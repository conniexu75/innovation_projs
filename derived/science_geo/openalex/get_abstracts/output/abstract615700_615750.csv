Understanding how such communities assemble and stabilize is important in a range of contexts, from biotechnological applications to what happens in our guts. Goldford et al. sampled the microbial communities from soil and plants containing hundreds to thousands of sequence variants. The organisms were passaged after culture in low concentrations of single carbon sources and were cross-fed with each other's metabolites; then, the resulting communities were sequenced using 16S ribosomal RNA, and the outcomes were modeled mathematically. The mix of species that survived under steady conditions converged reproducibly to reflect the experimentally imposed conditions rather than the mix of species initially inoculated—although at coarse phylogenetic levels, taxonomic patterns persisted.

Gut et al. present a high-throughput method that achieves the detection of more than 40 different proteins in biological samples across multiple spatial scales. This allows the simultaneous quantification of their expression levels in thousands of single cells; captures their detailed subcellular distribution to various compartments, organelles, and cellular structures within each of these single cells; and places all this information within a multicellular context. Such a scale-crossing dataset empowers artificial intelligence–based computer vision algorithms to achieve a comprehensive profiling of intracellular protein maps to measure their responses to different multicellular, cellular, and pharmacological contexts, and to reveal new cellular states.

Seep monkeyflower ( Mimulus guttatus ) populations are constrained by local moisture availability and the onset of summer drought. This results in a selective tradeoff between the amount of seed set, which is determined by plant size, and the timing of reproduction. Troth et al. sequenced and phenotyped 187 M. guttatus plants and identified genetic variants associated with plant and flower size and rapid flowering. In wild populations surveyed over 3 years, the magnitude of selection changed depending on the rainfall patterns. Thus, fluctuating selection may maintain genetic variation in this species.

https://openalex.org/W2885219921,"To realize human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based cardiac regenerative therapy, evidence of therapeutic advantages in human-sized diseased hearts are indispensable. In combination with an efficient and simultaneous differentiation of various cardiac lineages from hiPSCs and cell sheet technology, we aimed to generate clinical-sized large cardiac tissue sheets (L-CTSs) and to evaluate the therapeutic potential in porcine infarct heart. We simultaneously induced cardiomyocytes (CMs) and vascular cells [vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular mural cells (MCs)] from hiPSCs. We generated L-CTSs using 10cm-sized temperature-responsive culture dishes. We induced myocardial infarction (MI) in micromini-pigs (15–25 kg) and transplanted the L-CTSs (Tx) 2 weeks after MI induction (4 sheets/recipient) under immunosuppression (Tx: n = 5, Sham: n = 5). Self-pulsating L-CTSs were approximately 3.5cm in diameter with 6.8×106±0.8 of cells containing cTnT+-CMs (45.6±13.2%), VE-cadherin+-ECs (5.3±4.4%) and PDGFRβ+-MCs (14.4±20.7%), respectively (n = 5). In Tx group, echocardiogram indicated a significantly higher systolic function of the left ventricle (LV) compared to that in sham control (Sham vs Tx: fractional shortening: 24.2±8.6 vs 40.5±9.7%; p<0.05). Ejection fraction evaluated by left ventriculogram was significantly higher in Tx group (25.3±6.2% vs 39.8±4.2%; p<0.01). Speckle tracking echocardiogram showed a significant increase of circumference strain in infarct and border regions after transplantation. Fibrotic area was significantly lower in Tx group (23.8±4.5 vs 15.9±3.8%; P<0.001). Capillary density in the border region was significantly higher in Tx group (75.9±42.6/mm2 vs 137.4±44.8/mm2, p<0.001). These data indicate that the L-CTS transplantation attenuated LV remodeling. L-CTSs potentially restore cardiac dysfunction of human-sized infarct heart."

There is a remarkable decrease in muscle mass and muscle strength and an increase in intramuscular fat in the quadriceps of both limbs of non-ambulatory compared with ambulatory survivors. Therefore, given that paretic lower extremity function does not recover sufficiently in the chronic phase, it may be helpful to improve muscle mass and intramuscular fat to increase muscle strength in the quadriceps of non-ambulatory chronic stroke survivors. However, these relationships remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationships between muscle strength, muscle mass, and intramuscular fat of the quadriceps in non-ambulatory chronic stroke survivors.Study design: A cross-sectional study. Participants: Fifty non-ambulatory chronic stroke survivors. Main outcome measures: Quadriceps muscle strength was measured using a handheld dynamometer. Transverse ultrasound images were acquired using B-mode ultrasound imaging. Muscle mass and intramuscular fat of the quadriceps were assessed based on muscle thickness and echo intensity, respectively. Data analysis: Stepwise multiple regression analyses were used to identify the factors independently associated with the quadriceps muscle strength of the paretic and non-paretic limbs. To avoid multicollinearity, muscle thickness and echo intensity were entered into separate multiple regression models. Muscle thickness or echo intensity of the paretic or non-paretic limbs and other confounding factors were set as the independent variables.Muscle thickness was positively related and echo intensity was negatively related to the quadriceps muscle strength of the paretic and non-paretic limbs.Muscle mass and intramuscular fat of the quadriceps are related to muscle strength in non-ambulatory chronic stroke survivors. Increasing muscle mass and decreasing intramuscular fat of the quadriceps of both limbs may improve muscle strength."

However, it remains unclear whether other MST–MOB complexes are also involved in regulating Hippo–YAP signaling and have potential roles in PC. Here, we report that mammalian STE20-like kinase 4 (MST4), a distantly related ortholog of the MST1 kinase, forms a complex with MOB4 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. We found that the overall structure of the MST4–MOB4 complex resembles that of the MST1–MOB1 complex, even though the two complexes exhibited opposite biological functions in PC. In contrast to the tumor-suppressor effect of the MST1–MOB1 complex, the MST4–MOB4 complex promoted growth and migration of PANC-1 cells. Moreover, expression levels of MST4 and MOB4 were elevated in PC and were positively correlated with each other, whereas MST1 expression was down-regulated. Because of divergent evolution of key interface residues, MST4 and MOB4 could disrupt assembly of the MST1–MOB1 complex through alternative pairing and thereby increased YAP activity. Collectively, these findings identify the MST4–MOB4 complex as a noncanonical regulator of the Hippo–YAP pathway with an oncogenic role in PC. Our findings highlight that although MST–MOB complexes display some structural conservation, they functionally diverged during their evolution.

https://openalex.org/W2885658721,"The vast majority of scientific articles published to-date have not been accompanied by concomitant publication of the underlying research data upon which they are based. This state of affairs precludes the routine re-use and re-analysis of research data, undermining the efficiency of the scientific enterprise, and compromising the credibility of claims that cannot be independently verified. It may be especially important to make data available for the most influential studies that have provided a foundation for subsequent research and theory development. Therefore, we launched an initiative—the Data Ark—to examine whether we could retrospectively enhance the preservation and accessibility of important scientific data. Here we report the outcome of our efforts to retrieve, preserve, and liberate data from 111 of the most highly-cited articles published in psychology and psychiatry between 2006–2011 (n = 48) and 2014–2016 (n = 63). Most data sets were not made available (76/111, 68%, 95% CI [60, 77]), some were only made available with restrictions (20/111, 18%, 95% CI [10, 27]), and few were made available in a completely unrestricted form (15/111, 14%, 95% CI [5, 22]). Where extant data sharing systems were in place, they usually (17/22, 77%, 95% CI [54, 91]) did not allow unrestricted access. Authors reported several barriers to data sharing, including issues related to data ownership and ethical concerns. The Data Ark initiative could help preserve and liberate important scientific data, surface barriers to data sharing, and advance community discussions on data stewardship."
https://openalex.org/W2885487320,"Dye-decolorizing peroxidases (DyPs) represent the most recently classified hydrogen peroxide-dependent heme peroxidase family. Although widely distributed with more than 5000 annotated genes and hailed for their biotechnological potential, detailed biochemical characterization of their reaction mechanism remains limited. Here, we present the high-resolution crystal structures of WT B-class DyP from the pathogenic bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpDyP) (1.6 Å) and the variants D143A (1.3 Å), R232A (1.9 Å), and D143A/R232A (1.1 Å). We demonstrate the impact of elimination of the DyP-typical, distal residues Asp-143 and Arg-232 on (i) the spectral and redox properties, (ii) the kinetics of heterolytic cleavage of hydrogen peroxide, (iii) the formation of the low-spin cyanide complex, and (iv) the stability and reactivity of an oxoiron(IV)porphyrin π-cation radical (Compound I). Structural and functional studies reveal that the distal aspartate is responsible for deprotonation of H2O2 and for the poor oxidation capacity of Compound I. Elimination of the distal arginine promotes a collapse of the distal heme cavity, including blocking of one access channel and a conformational change of the catalytic aspartate. We also provide evidence of formation of an oxoiron(IV)-type Compound II in KpDyP with absorbance maxima at 418, 527, and 553 nm. In summary, a reaction mechanism of the peroxidase cycle of B-class DyPs is proposed. Our observations challenge the idea that peroxidase activity toward conventional aromatic substrates is related to the physiological roles of B-class DyPs."

https://openalex.org/W2886779814,"The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a primary vector of several serious arboviruses throughout the world and is therefore of great concern to many public health organizations. With vector control methodology pivoting towards rearing and releasing large numbers of genetically modified, sterilized, or Wolbachia-infected male mosquitoes to control vector populations, economical surveillance methods for release tracking becomes increasingly necessary. Previous work has identified that male Ae. aegypti are attracted to female wingbeat frequencies and can be captured through artificial playback of these frequencies, but the tested systems are cost-prohibitive for wide-scale monitoring. Thus, we have developed a simple, low-cost, battery-powered, microcontroller-based sound lure which mimics the wingbeat frequency of female Ae. aegypti, thereby attracting males. We then tested the efficacy of this lure in combination with a passive (non-powered) gravid Aedes trap (GAT) against the current gold-standard, the Biogents Sentinel (BGS) trap, which requires main power (household power) and costs several times what the GAT does. Capture rates of male Ae. aegypti in sound-baited GATs (Sound-GATs) in these field tests were comparable to that of the BGS with no inhibitory effects of sound playback on female capture. We conclude that the Sound-GAT is an effective replacement of the costly BGS for surveillance of male Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, particularly in the developing countries where funding is limited, and has the potential to be adapted to target males of other medically important species."
https://openalex.org/W4255785389,"Demands on visuospatial working memory are a ubiquitous part of everyday life. As such, significant efforts have been made to understand how the brain responds to these demands in real-world environments. Multiple brain imaging studies have highlighted a fronto-parietal cortical network that underlies visuospatial working memory, is modulated by cognitive load, and that appears to respond uniquely to encoding versus retrieval components. Furthermore, multiple studies have identified functional connectivity in regions of the fronto-parietal network during working memory tasks. Together, these findings have helped outline important aspects of the neural architecture that underlies visuospatial working memory. Here, we provide results from the first fNIRS-based investigation of fronto-parietal signatures of cortical activation and functional connectivity during a computer-based visuospatial working memory task. Our results indicate that the local maxima of cortical activation and functional coherence do not necessarily overlap spatially, and that cortical activation is significantly more susceptible to task-specific demands compared to functional connectivity. These results highlight important and novel information regarding neurotypical signatures of cortical activation and functional connectivity during visuospatial working memory. Our findings also demonstrate the utility of fNIRS for interrogating these cognitive processes."

Leadership research has rarely used computational modeling or neuroimaging techniques to examine mechanistic or neurobiological underpinnings of leadership choices. Edelson et al. found empirically and theoretically that the choice to lead rests on a metacognitive process (see the Perspective by Fleming and Bang). Individuals who showed less “responsibility aversion” had higher leadership scores. A computational model combining signal detection theory with prospect theory provided a mechanistic understanding of this preference. Neuroimaging experiments showed how the key theoretical concepts are encoded in the activity and connectivity of a brain network that comprises the medial prefrontal cortex, the superior temporal gyrus, the temporal parietal junction, and the anterior insula.

https://openalex.org/W2886035010,"Although aptamer-functionalized AuNPs technology exhibits great potential in analytical and biological chemistry, direct analysis of molecules at a low concentration using colorimetric assay remains challenging. The development of intuitive methods has attracted interest for promising detection of melamine in milk samples due to a demand for stable and understandable process. In this study, we propose a rapid and facile colorimetric measurement method of melamine combined aptamer-functionalized AuNPs in contaminated milk samples. To realize the high stability and the lower limit of detection, the aptamer-functionalized surface of AuNPs via a coordinated bond was used in combination with ultra-sonication. The kinetics of this colorimetric assay based on aptamer-functionalized AuNPs was analyzed to illustrate that the higher the concentration of melamine, the faster the aggregation of AuNPs induced. The sensitivity, selectivity, limit of detection and recovery rate were sufficiently validated to understand the measurement principle of melamine using aptamer-functionalized AuNPs. The calibration curve established by the absorption peak ratio (A640 /A520) was linear in the concentration range of 0~1μM of melamine in aqueous solutions with the correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.986 and the limit of detection (LOD) of 22 nM, whereas, the correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.998 and the LOD of 14.9 nM were achieved at the concentration of melamine below 0.5 μM in milk samples. The optimized performance of this colorimetric assay of melamine using aptamer-functionalized AuNPs in milk samples was obtained with 100 μL of 13 nm AuNPs solution, 40 μL of 1 μM (100 dilutions) aptamers and the pre-reaction time of 30 min. This simple colorimetric measurement of melamine using aptamer-functionalized AuNPs provides a promising target for various applications of the sample source with complex sample matrices."
https://openalex.org/W2886017105,"Reduced motivation is an important symptom of major depression, thought to impair recovery by reducing opportunities for rewarding experiences. We characterized motivation for monetary outcomes in depressed outpatients (N = 39, 22 female) and controls (N = 22, 11 female) in terms of their effectiveness in seeking rewards and avoiding losses. We assessed motivational function during learning of associations between stimuli and actions, as well as when learning was complete. We compared the activity within neural circuits underpinning these behaviors between depressed patients and controls.We used a Go/No-Go task that assessed subjects' abilities in learning to emit or withhold actions to obtain monetary rewards or avoid losses. We derived motivation-relevant parameters of behavior (learning rate, Pavlovian bias, and motivational influence of gains and losses). After learning, participants performed the task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We compared neural activation during anticipation of action emission vs. action inhibition, and for actions performed to obtain rewards compared to actions that avoid losses.Depressed patients showed a similar Pavlovian bias to controls and were equivalent in terms of withholding action to gain rewards and emitting action to avoid losses, behaviors that conflict with well-described Pavlovian tendencies to approach rewards and avoid losses. Patients were not impaired in overall performance or learning and showed no abnormal neural responses, for example in bilateral midbrain or striatum. We conclude that basic mechanisms subserving motivated learning are thus intact in moderate depression.Therapeutically, the intact mechanisms identified here suggest that learning-based interventions may be particularly effective in encouraging recovery. Etiologically, our results suggest that the severe motivational deficits clinically observed in depression are likely to have complex origins, possibly related to an impairment in the representation of future states necessary for long-term planning."
https://openalex.org/W2885638173,"In eukaryotic cells, elimination of misfolded proteins is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and cell viability. Misfolding-associated protein secretion (MAPS) is a protein quality-control mechanism that exports misfolded cytosolic proteins via a compartment characteristic of late endosomes, but how cytosolic proteins enter this compartment is unclear. Because chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a known mechanism that imports cytosolic proteins bearing a specific CMA motif to lysosomes for degradation and because late endosomes and lysosomes overlap significantly in mammalian cells, we determined here whether CMA is involved in targeting protein cargoes to the lumen of late endosomes in MAPS. Using HEK293T and COS-7 cells and immunoblotting and -staining and coimmunoprecipitation methods, we show that, unlike CMA, the secretion of misfolded proteins in MAPS does not require cargo unfolding, is inhibited by serum starvation, and is not dependent on the CMA motif in cargo. Intriguingly, knockdown of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2), which consists of three isoforms, including a variant proposed to form a protein channel on lysosomes for CMA, attenuated MAPS. However, this could not be attributed to the proposed channel function of the LAMP2a isoform because overexpression of a cytosolic MAPS stimulator, DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C5 (DNAJC5), fully rescued the secretion defect associated with LAMP2 deficiency.

https://openalex.org/W2886774059,"Background The Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for children (CERQ-k) is a useful clinical and research tool to identify cognitive patterns of emotion regulation that predict the presence of emotional symptomatology. This study aimed to validate the Spanish version of the CERQ-k (the CERQ-Sk) using a sample of children from Spain, which is not available. Methods The sample consisted of 582 children (48.6% girls) aged between 7 and 12 years (Mage = 9.49; SD = 1.2) recruited from Alicante, Spain. Cognitive emotion regulation strategies, anxiety and depressive symptomatology were self-reported evaluated. Factor structure, internal consistency, temporal stability with the Spanish version for children were examined. Convergent validity was evaluated using Spearman correlations to examine the relationships between the CERQ-k and measures of anxiety (trait anxiety subscale of STAI-C) and depression (CDI). Results The Spanish version of CERQ-Sk had the same nine factors proposed in the original version. Ordinal alpha of the total scale was excellent (.88), and moderate indexes were found for each subscale (.56 to .75). The 8-week test-retest coefficient was adequate for the total scale (ICC = .74) and moderate for the subscales (.54 to .70). Evidence of convergent validity was provided through correlations with the CDI (depression) and trait anxiety subscale of the STAI-C (anxiety). Cognitive strategies such as Rumination, self-blame, catastrophizing, and other-blame were significantly and positively related to depressive and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, positive refocusing and planning seemed to act as strategies that have a positive effect on the prevention of depression in children. Conclusions Results suggest that the CERQ-Sk is a reliable and valid tool that can be useful for researchers and clinicians to identify maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation patterns that may increase the risk of emotional problems, and orient treatment and prevention of mental health problems in children from Spanish-speaking countries."
https://openalex.org/W2887938337,"Filoviruses are notorious viral pathogens responsible for high-consequence diseases in humans and non-human primates. Transcription of filovirus mRNA shares several common features with transcription in other non-segmented negative-strand viruses, including differential expression of genes located across the viral genome. Transcriptional patterns of Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) have been previously described using traditional, laborious methods, such as northern blots and in vivo labeling of viral mRNAs. More recently, however, the availability of the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has offered a more straightforward approach to assess transcriptional patterns. In this report, we analyzed the transcription patterns of four ebolaviruses—EBOV, Sudan (SUDV), Bundibugyo (BDBV), and Reston (RESTV) viruses—in two different cell lines using standard NGS library preparation and sequencing protocols. In agreement with previous reports mainly focused on EBOV and MARV, the remaining filoviruses used in this study also showed a consistent transcription pattern, with only minor variations between the different viruses. We have also analyzed the proportions of the three mRNAs transcribed from the GP gene, which are characteristic of the genus Ebolavirus and encode the glycoprotein (GP), the soluble GP (sGP), and the small soluble GP (ssGP). In addition, we used NGS methodology to analyze the transcription pattern of two previously described recombinant MARV. This analysis allowed us to correct our construction design, and to make an improved version of the original MARV expressing reporter genes."
https://openalex.org/W2885167462,"Leishmania parasites cause a set of neglected tropical diseases with considerable public health impact, the leishmaniases, which are often fatal if left untreated. Since current treatments for the leishmaniases exhibit high toxicity, low efficacy and prohibitive prices, many laboratories throughout the world are engaged in research for the discovery of novel chemotherapeutics. This entails the necessity of screening large numbers of compounds against the clinically relevant form of the parasite, the obligatory intracellular amastigote, a procedure that in many laboratories is still carried out by manual inspection. To overcome this well-known bottleneck in Leishmania drug development, several studies have recently attempted to automate this process. Here we implemented an image-based high content triage assay for Leishmania which has the added advantages of using primary macrophages instead of macrophage cell lines and of enabling identification of active compounds against parasite species developing both in small individual phagolysosomes (such as L. infantum) and in large communal vacuoles (such as L. amazonensis). The automated image analysis protocol is made available for IN Cell Analyzer systems, and, importantly, also for the open-source CellProfiler software, in this way extending its implementation to any laboratory involved in drug development as well as in other aspects of Leishmania research requiring analysis of in vitro infected macrophages."

Outer membrane porins play a significant role in Acinetobacter antibiotic resistance and virulence. A. baumannii carbapenem resistance and virulence factor porin Omp33-36 was the subject of this study. We investigated the omp33-36 gene transcriptional response in the growth phase, its response to carbapenems, and the effect of contact with host cells. Additionally, the cytotoxic effect of A. baumannii towards keratinocytes was assessed, as well as correlation between omp33-36 gene transcription and cytotoxicity. Further, Acinetobacter spp. Omp33-36 was classified and its characteristics relevant for vaccine candidature were determined. The level of the omp33-36 gene transcription varied between growth phases, but a common pattern could not be established among different strains. Treatment with subinhibitory concentrations of carbapenems decreased, while contact with keratinocytes increased omp33-36 expression in the analysed A. baumannii strains. Variations in omp33-36 mRNA levels did not correlate with cytotoxicity levels. Decrease of omp33-36 mRNA during treatment with subinhibitory concentrations of carbapenems, indicated the importance of transcriptional changes in reversible resistance to carbapenems due to the absence of Omp33-36. The transcription of omp33-36 increased after contact with keratinocytes, indicating the important role of de novo transcription during the initial phase of A. baumannii infection. Primary structural analysis of Acinetobacter spp. Omp33-36 revealed three distinct groups (among four A. baumannii variants). Although we have shown that Omp33-36 was highly polymorphic, we propose a potential antigen (PLAEAAFL motif) for vaccine development. According to PROVEAN analysis, the highly polymorphic structure of Omp33-36 porin should not influence its function significantly."
https://openalex.org/W2887598676,"Despite the advance of knowledge about the factors and potential mechanisms triggering the ichthyotoxicity in microalgae, these remain unclear or are controversial for several species (e.g. Heterosigma). Neither typical toxicity tests carried out with cell extracts nor direct exposure to harmful species were proved suitable to unravel the mechanism of harm. Ichthyotoxic species show a complex harmful effect on fish, which is mediated through various mechanisms depending on the species. In this work, we present a method to study sub-lethal effects triggered by reactive oxygen species of a population of harmful algae in vivo over a fish cell line. To that end, Transwell co-cultures in which causative and target species are separated by a 0.4 μm pore membrane were carried out. This allowed the evaluation of the effect of the released molecules by cells in a rapid and compact test. In our method, the harmful effect was sensed through the transcriptional activation of sub-lethal marker Hsp70b in the CHSE214 salmon cell line. The method was tested with the raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo and Dunaliella tertiolecta (as negative control). It was shown that superoxide intracellular content and its release are not linked in these species. The methodology allowed proving that reactive oxygen species produced by H. akashiwo are able to induce the transcriptional activation of sub-lethal marker Hsp70b. However, neither loss of viability nor apoptosis was observed in CHSE214 salmon cell line except when exposed to direct contact with the raphidophyte cells (or their extract). Consequently, ROS was not concluded to be the main cause of ichthyotoxicity in H. akashiwo."

The short-form of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for children (PANAS-C-SF) and the Child and Adolescent Social Adaptive Functioning Scale (CASAFS) were used. Student's t tests indicated that those reporting high levels on all the social functioning dimensions also reported significantly higher levels of PA than peers who reported low levels; by contrast, students reporting high levels of social functioning reported significantly lower levels of NA than peers who reported low levels. Similarly, logistic regression analyses showed that an increase in PA increased probability of high levels of social functioning, and that an increase in NA decreased the probability of presenting high levels of social functioning dimensions, with the exception of school performance. These results expand the PA and NA relationship with social functioning reported in adults to Spanish children, which is potentially of interest in the fields of Education and Psychology."

During the last decade, vector control activities have been systematically carried out in northwestern Argentina, an endemic region for this disease. The general aim of this study to evaluate was spatio-temporal variation of infestation by T. infestans in rural communities of Los Llanos in La Rioja province. We estimated house infestation using two sampling methods: passive and active. Passive collection was conducted with community participation collecting triatomines. Six passive collections were carried out in 397 houses during the warm season between 2014 and 2017. Active collection of T. infestans was thoroughly performed by trained staff for 60 minutes and was carried out once in March 2016. The estimate of intradomestic infestation did not show significant differences between both collection methods (p = 0.39). However, passive collection method had lower sensitivity than active collection method for the estimation of peridomestic infestation and intradomestic colonization (PDI: p< 0.01; ID colonization: p< 0.01). The results obtained with passive collection methods showed that the infestation in the study area was spatially heterogeneous and temporally variable. Intradomiciliary infestation decreased over time (14.4% to 7.9%, p<0.05) although the effect of the chemical treatment application was not associated with the infestation level of T. infestans (p = 0.15) and the Departments had a different response each year (p<0.01). A high infestation cluster was located in the south of our study area during 2016–2017. The vector presence in the houses confirms the importance of to improve entomological surveillance programs. The search for triatomines carried out by the inhabitants might be a useful method to complement the activities of vector control programs in isolated and rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W2887202462,"Data from both the laboratory and clinic in the last decade indicate that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are widely regarded as potential sources of future antibiotics owing to their broad-spectrum activities, rapid killing, potentially low-resistance rate and multidirectional mechanisms of action compared to conventional antibiotics. Defensins, a prominent family of AMPs, have been found in a wide range of organisms including plants. Thailand is a rich source of plants including medicinal plants used therapeutically, however there is no report of defensin from among these plants. In this study, a novel plant defensin gene, BcDef, was successfully cloned from Brugmansia x candida (Bc). BcDef cDNA was 237 bp in length, encoding 78 amino acids with a putative 31-amino acid residue signal peptide at the N-terminal followed by the mature sequence. BcDef shared high sequence identity (78-85%) with Solanaceae defensins and belonged to the class I plant defensins. From homology modeling, BcDef shared a conserved triple stranded β-sheet (β1-β3) and one α-helix (α1) connected by a loop (L1-L3). BcDef1 peptide, designed from the γ-core motifs of BcDef located in loop 3, showed antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens with the lowest MIC (15.70 μM) against Staphylococcus epidermidis. This peptide affected cell membrane potential and permeability, and caused cell membrane disruption. Moreover, BcDef1 also exhibited antioxidant activity and showed low cytotoxicity against mouse fibroblast L929 cells. These findings may provide an opportunity for developing a promising antibacterial agent for medical application in the future."

At baseline and five-year follow-up, socio-demographic and health-related data including behaviors, chronic conditions, and medication use were collected by questionnaire. Estradiol and testosterone were assayed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and sex hormone-binding globulin by immunochemiluminescent assay. Fat mass was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.Community-dwelling men aged 35 years and older at enrollment, resident in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide without established disease of, or medications affecting, the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis (n = 725).The dependence of change in serum estradiol over five years on age, testosterone and fat mass after adjustment for multiple confounders.At baseline, mean age was 53.0 ± 10.8 years. Mean serum estradiol levels at baseline and five-year follow-up were 94.9 ± 34.8 and 89.4 ± 30.4 pmol/L respectively (-1.1 pmol/L/year). On multivariable analyses, estradiol change was associated with changes in testosterone (B-estimate = 2.719, standard error = 0.369, p˂0.001), but not age or total fat mass. Change in testosterone/estradiol ratio was inversely associated with change in fat mass (B = -1.450, SE = 0.575, p = 0.012), and this was consistent across quartiles of fat mass change.In healthy men, circulating estradiol is primarily dependent on testosterone. With increasing fat mass, estradiol decreases less than testosterone. From a clinical standpoint these data indicate that obesity is associated with a change in the testosterone to estradiol ratio, but a change in estradiol does not occur unless some other pathology is present."

Obesity-related genes, such as FTO, are associated with energy traits. No genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted to detect the genetic associations with energy-related traits, including energy intake and energy expenditure, among European-ancestry populations. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide study using pooled GWAS including 12,030 European-ancestry women and 6,743 European-ancestry men to identify genetic variants associated with these two energy traits. We observed a statistically significant genome-wide SNP heritability for energy intake of 6.05% (95%CI = (1.76, 10.34), P = 0.006); the SNP heritability for expenditure was not statistically significantly greater than zero. We discovered three SNPs on chromosome 12q13 near gene ANKRD33 that were genome-wide significantly associated with increased total energy intake among all men. We also identified signals on region 2q22 that were associated with energy expenditure among lean people. Body mass index related SNPs were found to be significantly associated with energy intake and expenditure through SNP set analyses. Larger GWAS studies of total energy traits are warranted to explore the genetic basis of energy intake, including possible differences between men and women, and the association between total energy intake and other downstream phenotypes, such as diabetes and chronic diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2885746948,"Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play pivotal roles in hepatic fibrosis as they synthesize glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is increased in activated HSCs. GFAP-expressing HSCs and myofibroblasts accumulate in and around hepatic fibrosis lesions. Peptidylarginine deiminase 2 (PAD2) is responsible for the citrullination of GFAP (cit-GFAP). However, the involvement of PAD2 and cit-GFAP in hepatic fibrosis remains unclear. To determine the expression of PAD2 and cit-GFAP in hepatic fibrosis, C57BL/6 mice underwent bile duct ligation (BDL) or a sham operation. In BDL livers, the expression of PAD2 and its enzyme activity were significantly increased compared with controls. In addition, PAD2-postitive cells were rarely observed in only the portal vein and the small bile duct in sham-operated livers, whereas an increased number of PAD2-positive cells were detected in the bile duct and Glisson's sheath in BDL livers. Interestingly, PAD2 was colocalized with α-SMA-positive cells and CK19-positive cells in BDL livers, indicating upregulated PAD2 in activated HSCs and portal fibroblasts of the livers of BDL mice. We also found that citrullinated proteins were highly accumulated in the livers of BDL mice compared with controls. Moreover, the expression level of GFAP and the amount of cit-GFAP were higher in BDL livers than in control livers. In correlation with PAD2 localization, cit-GFAP was observed in α-SMA-positive and CK19-positive cells in the livers of BDL mice. These results suggest that the increased expression and activation of PAD2 along with increased citrullinated proteins, specifically cit-GFAP, may play important roles in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2887564620,"HIV-associated pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of severe respiratory illness in sub-Saharan Africa. Outcomes of HIV-infected patients with PCP, especially those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, have not been adequately studied in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical phenotype and outcomes of HIV-associated PCP in a group of hospitalized South African patients, and to identify predictors of mortality. We conducted a retrospective record review at an academic referral center in Cape Town. HIV-infected patients over the age of 18 years with definite (any positive laboratory test) or probable PCP (defined according to the WHO/CDC clinical case definition) were included. The primary outcome measure was 90-day mortality. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to identify factors associated with mortality. We screened 562 test requests between 1 May 2004 and 31 April 2015; 124 PCP cases (68 confirmed and 56 probable) were included in the analysis. Median age was 34 years (interquartile range, IQR, 29 to 41), 89 (72%) were female, and median CD4 cell count was 26 cells/mm3 (IQR 12 to 70). Patients admitted to the ICU (n = 42) had more severe impairment of gas exchange (median ratio of arterial to inspired oxygen (PaO2:FiO2) 158 mmHg vs. 243 mmHg, p < 0.0001), and increased markers of systemic inflammation compared to those admitted to the ward (n = 82). Twenty-nine (23.6%) patients were newly-diagnosed with tuberculosis during their admission. Twenty-six (61.9%) patients admitted to ICU and 21 (25.9%) admitted to the ward had died at 90-days post-admission. Significant predictors of 90-day mortality included PaO2:FiO2 ratio (aOR 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 12.9 for every 50 mgHg decrease), serum LDH (aOR 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.1 for every 500 U/L increase), and concomitant antituberculosis therapy (aOR 82; 95% CI, 1.9 to 3525.4; P = 0.021). PaO2:FiO2 < 100 mmHg was significantly associated with inpatient death (aHR 3.8; 95% CI, 1.6 to 8.9; P = 0.003). HIV-associated PCP was associated with a severe clinical phenotype and high rates of tuberculosis co-infection. Mortality was high, particularly in patients admitted to the ICU, but was comparable to other settings. Prognostic indictors could be used to inform ICU admission policy for patients with this condition."

In total, 4,322 stroke survivors who participated in the 2013 Korean Community Health Survey were included in the final analysis. Sociodemographic information, socio-family relationships, health behaviors, health status, and suicidal ideation were assessed using a standardized questionnaire. On fully adjusted analysis, suicidal ideation among males was more common in those who were widowed, rather than married (odds ratio [OR] 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–2.47), those who rarely contacted neighbors (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.10–2.06), current smokers (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.03–2.29), and frequent drinkers (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.05–2.24). Suicidal ideation among females was more common in older subjects, those with lower monthly household incomes, the unemployed (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.21–2.53), and housewives/students (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.06–2.03), those who rarely contacted friends (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12–1.82), and diabetics (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.05–1.73). Perceived persistent high-level stress, depressive mood, poor self-rated health, and a diagnosis of depression were commonly associated with suicidal ideation in both genders. Gender differences should be considered by medical practitioners and community policymakers when seeking to prevent and manage suicidal ideation in stroke survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2887502537,"The increased nitrogen (N) use efficiency in cattle farming is proposed as a key action to improve N management and reduce the environmental impact of cattle farming systems. Most attention has been given to lactating cow nutrition, excluding the elements of fertility, disease, and the non-lactating animals within the herd. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop a herd-level simulation model incorporating these elements to assess dairy farm N use efficiency. We developed a cattle N use efficiency (CNE) model with six primary compartments: (i) heifer growth, (ii) heifer removal, (iii) pregnancy, (iv) cow removal, (v) disease and fertility, and (vi) milk production. The CNE model calculates N loss or gain for each compartment, and then calculates the lifetime N loss or gain taking into account the replacement rate (rep) and/or the corresponding number of lactations in a herd (Lact = 1/rep). Finally, three N use efficiencies were estimated: (i) ReplNE: replacement cattle N use efficiency, (ii) LactNE: lifetime N use efficiency for lactation, and (iii) LNE: lifetime N use efficiency. The sensitivity of the model to variation in farm- and animal-related input values was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. Values for a model dairy farm were used based on published data reflecting typical dairy farming practices in the United Kingdom. To assist reporting net values of main N outputs, a dairy herd of 100 lactating cows was modelled. Productive N outputs (1000s of kg) over the course of an animal’s lifetime, partitioned into milk and meat, were dominated by milk production (89% of total N output). We estimated a mean ReplNE of 23.7%, affected most by the last stage of heifer growth. The Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis suggested that variation in time to first calving (T1stCal) might cause larger changes on ReplNE than variation in feed. The sensitivity analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between dietary oriented milk N use efficiency (MNE) and LactNE and LNE (r = 0.99 and 0.97 for LactNE and LNE, respectively). However, our study highlighted two other model variables that affected LNE. Variation in calving interval (CI; r = −0.15) and T1stCal (r = −0.15) may cause measurable reductions of overall LNE. The first is an indicator of lactating cattle fertility, and the second an indicator of replacement cattle growth and fertility efficiency. In conclusion, with the current study we provided a dairy cattle herd model that is sensitive in elements of diet, fertility and health. Lifetime N use efficiency of dairy cattle is dominated by MNE, but we detected specific non-diet related variables that affect ReplNE, LactNE and LNE."

However, there is lack of information regarding which exactly age group of under-five is more vulnerable to morbidity when their mothers exposed to intimate partner violence victimization. This study aimed to determine the effect of mothers’ exposure to intimate partner violence victimization on age groups specific under-five morbidity that could lead to mortality. Material and methods The current study pooled and analyzed data from 2010 and 2016 Tanzania Demographic Health Survey datasets. We used a stratified multilevel modeling to assess the association between under-five morbidity and intimate partner violence victimization according to age groups. The Statistical approach using Stata 14 was used to adjust for clustering effect and weighted the estimates to correct for non-responses and disproportionate sampling employed during designing of the surveys. Results A total of 13,639 singleton live-births babies within three years prior to interview dates from the ever-married women were included in the analysis. We found a significant reduction of the three main symptoms of under-five morbidity namely; a cough with difficult or fast breathing from 21.7 to 15.7%, fever from 22.5 to 18.3%, and diarrhoea from 15.5 to 12.7% for the survey years from 2010 to 2016 respectively (P<0.05). Overall, about 40% of mothers reported experiencing any forms of intimate partner violence victimization. After adjusting for individual and cluster variables, we found that under-five in post-neonatal period (Adjusted odds ratios = 1.50; 95%CI, 1.21–1.86) and childhood period (Adjusted odds ratios = 1.40; 95%CI, 1.24–1.57) were significantly affected with morbidity when their mothers’ exposed to any form of intimate partner violence victimization. Conclusion This analysis revealed that intimate partner violence victimization is still a major and public health problem in Tanzania that threatens child health during the period of post-neonatal and childhood. There is a need to introduce screening for intimate partner violence victimization in maternal and child care for effective monitoring and prevention of the problem."

The aim of this study was to determine anticipatory stress in eight Standardbred stallions participating in harness race. Cortisol and HRV responses to a mild exercise performed in training circumstances were compared to a maximal effort exercise performed in real trotting race conditions. Parameters of HRV reflecting vagal (root mean square of the successive differences, RMSSD) and sympathetic nervous system activity (ratio of the low and high frequency component, LF/HF) were recorded before warming up (baseline) and during exercise. Plasma cortisol concentrations were obtained for the following stages of the exercise: before warming up (baseline), after warming up, after the exercise has finished and after a 30-min recovery. Baseline LF/HF ratio was higher before the race compared to the pre-training values (12.0 ± 6.6 vs. 5.9 ± 4.5, P = 0.009), while RMSSD did not show such difference (34.8 ± 15.9 ms vs. 48.0 ± 30.5 ms, P = 0.96). Cortisol level was higher in the case of race for all samples compared to training (P = 0.012). There were no significant differences between plasma cortisol levels obtained for the subsequent stages of race. Horses in the present study showed anticipatory response before race as shown by differences in pre-training (97.3 ± 16.4 nmol/L) and pre-race cortisol levels (171.8 ± 18.7 nmol/L), respectively (P < 0.001).

The teff-based diet improved glucose tolerance compared with the wheat group with normal chow but not with a high-fat diet. Reduced adipose inflammation characterized by lower expression of TNFα, Mcp1, and CD11c, together with higher levels of cecal short chain fatty acids such as acetate, compared with the control diet containing wheat after 14 weeks of dietary treatment. In addition, beige adipocyte formation, characterized by increased expression of Ucp-1 (~7-fold) and Cidea (~3-fold), was observed in the teff groups compared with the wheat group. Moreover, a body-weight matched experiment revealed that teff improved glucose tolerance in a manner independent of body weight reduction after 6 weeks of dietary treatment. Enhanced beige adipocyte formation without improved adipose inflammation in a body-weight matched experiment suggests that the improved glucose metabolism was a consequence of beige adipocyte formation, but not solely through adipose inflammation. However, these differences between teff- and wheat-containing diets were not observed in the high-fat diet group.Teff improved glucose tolerance likely by promoting beige adipocyte formation and improved adipose inflammation."

Wnt signaling pathways have multiple roles in the regulation of cartilage development, growth, and maintenance. This study focused on the role of sclerostin in the process of chondrogenic differentiation. We hypothesized that sclerostin is essential to induce chondrogenic differentiation and regulate endochondral ossification. ATDC5 cells were used to investigate chondrogenic differentiation and terminal calcification. During chondrogenic differentiation, intrinsic sclerostin was upregulated in the early stage, but downregulated in the late stage. Addition of sclerostin elevated expressions of Sox9 and Col2a1 (P<0.05) and reduced expressions of Runx2, Col10a1, MMP-3, MMP-13, and ADAMTS5 (P<0.05) through inhibition of the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway (P<0.05). Terminal calcification was significantly inhibited by sclerostin (P<0.05). In contrast, deletion of sclerostin decreased expressions of Sox9 and Col2a1 (P<0.05), increased expressions of Runx2, Col10a1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 (P<0.05), and promoted terminal calcification (P<0.05). This study provides insights into the possible role of sclerostin in the regulation of chondrogenic differentiation. Sclerostin is upregulated in the early stage of chondrogenic differentiation, but is not required in endochondral ossification. Sclerostin is a candidate modulator for chondrogenic differentiation."

This potential is highly contextual, depending on composition and spatial configuration of matrix elements and their mechanistic relationship with biological communities. We investigate the effects of local vegetation structure, and proximity to a PA on the site-use of different guilds in a wintering bird community within the PA, and in wooded land-use types in the surrounding matrix. We used occupancy models to estimate covariate-guild relationships and predict site-use. We also compared species richness (estimated through capture-recapture models) and species naïve site-use between the PA and the matrix to evaluate taxonomic changes. We found that tree cover did not limit the site-use of most guilds of the community, probably due to high canopy cover across all chosen sites. Exceptions to this were guilds comprising generalist species. Shrub cover and bamboo cover had important effects on some woodland-associated guilds, suggesting a change in limiting factors for site-use under adequate tree cover. Site-use across the matrix was high for all analyzed guilds. This was found to be due to three non-exclusive reasons: (i) presence of one or more ubiquitous species (found all across the landscape) within some guilds, (ii) redundancy of species within guilds that buffered against a decrease in site-use, and (iii) turnover in guild composition/abundances to more generalist species from PA to matrix. Estimated species richness was higher in the matrix (107± 11; mean ± SE) than in the PA (90± 7), which may have been in part due to the addition of generalist species in the matrix. Understanding factors that limit biological communities is crucial to better managing the ever-increasing matrix for biodiversity conservation. Our study provides insights into the effects of different components of vegetation structure on the bird community in wooded land-use types in the matrix. We highlight the value of woodlands surrounding PAs in maintaining multiple guilds, and hence, the functionality of a wintering bird community. However, we caution that the matrix may fall short in retaining some specialized species of the community."

https://openalex.org/W2887176155,"Sliding clamps on DNA consist of evolutionarily conserved enzymes that coordinate DNA replication, repair, and the cellular DNA damage response. MutS homolog (MSH) proteins initiate mismatch repair (MMR) by recognizing mispaired nucleotides and in the presence of ATP form stable sliding clamps that randomly diffuse along the DNA. The MSH sliding clamps subsequently load MutL homolog (MLH/PMS) proteins that form a second extremely stable sliding clamp, which together coordinate downstream MMR components with the excision-initiation site that may be hundreds to thousands of nucleotides distant from the mismatch. Specific or nonspecific binding of other proteins to the DNA between the mismatch and the distant excision-initiation site could conceivably obstruct the free diffusion of these MMR sliding clamps, inhibiting their ability to initiate repair. Here, we employed bulk biochemical analysis, single-molecule fluorescence imaging, and mathematical modeling to determine how sliding clamps might overcome such hindrances along the DNA. Using both bacterial and human MSH proteins, we found that increasing the number of MSH sliding clamps on a DNA decreased the association of the Escherichia coli transcriptional repressor LacI to its cognate promoter LacO. Our results suggest a simple mechanism whereby thermal diffusion of MSH sliding clamps along the DNA alters the association kinetics of other DNA-binding proteins over extended distances. These observations appear generally applicable to any stable sliding clamp that forms on DNA."

Fis overexpression reduced both ROS-tolerance and adherence to barley roots and activated the transcription of the nuoA-N operon encoding NADH dehydrogenase I, the first enzyme of a membrane-bound electron-transport chain. The nuoA-N knockout mutation in the fis-overexpression background increased the ROS-tolerance and adherence to barley roots. We show that nuoA has two transcriptional start sites located 104 and 377 nucleotides upstream of the coding sequence, indicating the presence of two promoters. The DNase I footprint analysis revealed four Fis binding sites: Fis-nuo1 to Fis-nuo4, situated between these two promoters. Site-directed mutagenesis in a promoter-lacZ reporter and β-galactosidase assay further confirmed direct binding of Fis to Fis-nuo2 and probably to Fis-nuo4 but not to Fis-nuo1 and Fis-nuo3. Additionally, the results implied that Fis binding to Fis-nuo4 could affect transcription of the nuoA-N operon by modification of upstream DNA topology. Moreover, our transposon mutagenesis results indicated that Fis might be involved in the regulation of several alternative ROS detoxification processes utilizing NADH."
https://openalex.org/W2886633835,"Studies in Caucasians have shown that values of hematological indices could be affected by a wide variety of factors. However, parallel work in other ethnical populations, particularly from the Asia-Pacific region, is lacking. Therefore, we designed this study to explore the association between clinical/laboratory parameters and hemogram levels. Adult individuals who came to our hospital for health exams were screened. Information on demographics and laboratory profiles was obtained. We analyzed the impacts of these parameters on the variation of hemogram. Overall, 26,497 adults were included in the current analysis after excluding those with abnormal hemogram. Multivariate regression analysis showed increasing age and male gender negatively affected the number of platelets, whereas a higher serum apolipoprotein B level was associated with an elevated platelet count. Gender and serum albumin level were the major determinants of variation in hemoglobin level. A modestly increased white cell count was seen in men as well as individuals with elevated apolipoprotein B levels, but it was inversely correlated with changes in age and serum albumin levels. Conversely, some variables, although statistically significantly associated with the hematological indices, only provided a trivial explanation for the heterogeneity observed. We further established predictive models for the approximate estimation of hematological indices in healthy adults. Our data indicate that age, gender, and serum levels of apolipoprotein B and albumin affect hematological indices in various ways. We also demonstrate that variation in hemogram could be successfully predicted by a number of clinical and laboratory parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2887595830,"Photophobia is a common condition in which bright light causes an unpleasant feeling due to increased sensitivity to light. In addition to discomfort, photophobia may be accompanied by visual dysfunction. The present study was conducted in order to examine whether visual evoked cortical responses contribute to the assessment of visual dysfunction due to bright light. Visual evoked magnetic fields (VEFs) following the presentation of a uniform bright light of 200-3700 cd/m2 in the lower visual field were recorded in 10 healthy volunteers and the effects of five color lenses: yellow, blue, gray, green, and colorless, were examined. VEFs were subjected to a multi-dipole analysis that resulted in the separation of several source activities, including the retina, V1, V2, V6, and fusiform gyrus. Source activity in the retina corresponding to the ERG b-wave exhibited a reduced amplitude and elongated peak latency with the yellow lens. Its latency strongly correlated with transmittance at 450 nm. On the other hand, cortical activities in V1 and the fusiform gyrus were stronger with the yellow lens than with the other color and colorless lenses. Only blue-light blocking showed significant effects. The result showing that the yellow lens enhanced V1 and fusiform activities indicated that processing in these areas was improved when subjects used this lens. The combination of delayed retinal activity and increased visual cortex activity may be an objective indicator of the effects of a color lens on visual function."

Our objective was to measure if a prediction model, developed to predict non-return to work (nRTW) after orthopaedic trauma, improves the allocation to various vocational pathways for use in clinical practice.Randomised-controlled trial on vocational inpatients after orthopaedic trauma (n = 280). In the intervention group, nRTW risk (estimated using the WORRK tool) was given to the clinician team before allocation of vocational pathways, while in the control group it was not. Three pathways were available: simple, coaching and evaluation (EP). Accompanying indications for interpretation of the nRTW risk were given. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients allocated to the EP. The secondary outcome was patients' and clinicians' satisfaction.450 patients were assessed for eligibility, 280 included, 139 randomized to the control group (mean age 42.3years) and 141 to the intervention group (43.2years). The two groups had a similar risk profile. The patients in the intervention group were more often referred to the EP compared to the control group, but not statistically significantly more (risk ratio 1.31 [95% CI 0.70-2.46]). The number needed to treat was 30. When considering patients transferred to different pathways during rehabilitation, more patients from the intervention group were transferred to the EP over the course of the rehabilitation, increasing the risk ratio to 1.57 [95% CI 0.89 to 2.74].The knowledge of the risk of nRTW has an influence, that is not however statistically significant and is without clinical importance as previously defined by our own power calculations (based on a 15% increase in referral to EP in the intervention group compared to the control group), on clinical decision making with regards to the allocation of patients to different physical and vocational rehabilitation programs after orthopaedic trauma. This influence is less than what was expected, possibly due to insufficient directive guidelines accompanying the WORRK model, or because clinicians associate less hours of therapy (as with certain rehabilitation programs) to disadvantaging the patient. These findings do, however, support the multi-factorial aspect of clinician decision-making."
