Flow can be experimentally visualized using, for example, smoke or contrast agents, but extracting velocity and pressure fields from this information is tricky. Raissi et al. developed a machine-learning approach to tackle this problem. Their method exploits the knowledge of Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the dynamics of fluid flow in many scientifically relevant situations. The authors illustrate their approach using examples such as blood flow in an aneurysm. Science , this issue p. 1026"

Delić et al. laser-cooled an optically trapped solid-state object (a ∼150-nanometer-diameter silic a nanoparticle) into its quantum ground state of motion starting from room temperature. Because the object is levitated using optical forces, the experimental configuration can be switched to free fall, thereby providing a test bed for several macroscopic quantum experiments.

https://openalex.org/W3004007615,"Spreading edema after stroke The brain is enveloped in a cushion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which normally provides protection and helps to remove metabolic waste. CSF transport has also recently been shown to play unexpected roles in neurodegeneration and sleep. Mestre et al. used multimodal in vivo imaging in rodents and found that, after a stroke, an abnormally large volume of CSF rushes into the brain, causing swelling (see the Perspective by Moss and Williams). This influx of CSF is caused by constrictions of arteries triggered by a well-known propagating chemical reaction-diffusion wave called spreading depolarization. CSF transport can thus play a role in brain swelling after stroke. Science , this issue p. eaax7171 ; see also p. 1195"

The protein complexes BAF and PBAF are mammalian SWI/SNF remodelers that play essential functions in diverse developmental and physiological processes. He et al. determined the structure of the human BAF complex, which contains three modules that bind the nucleosome on the top, bottom, and side, making this nucleosome-recognition pattern distinct from other chromatin remodelers. Mutations in BAF that are frequently associated with human cancer cluster into a nucleosome-interacting region. This structure provides a framework for understanding the BAF-mediated chromatin remodeling mechanism and its dysregulation in cancer. Science , this issue p. 875"
https://openalex.org/W3004009934,"ER regulates stress granule fission A hallmark of eukaryotic cells is the ability to compartmentalize essential reactions into membrane-bound and membraneless organelles. Membrane-bound organelles form networks through transport vesicles and interorganellar contact sites. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has emerged as a network hub and forms physical connections with nearly every membrane-bound organelle. Lee et al. now identify another class of ER contact sites that appear to help regulate the biogenesis and fission of membraneless ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules (see the Perspective by Kornmann and Weis). Live-cell fluorescence microscopy of human cells revealed that ER tubule dynamics are spatially and temporally coupled to the fission site of two types of RNP granules, processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules.

https://openalex.org/W3004317045,"Monosomes translate proteins in neurons Like all other cells, neurons use different proteins to process information and respond to stimuli. To meet the huge demands for new proteins in their large and complex cell volume, neurons have moved the protein templates—messenger RNAs (mRNAs)—and the protein synthesis machines—ribosomes—out to synapses to make proteins locally. During protein synthesis, multiple ribosomes can form a structure known as a polysome, which produces multiple protein copies from a single mRNA. Working in rodent preparations, Biever et al. found that solitary, mRNA-associated ribosomes, or monosomes, are a substantial source of proteins in neuronal processes. Many synaptic proteins are made on single ribosomes, which may solve the problem of limited space in tiny synaptic compartments. Science , this issue p. eaay4991"
https://openalex.org/W3004004162,"Background Necroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is accompanied by release of intracellular contents, and reportedly contributes to various diseases. Here, we investigate the significance of necroptosis in pancreatic cancer. Methods We used immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis to evaluate expression of the key mediators of necroptosis—receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 3 (RIP3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL)—in human pancreatic cancer. We also tested the effects of conditioned media (CM) from necroptotic cells on pancreatic cancer cells in Transwell migration and Matrigel invasion assays. Protein array analysis was used to investigate possible mediators derived from necroptotic cells. Results RIP3 and MLKL are highly expressed in human pancreatic cancer tissues compared with normal pancreas. MLKL expression was particularly intense at the tumor invasion front. CM derived from necroptotic cells promoted cancer cell migration and invasion, but not CM derived from apoptotic cells. C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5) was upregulated in CM derived from necroptotic cells compared with CM derived from control or apoptotic cells. Moreover, expression of the receptor for CXCL5, C-X-C-motif chemokine receptor-2 (CXCR2), was upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells. Inhibition of CXCR2 suppressed cancer cell migratory and invasive behavior enhanced by necroptosis. Conclusion These findings indicate that necroptosis at the pancreatic cancer invasion front can promote cancer cell migration and invasion via the CXCL5–CXCR2 axis."
https://openalex.org/W3004171189,"Although second-generation HIV integrase strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are prescribed throughout the world, the mechanistic basis for the superiority of these drugs is poorly understood. We used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to visualize the mode of action of the advanced INSTIs dolutegravir and bictegravir at near-atomic resolution. Glutamine-148→histidine (Q148H) and glycine-140→serine (G140S) amino acid substitutions in integrase that result in clinical INSTI failure perturb optimal magnesium ion coordination in the enzyme active site. The expanded chemical scaffolds of second-generation compounds mediate interactions with the protein backbone that are critical for antagonizing viruses containing the Q148H and G140S mutations. Our results reveal that binding to magnesium ions underpins a fundamental weakness of the INSTI pharmacophore that is exploited by the virus to engender resistance and provide a structural framework for the development of this class of anti-HIV/AIDS therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3004184083,"Strengths and weaknesses of an HIV drug Retroviruses replicate by inserting a copy of their RNA, which has been reverse transcribed into DNA, into the host genome. This process involves the intasome, a nucleoprotein complex comprising copies of the viral integrase bound at the ends of the viral DNA. HIV integrase strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) stop HIV from replicating by blocking the viral integrase and are widely used in HIV treatment. Cook et al. describe structures of second-generation inhibitors bound to the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) intasome and to an intasome with integrase mutations known to cause drug resistance. Passos et al. describe the structures of the HIV intasome bound to a second-generation inhibitor and to developmental compounds that are promising drug leads. These structures show how mutations can cause subtle changes in the active site that affect drug binding, show the basis for the higher activity of later-generation inhibitors, and may guide development of better drugs.

https://openalex.org/W3003381032,"Evaluation of fish nutritional content information could provide essential guidance for seafood consumption and human health protection. This study investigated the lipid contents, fatty acid compositions, and nutritional qualities of 22 commercially important marine fish species from the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), South China Sea. All the analyzed species had a low to moderate lipid content (0.51–7.35% fat), with no significant differences in fatty acid profiles among fishes from different lipid categories (p > 0.05). Compared with previous studies from other regions, the examined fish species exhibited higher proportions of saturated fatty acids (SFAs, 39.1 ± 4.00%) and lower contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs, 21.6 ± 5.44%), presumably due to the shifted diet influence from increased diatoms and decreased dinoflagellate over the past decades in the PRE. This study further revealed that there was a significantly negative correlation between the trophic levels and levels of PUFAs in the examined species (Pearson’s r = -0.42, p = 0.04), likely associated with their differed dietary composition. Considering the health benefit of PUFAs, a few marine fish in PRE with low levels of PUFAs might have no significant contribution to the cardiovascular disease prevention, although fish with different fatty acid profiles most likely contribute differently towards human health. Additional studies are needed in order to comprehensively analyze the nutritional status of fish species in the PRE."
https://openalex.org/W3003176882,"Introduction In Nepal, a substantial proportion of women still deliver their child at home. Disparities have been observed in utilisation of institutional delivery and skilled birth attendant services. We performed a disaggregated analysis among marginalised and non-marginalised women to identify if different factors are associated with home delivery among these groups. Materials and methods This study used data from the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey. It involves the analysis of 3,837 women who had experienced at least one live birth in the five years preceding the survey. Women were categorised as marginalised and non-marginalised based on ethnic group. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed to identify factors associated with home delivery. Results A higher proportion of marginalised women delivered at home (47%) than non-marginalised women (26%). Compared to non-marginalised women (35%), a larger proportion of marginalised women (64%) felt that it was not necessary to give birth at health facility. The multivariable analysis indicated an independent association of having no or basic education, belonging to middle, poorer and the poorest wealth quintile, residing in Province 2 and not having completed of four antenatal care visits per protocol with home delivery among both marginalised and non-marginalised women. Whereas residing in a rural area, residing in Province 7, and at a distance of >30 minutes to a health facility were factors independently associated with home delivery only among marginalised women. Conclusion We conclude that poor education, poor economic status, non-completion of four ANC visits and belonging to Province 2 particularly determined either group of women to deliver at home, whereas residing in rural areas, living far from health facility, and belonging to Province 7 determined marginalised women to deliver at home. Preventing mothers from delivering at home would thus require focusing on specific geographical areas besides considering wider socio-economic determinants."
https://openalex.org/W3003233424,"Dopaminergic functions are important for various biological activities, and their impairment leads to neurodegeneration, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Chronic manganese (Mn) exposure causes the neurological disorder manganism, presenting symptoms similar to those of PD. Emerging evidence has linked the transcription factor RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) to PD and also Alzheimer's disease. But REST's role in dopaminergic neurons is unclear. Here, we investigated whether REST protects dopaminergic neurons against Mn-induced toxicity and enhances expression of the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). We report that REST binds to RE1 consensus sites in the TH gene promoter, stimulates TH transcription, and increases TH mRNA and protein levels in dopaminergic cells. REST binding to the TH promoter recruited the epigenetic modifier cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein/p300 and thereby up-regulated TH expression. REST relieved Mn-induced repression of TH promoter activity, mRNA, and protein levels and also reduced Mn-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in dopaminergic neurons. REST reduced Mn-induced proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and interferon γ. Moreover, REST inhibited the Mn-induced proapoptotic proteins Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and death-associated protein 6 (Daxx) and attenuated an Mn-induced decrease in the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. REST also enhanced the expression of antioxidant proteins, including catalase, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). Our findings indicate that REST activates TH expression and thereby protects neurons against Mn-induced toxicity and neurological disorders associated with dopaminergic neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3003901609,"Despite overall improvements in cancer survival due to earlier diagnosis and better treatment, socio-economically disadvantaged people have lower cancer survival than more advantaged people. We aimed to examine differences in cancer survival by area-level socio-economic disadvantage in Victoria, Australia and assess whether these inequalities varied by year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, time since diagnosis and sex. Cases diagnosed with a first primary cancer in 2001-2015 were identified using the Victorian Cancer Registry and followed to the end of 2016. Five-year net survival and the excess risk of death due to a cancer diagnosis were estimated. People living in more disadvantaged areas had lower five-year survival than residents of less disadvantaged regions for 21 of 29 cancer types: head and neck, oesophagus, stomach, colorectum, anus/anal canal, liver, gallbladder/biliary tract, pancreas, lung, melanoma, connective/soft tissue, female breast, ovary, prostate, kidney, bladder, brain and central nervous system, unknown primary, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma and leukemia. The observed lower survival in more deprived regions persisted over time, except head and neck cancer, for which the gap in survival has widened. Socio-economic inequalities in survival decreased with increasing age at diagnosis for cancers of connective/soft tissue, bladder and unknown primary. For colorectal cancer, the observed survival disadvantage in lower socio-economic regions was greater for men than for women, while for brain and central nervous system tumours, it was larger for women. Cancer survival is generally lower for residents of more socio-economically disadvantaged areas. Identifying the underlying reasons for these inequalities is important and may help to identify effective interventions to increase survival for underprivileged cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3003499515,"Background Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) often cause local kyphosis. Percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) is a common method for the treatment of local kyphosis. However, the influence of kyphoplasty on spino-pelvic alignment and global sagittal balance when performed at specific treatment sites in the spine remains unclear. The purpose of the study is to investigate the influence of different fracture sites and PKP treatment on the spino-pelvic alignment and global sagittal balance in patients with OVCFs. Methods 90 patients with OVCF who underwent PKP were included in the retrospective study. According to the site of the fractured vertebrae, all the cases were divided into 3 groups: Main thoracic (MT) group (T1 to T9), Thoracolumbar (TL) group (T10 to L2) and Lumbar (LU) group (L3 to L5). 26 healthy elderly volunteers (aged over 59) were enrolled as the control group. Sagittal spino-pelvic parameters were measured on the full-spine radiographs preoperatively and postoperatively. Information of sagittal spino-pelvic parameters and global sagittal balance was gathered. Results Compared with the Control group, TL group showed significant differences in almost all parameters, except pelvic incidence (PI) and lumbar lordosis (LL). While only local sagittal parameters (Thoracic kyphosis (TK), Thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), LL) were significantly different in MT group. There was no significant difference in almost all of the parameters except for PT and TPA in LU group. Correspondingly, the sagittal parameters of TL group improved best after PKP, except for thoracic kyphosis (TK) and sagittal vertical axis (SVA). In MT group, only TLK was significantly decreased, while in LU group, only local kyphosis Cobb angle and SSA were improved. Conclusions OVCF mainly occurs in the thoracolumbar region. Compared with MT group and LU group, OVCF occurred in the thoracolumbar region had greater influence on the spino-pelvic alignment and global sagittal balance. When PKP was performed, the improvement of sagittal balance parameters of TL group was the best in the three groups."
https://openalex.org/W3003560153,"Assessing wetland vulnerability to chronic and episodic physical drivers is fundamental for establishing restoration priorities. We synthesized multiple data sets from E.B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge, New Jersey, to establish a wetland vulnerability metric that integrates a range of physical processes, anthropogenic impact and physical/biophysical features. The geospatial data are based on aerial imagery, remote sensing, regulatory information, and hydrodynamic modeling; and include elevation, tidal range, unvegetated to vegetated marsh ratio (UVVR), shoreline erosion, potential exposure to contaminants, residence time, marsh condition change, change in salinity, salinity exposure and sediment concentration. First, we delineated the wetland complex into individual marsh units based on surface contours, and then defined a wetland vulnerability index that combined contributions from all parameters. We applied principal component and cluster analyses to explore the interrelations between the data layers, and separate regions that exhibited common characteristics. Our analysis shows that the spatial variation of vulnerability in this domain cannot be explained satisfactorily by a smaller subset of the variables. The most influential factor on the vulnerability index was the combined effect of elevation, tide range, residence time, and UVVR. Tide range and residence time had the highest correlation, and similar bay-wide spatial variation. Some variables (e.g., shoreline erosion) had no significant correlation with the rest of the variables. The aggregated index based on the complete dataset allows us to assess the overall state of a given marsh unit and quickly locate the most vulnerable units in a larger marsh complex. The application of geospatially complete datasets and consideration of chronic and episodic physical drivers represents an advance over traditional point-based methods for wetland assessment."

Furthermore, its effectiveness-related factors on IPF patients are not quite explored. Methods A retrospective study, on patients prescribed pirfenidone for pulmonary fibrosis, was conducted to assess effectiveness on IPF patients and tolerability of all patients with lung fibrosis. The effectiveness of pirfenidone was tested on 110 IPF subjects receiving treatment for ≥3 months by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Response-linked factors and progression-free survival (PFS) were also analyzed. The data about safety outcomes and drug dose adjustments were collected from all included subjects. Results A total of 176 subjects were included: 117 were IPF, 19 connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD), and 40 unclassifiable ILD. Out of the 110 IPF subjects, 89 subjects were assessed as stable and 21 as progressive, out of which 10 died of acute exacerbation and 11 progressed. The effectiveness was significantly related to their baseline body mass index (BMI). IPF subjects with BMI>25kg/m2 or diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLco)>30% had higher PFS rate. The most common adverse events were skin-related and gastrointestinal-related. Drug discontinuation owing to adverse events occurred similarly in these three groups. Conclusion Pirfenidone was well tolerated in most of the lung fibrosis patients besides IPF, with a similar pattern of adverse events. Nearly 80% of IPF subjects were assessed as stable. More benefits were seen in IPF patients with higher BMI or mild-to-moderate disease."
https://openalex.org/W3003234363,"In human cancer cells that harbor mutant KRAS and WT p53 (p53), KRAS contributes to the maintenance of low p53 levels. Moreover, KRAS depletion stabilizes and reactivates p53 and thereby inhibits malignant transformation. However, the mechanism by which KRAS regulates p53 is largely unknown. Recently, we showed that KRAS depletion leads to p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation (P-p53) and increases the levels of p53 and its target p21/WT p53-activated fragment 1 (WAF1)/CIP1. Here, using several human lung cancer cell lines, siRNA-mediated gene silencing, immunoblotting, quantitative RT-PCR, promoter–reporter assays, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays, we demonstrate that KRAS maintains low p53 levels by activating the NRF2 (NFE2-related factor 2)–regulated antioxidant defense system. We found that KRAS depletion led to down-regulation of NRF2 and its targets NQO1 (NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1) and SLC7A11 (solute carrier family 7 member 11), decreased the GSH/GSSG ratio, and increased ROS levels. We noted that the increase in ROS is required for increased P-p53, p53, and p21Waf1/cip1 levels following KRAS depletion. Downstream of KRAS, depletion of RalB (RAS-like proto-oncogene B) and IκB kinase–related TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) activated p53 in a ROS- and NRF2-dependent manner. Consistent with this, the IκB kinase inhibitor BAY11-7085 and dominant-negative mutant IκBαM inhibited NF-κB activity and increased P-p53, p53, and p21Waf1/cip1 levels in a ROS-dependent manner. In conclusion, our findings uncover an important role for the NRF2-regulated antioxidant system in KRAS-mediated p53 suppression."
https://openalex.org/W3003379629,"Background Chronic tinnitus is a complex condition that can be associated with considerable distress. Whilst cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) approaches have been shown to be effective, not all patients benefit from psychological or psychologically anchored multimodal therapies. Determinants of tinnitus-related distress thus provide valuable information about tinnitus characterization and therapy planning. Objective The study aimed to develop machine learning models that use variables (or “features”) obtained before treatment to characterize patients’ tinnitus-related distress status after treatment. Whilst initially all available variables were considered for model training, the final model was required to achieve highest predictive performance using only a small number of features. Methods 1,416 tinnitus patients (decompensated tinnitus: 32%) who completed a 7-day multimodal treatment encompassing tinnitus-specific components, CBT, physiotherapy and informational counseling were included in the analysis. At baseline, patients were assessed using 205 features from 10 questionnaires comprising sociodemographic and clinical information. A data-driven workflow was developed consisting of (a) an initial exploratory correlation analysis, (b) supervised machine learning to predict tinnitus-related distress after treatment (T1) using baseline data only (T0), and (c) post-hoc analysis of the best model to facilitate model inspection and understanding. Classification methods were embedded in a feature elimination wrapper that iteratively learned on features found to be important for the model in the preceding iteration, in order to keep the performance stable while successively reducing the model complexity. 10-fold cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC) as performance measure was implemented for model generalization error estimation. Results The best machine learning classifier (gradient boosted trees) can predict tinnitus-related distress in T1 with AUC = 0.890 using 26 features. Subjectively perceived tinnitus-related impairment, depressivity, sleep problems, physical health-related impairments in quality of life, time spent to complete questionnaires and educational level exhibited a high attribution towards model prediction. Conclusions Machine learning can reliably identify baseline features recorded prior to treatment commencement that characterize tinnitus-related distress after treatment. The identification of key features can contribute to an improved understanding of multifactorial contributors to tinnitus-related distress and thereon based multimodal treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3003759034,"Peony is a famous ornamental and medicinal plant in China, and peony hybrid breeding is an important means of germplasm innovation. However, research on the genome of this species is limited, thereby hindering the genetic and breeding research on peony. In the present study, simple sequence repeat (SSR) locus analysis was performed on expressed sequence tags obtained by the transcriptome sequencing of Paeonia using Microsatellite software. Primers with polymorphism were obtained via polymerase chain reaction amplification and electrophoresis. As a result, a total of 86,195 unigenes were obtained by assembling the transcriptome data of Paeonia. Functional annotations were obtained in seven functional databases including 49,172 (Non-Redundant Protein Sequence Database: 57.05%), 38,352 (Nucleotide Sequence Database: 44.49%), 36,477 (Swiss Prot: 42.32%), 38,905 (Clusters of Orthologous Groups for Eukaryotic Complete Genomes: 45.14%), 37,993 (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes: 44.08%), 26,832 (Gene Ontology: 31.13%) and 37,758 (Pfam: 43.81%) unigenes. Meanwhile, 21,998 SSR loci were distributed in 17,567 unigenes containing SSR sequences, and the SSR distribution frequency was 25.52%, with an average of one SSR sequence per 4.66 kb.

Forty-five pairs of the 100 pairs of primers selected randomly could amplify clear polymorphic bands. The polymorphic primers of these 45 pairs were used to cluster and analyze 16 species of peony. The new SSR molecular markers can be useful for the study of genetic diversity and marker-assisted breeding of peony."
https://openalex.org/W3004212166,"Insect microbiomes play an important role in the health and fitness of insect hosts by contributing to nutrient absorption, immune health, and overall ecological fitness. As such, research interests in insect microbiomes have focused on agriculturally and industrially important organisms such as honey bees and termites. Orthopterans, on the other hand, have not been well explored for their resident microbial communities. Grasshoppers are an integral part of grassland ecosystems and provide important ecosystem services. Conversely, grasshoppers can be an agricultural pest requiring management with broad spectrum pesticides. However, little is known about the microbiomes of grasshoppers and their potential contribution to grasshopper biology. Here we examine the gut microbiome of six species of grasshoppers (n = 60) from a coastal tallgrass prairie ecosystem to gain a better understanding of the microbial communities present across the orthopteran order in this ecosystem. We found that there are bacterial phyla common to all six grasshopper species: Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and to a lesser degree, Tenericutes. Although the grasshopper species shared a high relative abundance of these groups, there were notable shifts in dominant phyla depending on the grasshopper species. Moreover, measures of alpha diversity revealed a more diverse microbiome in males than females. Our observations support the hypothesis that there is a “core” group of bacterial families in these grasshopper species and factors such as trophic behaviors and the evolution of the host may contribute to the shifts in prevalence among these core microbial groups."
https://openalex.org/W3004027727,"Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan that has great genetic diversity and is prevalent worldwide. In 2018, an outbreak of toxoplasmosis occurred in Santa Maria, Brazil, which was considered the largest outbreak ever described in the world. This paper describes the isolation and molecular characterization of Toxoplasma gondii from the placenta of two pregnant women with acute toxoplasmosis who had live births and were receiving treatment for toxoplasmosis during the outbreak. For this, placental tissue samples from two patients underwent isolation by mice bioassay, conventional PCR and genotyping using PCR-RFLP with twelve markers. Both samples were positive in isolation in mice. The isolate was lethal to mice, suggesting high virulence. In addition, the samples were positive in conventional PCR and isolates submitted to PCR-RFLP genotyping presented an atypical genotype, which had never been described before. This research contributes to the elucidation of this great outbreak in Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W3004305150,"Objective To investigate the association between sedentary behavior (SB) and sociodemographic, social support, behavioral, and health variables among Brazilian adolescents. Methods The 2015 National Adolescent School-based Health Survey (PeNSE) was a cross-sectional study consisting of 102,072 Brazilian ninth-graders (mainly aged 13–15 years). SB was defined as the time (in hours) watching television, using a computer, playing video games, talking to friends, or doing other activities in a sitting position. For analysis purposes, SB was categorized into different cut-offs as per the sample distribution quartiles: >2 versus <2 (25th percentile); >4 versus <4 (50th 26 percentile) and >6 versus <6 (75th 27 percentile). We employed Poisson univariate and multivariate regression analyses with robust variance and hierarchical entry of variables for each cut-off point. Results The prevalence rates of each SB cut-off point were 68.15% (CI: 67.44–68.86), 44.15% (CI: 43.40–44.90) and 24.97% (CI:24.37–25.57) for >2, >4 and >6 hours, respectively. The following characteristics were positively and significantly associated with each SB cut-off point in the final models: females, current employment, higher household economic status and higher maternal schooling, lower levels of parents checking homework, tobacco and alcohol use, soft drink and fruit consumption, and regular, poor or very poor self-assessed health status. Conversely, students who self-declared brown were less likely to be classified as a SB cut-off point. Significant associations with age, report of close friends, and physical activity varied by different SB cut-off points. Conclusion Understanding the SB correlates in their different dimensions contributes to the identification of subgroups of adolescents with higher SB prevalence, which is crucial in the development and improvement of public policies. The demographic and behavioral characterization of these groups can guide the development of future intervention strategies, considering the school and family contexts of these adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W3004038976,"Objectives HIV prevalence and incidence are higher among key populations including Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and transgender women in low and middle income countries, when compared to the general population. Despite World Health Organisation guidelines on the provision of services to key populations recommending an evidence-based, culturally relevant and rights-based approach, uptake of HIV services in many resource-limited and rights-constrained settings remains low. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been offering health services for MSM and transgender women in Beira, Mozambique since 2014 using a peer-educator driven model, but uptake of services has not been as high as expected. This qualitative study aimed to learn more about these key populations in Beira, their experiences of accessing MSM- and transgender-friendly services and their use of face-to-face and virtual networks, including social media, for engagement with health care. Methods In-depth interviews were carried out with MSM and transgender women who were 1) enrolled in, 2) disengaged from or 3) never engaged in MSF’s programme. Purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit the different groups of interviewees. Interviews were conducted in Portuguese, transcribed and translated into English before being coded and manually analysed using a thematic network framework. Results Nine transgender women and 18 cisgender MSM participated in the study. Interviewees ranged in age from 19 to 47 years, with a median age of 29. Three main themes emerged from the data: perceptions of stigma and discrimination, experiences of the peer-educator driven model and the use of face-to-face and virtual platforms for communication and engagement, including social media. Interviewees reported experiencing stigma and discrimination because of their gender or sexual identity. HIV-related stigma and health-care setting discrimination, including gossip and breach of confidentiality, were also reported. Although the presence of the peer-educators and their outreach activities were appreciated, they had limited visibility and an over-focus on health and HIV. The face-to-face networks of MSM and transgender women were small and fragmented. Virtual networks such as Facebook were mainly used for flirting, dating and informal communication. Most interviewees were at ease using social media and would consider it as a means of engaging with health messaging. Conclusions MSM and transgender women have challenges in accessing health services due to being stigmatised because of their gender identity and their sexual behaviour, and often experience stigma at home, in health-care facilities and in their communities. Peer-driven models of engagement were appreciated but have limitations. There is an untapped potential for further expansion and engagement with face-to-face and virtual platforms to reach MSM and transgender women in settings with a high HIV burden, and to provide them with essential information about HIV and their health."
https://openalex.org/W3004213373,"Background The rising prevalence of overweight and obesity and their health implications is a major public health concern worldwide. This study set out to understand the relationship between the number of hours spent watching television and Body Mass Index (BMI) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia using data from the Saudi Health Interview Survey. Methods The study employed both ordinary least squares and quantile regressions to estimate the mean and distributional association of prolonged television watching and BMI. Results The findings showed that prolonged television viewing is associated with larger BMI values. Additionally, the relationship was found to be greater towards the lower and upper tails of the BMI range and insignificant in the middle of the BMI distribution. Furthermore, the findings also showed that there is a gender gap in BMI levels, where females are likely to have higher BMI values than males. Conclusions The creation of more proactive recreational programs that can act as substitutes to television watching is recommended in order to reduce the amount of time that individuals spend watching television. It is also recommended that such interventions are tailored towards improving females’ levels of physical activity. The inclusion of television programs aimed at encouraging physical exercise and healthy diets is also imperative."
https://openalex.org/W3003335489,"The combination of a fluorescent reporter and enzymatic reporter provides a flexible and versatile way for the study of diverse biological processes, such as the detection of transcription and translation. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop this novel bifunctional reporter system. This study reports the design, construction, and validation of a new dicistronic mCherry-lacZα reporter system by artificial lac operon and pbr operon models in lacZM15-producing E. coli. It allows two reporter genes to be co-transcribed into a dicistronic mRNA strand, followed by coupled expression of mCherry and lacZα. In artificial lac operons, expression of the downstream lacZα was demonstrated to be positively related to expression of the upstream ORF. In artificial pbr operons, compared with the insertion of downstream full-length lacZ, the insertion of downstream lacZα exerted a slight effect on the response from the upstream mCherry. Furthermore, the downstream lacZα reporter showed stronger response to Pb(II) than the downstream full-length lacZ. Importantly, the response sensitivity of downstream lacZα was still higher than that of upstream mCherry in a dual RFP-lacZα reporter construct. The highly efficient expression profile of the reporter lacZα peptide makes it a preferred downstream reporter in polycistronic constructs. This novel bifunctional reporter system offers a robust tool for biological studies."
https://openalex.org/W3003935592,"Echinoderms are among the most primitive deuterostomes and have been used as model organisms to understand chordate biology because of their close evolutionary relationship to this phylogenetic group. However, there are almost no data available regarding the N-glycomic capacity of echinoderms, which are otherwise known to produce a diverse set of species-specific glycoconjugates, including ones heavily modified by fucose, sulfate, and sialic acid residues. To increase the knowledge of diversity of carbohydrate structures within this phylum, here we conducted an in-depth analysis of N-glycans from a brittle star (Ophiactis savignyi) as an example member of the class Ophiuroidea. To this end, we performed a multi-step N-glycan analysis by HPLC and various exoglyosidase and chemical treatments in combination with MALDI-TOF MS and MS/MS. Using this approach, we found a wealth of hybrid and complex oligosaccharide structures reminiscent of those in higher vertebrates as well as some classical invertebrate glycan structures. 70% of these N-glycans were anionic, carrying either sialic acid, sulfate, or phosphate residues. In terms of glycophylogeny, our data position the brittle star between invertebrates and vertebrates and confirm the high diversity of N-glycosylation in lower organisms."
https://openalex.org/W3004145665,"Structural knowledge of gastropod hemocyanins is scarce. To better understand their evolution and diversity we studied the hemocyanin of a caenogastropod, Pomacea canaliculata (PcH). Through a proteomic and genomic approach, we identified 4 PcH subunit isoforms, in contrast with other gastropods that usually have 2 or 3. Each isoform has the typical Keyhole limpet-type hemocyanin architecture, comprising a string of eight globular functional units (FUs). Correspondingly, genes are organized in eight FUs coding regions. All FUs in the 4 genes are encoded by more than one exon, a feature not found in non- caenogastropods. Transmission electron microscopy images of PcH showed a cylindrical structure organized in di, tri and tetra-decamers with an internal collar structure, being the di and tri-decameric cylinders the most abundant ones. PcH is N-glycosylated with high mannose and hybrid-type structures, and complex-type N-linked glycans, with absence of sialic acid. Terminal β-N-GlcNAc residues and nonreducing terminal α-GalNAc are also present. The molecule lacks O-linked glycosylation but presents the T-antigen (Gal-β1,3-GalNAc). Using an anti-PcH polyclonal antibody, no cross-immunoreactivity was observed against other gastropod hemocyanins, highlighting the presence of clade-specific structural differences among gastropod hemocyanins. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first gene structure study of a Caenogastropoda hemocyanin."
https://openalex.org/W3004342974,"To assess the variation in body dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms by weight status and the bi-directional relations between body dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms by weight status among Black adolescents.A sample of 153 Black adolescents aged 12-13 years, either overweight/obese (n = 57, 37%) or healthy weight (n = 96, 63%), were recruited and evaluated three times over two years (T1, T2 and T3). Measured weight and height were converted to age and sex-specific BMI z-score; body dissatisfaction was measured with silhouettes, and depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-I). Bidirectional relations were assessed with cross-lagged panel analyses, accounting for stability over time and contemporary correlations.Body dissatisfaction was higher among the overweight/obese group than the healthy weight group. No significant differences were found for depressive symptoms by weight status. Among the overweight/obese group, there were bidirectional relations: antecedent body dissatisfaction predicted subsequent depressive symptoms (T1-T2: β = 0.42, SE = 0.11, p<0.001; T2-T3: β = 0.36, SE = 0.09, p<0.001) and antecedent depressive symptoms predicted subsequent body dissatisfaction (T1-T2: β = 0.25, SE = 0.10, p = 0.012; T2-T3: β = 0.17, SE = 0.08, p = 0.045). Among the healthy weight group, there was no relation in either direction.Elevated body dissatisfaction among the overweight/obese group supports weight-based stigma as a stressor among Black adolescents. The bidirectional relations between body dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms among the overweight/obese group support the internalization of thinness idea and negative self-appraisal associated with depressive symptoms. Prevention of both body dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms may be mutually beneficial among Black adolescents with overweight/obesity."

The first filial generation (F1) hybrids of Hainan black goats and Saanen goats had different traits, black goats (BG) and white goats (WG), which also brought different production performance. We explored the difference of gut microbiota between black goats and white goats that both belonged to the first filial generation (F1) hybrids. In general, the alpha diversity of the black goat group was significantly higher than the white goat group. The species richness had no significant difference, while the species evenness of BG was higher than WG. Bacteroides, Oscillospira, Alistipes, Ruminococcus, Clostridium and Oscillibacter, as the core gut microbial genera, all had high abundance in BG and WG group. Only the Bacteroides and Bacteroidaceae 5-7N15 were the different genera between the BG and WG group, of which Bacteroides overlapped with the core genera and enriched in the WG group. Besides, PICRUSt analysis showed that there was a high abundance in the secondary metabolic pathways including membrane transport, replication and repair, carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism. We found the intestinal microbial species of black goats and white goats were very similar for living in the identical growing environment and feeding conditions, but there was still a slight difference in the content. On the one hand, it was proved that the small effect of genotype and the great effect of diet affected the intestinal microbiota together. On the other hand, it was also proved that these different traits of first filial generation (F1) hybrids may not related to gut microbiota and only because of different genotype. Moreover, characterization of the gut microbiota in BG and WG will be useful in goats gut microbiota research."
https://openalex.org/W3003365085,"Eye movements play multiple roles in human behaviour—small stabilizing movements are important for keeping the image of the scene steady during locomotion, whilst large scanning movements search for relevant information. It has been proposed that eye movement induced retinal motion interferes with the estimation of self-motion based on optic flow. We investigated the effect of eye movements on retinal motion information during walking. Observers walked towards a target, wearing eye tracking glasses that simultaneously recorded the scene ahead and tracked the movements of both eyes. By realigning the frames of the recording from the scene ahead, relative to the centre of gaze, we could mimic the input received by the retina (retinocentric coordinates) and compare this to the input received by the scene camera (head centred coordinates). We asked which of these coordinate frames resulted in the least noisy motion information. Motion noise was calculated by finding the error in between the optic flow signal and a noise-free motion expansion pattern. We found that eye movements improved the optic flow information available, even when large diversions away from target were made."
https://openalex.org/W3003499814,"To identify the whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) image type(s) with the highest value for assessment of multiple myeloma, in order to optimise acquisition protocols and read times.Thirty patients with clinically-suspected MM underwent WB-MRI at 3 Tesla. Unenhanced Dixon images [fat-only (FO) and water-only (WO)], post contrast Dixon [fat-only plus contrast (FOC) and water-only plus contrast (WOC)] and diffusion weighted images (DWI) of the pelvis from all 30 patients were randomised and read by three experienced readers. For each image type, each reader identified and labelled all visible myeloma lesions. Each identified lesion was compared with a composite reference standard achieved by review of a complete imaging dataset by a further experienced consultant radiologist to determine truly positive lesions. Lesion count, true positives, sensitivity, and positive predictive value were determined. Time to read each scan set was recorded. Confidence for a diagnosis of myeloma was scored using a Likert scale. Conspicuity of focal lesions was assessed in terms of percent contrast and contrast to noise ratio (CNR).Lesion count, true positives, sensitivity and confidence scores were significantly higher when compared to other image types for DWI (P<0.0001 to 0.003), followed by WOC (significant for sensitivity (P<0.0001 to 0.004), true positives (P = 0.003 to 0.049) and positive predictive value (P< 0.0001 to 0.006)). There was no statistically significant difference in these metrics between FO and FOC. Percent contrast was highest for WOC (P = 0.001 to 0.005) and contrast to noise ratio (CNR) was highest for DWI (P = 0.03 to 0.05). Reading times were fastest for DWI across all observers (P< 0.0001 to 0.014).Observers detected more myeloma lesions on DWI images and WOC images when compared to other image types. We suggest that these image types should be read preferentially by radiologists to improve diagnostic accuracy and reporting efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3003789423,"Purpose Previous studies have suggested that peripheral venous catheter is a significant source of gram-negative bacteraemia in patients with malignancy. We aimed to identify risk factors and develop a clinical prediction rule for the involvement of gram-negative organisms in peripheral venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections (PVC-BSIs) among patients with malignancy. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a 700-bed cancer hospital in Japan. Consecutive patients diagnosed with PVC-BSI based on clinical and microbiological criteria were included in this study. Based on clinical and microbiological characteristics of PVC-BSIs in cancer patients, a logistic regression model for predicting gram-negative organisms as causative organisms in PVC-BSIs was then developed. Results Of the 99 patients included in our cohort, 60 patients (60.6%) had gram-negative PVC-BSIs. The median age of patients with PVC-BSIs was 67 years (interquartile range [IQR], 59–74 years), and the median Pitt bactearemia score was 1 (IQR, 0–3). The median duration of catherization was 5 days (IQR, 4–7 days) and 70 patients (70.7%) received peripheral parenteral nutrition that contained amino acids. On multivariable analysis, age ≥65 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10–8.62), showering (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.07–9.26), Pitt bacteraemia score ≥2 points (OR, 6.96; 95% CI, 2.52–19.2), and use of peripheral parenteral nutrition (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10–0.98) were independent predictors for gram-negative PVC-BSIs among all PVC-BSIs. The simplified PVC-GN scores established to predict gram-negative PVC-BSIs had a optimism-corrected c-index of 0.775. Conclusion Gram-negative bacteria were more commonly responsible for PVC-BSI than Gram-positive bacteria among cancer patients in this cohort. Involvement of Gram-negative bacteria in PVC-BSIs could be predicted with readily available clinical variables."
https://openalex.org/W3003290498,"Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are conserved, ubiquitous members of the proteostasis network. Canonically, they act as “holdases” and buffer unfolded or misfolded proteins against aggregation in an ATP-independent manner. Whereas bacteria and yeast each have only two sHsps in their genomes, this number is higher in metazoan genomes, suggesting a spatiotemporal and functional specialization in higher eukaryotes. Here, using recombinantly expressed and purified proteins, static light-scattering analysis, and disaggregation assays, we report that the noncanonical sHsp HSP-17 of Caenorhabditis elegans facilitates aggregation of model substrates, such as malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and inhibits disaggregation of luciferase in vitro. Experiments with fluorescently tagged HSP-17 under the control of its endogenous promoter revealed that HSP-17 is expressed in the digestive and excretory organs, where its overexpression promotes the aggregation of polyQ proteins and of the endogenous kinase KIN-19. Systemic depletion of hsp-17 shortens C. elegans lifespan and severely reduces fecundity and survival upon prolonged heat stress. HSP-17 is an abundant protein exhibiting opposing chaperone activities on different substrates, indicating that it is a selective protein aggregase with physiological roles in development, digestion, and osmoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W3003385967,"Green turtles are megaherbivores with a key role in the dynamics of tropical seagrass meadows, but little is known about their relevance as herbivores in tropical reef habitats. We conducted underwater censuses of green turtles, herbivorous fishes and sea urchins in two distinct tropical regions: Fernando de Noronha (Western Atlantic Ocean) and the Hawaiian Archipelago (Central Pacific Ocean), to assess the contribution of green turtles to the total herbivore biomass in shallow reef habitats of tropical oceanic islands. Juvenile green turtles ranging 40-60 cm were observed at most of the surveyed sites, and hence, could be considered typical components of the shallow reef fauna of tropical oceanic islands. Furthermore, they were usually one of the most abundant species of roving herbivores in many of the sites surveyed. However, the biomass of green turtles was usually much lower than the aggregated biomass of fishes or sea urchins, which usually constituted most of the total herbivore biomass. Green turtles made a major contribution to the total herbivore biomass only in sheltered sites with low rugosity, low coral cover and high algal cover. Further investigation on the trophic redundancy between herbivores is required to assess the actual relevance of green turtles in reef ecosystems of oceanic islands, compared to herbivorous fishes and sea urchins, because different herbivores may target different algal resources and complementarity may be needed to maintain ecosystem functioning across large, naturally varied reefscapes."
https://openalex.org/W3004408537,"Introduction A programmatic mapping and size estimation study was conducted in 24 districts in 5 regions of Tanzania to estimate the size and locations of female sex workers (FSW) and men who have sex with men (MSM) to inform the HIV programming for Key Populations. Methodology Data were collected at two levels: first, interviews were conducted with informants to identify venues where FSWs and MSM frequent. Secondly, the size of MSM and FSWs were estimated through interviews with FSWs, MSM and other informants at the venue. The venue estimates were aggregated to generate the ward level estimates. Correction factors were then applied to adjust for MSM/FSW counted twice or more, absent from the venues on the mapping day or remain online and hidden. The ward size estimates for mapped wards were extrapolated to non-mapped wards and aggregated to generate district and regional level estimates. Results A total of 4,557 level I interviews were conducted. Further, 3,098 FSWs and 1,074 other informants at the FSWs venues and 558 MSM and 210 other informants at the MSM venues were interviewed during level II. The mapping survey identified 6,658 FSW, 1,099 FSW and MSM and 50 MSM venues in 75 wards. A total of 118,057 (range: 108,269 to 127,845) FSWs and 23,771 (range: 22,087 to 25,454) MSM were estimated in the study regions after extrapolation and accounting for correction factors. It was estimated that 5.6% and 1.3% of the female and male population of reproductive age (15–49 years old) could be FSWs and MSM in the study regions, respectively. Conclusion This study provides the baseline figures for planning, target setting and monitoring of the HIV intervention services in the study areas and geographic prioritisation of the response by allocating more resources to areas with a large number of FSWs and MSM."
https://openalex.org/W3004285128,"Fitness is closely associated with the development of pesticide resistance in insects, which determines the control strategies employed to target species and the risks of toxicity faced by non-target species. After years of selections with beta-cypermethrin in laboratory, a strain of housefly was developed that was 684,521.62-fold resistant (CRR) compared with the susceptible strain (CSS). By constructing ≤ 21 d and ≤ 30 d life tables, the differences in life history parameters between CSS and CRR were analyzed. The total production numbers of all the detected development stages in CRR were lower than in CSS. Except for the lower mortality of larvae, all the other detected mortalities in CRR were higher than in CSS. ♀:♂ and normal females of CRR were also lower than those of CSS. For CRR, the relative fitness was 0.25 in the ≤ 21 d life table and 0.24 in the ≤ 30 d life table, and a lower intrinsic rate of increase (rm) and net reproductive rate (Ro) were detected. Based on phenotype correlation and structural equation model (SEM) analyses, fecundity and viability were the only directly positive fitness components affecting fitness in CRR and CSS, and the other components played indirect roles in fitness. The variations of the relationships among fitness, fecundity and viability seemed to be the core issue resulting in fitness differences between CRR and CSS. The interactions among all the detected fitness components and the mating frequency-time curves appeared to be distinctly different between CRR and CSS. In summary, fecundity and its related factors separately played direct and indirect roles in the fitness costs of a highly beta-cypermethrin-resistant housefly strain."
https://openalex.org/W3004359062,"Effective treatment strategies exist for substance use disorder (SUD), however severe hurdles remain in ensuring adequacy of the SUD treatment (SUDT) workforce as well as improving SUDT affordability, access and stigma. Although evidence shows recent increases in SUD medication access from expanding Medicaid availability under the Affordable Care Act, it is yet unknown whether these policies also led to a growth in the changes in the nature of hiring in SUDT related workforce, partly due to poor data availability. Our study uses novel data to shed light on recent trends in a fast-evolving and policy-relevant labor market, and contributes to understanding the current SUDT related workforce and the effect of Medicaid expansion on hiring attempts in this sector. We examine attempts over 2010-2018 at hiring in the SUDT and related behavioral health sector as background for estimating the causal effect of the 2014-and-beyond state Medicaid expansion on these outcomes through ""difference-in-difference"" econometric models. We use Burning Glass Technologies (BGT) data covering virtually all U.S. job postings by employers. Nationally, we find little growth in the sector's hiring attempts in 2010-2018 relative to the rest of the economy or to health care as a whole. However, this masks diverging trends in subsectors, which saw reduction in hospital based hiring attempts, increases towards outpatient facilities, and changes in occupational hiring demand shifting from medical personnel towards counselors and social workers. Although Medicaid expansion did not lead to any statistically significant or meaningful change in overall hiring attempts, there was a shift in the hiring landscape."

Human skin color seems to be adapted and optimized for regional sun ultraviolet (UV) intensity. However, we do not know if fair, UV-sensitive skin is a survival advantage in regions with low UV radiation.A population-based nested case-control study of 29,518 Caucasian women, ages 25 to 64 years from Southern Sweden who responded to a questionnaire regarding risk-factors for malignant melanoma in 1990 and followed for 25 years. For each fair woman, defined as having red hair or freckles (n = 11,993), a control was randomly selected from all non-fair women from within the cohort of similar age, smoking habits, education, marital status, income, and comorbidity, i.e., 11,993 pairs. The main outcome was the difference in all-cause mortality between fair and non-fair women in a low UV milieu, defined as living in Sweden and having low-to-moderate sun exposure habits. Secondary outcomes were mortality by sun exposure, and among those non-overweight.In a low UV milieu, fair women were at a significantly lower all-cause mortality risk as compared to non-fair women (log rank test p = 0.04) with an 8% lower all-cause mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92, 95% CI 0.84‒1.0), including a 59% greater risk of dying from skin cancer among fair women (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.26‒2.0). Thus, it seem that the beneficial health effect from low skin coloration outweigh the risk of skin cancer at high latitudes.In a region with low UV milieu, evolution seems to improve all-cause survival by selecting a fair skin phenotype, i.e., comprising fair women with a survival advantage."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether measures of regional adiposity-including subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SATI) and visceral adipose tissue index (VATI)-can be associated with overall survival (OS) in Taiwanese patients with bone metastases.This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. We examined 1280 patients with bone metastases who had undergone radiotherapy (RT) between March 2005 and August 2013. Body composition (SATI, VATI, and muscle index) was assessed by computed tomography at the third lumbar vertebra and normalized for patient height. Patients were divided into low- and high-adiposity groups (for both SATI and VATI) according to sex-specific median values.Both SATI (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.696; P<0.001) and VATI (HR: 0.87; P = 0.037)-but not muscle index-were independently associated with a more favorable OS, with the former showing a stronger relationship. The most favorable OS was observed in women with high SATI (11.21 months; 95% confidence interval: 9.434-12.988; P<0.001).High SATI and VATI are associated with a more favorable OS in Taiwanese patients with bone metastases referred for RT. The question as to whether clinical measures aimed at improving adiposity may improve OS in this clinical population deserves further scrutiny."

The molecular mechanism of MUTYH-enhanced MNNG cytotoxicity is unclear, because MUTYH has a well-established role in the repair of oxidative DNA lesions. Here, we show in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that this MNNG-dependent phenotype does not involve oxidative DNA damage and occurs independently of both O6-methyl guanine adduct cytotoxicity and MUTYH-dependent glycosylase activity. We found that blocking of abasic (AP) sites abolishes higher survival of Mutyh-deficient (Mutyh−/−) MEFs, but this blockade had no additive cytotoxicity in WT MEFs, suggesting the cytotoxicity is due to MUTYH interactions with MNNG-induced AP sites. We found that recombinant mouse MUTYH tightly binds AP sites opposite all four canonical undamaged bases and stimulated apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)-mediated DNA incision. Consistent with these observations, we found that stable expression of WT, but not catalytically-inactive MUTYH, enhances MNNG cytotoxicity in Mutyh−/− MEFs and that MUTYH expression enhances MNNG-induced genomic strand breaks. Taken together, these results suggest that MUTYH enhances the rapid accumulation of AP-site intermediates by interacting with APE1, implicating MUTYH as a factor that modulates the delicate process of base-excision repair independently of its glycosylase activity.

High endogenous MUTYH expression in a panel of 24 immortalized human lymphocyte cell lines from healthy human subjects is associated with reduced cell survival to the alkylating agent N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), suggesting MUTYH enhances the cytotoxicity of alkylating agents (8Fry R.C.

MNNG induces DNA methyl adducts (Fig. 1B) that are primarily repaired by an alkyl-adenine glycosylase (AAG) or methyl-guanine methyltransferase (MGMT) (14Fu D. Calvo J.A. Samson L.D.

High basal MUTYH expression was more strongly associated with higher cell death versus genes known to mediate alkylating agent survival, such as AAG and MGMT. Here, we present evidence suggesting a novel mechanism for MUTYH-dependent cytotoxicity to the alkylating agent MNNG. Our results show that the levels of MNNG associated with MUTYH-dependent toxicity do not generate cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, we find in vitro that mouse MUTYH does not have glycosylase activity toward methyl-DNA base adducts. In contrast, our findings show that the levels of genomic strand breaks are increased in WT relative to Mutyh−/− MEFs at 40 min after MNNG treatment, and additionally, there is a decrease in unresolved genomic AP sites in WT versus Mutyh−/− MEFs after 24 h, evidence of a key role of MUTYH in AP site processing. In vitro experiments are consistent with these results showing high affinity of recombinant mouse MUTYH for AP sites and stimulation of APE1 incision. Our observations may be relevant to understanding the more general role of MUTYH in cross-talk with other DNA repair pathways reported by a number of studies (8Fry R.C. Svensson J.P. Valiathan C.

Consistent with a previous report (8Fry R.C. Svensson J.P. Valiathan C. Wang E. Hogan B.J. Bhattacharya S. Bugni J.M. Whittaker C.A. Samson L.D. Genomic predictors of interindividual differences in response to DNA damaging agents.Genes Dev. 2008; 22 (18805990): 2621-262610.1101/gad.1688508Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we found that immortalized Mutyh−/− MEFs treated with 67 μm (10 μg/ml) MNNG had significantly higher survival versus wildtype (WT) MEFs, p = 0.0016 (Fig. 2A, 1st and 2nd columns). Several experiments with Mutyh−/− MEFs had unusually high survival; after the experimental results with survival above 50% were discarded as outliers, there still existed a significant difference in survival between these cell lines (p = 0.007), which suggested the effect was robust. To verify the connection between MUTYH expression and MNNG cytotoxicity, we created Mutyh−/− MEF cell lines stably expressing recombinant human MUTYH. Antibiotic-resistant colonies were isolated and screened for MUTYH expression by Western blotting and were categorized as having high or low MUTYH expression as shown in Fig. 2B. Two high MUTYH cell lines had significantly lower survival to MNNG treatment versus three low MUTYH cell lines, p = 0.0048 (Fig. 2A, 3rd and 4th columns), evidence that increasing MUTYH expression levels leads to increasing amounts of MNNG cytotoxicity. The known activity of MUTYH in oxidative base damage repair suggests that the enhanced MNNG cytotoxicity may be due to induction of ROS. Previous reports indicated that treatment of mammalian cells with 250 μm MNNG induces ROS (16Chiu L.Y. Ho F.M. Shiah S.G. Chang Y. Lin W.W. Oxidative stress initiates DNA damager MNNG-induced poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1-dependent parthanatos cell death.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2011; 81 (21056551): 459-47010.1016/j.bcp.2010.10.016Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether lower concentrations also generate ROS. In addition, MUTYH expression has been associated with increased strand breaks and cell death due to oxidative DNA damage (17Oka S. Ohno M. Tsuchimoto D. Sakumi K. Furuichi M. Nakabeppu Y. Two distinct pathways of cell death triggered by oxidative damage to nuclear and mitochondrial DNAs.EMBO J. 2008; 27 (18188152): 421-43210.1038/sj.emboj.7601975Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which could explain the enhanced toxicity of MUTYH expression with MNNG. However, there is also evidence that MUTYH enhances survival to ROS (18Hwang B.J. Shi G. Lu A.L. Mammalian MutY homolog (MYH or MUTYH) protects cells from oxidative DNA damage.DNA Repair. 2014; 13 (24315136): 10-2110.1016/j.dnarep.2013.10.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and that MUTYH expression correlates with increased survival to the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) at a concentration that was shown to induce ROS (19Svilar D. Dyavaiah M. Brown A.R. Tang J.B. Li J. McDonald P.R. Shun T.Y. Braganza A. Wang X.H. Maniar S. St Croix C.M. Lazo J.S. Pollack I.F. Begley T.J. Sobol R.W.

We thus tested the role of MUTYH and OGG1 status to survival, oxidative DNA damage, and cellular ROS levels, specifically comparing differences at 67 μm MNNG (used in experiments in Fig. 2A) versus higher concentrations previously shown to induce ROS (16Chiu L.Y. Ho F.M. Shiah S.G. Chang Y. Lin W.W. Oxidative stress initiates DNA damager MNNG-induced poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1-dependent parthanatos cell death.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2011; 81 (21056551): 459-47010.1016/j.bcp.2010.10.016Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To directly test the hypothesis that MNNG induces ROS formation in MEF cells under the conditions of our survival assay, we used the redox-sensitive probe 2′,7′-dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate. Oxidative stress of high-concentration MNNG treatment occurs within 1 h of exposure (16Chiu L.Y. Ho F.M. Shiah S.G. Chang Y. Lin W.W. Oxidative stress initiates DNA damager MNNG-induced poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1-dependent parthanatos cell death.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2011; 81 (21056551): 459-47010.1016/j.bcp.2010.10.016Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At 1–2 h, 5–50 μm hydrogen peroxide induced ∼5–15% of cells to be categorized as green fluorescence–positive by flow cytometry (Fig. 3B), whereas untreated cells had background fluorescence below 1%, demonstrating sensitive detection of cellular oxidative stress. Equal gating and quantitation of MNNG-treated MEFs showed less than 1% positive fluorescence at all concentrations tested below 333 μm MNNG (Fig. 3A), ∼5-fold higher concentrations than that which mediated increased survival of Mutyh−/−/MEFs shown in Fig. 2A. Differences in the number of fluorescent cells in the 0–167 μm MNNG categories were not significant. Assays at 15 min and 4 h after MNNG treatment, more stringent gating of cells, and concentration dependence analysis failed to detect any evidence of increased ROS below 333 μm MNNG. Because ROS is generated at high levels of MNNG, we then examined whether there would be a MNNG dose dependence in our cell-survival assays. We found that the differences in survival between WT and Mutyh−/− MEFs were reversed at higher MNNG concentrations (pooled results of 333 and 667 μm; Fig. 3C). At the high MNNG concentrations shown to induce ROS, WT MEFs had significantly higher survival (p = 0.01), suggesting MUTYH has a prosurvival role to oxidative DNA damage induced by high concentrations of MNNG. These results are consistent with previous studies that showed that MUTYH provides protection to hydrogen peroxide and ROS generated by TMZ (18Hwang B.J. Shi G. Lu A.L. Mammalian MutY homolog (MYH or MUTYH) protects cells from oxidative DNA damage.DNA Repair. 2014; 13 (24315136): 10-2110.1016/j.dnarep.2013.10.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Svilar D. Dyavaiah M. Brown A.R. Tang J.B. Li J. McDonald P.R. Shun T.Y. Braganza A. Wang X.H. Maniar S. St Croix C.M. Lazo J.S. Pollack I.F. Begley T.J. Sobol R.W. Alkylation sensitivity screens reveal a conserved cross-species functionome.Mol. Cancer Res. 2012; 10 (23038810): 1580-159610.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0168Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We anticipated that induction of ROS by MNNG would also be influenced by the presence of Ogg1 because Ogg1−/− MEFs have been shown to be sensitive to cell death due to oxidative DNA damage (17Oka S. Ohno M. Tsuchimoto D. Sakumi K. Furuichi M. Nakabeppu Y. Two distinct pathways of cell death triggered by oxidative damage to nuclear and mitochondrial DNAs.EMBO J. 2008; 27 (18188152): 421-43210.1038/sj.emboj.7601975Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Consistent with the lack of ROS generated at low MNNG, we found that Ogg1−/− and WT MEFs had s similar survival to 67 μm MNNG (p = 0.88; Fig. 3D). These results provide further evidence that Mutyh−/− MEF MNNG survival is independent of the OG lesion repair pathway. Plasmid DNA–nicking assays have been used to assess levels of OG formation induced by chemical treatment in vitro (20Pastoriza-Gallego M. Armier J. Sarasin A. Transcription through 8-oxoguanine in DNA repair-proficient and Csb(−)/Ogg1(−) DNA repair-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts is dependent upon promoter strength and sequence context.Mutagenesis. 2007; 22 (17630408): 343-35110.1093/mutage/gem024Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether the treatment with MNNG concentration that resulted in increased survival of Mutyh−/− MEFs (67 μm) may directly induce formation of OG lesions, plasmid DNA was treated with increasing levels of MNNG and incubated with the human OG glycosylase (hOgg1). As shown in Fig. 3E, at MNNG concentrations of 333 μm and above, a base lesion is formed at a modest level that is removed by hOgg1, but no significant hOgg1-dependent cleavage above a background observed at 67 μm, the concentration used in the cell assays in Fig. 2A. These data taken together argue against the hypothesis that oxidative DNA damage mediates the higher survival of Mutyh−/− MEFs to MNNG treatment, although due to both the detection limit of these assays and the possibility of rare adducts, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that rare MNNG-induced DNA lesions are substrates for MUTYH. Notably, these results also show that there is a fine balance between the cytotoxic and protective roles of MUTYH that is dependent on the concentrations of MNNG and the generation of ROS. To understand how MUTYH status alters survival to different alkylating agents, we tested the survival of MEFs to TMZ, a cancer chemotherapy agent, and methyl-methanesulfonate (MMS). Although Mutyh−/− MEFs had higher survival to TMZ on average, similar to MNNG, this difference did not reach statistical significance with a TMZ dose of 1.1 mm (p = 0.28, Fig. S1). This concentration likely induces oxidative DNA damage (19Svilar D. Dyavaiah M. Brown A.R. Tang J.B. Li J. McDonald P.R. Shun T.Y. Braganza A. Wang X.H. Maniar S. St Croix C.M. Lazo J.S. Pollack I.F.

Thus, the survival of MEFs to these TMZ concentrations may be a result of competing prosurvival and pro-death activities of MUTYH. Mutyh−/− MEFs have increased survival to MNNG and decreased survival to 2 mm MMS in parallel wells of the same set of experiments (p < 0.001, Fig. S1). MUTYH interacts with mismatch repair (MMR) proteins in both bacteria and mammalian cells (21Bai H. Lu A.L. Physical and functional interactions between Escherichia coli MutY glycosylase and mismatch repair protein MutS.J.

To test for MUTYH involvement in the repair of O6mG lesions, we used the MGMT inhibitor O6-benzylguanine (BG), which leads to increased levels of O6mG in genomic DNA and MMR-dependent cell death (25Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Pegg A.E.

Although BG treatment altered MNNG cytotoxicity, the effect of BG and MUTYH status was independent and did not interact, evidence that MUTYH does not alter MNNG survival via interactions with O6mG lesion repair (Fig. S2). MUTYH and its homologs are adenine glycosylases that have strong preferences for OG in the opposite strand, but they will also remove A in G:A and C:A mispairs (26Lu A.L. Yuen D.S. Cillo J.

A 30-bp dsDNA duplex containing a centrally-located O6mG:A lesion was treated with Mutyh under single-turnover (STO) conditions ([DNA] < [enzyme]) for 30 min at 37 °C (Fig. S3); however, no excision activity was detected under these conditions. To our knowledge, the ability of MUTYH to excise methylated bases has not been tested. Because MUTYH-mediated strand scission can enhance cell death (17Oka S. Ohno M. Tsuchimoto D. Sakumi K.

Despite the important role of BAT in the control of glucose homeostasis, the metabolic fate and function of glucose in BAT remain elusive as there is clear dissociation between glucose uptake and BAT thermogenesis. Interestingly, intracellular glycolysis and lactate production appear to be required for glucose uptake by BAT. Here, we specifically examine whether activation of lactate receptors in BAT plays a key role in regulating glucose homeostasis in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). When C57BL/6J mice are given HFD for 5 weeks at 28°C, male, but not female, mice gain body weight and develop hyperglycemia. Importantly, high-fat feeding upregulates expression of the lactate receptor hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1) in female C57BL/6J mice, whereas male C57BL/6J mice show reduced HCAR1 expression in BAT. Treatment with the HCAR1 agonist lowers systemic glucose levels in male DIO mice. This reduction is associated with increased glucose uptake in BAT. Therefore, our results suggest that HCAR1 in BAT may contribute to the development of hyperglycemia in male C57BL/6J DIO mice."

In order to achieve a balance between cell proliferation and cell death, a tight regulation of Caspase-8, which is a key player in controlling apoptosis, is required. Caspase-8 activity is regulated by cellular FLIP proteins. These proteins are expressed in different isoforms (cFLIPlong and cFLIPshort) which determine cell death and survival. Interestingly, several viruses encode FLIP proteins, homologous to cFLIPshort, which are described to regulate Caspase-8 and the host cell death machinery. In the current study a mouse model was generated to show the impact of viral FLIP (vFLIP) from Kaposi’s Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV)/ Human Herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) on cell death regulation in the gut. Our results demonstrate that expression of vFlip in intestinal epithelial cells suppressed cFlip expression, but protected mice from lethality, tissue damage and excessive apoptotic cell death induced by genetic cFlip deletion. Finally, our model shows that vFlip expression decreases cFlip mediated Caspase-8 activation in intestinal epithelial cells. In conclusion, our data suggests that viral FLIP neutralizes and compensates for cellular FLIP, efficiently counteracting host cell death induction and facilitating further propagation in the host organism."
https://openalex.org/W3004044095,"The experience of having a child hospitalised is stressful and disrupts families in myriad ways; however, the experiences of parents/caregivers who encounter repeated admissions of a child with acute lower respiratory infections are under-researched. This project aims to explore these experiences, from a qualitative perspective, using the philosophical tenets of reflective lifeworld research. The research included 14 face-to-face interviews with parents, grandparents, or primary caregivers, of children who, whilst under two years of age, were admitted to hospital multiple times with a lower respiratory infection diagnosis. Many of the participants were from Māori or Samoan ethnic backgrounds. The findings of this single site study revealed that these parents/caregivers' experiences were characterised by feelings of powerlessness, offering descriptions of hospitals as harsh and difficult places to reside, they are ‘in-hospitable’. The findings suggest that repeated hospitalisations created a cycle of stressful experiences that impacted both familial relationships and interactions with society. This study draws attention to this previously obscured population group, and calls health care practitioners and policy advisors to engage differently over issues involving families in similar positions."
https://openalex.org/W3004227086,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is highly prevalent, occurring in 1%-2% of the adult population, increasing the risk of stroke, and resulting in considerable healthcare costs. While stroke is a major complication of AF, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients also have a high risk of stroke, suggesting that AF is a possible risk factor for mortality of ESRD patients. However, whether the existence of AF at the initiation of hemodialysis predicts higher mortality risk of incident ESRD patients remains to be defined.This retrospective cohort study was performed at Wanfang Hospital from January 2004 to May 2018. The end points were mortality of patients or the end of the study. Incident ESRD patients who were on maintenance hemodialysis for more than 3 months were eligible for inclusion. Cox proportional regression and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to determine the association between predictors and mortality. The association between AF and echocardiographic parameters, causes of death were also investigated.Of the 393 incident ESRD patients at initiation of hemodialysis, 57 (14.5%) had AF and the median age was 71 years. Patients with AF were significantly older; showed significantly higher C-reactive protein levels, more heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mortality. Multivariate Cox regression showed that AF had a hazard ratio of 4.1 (95% confidence interval: 2.4-7.0) for mortality. Age-specific analysis showed that AF was significantly associated with mortality in all age groups. Echocardiography measurements including ejection fraction and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were similar in AF and non-AF patients. Cause-specific analysis showed that AF significantly associated with overall cardiovascular death and death due to acute myocardial infarction/coronary artery disease and sepsis.AF at the initiation of hemodialysis predicts higher mortality risk of incident ESRD patients regardless of age. The systolic function and degree of LVH were similar in AF and non-AF patients. The association between AF and sepsis-related death suggested the role of systemic inflammation on the pathogenesis of AF."
https://openalex.org/W3003386566,"Researchers in Europe are increasingly assessed by their publication metrics. To uncover the effect of quantitative assessment on the publication strategies of clinical researchers in Denmark, we interviewed 9 senior researchers at the Department of Clinical Research at the University of Southern Denmark with the lowest and highest values for a, as defined by Hirsch. Our aim is to investigate the importance of these metrics to their academic careers: h-index, number of publications, number of citations, international collaborations, local collaborations, field specific journal publishing and high journal impact factor publishing. To validate our findings we compared their publication record to their statistically analyzed stated publication strategy. Our results indicate two styles of publication strategy used by these senior researchers. Researchers with Low a engage in local collaborations, disseminate knowledge in local media and publish in field specific journals, while researchers with High a engage in international collaborations, invest significant time in publishing in the highest impact journals in their field, and acquire a greater number of citations. Both publication strategies can lead to a successful academic career, yet we have an indication through the h5-index that the practices of the High a group are more likely to nudge the h-index."
https://openalex.org/W3004228505,"We analyzed the association between birthweight, nutritional status and transverse maxillary growth in 7- to 9-year-old schoolchildren. We undertook a cross-sectional survey nested in a population-based cohort study of 158 schoolchildren. The participants lived in the urban area of a small town within the Western Brazilian Amazon. The outcome was represented by the upper intermolar distance given in millimeters (mm), as an indicator of the degree of maxillary bone growth in its transverse dimension. The exposures were sex, birthweight, the bottle-feeding pattern operationalized by a scale corresponding to the age of introduction of the bottle and Body Mass Index-for-age z-score (BAZ) at 4 to 6 ys. Path analysis was employed to estimate standardized direct, indirect and total effects of exposures on the outcome using structural equations model (SEM) supported by Mplus 7 program. The values of standardized coefficients (SC) showed significant direct positive effects of sex (SC = 0.203; p = 0.006), birth weight (SC = 0.155; p = 0.030) and BAZ (SC = 0.165; p = 0.014) on transverse maxillary growth. The indirect effects (SC = 0.057; p = 0.012) and the total effect (SC = 0.261; p<0.001) of sex on the outcome were statistically significant. The indirect effects of birth weight on the outcome were not significant (SC = 0.018; p = 0.488), however, the total effect was significant (SC = 0.174; p = 0.011). In conclusion, sex, birthweight, bottle beginning age and BAZ showed association with the transverse growth of the maxillary bone. In addition to contributing to an adequate birth weight of the child, policies and programs that favor prenatal care and conditions to guarantee a full-term birth can positively affect transverse growth of the maxilla. From a Public Health Surveillance point of view, children with reduced birthweight, inadequate breastfeeding pattern and nutritional deficit for age may be more likely to develop atrophy of the jaws which, depending on the severity, may result in malocclusion with an important impact on quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W3003228961,"Most days, Willy van Wingerden spends a few free hours walking by the sea not far from the Dutch town of Monster. Here, the cheerful nurse has plucked more than 500 ancient artifacts from the broad, windswept beach known as the Zandmotor, or sand engine. She has found Neanderthal tools made of river cobbles, bone fishhooks, and human remains thousands of years old. Her favorite beach—made of material dredged from the sea bottom offshore—preserves traces of a lost world, when sea levels were lower, and what is now the North Sea was a rich lowland, home to modern humans and Neanderthals. While she and other dedicated amateurs amass artifacts, scientists are applying new methods to date the finds and sequence any genetic traces, as well as to map the sea floor and analyze sediment cores. Together, researchers and collectors are bringing to light a vanished homeland of ancient Europeans."
