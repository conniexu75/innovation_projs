https://openalex.org/W4289261835,"In spite of the availability of vaccine, the health burden associated with the COVID-19 pandemic continues to increase. An estimated 5 million people have died with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of evolution and genomic diversity can provide sufficient information to reduce the health burden of the pandemic. This study focused to conduct worldwide genomic surveillance. About 7.6 million genomic data were analyzed during 2019 to 2022. Multiple sequence alignment was conducted by using maximum likelihood method. Clade GK (52%) was the most predominant followed by GRY (12%), GRA (11%), GR (8%), GH (7%), G (6%), GV (3%), and O (1%), respectively. VOC Delta (66%) was the most prevalent variant followed by VOC Alpha (18%), VOC Omicron (13%), VOC Gamma (2%) and VOC Beta (1%), respectively. The frequency of point mutations including E484K, N501Y, N439K, and L452R at spike protein has increased 10%-92%. Evolutionary rate of the variants was 23.7 substitution per site per year. Substitution mutations E484K and N501Y had significant correlation with cases ( r = .45, r = .23), fatalities ( r = .15, r = .44) and growth rate R 0 ( r = .28, r = .54). This study will help to understand the genomic diversity, evolution and the impact of the variants on the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4289262055,"An important mechanical property of cells is the membrane bending modulus, κ . In the case of red blood cells (RBCs) there is a composite membrane consisting of a cytoplasmic membrane and an underlying spectrin network. Literature values of κ are puzzling, as they are reported over a wide range, from 5 k B T to 230 k B T. To disentangle the contribution of the cytoplasmic membrane from the spectrin network, we investigated the bending of red blood cell cytoplasmic membranes (RBC cm ) in the absence of spectrin and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). We used a combination of X-ray diffuse scattering (XDS), neutron spin-echo (NSE) spectrometry and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Our results indicate values of κ of order 4 k B T to 6 k B T, relatively small compared to literature values for most single component lipid bilayers. We suggest two ways this relative softness might confer biological advantage."
https://openalex.org/W4289262384,"Rural subjects, the agricultural industrial structure, public services and rural governance are fully empowered by digital villages. This empowerment effectively compensates for the urban-rural digital divide and promotes the equalization of urban-rural income, consumption, education, medical care, and governance. Based on the three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and Malmquist index, this article conducts an in-depth study of the static and dynamic efficiency trends of digital villages that empower urban-rural balanced development in 31 provinces in China from 2015 to 2020. The results show that comprehensive technical efficiency of 31 provinces is weak DEA effective, and that the scale efficiency is the main factor affecting comprehensive technical efficiency. The educational level, local finance and industrial structure optimization have a significant positive impact on efficiency evaluation, but technological innovation and the urbanization level have a significant negative impact. Total factor productivity shows diminishing marginal utility based on the Malmquist index and its decomposition change. Restricted by the change in technological progress, the efficiency of digital villages in China in enabling urban-rural equilibrium needs to be further improved."
https://openalex.org/W4289337934,"Armillaria mellea is an important fungal pathogen worldwide, affecting a large number of hosts in the horticulture and forestry industries. Controlling A. mellea infection is expensive, labour intensive and time-consuming, so a new, environmentally friendly management solution is required. To this effect, endophytic Trichoderma species were studied as a potential protective agent for Armillaria root rot (ARR) in strawberry and privet plants. A collection of forty endophytic Trichoderma isolates were inoculated into strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) plants and plant growth was monitored for two months, during which time Trichoderma treatment had no apparent effect. Trichoderma-colonised strawberry plants were then inoculated with A. mellea and after three months plants were assessed for A. mellea infection. There was considerable variation in ARR disease levels between plants inoculated with different Trichoderma spp. isolates, but seven isolates reduced ARR below the level of positive controls. These isolates were further tested for protective potential in Trichoderma-colonized privet (Ligustrum vulgare) plants where five Trichoderma spp. isolates, including two highly effective Trichoderma atrobrunneum isolates, were able to significantly reduce levels of disease. This study highlights the potential of plants pre-colonised with T. atrobrunneum for effective protection against A. mellea in two hosts from different plant families."
https://openalex.org/W4289261919,"The filling mining method is an effective method for controlling ground stress and preventing surface subsidence in the mining field during exploitation of underground resources. Tailings can be utilized as the filling material, so as to realize the reuse of industrial waste. However, utilization of the traditional Portland cement as the cementing material for tailings leads to groundwater pollution. In addition, production of Portland cement results in consumption of a great amount of ore and air pollution. In this paper, a tailings cementation method by using the microbial induced calcite precipitation (MICP) technique with immersion curing is proposed. Tailings are cemented by the MICP technique with aerobic bacteria ( Sporosarcina pasteurii ) under a soaked curing environment. The variable control method is applied to investigate the factors influencing the cementation effects by the MICP technique with Sporosarcina pasteurii , including the bacterial solution concentration, the cementing solution concentration, the particle size of tailings, and the curing temperature. The results indicate that: when OD 600 of the Sporosarcina pasteurii solution is 1.6, the urea concentration in the cementing solution is 0.75 mol/L, the tailings are raw materials without grinding, and the curing temperature is 30°C, the cementation effect is the best. In view of uneven calcification during MICP with Sporosarcina pasteurii , mixed Sporosarcina pasteurii and Castellaniella denitrificans are used for tailings cementation. Higher strength of cemented tailings is achieved. It is proved that the MICP technique with mixed aerobic bacteria and facultative anaerobes is an effective method for tailings cementation."
https://openalex.org/W4289338988,"Lipid ratios and the triglyceride and glucose index (TyG) could be a simple biochemical marker of insulin resistance (IR). The current study was carried out to examine the correlation between triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (TG/HDL-C), total cholesterol to HDL-C (TC/HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol to HDL-C ratio (LDL-C/HDL-C), as well as TyG index with the severity and mortality of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A total of 1228 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in the current research. Regression models were performed to evaluate the correlation between the lipid index and severity and mortality of COVID-19. The TyG index and TG/HDL-C levels were significantly higher in the severe patients (P<0.05). TG/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, TC/HDL-C ratios, and TyG index were significantly lower in survivor cases (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that predictors of the severity adjusted for age, sex and BMI were TyG index, TG/HDL-C ratio (OR = 1.42 CI:1.10-1.82, OR = 1.06 CI: 1.02-1.11, respectively). This analysis showed that TG/HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C ratios, and TyG index statistically are correlated with COVID-19 mortality (OR = 1.12 CI:1.06-1.18, OR = 1.24 CI:1.05-1.48, OR = 1.47 CI:1.19-1.80, OR = 1.52 CI:1.01-2.31, respectively). In summary, the TyG index and lipid ratios such as TC/HDL-C, TG/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C could be used as an early indicator of COVID-19 mortality. Furthermore, the study revealed that TyG index and TG/HDL-C indices are biochemical markers of COVID-19 severe prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4289261944,"Non-typhoidal Salmonellae are common foodborne pathogens that can cause gastroenteritis and other illnesses in people. This is the first study to assess the transfer of Salmonella enterica from raw chicken carcasses to ready-to-eat chicken salad in Cambodia. Twelve focus group discussions in four Cambodian provinces collected information on typical household ways of preparing salad. The results informed four laboratory experiments that mimicked household practices, using chicken carcasses inoculated with Salmonella. We developed four scenarios encompassing the range of practices, varying by order of washing (chicken or vegetables first) and change of chopping utensils (same utensils or different). Even though raw carcasses were washed twice, Salmonella was isolated from 32 out of 36 chicken samples (88.9%, 95% CI: 73.0-96.4) and two out of 18 vegetable samples (11.1%, 95% CI: 1.9-36.1). Salmonella was detected on cutting boards (66.7%), knives (50.0%) and hands (22.2%) after one wash; cross-contamination was significantly higher on cutting boards than on knives or hands (p-value < 0.05). The ready-to-eat chicken salad was contaminated in scenario 1 (wash vegetables first, use same utensils), 2 (wash vegetables first, use different utensils) and 3 (wash chicken first, use same utensils) but not 4 (wash chicken first, use different utensils) (77.8%, 11.1%, 22.2% and 0%, respectively). There was significantly higher Salmonella cross-contamination in scenario 1 (wash vegetables first, use same utensils) than in the other three scenarios. These results show how different hygiene practices influence the risk of pathogens contaminating chicken salad. This information could decrease the risk of foodborne disease in Cambodia and provides inputs to a quantitative risk assessment model."
https://openalex.org/W4289262014,"Gramicidin is a monomeric protein that is thought to non-selectively conduct cationic currents and water. Linear gramicidin is considered an antibiotic. This function is considered to be mediated by the formation of pores within the lipid membrane, thereby killing bacterial cells. The main non-psychoactive active constituent of the cannabis plant, cannabidiol (CBD), has recently gained interest, and is proposed to possess various potential therapeutic properties, including being an antibiotic. We previously determined that CBD's activity on ion channels could be, in part, mediated by altering membrane biophysical properties, including elasticity. In this study, our goal was to determine the empirical effects of CBD on gramicidin currents in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, seeking to infer potential direct compound-protein interactions. Our results indicate that gramicidin, when applied to the extracellular HEK cell membrane, followed by CBD perfusion, increases the gramicidin current."
https://openalex.org/W4289262438,"In this article, we investigate the problem of point and interval estimations under constant-stress partially accelerated life tests. The lifetime of items under use condition is assumed to follow the two-parameter inverted Kumaraswamy distribution. Based on Type-I progressively hybrid censored samples, the maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods are applied to estimate the model parameters as well as the acceleration factor. Under linear exponential, general entropy and squared error loss functions, Bayesian method outcomes are obtained. In addition, interval estimation is achieved by finding approximately confidence intervals for the parameters, as well as credible intervals. To investigate the accuracy of the obtained estimates and to compare the performance of confidence intervals, a Monte Carlo simulation is developed. Finally, a set of real data is analyzed to demonstrate the estimation procedures."
https://openalex.org/W4289261679,"Many airlines instituted social distancing practices to keep passengers safe during the pandemic. The practices include keeping the middle seats empty, reducing the number of passengers taking an apron bus from the terminal to the airplane, and prescribing that passengers maintain 1 m social distance of separation from other passengers in the aisle while advancing to their seats. However, not all passengers comply with a prescribed 1 m aisle social distance. Through agent-based simulations of passenger boarding when apron buses are used, we examine boarding policies adapted for the pandemic when the level of passenger compliance varies. To compare policies, we consider the duration of time that passengers are too close to other passengers while walking or standing in the aisle. We consider other health metrics from previous research and the time to complete boarding of the airplane. We find that the WilMA–Spread and Reverse-pyramid–Spread boarding methods provide favorable outcomes. Airlines should use WilMA–Spread if their primary concern is the risk to passengers while walking down the aisle and Reverse-pyramid–Spread if they want faster times to complete boarding of the airplane and reduced risk to aisle seat passengers from later boarding passengers. The level of the passengers’ non-compliance with the prescribed aisle social distance can impact a health metric by up to 6.75%—depending on the boarding method and metric. However, non-compliance reduces the time to complete boarding of the airplane by up to 38.8% even though it increases the average time an individual passenger spends boarding."
https://openalex.org/W4289261806,"The relational event model (REM) facilitates the study of network evolution in relational event history data, i.e., time-ordered sequences of social interactions. In real-life social networks it is likely that network effects, i.e., the parameters that quantify the relative importance of drivers of these social interaction sequences, change over time. In these networks, the basic REM is not appropriate to understand what drives network evolution. This research extends the REM framework with approaches for testing and exploring time-varying network effects. First, we develop a Bayesian approach to test whether network effects change during the study period. We conduct a simulation study that illustrates that the Bayesian test accurately quantifies the evidence between a basic (‘static’) REM or a dynamic REM. Secondly, in the case of the latter, time-varying network effects can be studied by means of a moving window that slides over the relational event history. A simulation study was conducted that illustrates that the accuracy and precision of the estimates depend on the window width: narrower windows result in greater accuracy at the cost of lower precision. Third, we develop a Bayesian approach for determining window widths using the empirical network data and conduct a simulation study that illustrates that estimation with empirically determined window widths achieves both good accuracy for time intervals with important changes and good precision for time intervals with hardly any changes in the effects. Finally, in an empirical application, we illustrate how the approaches in this research can be used to test for and explore time-varying network effects of face-to-face contacts at the workplace."
https://openalex.org/W4289262253,"Background Cirrhosis causes alterations in the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous systems and leads to cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (CCM). CCM is defined as cardiac dysfunction characterized by an impaired systolic responsiveness to stress or exercise, and/or impaired diastolic function, as well as electrophysiological abnormalities, including chronotropic incompetence (CI), in the absence of other known cardiac disease. CI is a common feature of autonomic neuropathy in cirrhosis. The aim of the study is to assess the role of cardiac exercise stress test in the diagnosis of CCM. Methods The analysis included 160 end-stage liver disease (ESLD) patients who underwent a cardiac exercise stress test prior to the orthotopic liver transplantation. CI was defined as the inability to achieve the heart rate reserve (HRR). Pertaining to the therapy with beta-blockers: 80% of HRR was achieved in patients not taking beta-blockers and 62% in patients taking beta-blockers. Results In the analyzed population, 68.8% of patients met the criteria for CI. CI was more frequent in the more severe ESLD (with a higher MELD score and in a higher Child-Pugh class). In comparison to the viral hepatitis and other etiologies of ESLD, patients with alcoholic cirrhosis had a significantly lower rest heart rate (HR), lower maximal HR, lower median achieved percentage of maximal predicted HR (MPHR), a smaller percentage of patients achieved ≥ 85% of MPHR and a lower heart rate reserve. No significant relationship between the survival of OLT recipients and presence of chronotropic incompetence regarding to class of Child-Pugh scale, MELD score and etiology of ESLD were found. Conclusions The prevalence of CI is higher among liver transplant candidates than previously described. The altered chronotropic response may differ in regard to the severity of liver disease correlating with both the Child-Pugh and MELD scores, however CI does not seem to influence the long-term survival post OLT. Exercise stress test is a reliable, safe and useful tool for the diagnosis of CCM in liver transplant candidates and should be included in the standard cardiovascular assessment prior to OLT."
https://openalex.org/W4289337609,"The objective of this study was to assess the potential of the use of asynchronous tele-expertise (ASTE) to provide prenatal diagnosis from a medical and economic point of view.Patients screened by a midwife at a primary center.A technical and clinical evaluation was conducted retrospectively, and a cost minimization study compared asynchronous tele-expertise to face-to-face consultations that would have been performed without ASTE.In our study we assessed the feasibility of ASTE, what were the origins of the requests for expertise, whether patients need to be moved and the reasons for doing so, and the costs of tele-expertise and conventional consultation.In this retrospective analysis 322 advices from 260 patients were interpreted remotely via a platform. The results revealed a 90.68% feasibility of transmitting in a satisfactory and interpretable way ultrasound images and videos via the tele-expertise platform (292/322 files). In our series, asynchronous analysis allowed the required physician to make an accurate diagnosis and identify 74 (28.5%, 95% CI [23% -33.9%]) pregnancies associated with malformations and rule out abnormalities in 186 (71.5%, 95% CI [66.1% -77%]) of the cases. The ASTE was not associated with face-to-face consultations for 72.7% (189/260) of the patients, who without moving, were able to have access to a precise diagnosis by ruling out the presence of anomalies in 163/189 of these patients and confirming them in 26/189 patients. The practice of ASTE would result from a societal point of view, an average saving of 61.8% (€ 120.57) per patient compared to a face-to-face consultation.The use of asynchronous tele-expertise (ASTE) using fetal ultrasound, is feasible and may contribute to increased diagnostic accuracy while generating a significant reduction in costs for society."
https://openalex.org/W4289344025,"In the new era, many people seek their health-related information through the Internet due to the increasing access to this technology. Searching online health information can affect the health behavior. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between online health information-seeking behavior and a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy in a sample of Iranian pregnant women. This cross-sectional study was conducted among pregnant women admitted to health centers of Eghlid city, Fars province, Iran in 2019. A total of 193 women participated in the study. The required data were gathered using two validated questionnaires to measure the online health information-seeking behavior and the healthy lifestyle practices of the participants. The collected data were analyzed through descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation coefficient using SPSS version 22. Online health information experience and its subscales showed no statistical correlation with a healthy lifestyle. Age and education did not correlate with online health information-seeking behavior. Age had a statistical correlation with a healthy lifestyle, but education had the same correlation only with some subscales of a healthy lifestyle. The findings were surprising, suggesting that online health information-seeking behavior does not affect the lifestyle of pregnant women. These finding and probable explanations are discussed, but due to the limited literature on the subject, further studies are recommended to be conducted."
https://openalex.org/W4289261760,"Exposure to air pollution (AP) is an important environmental risk factor for increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and triggering acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, there are limited data regarding the clinical impact of AP on long-term major clinical outcomes of AMI patients. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of ambient AP concentration on short-term and 1-year clinical outcomes of AMI patients.A total of 46,263 eligible patients were enrolled in the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction (KAMIR) and KAMIR-National Institutes of Health (NIH) registry from January 2006 to December 2015. We performed Cox proportional hazard regression to assess the risk of all-cause death and any-revascularization according to the annual average concentration of AP during one-year follow-up period.The assessment of the annual average of air pollutants before symptom date and all-cause death up to 30 days showed the hazard ratio (HR) of SO2 per 1 part per billion (ppb) increase was 1.084 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.016-1.157), and particulate matter with diameter of 10 microns or less (PM10) per 1 μg/m3 increase was 1.011 (95% CI: 1.002-1.021). The results of the 30-day and one-year all-cause death showed a similar trend. For SO2, the HR per 1 ppb increase was 1.084 (95% CI: 1.003-1.172), and the HR of PM10 was 1.021 (95% CI: 1.009-1.033) per 1 μg/m3 increase. We observed that SO2, CO, and PM10 were associated with an increased risk of incidence for any-revascularization up to one-year.In some air pollutants, a higher AP concentration was an environmental risk factor for poor prognosis in AMI patients up to 1 year. AMI patients and high-risk individuals need a strategy to reduce or prevent exposure to high AP concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W4289261879,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of motor neurons and skeletal muscle atrophy which is caused by ubiquitous deficiency in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Several cellular defects contribute to sensory-motor circuit pathology in SMA mice, but the underlying mechanisms have often been studied in one mouse model without validation in other available models. Here, we used Smn 2B/- mice to investigate specific behavioral, morphological, and functional aspects of SMA pathology that we previously characterized in the SMNΔ7 model. Smn 2B/- SMA mice on a pure FVB/N background display deficits in body weight gain and muscle strength with onset in the second postnatal week and median survival of 19 days. Morphological analysis revealed severe loss of proprioceptive synapses on the soma of motor neurons and prominent denervation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in axial but not distal muscles. In contrast, no evidence of cell death emerged from analysis of several distinct pools of lumbar motor neurons known to be lost in the disease. Moreover, SMA motor neurons from Smn 2B/- mice showed robust nuclear accumulation of p53 but lack of phosphorylation of serine 18 at its amino-terminal, which selectively marks degenerating motor neurons in the SMNΔ7 mouse model. These results indicate that NMJ denervation and deafferentation, but not motor neuron death, are conserved features of SMA pathology in Smn 2B/- mice."
https://openalex.org/W4289262243,"With the progression of global vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), embolic and thrombotic events (ETEs) following COVID-19 vaccination continue to be reported. To date, most reports on the type of COVID-19 vaccine and ETEs have been based on clinical trials, and other reports include a small number of cases. Further, the relationship between the type of COVID-19 vaccine and ETEs has not been clarified. It is important to elucidate trends in the development of ETEs after vaccination, which is a crucial concern for both prospective patients and healthcare providers. In this retrospective, pharmacovigilance study, we analyzed the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports from January 1, 2020 to June 18, 2021, and performed signal detection and time-to-onset analysis of adverse events by calculating the reported odds ratio (ROR) to understand ETE trends after COVID-19 vaccination based on the vaccine type. Using VAERS, we could collect data about several ETEs associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Nine adverse events associated with ETEs were reported following the administration of viral vector vaccines. The median time to ETE onset was 6 (interquartile range: 2–17) days for mRNA vaccines and 11 (interquartile range: 4–21) days for viral vector vaccines. This study suggests that VAERS aids in disequilibrium analysis to examine the association between vaccine type and ETEs after COVID-19 vaccination. Additionally, the tendency to develop ETEs and the number of days taken to develop ETEs varied depending on the type of the COVID-19 vaccine. Thus, vaccinators and healthcare providers should consider the primary diseases associated with ETEs while selecting vaccines for administration and carefully monitor patients following vaccination for potential ETEs based on the characteristics of vaccine type-specific onset period."
https://openalex.org/W4289262487,"Background Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy and multiple barriers to care in people with intellectual disability, the risk of returning to hospital after an admission for epilepsy is largely unknown. In this study, we sought to quantify and compare readmission and emergency department (ED) presentations after hospitalisation for epilepsy in people with and without intellectual disability. Methods and findings Using linked administrative datasets, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of people aged 5–64 years with an acute hospitalisation for epilepsy from 2005–2014 in New South Wales, Australia. Acute readmission and ED presentation rates within 30, 90, and 365 days of the index hospitalisation were estimated and compared between people with and without intellectual disability using modified Poisson regression. Of 13537 individuals with an index hospitalisation, 712 children and 1862 adults had intellectual disability. Readmission and ED presentation after the index hospitalisation were common in people with intellectual disability. Within 30 days, 11% of children and 15.6% of adults had an all-cause readmission and 18% of children and 23.5% of adults had an ED presentation. Over 60% of both children and adults presented to an ED within a year. Neurological, respiratory, and infectious conditions were overrepresented reasons for readmission in people with intellectual disability. Age-adjusted relative risks (RRs) within each period showed a higher risk of readmission and ED presentation in children and adults with intellectual disability than without. Most RRs remained statistically significant after controlling for covariates. The largest adjusted RRs were observed for readmission for epilepsy (RR 1.70, 95% CI: 1.42 to 2.04) and non-epilepsy related conditions (RR 1.73, 95%: CI 1.43 to 2.10) in children. Study limitations include lack of clinical data. Conclusions Increased risk of returning to acute care after epilepsy hospitalisation suggests there is a need to improve epilepsy care for people with intellectual disability. We recommend research into strategies to improve management of both seizures and comorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W4289334237,"Children in industrialized cultures typically succeed on Give-N, a test of counting ability, by age 4. On the other hand, counting appears to be learned much later in the Tsimane’, an indigenous group in the Bolivian Amazon. This study tests three hypotheses for what may cause this difference in timing: (a) Tsimane’ children may be shy in providing behavioral responses to number tasks, (b) Tsimane’ children may not memorize the verbal list of number words early in acquisition, and/or (c) home environments may not support mathematical learning in the same way as in US samples, leading Tsimane’ children to primarily acquire mathematics through formalized schooling. Our results suggest that most of our subjects are not inhibited by shyness in responding to experimental tasks. We also find that Tsimane’ children (N = 100, ages 4-11) learn the verbal list later than US children, but even upon acquiring this list, still take time to pass Give-N tasks. We find that performance in counting varies across tasks and is related to formal schooling. These results highlight the importance of formal education, including instruction in the count list, in learning the meanings of the number words."
https://openalex.org/W4289335942,"The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, is one of the most devastating insect pests with explosive reproductive potential. However, its reproductive physiological processes are not well understood. This study reports the ovarian development and associated transcriptomes of F. occidentalis. Each ovary consisted of four ovarioles, each of which contained a maximum of nine follicles in the vitellarium. The germarium consisted of several dividing cells forming a germ cell cluster, presumably consisting of oocytes and nurse cells. The nurse cells were restricted to the germarium while the subsequent follicles did not possess nurse cells or a nutritive cord, supporting the neo-panoistic ovariole usually found in thysanopteran insects. Oocyte development was completed 72 h after adult emergence (AAE). Transcriptome analysis was performed at mid (36 h AAE) and late (60 h AAE) ovarian developmental stages using RNA sequencing (RNASeq) technology. More than 120 million reads per replication were matched to ≈ 15,000 F. occidentalis genes. Almost 500 genes were differentially expressed at each of the mid and late ovarian developmental stages. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were associated with metabolic pathways along with protein and nucleic acid biosynthesis. In both ovarian developmental stages, vitellogenin, mucin, and chorion genes were highly (> 8-fold) expressed. Endocrine signals associated with ovarian development were further investigated from the DEGs. Insulin and juvenile hormone signals were upregulated only at 36 h AAE, whereas the ecdysteroid signal was highly maintained at 60 h AAE. This study reports the transcriptome associated with the ovarian development of F. occidentalis, which possesses a neo-panoistic ovariole."
https://openalex.org/W4289337912,"There are limited recent data on the characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) and the use of colonoscopy prior to CRC diagnosis among persons with IBD. We analyzed IBD-CRC characteristics, survival after IBD-CRC diagnosis and the use of colonoscopy prior to IBD-CRC diagnosis over time.We identified individuals with and without IBD from the University of Manitoba IBD Epidemiology Database and CRC from linkage to the Manitoba Cancer Registry. We compared characteristics of IBD-CRC and sporadic-CRC using logistic regression and survival after CRC diagnosis using Cox regression analysis. We assessed rate and predictors of colonoscopy use 5 years to 6 months prior to IBD-CRC.1,262 individuals with CRC were included (212 IBD-CRC). IBD was associated with an increased risk of death after CRC diagnosis in 2004-2011 (HR 1.89; 95% CI 1.25-2.88) but not in 2012-2017 (HR = 1.002; CI 0.50-2.03). In the 5 years to 6 months prior to IBD-CRC (1989-2018), 51% underwent colonoscopy, which was very similar to IBD without CRC and contrasted to 9% among sporadic CRCs. Exposure to colonoscopy pre IBD-CRC remained stable through the study period (1989-2002 OR = 1.25; CI 0.77-2.01; 2003-2011 OR = 1.21; CI 0.56-1.70; reference 2012-2018). Exposure to colonoscopy pre-IBD-CRC was not associated with improved post-CRC survival.The risk of death following CRC diagnosis is not impacted by a diagnosis of IBD in recent years. There is a very high proportion of post colonoscopy CRC among IBD-CRC, which has not changed over the years and needs detailed root-cause analysis and interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4289261780,"Thyroid cancer (TC) is one of the most common thyroid malignancies occurring worldwide, and accounts for about 1% of all the malignant tumors. It is one of the fastest growing tumor and can occur at any age, but it is more common in women. It is important to find the pathogenesis and treatment targets of TC. In this pursuit, the present study was envisaged to investigate the effective carcinogenic biological macromolecules, so as to provide a better understanding of the occurrence and development of TC. The clinical and gene expression data were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We clustered mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) into different modules by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), and calculated the correlation coefficient between the genes and clinical phenotypes. Using WGCNA, we identified the module with the highest correlation coefficient. Subsequently, by using the differential genes expression analysis to screen the differential micro-RNA (miRNA), the univariate Cox proportional hazard regression was employed to screen the hub genes related to overall survival (OS), with P &lt; 0.05 as the statistical significance threshold. Finally, we designed a hub competitive endogenous RNA(ceRNA) network of disease-associated lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs. From the results of enrichment analysis, the association of these genes could be related to the occurrence and development of TC, and these hub RNAs can be valuable prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in TC."

It is described as an IgE-mediated, Type I hypersensitivity reaction to salivary gland proteins of Culicoides insects. Together with Th2 cells, epithelial barrier cells play an important role in development of Type I hypersensitivities. In order to elucidate the role of equine keratinocytes in development of IBH, we stimulated keratinocytes derived from IBH-affected (IBH-KER) (n = 9) and healthy horses (H-KER) (n = 9) with Culicoides recombinant allergens and extract, allergic cytokine milieu (ACM) and a Toll like receptor ligand 1/2 (TLR-1/2-L) and investigated their transcriptomes. Stimulation of keratinocytes with Culicoides allergens did not induce transcriptional changes. However, when stimulated with allergic cytokine milieu, their gene expression significantly changed. We found upregulation of genes encoding for CCL5 , -11 , -20 , -27 and interleukins such as IL31 . We also found a strong downregulation of genes such as SCEL and KRT16 involved in the formation of epithelial barrier. Following stimulation with TLR-1/2-L, keratinocytes significantly upregulated expression of genes affecting Toll like receptor and NOD-receptor signaling pathway as well as NF-kappa B signaling pathway, among others. The transcriptomes of IBH-KER and H-KER were very similar: without stimulations they only differed in one gene ( CTSL) ; following stimulation with allergic cytokine milieu we found only 23 differentially expressed genes (e.g. CXCL10 and 11 ) and following stimulation with TLR-1/2-L they only differed by expression of seven genes. Our data suggests that keratinocytes contribute to the innate immune response and are able to elicit responses to different stimuli, possibly playing a role in the pathogenesis of IBH."

The Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT) is the most used test to assess hand dexterity in clinical practice but presents limitations. A new graphic test to enhance objective evaluation of the of the dominant hand dexterity is proposed. The task consists in drawing a continuous line in paths composed by a part with multiple orthogonal changes of direction (‘meander’), and a second part derived from the Archimedean spiral (‘spiral’). The test was validated in 200 healthy controls and 93 neurological patients. 48 patients performed also the NHPT. Several parameters were analyzed, among which total time, total length, number of touches and number of crossings. Healthy subjects display statistically significant differences with respect to pathological subjects in the case of total time, number of touches, and number of crossings (p&lt;0.001), but not in the case of total length (p = 0.27) needed to complete the second sheet. Moreover, healthy controls display a learning effect, the time needed to complete the second sheet was significantly lower than for the first sheet (p&lt;0.001), and an inverse correlation with age was observed (r = 0.56, p&lt;0.001). The comparison between the NHPT and the new test showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.71, p&lt;0.001) whereas touches and crossing a weak positive one (r = 0.35, p = 0.01). The new test distinguishes between a slow but precise performance and a fast but imprecise performance, thus providing additional information with respect to NHPT."

https://openalex.org/W4289262218,"Francisella tularensis is an extremely infectious pathogen and a category A bioterrorism agent. It causes the highly contagious zoonosis, Tularemia. Currently, FDA approved vaccines against tularemia are unavailable. F. tularensis outer membrane protein A (FopA) is a well-studied virulence determinant and protective antigen against tularemia. It is a major outer membrane protein (Omp) of F. tularensis. However, FopA-based therapeutic intervention is hindered due to lack of complete structural information for membrane localized mature FopA. In our study, we established recombinant expression, monodisperse purification, crystallization and X-ray diffraction (~6.5 Å) of membrane localized mature FopA. Further, we performed bioinformatics and biophysical experiments to unveil its structural organization in the outer membrane. FopA consists of 393 amino acids and has less than 40% sequence identity to known bacterial Omps. Using comprehensive sequence alignments and structure predictions together with existing partial structural information, we propose a two-domain organization for FopA. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and heat modifiability assay confirmed FopA has a β-barrel domain consistent with alphafold2's prediction of an eight stranded β-barrel at the N-terminus. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed FopA purified in detergent micelles is predominantly dimeric. Molecular density derived from SAXS at 31 Å shows putative dimeric N-terminal β-barrels surrounded by detergent corona and connected to C-terminal domains via flexible linker. Disorder analysis predicts N- and C-terminal domains are interspersed by a long intrinsically disordered region and alphafold2 predicts this region to be largely unstructured. Taken together, we propose a dimeric, two-domain organization of FopA in the outer membrane: the N-terminal β-barrel is membrane embedded, provides dimerization interface and tethers to membrane extrinsic C-terminal domain via long flexible linker. Structure determination of membrane localized mature FopA is essential to understand its role in pathogenesis and develop anti-tularemia therapeutics. Our results pave the way towards it."

In Ethiopia, it's reported that the majority of health care providers had poor knowledge and practice of preconception care. The institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 359 obstetric care providers to assess knowledge, attitude, and practice of preconception care in West Shoa Zone, Ethiopia. A stratified, simple random sampling technique selected five hospitals, 46 health centers, and study participants. Pretested and structured questionnaires were used to collect data. Data were entered into Epidata and exported to SPSS for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were employed to identify an association between the independent predictors and the outcome variables. In this study, 173(48.2%) and 124(34.5%) of the obstetric care providers had good knowledge and practice of preconception care, respectively. Two-thirds 255(71%) of providers had a favorable attitude toward preconception care. The odds of having good knowledge were higher among Midwives' providers [AOR: 2.03, 95%CI: 1.09-3.77] and had training on HIV testing [AOR: 3.5, 95%CI: 1.9-6.4]. The presence of a library [AOR: 1.7, 95%CI: 1.04-2.85] and internet access [AOR: 3.4, 95%CI: 2.0-5.8] in working health facility had a higher odds of good knowledge about preconception. Degree and above holders [AOR: 3.1, 95%CI: 1.5-6.1] also had higher odds of good preconception knowledge than diploma holders. Similarly, the odds of having good practice of preconception care were higher among health care providers: who did screening for reproductive life plans [AOR: 3.7, 95%CI:1.8-7.4], worked in maternity and child health unit [AOR:4.2,95%CI:2.0-8.6], perceive all health facilities should give preconception care services [AOR:2.3,95%CI:1.2-4.3], and perceive all health care providers should provide preconception services [AOR:3.0, 95%CI: 1.7-5.5]. This study found that more than half of obstetric care providers' had poor knowledge, favorable attitude, and poor practice of preconception care. Provision of training, carrier development, and installation of internet and library services should be enhanced."

Correct identification of materials from C . pilosula subsp. tangshen is critical to ensure the efficacy and safety of the associated medicines. Traditional DNA molecular markers could distinguish Codonopsis species well, so we need to develop super or specific molecular markers. In this study, we reported the plastome of Codonopsis pilosula subsp. tangshen (Oliv.) D.Y. Hong conducted phylogenomic and comparative analyses in the Codonopsis genus for the first time. The entire length of the Codonopsis pilosula subsp. tangshen plastome was 170,672 bp. There were 108 genes in the plastome, including 76 protein-coding genes, 28 transfer RNA (tRNA), and four ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Comparative analysis indicated that Codonopsis pilosula subsp. tangshen had an unusual large inversion in the large single-copy (LSC) region compared with the other three Codonopsis species. And there were two dispersed repeat sequences at both ends of the inverted regions, which might mediate the generation of this inversion. We found five hypervariable regions among the four Codonopsis species. PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing experiments demonstrated that two hypervariable regions could distinguish three medicinal Codonopsis species. Results obtained from this study will support taxonomic classification, discrimination, and molecular evolutionary studies of Codonopsis species."
https://openalex.org/W4289315027,"As part of World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 updated antenatal care (ANC) guidelines routine ultrasonography is recommended, including to detect congenital anomalies. The Ghana Health Service (GHS) developed an in-service midwifery ultrasound training course in 2017, which includes fetal anomaly detection. Training rollout has been very limited. We sought to determine proportions of anomalies among neonates presenting to Tamale Teaching Hospital (TTH) that should be prenatally detectable by course-trained midwives in order to determine training program potential utility.We analyzed data from a registry of neonates admitted to TTH with congenital anomaly diagnoses in 2016. We classified ultrasonographic detectability of anomalies at ≤13 and 14-23 weeks gestation, based on GHS course content and literature review. Secondary analysis included 2011-2015 retrospective chart review data.Eighty-five neonates with congenital anomalies were admitted to TTH in 2016. Seventy-three (86%) mothers received ≥1 ANC visit; 47 (55%) had at least one prenatal ultrasound, but only three (6%) were interpreted as abnormal. Sixteen (19%) and 26 (31%) of the anomalies should be readily detectable by course-trained midwives at ≤13 and 14-23 weeks gestation, respectively. When the 161 anomalies from 2011-2015 were also analyzed, 52 (21%) and 105 (43%) should be readily detectable at ≤13 and 14-23 weeks gestation, respectively. ""Optimal conditions"" (state-of-the-art equipment by ultrasonography-trained physicians) should readily identify 53 (22%) and 115 (47%) of the anomalies at ≤13 and 14-23 weeks gestation, respectively.Training Ghanaian midwives could substantially increase second trimester anomaly detection, potentially at proportions nearing highly resourced settings. Our data also highlight the need for refinement of the WHO antenatal ultrasonography recommendation for a scan before 24 weeks gestation for multiple purposes. Gestational dating accuracy requires first trimester scanning while fetal anomaly detection is more accurate during second trimester. Further specification will enhance guideline utility."

https://openalex.org/W4289337222,"Atlantoaxial instability (AAI) in dogs refers to abnormal motion at the C1–C2 articulation due to congenital or developmental anomalies. Surgical treatment options for AAI include dorsal and ventral stabilization techniques. Ventral stabilization techniques commonly utilize transarticular and vertebral body screws or pins. However, accurate screw insertion into the vertebrae of C1 and C2 is difficult because of the narrow safety corridors. This study included 10 mixed dogs, 1 Pomeranian, and 1 Shih-Tzu cadaver. All dogs weighed &lt;10 kg. Each specimen was scanned using computed tomography (CT) from the head to the 7th cervical vertebrae. This study used 12 bone models and 6 patient-specific drill guides. Bone models were made using CT images and drill guides were created through a CAD (computer-aided design) program. A total of six cortical screws were used for each specimen. Two screws were placed at each of the C1, C2 cranial, and C2 caudal positions. Postoperative CT images of the cervical region were obtained. The degree of cortex breaching and angle and bicortical status of each screw was evaluated. The number of screws that did not penetrate the vertebral canal was higher in the guided group (33/36, 92%) than in the control group (20/36, 56%) (P = 0.003). The screw angles were more similar to the reference angle compared to the control group. The number of bicortically applied screws in the control group was 28/36 (78%) compared to 34/36 (94%) in the guided group. Differences between the preoperative plan and the length of the applied screw at the C1 and C2 caudal positions were determined by comparing the screw lengths in the guide group. The study results demonstrated that the use of a patient-specific 3D-printed drill guide for AAI ventral stabilization can improve the accuracy of the surgery. The use of rehearsal using bone models and a drilling guide may improve screw insertion accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W4289341485,"Detailed knowledge about biodiversity distribution is critical for monitoring the biological effects of global change processes. Biodiversity knowledge gaps hamper the monitoring of conservation trends and they are especially evident in the desert biome. Mauritania constitutes a remarkable example on how remoteness and regional insecurity affect current knowledge gaps. Mammals remain one of the least studied groups in this country, without a concerted species checklist, the mapping of regions concentrating mammal diversity, or a national assessment of their conservation status. This work assessed the diversity, distribution, and conservation of land mammals in Mauritania. A total of 6,718 published and original observations were assembled in a spatial database and used to update the occurrence status, distribution area, and conservation status. The updated taxonomic list comprises 107 species, including 93 extant, 12 Regionally Extinct, and 2 Extinct in the Wild. Mapping of species distributions allowed locating concentrations of extant mammal species richness in coastal areas, along the Senegal River valley, and in mountain plateaus. Recent regional extinction of large-sized Artiodactyla and Carnivora has been very high (11% extinct species). From the extant mammals, 11% are threatened, including flagship species (e.g., Addax nasomaculatus and Panthera pardus ). Species richness is poorly represented by the current protected areas. Despite the strong advances made, 23% of species categorise as Data Deficient. Persisting systematics and distribution uncertainties require further research. Field surveys in currently unexplored areas (northern and south-eastern regions) are urgently needed to increase knowledge about threatened mammals. The long-term conservation of land mammals in Mauritania is embedded in a complex web of socioeconomic and environmental factors that call for collaborative action and investment in sustainable human development. The current work sets the baseline for the future development of detailed research studies and to address the general challenges faced by mammals and biodiversity in the country."
https://openalex.org/W4289341750,"This paper examines the experiences of refugees in a developing country during its first COVID-19 lockdown by utilizing a two-stage qualitative data analysis of 39 interviews with refugees and asylum-seekers. We find that their experiences during the lockdown are shaped by identity, trauma and help from external parties–such as community leaders and local non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Experiences during the pandemic in turn moderate the relationship between policy changes and trust in domestic authority figures, which consequently affects attitudes towards and compliance with public health measures put in place to contain the pandemic. We then explore the role of identity in refugees’ pandemic experiences by comparing the differences between two refugee groups (Syrians and Rohingyas), validating them by utilizing comparative thematic analysis. Finally, the paper presents policy implications for crisis response in developing countries by suggesting improvements that can be made on the ground regarding the delivery of aid and assistance to vulnerable groups."
https://openalex.org/W4289342531,"Background Early identification of patients at risk of developing diabetic kidney disease or rapid renal decline is imperative for appropriate patient management, but traditional methods of predicting renal decline are limited. Objective This study evaluated the impact of PromarkerD, a biomarker-based blood test predicting the risk of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and rapid renal decline. Methods Conjoint analysis clarified the importance of PromarkerD and other patient attributes to physician decisions for type 2 diabetes patients. Forty-two patient profiles were generated, with varying levels of albuminuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), age, and PromarkerD result. A web-based survey asked each physician to make monitoring/treatment decisions about eight randomly selected profiles. Data were analyzed using multivariable logit models. Results Two hundred three primary care physicians and 197 endocrinologists completed the survey. PromarkerD result was most important for increasing the frequency of risk factor monitoring. PromarkerD was second to HbA1c in importance for deciding to prescribe sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2s) with a DKD indication, second to blood pressure for increasing the dose of lisinopril, and second to eGFR for replacing ibuprofen with a non-nephrotoxic medication. Compared with no PromarkerD results, a high-risk PromarkerD result was associated with significantly higher odds of increasing monitoring frequency (odds ratio [OR]: 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.90–3.45), prescribing SGLT2s (OR: 1.98 [1.56–2.52]), increasing lisinopril dose (OR: 1.48 [1.17–1.87]), and replacing ibuprofen (OR: 1.78 [1.32–2.40]). A low-risk PromarkerD result was associated with significantly lower odds of increasing monitoring frequency (OR: 0.48 [0.37–0.64]), prescribing SGLT2s (OR: 0.70 [0.56–0.88]), and replacing ibuprofen (OR: 0.75 [0.57–0.99]). Conclusion PromarkerD could increase adoption of renoprotective interventions in patients at high risk for renal decline and lower the likelihood of aggressive treatment in those at low risk. Further studies are needed to assess patient outcomes with PromarkerD in real-world practice."

https://openalex.org/W4289261628,"Microblog has become the ""first scenario"" under which the public learn about the epidemic situation and express their opinions. Public sentiment mining based on microblog data can provide a reference for the government's information disclosure, public sentiment guidance and formulation of epidemic prevention and control policy. In this paper, about 200,000 pieces of text data were collected from Jan. 1 to Feb. 26, 2020 from Sina Weibo, which is the most popular microblog website in China. And a public sentiment analysis framework suitable for Chinese-language scenarios was proposed. In this framework, a sentiment dictionary suitable for Chinese-language scenarios was constructed, and Baidu's Sentiment Analysis API was used to calculate the public sentiment indexes. Then, an analysis on the correlation between the public sentiment indexes and the COVID-19 case indicators was made. It was discovered that there is a high correlation between public sentiments and incidence trends, in which negative sentiment is of statistical significance for the prediction of epidemic development. To further explore the source of public negative sentiment, the topics of the public negative sentiment on Weibo was analyzed, and 20 topics in five categories were got. It is found that there is a strong linkage between the hot spots of public concern and the epidemic prevention and control policies. If the policies cover the hot spots of public concern in a timely and effective manner, the public negative sentiment will be effectively alleviated. The analytical framework proposed in this paper also applies to the public sentiment analysis and policy making for other major public events."
https://openalex.org/W4289261788,"Background Increased coverage of interventions have been advocated to reduce under-five mortality. However, Ghana failed to achieve the Millennium Development Goal on child survival in 2015 despite improved coverage levels of some child health interventions. Therefore, there is the need to determine which interventions contributed the most to mortality reduction and those that can further rapidly reduce mortality to inform the prioritization of the scale-up of interventions. Materials and methods Deterministic mathematical modeling was done using Lives Saved and Missed Opportunity Tools. Secondary data was used, and the period of the evaluation was between 2008 and 2014. Some of the interventions assessed were complementary feeding, skilled delivery, and rotavirus vaccine. Results A total of 48,084 lives were saved from changes in coverage of interventions and a reduction in the prevalence of stunting and wasting. Reduction in wasting prevalence saved 10,372(21.6%) lives, insecticide-treated net/indoor residual spraying 6,437(13.4%) lives saved, reduction in stunting 4,315(9%) lives saved and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACTs) 4,325(9.0%) lives saved. If coverage levels of interventions in 2014 were scaled up to 90% in 2015, among neonates, full supportive care for prematurity (5,435 lives saved), full supportive care for neonatal sepsis/pneumonia (3,002 lives saved), and assisted vaginal delivery (2,163 lives saved), would have saved the most lives among neonates, while ACTs (4,925 lives saved), oral rehydration salts (ORS) (2,056 lives saved), and antibiotics for the treatment of pneumonia (1,805 lives saved) would have made the most impact on lives saved among children 1–59 months. Lastly, if all the interventions were at 100% coverage in 2014, the under-five mortality rate would have been 40.1 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2014. Discussion The state of the package of interventions will likely not lead to rapid mortality reduction. Coverage and quality of childbirth-related interventions should be increased. Additionally, avenues to further reduce stunting and wasting, including increased breastfeeding and complementary feeding, will be beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W4289261862,"Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) complicates advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and causes skeletal and other morbidity. In animal models of CKD, SHPT was prevented and reversed by reduction of dietary phosphate in proportion to GFR, but the phenomena underlying these observations are not understood. The tradeoff-in-the-nephron hypothesis states that as GFR falls, the phosphate concentration in the distal convoluted tubule ([P]DCT]) rises, reduces the ionized calcium concentration in that segment ([Ca++]DCT), and thereby induces increased secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) to maintain normal calcium reabsorption. In patients with CKD, we previously documented correlations between [PTH] and phosphate excreted per volume of filtrate (EP/Ccr), a surrogate for [P]DCT. In the present investigation, we estimated [P]DCT from physiologic considerations and measurements of phosphaturia, and sought evidence for a specific chemical phenomenon by which increased [P]DCT could lower [Ca++]DCT and raise [PTH].We studied 28 patients (""CKD"") with eGFR of 14-49 mL/min/1.73m2 (mean 29.9 ± 9.5) and 27 controls (""CTRL"") with eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73m2 (mean 86.2 ± 10.2). In each subject, total [Ca]DCT and [P]DCT were deduced from relevant laboratory data. The Joint Expert Speciation System (JESS) was used to calculate [Ca++]DCT and concentrations of related chemical species under the assumption that a solid phase of amorphous calcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2 (am., s.)) could precipitate. Regressions of [PTH] on eGFR, [P]DCT, and [Ca++]DCT were then examined. At filtrate pH of 6.8 and 7.0, [P]DCT was found to be the sole determinant of [Ca++]DCT, and precipitation of Ca3(PO4)2 (am., s.) appeared to mediate this result. At pH 6.6, total [Ca]DCT was the principal determinant of [Ca++]DCT, [P]DCT was a minor determinant, and precipitation of Ca3(PO4)2 (am., s.) was predicted in no CKD and five CTRL. In CKD, at all three pH values, [PTH] varied directly with [P]DCT and inversely with [Ca++]DCT, and a reduced [Ca++]DCT was identified at which [PTH] rose unequivocally. Relationships of [PTH] to [Ca++]DCT and to eGFR resembled each other closely.As [P]DCT increases, chemical speciation calculations predict reduction of [Ca++]DCT through precipitation of Ca3(PO4)2 (am., s.). [PTH] appears to rise unequivocally if [Ca++]DCT falls sufficiently. These results support the tradeoff-in-the-nephron hypothesis, and they explain why proportional phosphate restriction prevented and reversed SHPT in experimental CKD. Whether equally stringent treatment can be as efficacious in humans warrants investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4289261955,"Previous studies suggest a link between future thinking and prosocial behaviors. However, this association is not fully understood at state and trait level. The present study tested whether a brief future thinking induction promoted helping behavior in an unrelated task. In addition, the relation between mental time travel and prosocial behaviors in daily life was tested with questionnaire data. Forty-eight participants filled in questionnaires and were asked to think about the future for one minute or to name animals for one minute (control condition) before playing the Zurich Prosocial Game (a measure of helping behavior). Results revealed that participants in the future thinking condition helped significantly more than participants in the control condition. Moreover, questionnaire data showed that dispositional and positive orientation toward the future and the past was significantly associated with self-reported prosocial behaviors. The present findings suggest that thinking about the future in general has positive transfer effects on subsequent prosocial behavior and that people who think more about the past or future in a positive way engage more in prosocial behavior."

Data were collected by interview, analysis of maternal blood samples and measurement of maternal and foetal parameters. Total calcaemia and albuminaemia were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, while iCa and pH were measured using ion-selective potentiometry. Associations were measured using the odds ratio in simple and multiple logistic regression.The prevalence of low birth weight, macrosomia, and hypertension in pregnancy was 6.27 [4.97-7.89]%, 4.78 [3.65-7.89]%, 10.24 [8.57-12.20]%, respectively. Following multiple logistic regression, women with iCa levels ≤ 1.31mmol/L had significantly increased odds of hypertension in pregnancy (AOR = 2.47 [1.63-3.74], p-value = 0.000), having babies with low birth weight (AOR = 2.02[1.33-3.61], p-value = 0.002), low birth length (AOR = 2.00 [1.34-2.99], p-value = 0.001), low brachial circumference (AOR = 1.41[1.10-1.81], p-value = 0.007), first minute Apgar score < 7 (AOR = 3.08[1.70-5.59], p-value = 0.000) and fifth minute Apgar score < 7 (AOR = 2.86[1.32-6.16], p-value = 0.007). Ionised calcaemia had no significant association with maternal body mass index immediately after birth and the head circumference of the baby. Total calcaemia was found to have no significant association with any of the selected outcomes, while women with total albuminaemia ≤ 30mg/L had significantly higher odds of having babies with low birth weight (AOR = 3.40[1.96-5.91], p-value = 0.000), and Apgar scores < 7 at the first (AOR = 2.07[1.16-3.70], p-value = 0.013). Calcium supplementation showed no significant association with any of the selected outcomes except for the first (OR = 0.42[0.24-0.72], p-value = 0.002) and fifth minute Apgar score (OR = 0.25[0.12-0.50], p-value = 0.000).The prevalence of low birth weight, macrosomia, and hypertension in pregnancy was 6.27 [4.97-7.89]%, 4.78 [3.65-7.89]%, 10.24 [8.57-12.20]%, respectively. Maternal iCa levels ≤ 1.31mmol/L significantly increase the odds of having babies with low birth weight, low birth length, low brachial circumference at birth, low Apgar scores at the first and fifth minutes and maternal hypertension in pregnancy. Low maternal albuminaemia is significantly associated with low birth weight, and Apgar score < 7 at the first minute. None f the selected maternofoetal outcomes directly depend on total calcaemia, given that none of the associations was statistically significant. Even though iCa levels remain relatively normal in normal pregnancies, it remains the strongest predictor of foetal outcomes. Calcium supplementation significantly improves the Apgar scores at the first and fifth minute. Routine pregnancy follow-up should include evaluating maternal calcaemic states, particularly the ionised fraction, to detect the low-normal concentrations likely to impact maternal and foetal outcomes. Normal iCa levels for pregnant women need revisiting."
https://openalex.org/W4289262028,"Objective In a resource-constrained setting like Bangladesh, effective patient-provider communication is critical to the delivery of maternal healthcare services. Using communication accommodation theory, this study tried to understand how providers perceive, engage, and accommodate patients’ needs in maternity wards. Methods This qualitative exploratory study used a semi-structured interview guide to conduct in-depth face-to-face interviews of ten healthcare providers in two government-funded public health facilities in Bangladesh. The interview data were analyzed using MAXQDA 2020 software. Results The thematic analyses revealed that nurses and midwives faced conceivable neglect from patients and their attendees due to possible service and facility constraints, indicating their low status and control within the service operation. Despite efforts to address patients’ emotional and psychological concerns, providers appear to avoid (divergence strategy) confronting patients and their irate visitors. Unimodal convergence emerged when providers accepted patients’ arguments about the systematic inadequacy of service facilities. Providers have employed interpretability tactics to communicate medical opinions and applied nonverbal cues where necessary. Conclusion A lack of open communication between healthcare providers and patients necessitated various forms of accommodation. Integrated strategies addressing service restrictions and initiatives fostering patient understanding and cooperation may improve patient-provider communication."
https://openalex.org/W4289262235,"This paper examined the association between young mothers’ attitudes towards domestic violence and four or more antenatal care (ANC) and health-center-based delivery service utilization using two cross-sectional waves of the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys (2014 and 2018) data. We carried out a multilevel logistic regression analysis. Findings show that a strong cluster variation exists in four or more ANC and health-center-based delivery service utilization. Although the utilization of four or more ANC and health-center-based delivery services has increased over the years, it is far behind the targets of SDGs, particularly for young mothers with justified attitudes towards domestic violence. Extension of maternity allowance coverage and motivational programs are important policy recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W4289262300,"There is limited evidence on labour exploitation's impact on migrant health. This population is, however, often employed in manual low-skilled jobs known for poor labour conditions and exploitation risks. The lack of a common conceptualisation of labour exploitation in health research impedes the development of research measuring its effects on migrant health and, ultimately, our understanding of migrants' health needs.To develop an operational conceptual framework of labour exploitation focusing on migrant workers in manual low-skilled jobs.Non-probabilistic sampling was used to recruit multidisciplinary experts on labour exploitation. An online Group Concept Mapping (GCM) was conducted. Experts: 1) generated statements describing the concept 'labour exploitation' focusing on migrants working in manual low-skilled jobs; 2) sorted generated statements into groups reflecting common themes; and 3) rated them according to their importance in characterising a situation as migrant labour exploitation. Multidimensional Scaling and Cluster Analysis were used to produce an operational framework detailing the concept content (dimensions, statements, and corresponding averaged rating).Thirty-two experts sorted and rated 96 statements according to their relative importance (1 ""relatively unimportant"" to 5 ""extremely important""). The operational framework consists of four key dimensions of migrant labour exploitation, distributed along a continuum of severity revealed by the rating: 'Shelter and personal security' (rating: 4.47); 'Finance and migration' (4.15); 'Health and safety' (3.96); and 'Social and legal protection' (3.71).This study is the first to both generate an empirical operational framework of migrant labour exploitation, and demonstrate the existence of a ""continuum from decent work to forced labour"". The framework content can be operationalised to measure labour exploitation. It paves the way to better understand how different levels of exploitation affect migrant workers' health for global policymakers, health researchers, and professionals working in the field of migrant exploitation."
https://openalex.org/W4289313663,"Point of care testing (POCT) is an analytical test performed by a healthcare professional outside of a conventional laboratory. The global POCT market was valued at US$ 23.16 billion in 2016 and is forecasted to grow to US$ 36.96 billion in 2021. This upward trend for POCT has increased workload for pathology departments who manage POCT. This research aims to characterize and analyse the teaching and training of POCT at United Kingdom (UK) universities on Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS) accredited biomedical science degrees, and at UK hospital laboratories. A freedom of information (FOI) request was sent in 2018 to all 52 UK universities with an accredited IBMS Biomedical science degree to request information on teaching of POCT, with a 100% response rate. Further FOI requests were sent to all National Health Service (NHS) hospital pathology departments in the UK, regarding POCT training provided to trainee Biomedical scientists, with a 97% response rate. Twelve of the degrees contained no POCT teaching, with a further 9 having no specific POCT teaching. Sixty-six laboratories confirmed that there was no POCT training. The university teaching hours varied between 0 and 35 hours. The median time spent teaching POCT at university was 2 hours. The laboratory teaching hours varied between 0 and 450 hours The median time spent teaching POCT in hospital laboratories was 3 hours. A content analysis of the learning outcomes provided by 29 universities showed that only 61% (84/137) were measurable and 26% (36/137) of the learning outcomes used action verbs that have previously been listed to be avoided in learning outcome writing. Only 9% (13/137) of outcomes specifically described POCT, with 8 of these being measurable. The findings demonstrate that although this is a commonly required skill for biomedical scientists, there is a clear lack of POCT teaching and training in the UK. To meet the new Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) guidelines, but most importantly to ensure the workforce is fit for the needs of the current healthcare system, the quality and quantity of POCT teaching and training needs to improve."
https://openalex.org/W4289313717,"This study examined the association between height and the risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), and whether this association was mediated or moderated by early pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) that are known independent risk factors for GDM. Data of a retrospective cohort of pregnant women (N = 1,945) were extracted from antenatal clinic cards. The cut-off values of height in relation to risk of GDM were identified using receiver operating characteristic analysis and four categories of height were derived: &lt; 150 cm, 150–155 cm, 156–160 cm, and &gt; 160cm. Mediation analysis was performed using the Preacher and Hayes bootstrapping method while the moderation effect was tested with multiple regression analysis with interaction terms. Although there was no mediation effect of BMI and GWG on the association between height and risk of GDM, both factors moderated this association with a significant association between shorter height and risk of GDM was observed in overweight / obese women (height &lt; 150 cm: AOR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.03–2.44; height 156–160 cm: AOR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.03–2.14). Overweight / obese women with height &lt; 150 cm and excessive GWG at the end of the second trimester (AOR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.45–4.17) had significantly higher risk of GDM than those without these factors. Short stature (&lt; 150 cm) was significantly associated with GDM risk among OW/OB women with excessive gestational weight gain at the end of second trimester. This finding underscores the importance of maintaining a healthy BMI during reproductive age and gaining weight in recommended range during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W4289334533,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia contains an operon comprising mfsB and mfsC, which encode membrane transporters in the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). The results of the topological analysis predicted that both MfsB and MfsC possess 12 transmembrane helices with the N- and C-termini located inside the cells. The deletion of mfsC increased the susceptibility to diamide, a chemical oxidizing agent, but not to antibiotics and oxidative stress-generating substances relative to wild-type K279a. Moreover, no altered phenotype was observed against all tested substances for the ΔmfsB mutant. The results of the expression analysis revealed that the mfsBC expression was significantly induced by exposure to diamide. The diamide-induced gene expression was mediated by DitR, a TetR-type transcriptional regulator encoded by smlt0547. A constitutively high expression of mfsC in the ditR mutant indicated that DitR acts as a transcriptional repressor of mfsBC under physiological conditions. Purified DitR was bound to three sites spanning from position + 21 to -57, corresponding to the putative mfsBC promoter sequence, thereby interfering with the binding of RNA polymerase. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays illustrated that the treatment of purified DitR with diamide caused the release of DitR from the mfsBC promoter region, and the diamide sensing mechanism of DitR required two conserved cysteine residues, Cys92 and Cys127. This suggests that exposure to diamide can oxidize DitR through the oxidation of cysteine residues, leading to its release from the promoter, thus allowing mfsBC transcription. Overall, MfsC and DitR play a role in adaptive resistance against the diamide of S. maltophilia."
https://openalex.org/W4289335672,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows obtaining anatomical and functional information of the brain in the same subject at different times. Manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) uses manganese ions to identify brain activity, although in high doses it might produce neurotoxic effects. Our aims were to identify a manganese dose that does not affect motivated behaviors such as sexual behavior, running wheel and the rotarod test. The second goal was to determine the optimal dose of chloride manganese (MnCl 2 ) that will allow us to evaluate activation of brain regions after females mated controlling (pacing) the sexual interaction. To achieve that, two experiments were performed. In experiment 1 we evaluated the effects of two doses of MnCl 2 , 8 and 16 mg/kg. Subjects were injected with one of the doses of MnCl 2 24 hours before the test on sessions 1, 5 and 10 and immediately thereafter scanned. Female sexual behavior, running wheel and the rotarod were evaluated once a week for 10 weeks. In experiment 2 we followed a similar procedure, but females paced the sexual interaction once a week for 10 weeks and were injected with one of the doses of MnCl 2 24 hours before the test and immediately thereafter scanned on sessions 1, 5 and 10. The results of experiment 1 show that neither dose of MnCl 2 induces alterations on sexual behavior, running wheel and rotarod. Experiment 2 demonstrated that MEMRI allow us to detect activation of different brain regions after sexual behavior, including the olfactory bulb (OB), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), the amygdala (AMG), the medial preoptic area (MPOA), the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), the striatum (STR) and the hippocampus (Hipp) allowing the identification of changes in brain circuits activated by sexual behavior. The socio sexual circuit showed a higher signal intensity on session 5 than the reward circuit and the control groups indicating that even with sexual experience the activation of the reward circuit requires the activation of the socio sexual circuit. Our study demonstrates that MEMRI can be used repeatedly in the same subject to evaluate the activation of brain circuits after motivated behaviors and how can this activation change with experience."
https://openalex.org/W4289337905,"The purpose of this study was to explore North American adult beliefs and perspectives on how young children develop early cognitive, language, and word learning skills, and how these beliefs vary depending on experience and expertise. While there is a body of literature that uses questionnaires to assess beliefs about how children develop, traditional rating scales (e.g., Likert scales) may miss the nuances of how people think about child development. Thus, we ran six in-person focus groups, differing in parenthood status and expertise, to learn how various adults talk and reason about cognitive development. Questions throughout the focus group sessions were aimed at determining the quality and origins of participants' beliefs. Four main patterns emerged: developmental psychologists who were also parents were the most certain in their statements, parents used more anecdotes than non-parents, non-parents were more likely to talk about development as controllable compared to parents, and participants in all groups frequently referred to environment-based influences on development. Together, the results suggest that many adults are uncertain about how children develop and that there are differences in how parents and non-parents reason about development. These findings have implications for how we interpret past survey results and motivate future studies about how experience with children changes adult beliefs and reasoning about child development."
https://openalex.org/W4289343325,"Background Centrifugal-flow pumps are novel treatment options for patients with advanced heart failure (HF). This study estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of centrifugal-flow pumps for patients with advanced HF in Argentina. Methods Two Markov models were developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a centrifugal-flow pump as destination therapy (DT) in patients with contraindication for heart transplantation, and as bridge-to-transplant (BTT), with a lifetime horizon using the third-party payer Social Security (SS) and Private Sector (PS) perspectives. Clinical, epidemiological, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) parameters were retrieved from the literature. Direct medical costs were estimated through a micro-costing approach (exchange rate USD 1 = ARS 59.95). Results The centrifugal-flow pump as a DT increased the per patient QALYs by 3.5 and costs by ARS 8.1 million in both the SS and PS, with an ICER of ARS 2.3 million per QALY. Corresponding values for a centrifugal-flow pump as BTT were 0.74 QALYs and more than ARS 8 million, yielding ICERs of ARS 11 million per QALY (highly dependent on waiting times). For the 1, 3, and 5 GDP per QALY thresholds, the probability of a centrifugal-flow pump to be cost-effective for DT/BTT was around 2%/0%, 40%/0%, and 80%/1%, respectively. Conclusion The centrifugal-flow pump prolongs life and improves the quality of life at significantly higher costs. As in Argentina there is no current explicit cost-effectiveness threshold, the final decision on reimbursement will depend on the willingness to pay in each subsector. Nevertheless, the centrifugal-flow pump as a DT was more cost-effective than as a BTT."
https://openalex.org/W4289346396,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) remains one of the most significant causes of death and a major public health problem in the community. As a result, the aim of this study was to determine magnitude of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, its drug resistance, and associated factors among presumptive tuberculosis (TB) patients at St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.Cross-sectional study was conducted at St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from January to July 2019. Demographic and clinical data were collected by structured questionnaire through face to face interview. Using microscopic examination and GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay and culturing in the Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) culture media, we collected and analyzed both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary clinical samples. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 23. Binary logistic regression was done to identify the associated risk factors and p-value less than 0.05 was taken as significant association.Of the total 436 respondents, 223(51%) were male. The mean ±SD age of the participants was 38±17years. Overall, 27/436(6.2%) of the participants had confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis using the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay and LJ culture media, and two isolates were resistant to RIF and one to INH medication, with two (0.5%) being MDR-TB. MTB infection was associated with previous TB contact history, patient weight loss, and CD4+ T-cell counts of 200-350/mm3 of blood.The magnitude of M. tuberculosis and MDR-TB in this study underscores the need for improved early case detection and management of MDR-TB in order to reduce transmission and patient suffering."
