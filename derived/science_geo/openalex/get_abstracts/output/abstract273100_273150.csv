https://openalex.org/W2079835514,Some effects of androgenic substances in the rat are discussed. The effect of male hormone extracts on the testes of hypophysectomized rats was studied. The results indicated not only that the sperm possessed the capacity for fertilization but also that male hormone extracts can restore libido in hypophysectomized animals. The effect of synthetic androgenic substances on the hypophysis mammary gland and uterus was studied in spayed rats. Androsterone androstanediol or androstenedione was injected into spayed virgin rats (.5 of 1 mg/day) fo r 30 days beginning the day after ovariectomy. 1 mg androstanediol and androstenedione suppressed the castration changes in the hypophysis and induced degranulation 1 mg androsterone partially prevented castration changes and androstenediol revealed no effect. 1 mg of androstanediol showed a remarkable proliferation of the mammary glands 1 mg androstenedione was similar but less so and androsterone revealed no effect. 1 mg androstanediol caused an increase in uteri-connective tissue and smooth muscle androstenedione caused slight stimulation and androsterone revealed no effect.

https://openalex.org/W2984642517,"In response to Paul R. Gross's illuminating discussion of maternal inheritance and the cloning hysteria (Letters, 14 Apr., p. 126), Mitchel Sayare (Letters, 5 May, p. 486) contends that a literal replica of an individual would result . . if the donor of the somatic nucleus were the same person as the source of the ovum. On a date so close to Mother's Day, the facts must be set straight. A truly identical copy of the donor of a nucleus would need to have developed under the influence of egg cytoplasm identical to that which influenced the donor's development. Therefore, the production of exact copies is not limited to persons capable of oogenesis, but to those with living mothers. Since the size of a woman's oocyte pool declines progressively from a maximum attained before birth, and since human oocytes apparently undergo senescence, as indicated by the increase in chromosomal nondisjunction with age, the candidates for exact duplication may be further restricted to those with young mothers, a category which presumably excludes millionaires in their 60's.
