https://openalex.org/W2804560798,"Astrocytes respond to neuronal activity and were shown to be necessary for plasticity and memory. To test whether astrocytic activity is also sufficient to generate synaptic potentiation and enhance memory, we expressed the Gq-coupled receptor hM3Dq in CA1 astrocytes, allowing their activation by a designer drug. We discovered that astrocytic activation is not only necessary for synaptic plasticity, but also sufficient to induce NMDA-dependent de novo long-term potentiation in the hippocampus that persisted after astrocytic activation ceased. In vivo, astrocytic activation enhanced memory allocation; i.e., it increased neuronal activity in a task-specific way only when coupled with learning, but not in home-caged mice. Furthermore, astrocytic activation using either a chemogenetic or an optogenetic tool during acquisition resulted in memory recall enhancement on the following day. Conversely, directly increasing neuronal activity resulted in dramatic memory impairment. Our findings that astrocytes induce plasticity and enhance memory may have important clinical implications for cognitive augmentation treatments."

Here we report the construction and validation of a molecular network of the aging human frontal cortex. Using RNA sequence data from 478 individuals, we first build a molecular network using modules of coexpressed genes and then relate these modules to AD and its neuropathologic and cognitive endophenotypes. We confirm these associations in two independent AD datasets. We also illustrate the use of the network in prioritizing amyloid- and cognition-associated genes for in vitro validation in human neurons and astrocytes. These analyses based on unique cohorts enable us to resolve the role of distinct cortical modules that have a direct effect on the accumulation of AD pathology from those that have a direct effect on cognitive decline, exemplifying a network approach to complex diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2803754954,"The acetyltransferases CBP and p300 are multifunctional transcriptional co-activators. Here, we combined quantitative proteomics with CBP/p300-specific catalytic inhibitors, bromodomain inhibitor, and gene knockout to reveal a comprehensive map of regulated acetylation sites and their dynamic turnover rates. CBP/p300 acetylates thousands of sites, including signature histone sites and a multitude of sites on signaling effectors and enhancer-associated transcriptional regulators. Time-resolved acetylome analyses identified a subset of CBP/p300-regulated sites with very rapid (<30 min) acetylation turnover, revealing a dynamic balance between acetylation and deacetylation. Quantification of acetylation, mRNA, and protein abundance after CBP/p300 inhibition reveals a kinetically competent network of gene expression that strictly depends on CBP/p300-catalyzed rapid acetylation. Collectively, our in-depth acetylome analyses reveal systems attributes of CBP/p300 targets, and the resource dataset provides a framework for investigating CBP/p300 functions and for understanding the impact of small-molecule inhibitors targeting its catalytic and bromodomain activities."
https://openalex.org/W2782385981,"Ultrasound has received widespread attention as an emerging technology for targeted, non-invasive neuromodulation based on its ability to evoke electrophysiological and motor responses in animals. However, little is known about the spatiotemporal pattern of ultrasound-induced brain activity that could drive these responses. Here, we address this question by combining focused ultrasound with wide-field optical imaging of calcium signals in transgenic mice. Surprisingly, we find cortical activity patterns consistent with indirect activation of auditory pathways rather than direct neuromodulation at the ultrasound focus. Ultrasound-induced activity is similar to that evoked by audible sound. Furthermore, both ultrasound and audible sound elicit motor responses consistent with a startle reflex, with both responses reduced by chemical deafening. These findings reveal an indirect auditory mechanism for ultrasound-induced cortical activity and movement requiring careful consideration in future development of ultrasonic neuromodulation as a tool in neuroscience research."
https://openalex.org/W2803848728,"The Hippo pathway plays an important role in regulating tissue homeostasis, and its effectors, the transcriptional co-activators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and WW domain–containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1 or TAZ), are responsible for mediating the vast majority of its physiological functions. Although YAP and TAZ are thought to be largely redundant and similarly regulated by Hippo signaling, they have developmental, structural, and physiological differences that suggest they may differ in their regulation and downstream functions. To better understand the functions of YAP and TAZ in the Hippo pathway, using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated YAP KO, TAZ KO, and YAP/TAZ KO cell lines in HEK293A cells. We evaluated them in response to many environmental conditions and stimuli and used RNA-Seq to compare their transcriptional profiles. We found that YAP inactivation has a greater effect on cellular physiology (namely, cell spreading, volume, granularity, glucose uptake, proliferation, and migration) than TAZ inactivation. However, functional redundancy between YAP and TAZ was also observed. In summary, our findings confirm that the Hippo pathway effectors YAP and TAZ are master regulators for multiple cellular processes but also reveal that YAP has a stronger influence than TAZ."

Exons encoding immunoglobulin (Ig) or T cell receptor (TCR) variable regions are assembled from V, D, and J gene segments during B and T lymphocyte development. V(D)J recombination is initiated by RAG1/RAG2 endonuclease (RAG), which introduces DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) between a pair of V, D, and J coding segments and flanking recombination signal sequences (RSSs) (Teng and Schatz, 2015Teng G. Schatz D.G. Regulation and evolution of the RAG recombinase.Adv. Immunol. 2015; 128: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). RSSs consist of a conserved heptamer, closely related to the canonical 5′-CACAGTG-3′ sequence, and a less-conserved nonamer separated by 12 (12RSS) or 23 (23RSS) bp spacers. Physiological RAG cleavage requires RSSs and is restricted to paired coding segments flanked, respectively, by 12RSSs and 23RSSs (Teng and Schatz, 2015Teng G. Schatz D.G. Regulation and evolution of the RAG recombinase.Adv. Immunol. 2015; 128: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). RAG binds paired RSSs as a Y-shaped heterodimer (Kim et al., 2015Kim M.-S.

Cleaved coding and RSS ends reside in a RAG post-cleavage synaptic complex prior to fusion of RSS ends and coding ends, respectively, by non-homologous DSB end-joining (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W.

Mechanisms of programmed DNA lesions and genomic instability in the immune system.Cell. 2013; 152: 417-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The mouse Ig heavy chain locus (Igh) spans 2.7 Mb, with more than 100 VHs flanked by 23RSSs embedded in the 2.4 Mb distal portion; 13 Ds flanked on each side by a 12RSS located in a region starting 100 kb downstream of the D-proximal VH (VH5-2; commonly termed “VH81X”), and 4 JHs flanked by 23RSSs lying just downstream of the Ds (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W.

Mechanisms of programmed DNA lesions and genomic instability in the immune system.Cell. 2013; 152: 417-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A and S1A). Igh V(D)J recombination is ordered, with Ds joining on their downstream side to JHs before VHs join to the upstream side of the DJH intermediate (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W. Zhang Y. Meng F.-L. Guo C. Schwer B. Mechanisms of programmed DNA lesions and genomic instability in the immune system.Cell. 2013; 152: 417-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). D to JH joining initiates after RAG is recruited to a nascent V(D)J recombination center (“nRC”) to form an active V(D)J recombination center (RC) around the Igh intronic enhancer (iEμ), JHs, and proximal DHQ52 (Teng and Schatz, 2015Teng G. Schatz D.G. Regulation and evolution of the RAG recombinase.Adv. Immunol. 2015; 128: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Upon formation of DJH intermediates, VHs must enter a newly established DJHRC for joining. In this regard, Igh locus contraction brings VHs into closer physical proximity to the DJHRC, allowing utilization of VHs from across the VH domain (Bossen et al., 2012Bossen C. Mansson R. Murre C.

Following locus contraction, diffusion-related mechanisms contribute to VH incorporation into the DJHRC (Lucas et al., 2014Lucas J.S. Zhang Y. Dudko O.K.

These sites, which may theoretically serve overlapping functions to CBE interactions in the model in Figure 7, are shown on top of blue bars wherever present. V(D)J recombination is regulated to maintain specificity and diversity of antigen receptor repertoires by modulating chromatin accessibility of particular Ig or TCR loci, or regions of these loci, for V(D)J recombination (Yancopoulos et al., 1986Yancopoulos G.D.

Accessibility regulation was proposed based on robust transcription of distal VHs before rearrangement (Yancopoulos and Alt, 1985Yancopoulos G.D. Alt F.W. Developmentally controlled and tissue-specific expression of unrearranged VH gene segments.Cell. 1985; 40: 271-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) and correlated with various epigenetic modifications (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W.

In this regard, germline transcription and active chromatin modifications in the nRC recruit RAG1 and RAG2 to form the active RC (Teng and Schatz, 2015Teng G. Schatz D.G. Regulation and evolution of the RAG recombinase.Adv. Immunol. 2015; 128: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Genome organization alterations also positively impact VH “accessibility” by bringing distal VHs into closer physical proximity to the DJHRC via Igh locus contraction (Bossen et al., 2012Bossen C. Mansson R. Murre C. Chromatin topology and the regulation of antigen receptor assembly.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30: 337-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Conversely, the intergenic control region 1 (IGCR1) in the VH to D interval plays a negative, insulating role with respect to proximal VH accessibility (Guo et al., 2011Guo C. Yoon H.S. Franklin A.

IGCR1 function relies on two CTCF looping factor binding elements (“CBEs”) that contribute to sequestering Ds, JHs and RC within a chromatin domain that excludes proximal VHs; thereby, mediating ordered D to JH recombination and preventing proximal VH over-utilization (Guo et al., 2011Guo C.

RAG can explore directionally from an initiating physiological or ectopically introduced RC for Mb distances within convergent CBE-based contact chromatin loop domains genome-wide (Hu et al., 2015Hu J.

During such exploration, RAG uses RSSs in convergent orientation, including cryptic RSSs as simple as a CAC, for cleavage and joining to a canonical RSS in the RC (Hu et al., 2015Hu J. Zhang Y. Zhao L. Frock R.L. Du Z. Meyers R.M. Meng F.-L. Schatz D.G. Alt F.W.

Med. 2016; 213: 1921-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This long-range directional RAG activity is impeded upon encounter of cohesin-bound convergent CBE pairs and potentially by other blockages that create chromatin sub-domains within loops (Hu et al., 2015Hu J.

Med. 2016; 213: 1921-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The directionality and linearity of RAG activity across these domains implicated one-dimensional RAG tracking (Hu et al., 2015Hu J. Zhang Y. Zhao L. Frock R.L. Du Z. Meyers R.M. Meng F.-L. Schatz D.G. Alt F.W. Chromosomal loop domains direct the recombination of antigen receptor genes.Cell. 2015; 163: 947-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Directional RAG tracking also occurs upstream of the DJHRC to IGCR1 (Hu et al., 2015Hu J. Zhang Y. Zhao L. Frock R.L. Du Z. Meyers R.M. Meng F.-L. Schatz D.G. Alt F.W. Chromosomal loop domains direct the recombination of antigen receptor genes.Cell. 2015; 163: 947-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). IGCR1 deletion extends this recombination tracking domain directionally upstream of the DJHRC to the proximal VHs, coupled with dramatically increased proximal VH to DJH joining, most dominantly VH81X (Hu et al., 2015Hu J. Zhang Y. Zhao L. Frock R.L. Du Z. Meyers R.M. Meng F.-L. Schatz D.G. Alt F.W. Chromosomal loop domains direct the recombination of antigen receptor genes.Cell. 2015; 163: 947-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the tracked substrate and factors that drive RAG tracking remained speculative. The mouse Igh harbors a high density of CBEs (Degner et al., 2011Degner S.C. Verma-Gaur J. Wong T.P. Bossen C. Iverson G.M. Torkamani A. Vettermann C. Lin Y.C. Ju Z.

USA. 2011; 108: 9566-9571Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Ten clustered CBEs (“3′CBEs”) lie at the downstream Igh boundary in convergent orientation to more than 100 CBEs embedded across the VH domain (Proudhon et al., 2015Proudhon C. Hao B. Raviram R. Chaumeil J. Skok J.A. Long-range regulation of V(D)J recombination.Adv. Immunol. 2015; 128: 123-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). VH CBEs are spread throughout the VH domain and, particularly for more proximal VHs, often found immediately downstream of VH RSSs (Choi et al., 2013Choi N.M. Loguercio S. Verma-Gaur J. Degner S.C. Torkamani A. Su A.I. Oltz E.M. Artyomov M. Feeney A.J. Deep sequencing of the murine IgH repertoire reveals complex regulation of nonrandom V gene rearrangement frequencies.J.

Notably, VH CBEs and 3′CBEs are in convergent orientation with each other and with, respectively, the upstream and downstream IGCR1 CBEs (Guo et al., 2011Guo C. Yoon H.S. Franklin A. Jain S. Ebert A. Cheng H.-L. Hansen E. Despo O. Bossen C. Vettermann C. et al.CTCF-binding elements mediate control of V(D)J recombination.Nature. 2011; 477: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The striking number and organization of the CBEs across the VH portion of Igh has led to speculation of potential positive or negative VH CBE roles in Igh V(D)J recombination (Bossen et al., 2012Bossen C.

The production of blood cells depends on the fitness of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment, which contributes to multilineage hematopoiesis throughout life (Bernitz et al., 2016Bernitz J.M.

HSCs exist in at least three different states: a dormant state, characterized by quiescence and by the highest regenerative potential in the HSC cell compartment (Bernitz et al., 2016Bernitz J.M.

Metabolic changes play an important role in HSC activation. Quiescent HSCs rely primarily on anaerobic glycolysis. They contain low numbers of mitochondria, limited essentially by mitophagy (Ho et al., 2017Ho T.T. Warr M.R. Adelman E.R. Lansinger O.M. Flach J. Verovskaya E.V. Figueroa M.E. Passegué E.

Conversely, HSC activation is characterized by a continuous increase in biosynthetic activity and correlates with mitochondrial expansion, increased reliance on oxidative phosphorylation, and increased ROS levels (Bigarella et al., 2014Bigarella C.L.

The mTOR pathway, which stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and counteracts autophagy, is a major player in HSC activation and differentiation (Chen et al., 2008Chen C. Liu Y. Liu R. Ikenoue T.

The functionality of the HSC compartment hinges on the balance between quiescence and activation. A reduction in the ability of HSCs to exit quiescence will result in insufficient blood cell production, whereas an increased propensity to exit quiescence or failure to re-enter it will cause HSC exhaustion and bone marrow failure. The identity of the cell-intrinsic mechanism(s) required to terminate activation and re-enter dormancy and the signaling pathways that mediate this transition remain key unresolved questions in the field. The MEK/ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways are common targets of growth factors regulating hematopoiesis (Chung and Kondo, 2011Chung E. Kondo M.

In mouse models, constitutive activation of these pathways promotes HSC proliferation at the expense of quiescence. Both pathways are activated downstream of RAS, and at least one of the RAS paralogs, KRAS, is required in HSCs for adult hematopoiesis (Damnernsawad et al., 2016Damnernsawad A. Kong G. Wen Z. Liu Y. Rajagopalan A. You X. Wang J. Zhou Y. Ranheim E.A. Luo H.R. et al.Kras is required for adult hematopoiesis.Stem Cells. 2016; 34: 1859-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); constitutively activated KRASG12D sensitizes HSCs and progenitors to cytokines (Van Meter et al., 2007Van Meter M.E.

K-RasG12D expression induces hyperproliferation and aberrant signaling in primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.Blood. 2007; 109: 3945-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas NRASG12D has a bimodal effect on HSCs, increasing regenerative potential in a slow-cycling pool and decreasing it in a fast-cycling pool (Li et al., 2013Li Q.

In contrast, constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway by deletion of its antagonist PTEN decreases regenerative potential and causes HSC exhaustion, primarily via mTOR activation (Kalaitzidis et al., 2012Kalaitzidis D.

From all of the above, it is clear that efficient hematopoiesis requires the fine-tuning of the MEK/ERK and PI3K pathways. However, the mechanisms involved in this regulation are currently unknown. We have previously shown that activated ERK can dim the activation of both pathways by feedback phosphorylation of a specific residue on MEK1 (Catalanotti et al., 2009Catalanotti F. Reyes G. Jesenberger V. Galabova-Kovacs G. de Matos Simoes R. Carugo O. Baccarini M. A Mek1-Mek2 heterodimer determines the strength and duration of the Erk signal.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Cell. 2013; 50: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that these feedbacks may play a role in hematopoiesis. To study the cell-autonomous effects of MEK1 in hematopoietic cells in detail, we used a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model inducing hematopoietic system-restricted MEK1 deletion (Vav1iCRE;Map2klF/F mice, hereafter termed MEK1-cKO; de Boer et al., 2003de Boer J. Williams A. Skavdis G. Harker N. Coles M. Tolaini M. Norton T. Williams K. Roderick K. Potocnik A.J. Kioussis D. Transgenic mice with hematopoietic and lymphoid specific expression of Cre.Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). MEK1 was efficiently deleted in MEK1-cKO bone marrow (BM), whereas expression of the paralog MEK2 was unaffected (Figure S1A). One-year-old MEK1-cKO showed a moderate peripheral pancytopenia (Figure S1B), which correlated with reduced HSC numbers and loss of label-retaining cells (Figures S1C and S1D; for full HSC fluorescence-activated cell sorting [FACS] gating strategy, see Figure S1E). We next tested the regenerative capacity of MEK1-deficient HSCs by performing serial competitive reconstitution assays, in which CRE+, F/F, or cKO Ly5.2+ donor BM cells (each containing 100 HSCs) were mixed with F/F Ly5.1+ competitor BM and injected into lethally irradiated Ly5.1+ recipient mice (Figure 1A). MEK1-cKO cells could contribute to all lineages but yielded low levels of peripheral blood, BM, and HSC chimerism (Figure 1B) and exhausted after the second round of transplantation (Figure 1C). Consistent with this defect in HSC regenerative capacity, MEK1 ablation suppressed chemotherapy-induced emergency hematopoiesis. Repetitive exposure to the myelotoxic drug 5-FU (Figure 1D) caused HSC expansion in F/F animals, whereas in MEK1-cKO mice, the HSC compartment contracted dramatically, leading to BM failure and premature death (Figures 1E and 1F). In the initial phases of the treatment, however, the output of differentiated cells in both BM and peripheral blood of MEK1-cKO animals was higher than that of controls (Figure 1E). A more detailed analysis of the hematopoietic compartment showed that all other stem and precursor cell subsets analyzed behaved similarly to HSCs, with numbers indistinguishable from the F/F controls in young animals and significant contraction occurring in aging, chemotherapy, and transplantation (Mendeley Data, https://doi.org/10.17632/7rdg6mjk5h.1). The defect caused by MEK1 ablation was cell intrinsic and could be recapitulated in long-term cultures (LTCs) of HSCs seeded on F/F feeder layers. In these experiments, MEK1-cKO HSCs produced a significantly higher number of lineage+ cells than F/F cultures, whereas the number of cells capable of generating colony-forming units (CFUs) steadily decreased (Figure 1G). Increased output of differentiated cells and HSC exhaustion correlated with reduced numbers of HSCs in G0 in all the systems investigated (Figure 1H). To gain further insight on the role of MEK1, we next focused on mice recovering from a single 5-FU injection, which promotes the reversible activation of virtually all dormant HSCs (Wilson et al., 2008Wilson A. Laurenti E. Oser G. van der Wath R.C. Blanco-Bose W. Jaworski M. Offner S. Dunant C.F. Eshkind L. Bockamp E. et al.Hematopoietic stem cells reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal during homeostasis and repair.Cell. 2008; 135: 1118-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). In this setup, the temporal correlation among contraction of the HSC compartment, increased HSC proliferation, and increased output of differentiated cells in MEK1-cKO mice was readily apparent (Figures 2A–2C). To explore the mechanisms driving HSC exhaustion in an unbiased manner, we performed transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments comparing F/F and MEK1-cKO HSCs from untreated animals or from animals recovering from one single 5-FU injection administered 9 days before harvesting the cells, at the time of maximum HSC expansion in F/F BM. 483 genes were upregulated and 450 were downregulated in 5-FU-treated F/F HSCs (complete gene list in Table S1); among these genes, two groups were clearly impacted by MEK1 ablation (Figures 2D, 2E, and S2). The first group included genes connected with increased cell cycle activity. The upregulation of cell-cycle-promoting genes and the downregulation of cell cycle inhibitors, validated by qRT-PCR, correlated with the reduction in G0 populations in all stress systems investigated (Figure 2F, top). Upregulation of cell cycle genes was also observed in HSCs isolated from untreated MEK1-cKO animals, where the percentage of HSCs in G0 was indistinguishable between F/F and cKO (compare Figure 2B with Figure 2F, top). Thus, MEK1-cKO HSCs are in a state reminiscent of the GAlert (Rodgers et al., 2014Rodgers J.T. King K.Y. Brett J.O. Cromie M.J. Charville G.W. Maguire K.K. Brunson C. Mastey N. Liu L. Tsai C.R. et al.mTORC1 controls the adaptive transition of quiescent stem cells from G0 to G(Alert).Nature. 2014; 510: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) or “active” as opposed to “dormant” state (Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2017Cabezas-Wallscheid N. Buettner F. Sommerkamp P. Klimmeck D. Ladel L. Thalheimer F.B. Pastor-Flores D. Roma L.P. Renders S. Zeisberger P. et al.Vitamin A-retinoic acid signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell dormancy.Cell. 2017; 169: 807-823.e19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), i.e., they are primed for cell cycle entry. This is consistent with the higher numbers of cycling MEK1-cKO HSCs and with the initial burst of lineage+ cells observed in all activation models. The second group of upregulated genes encoded mitochondrial components, most notably proteins of the electron transport chain involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (Murphy, 2009Murphy M.P. How mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species.Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (5274) Google Scholar). Upregulation of these genes was only observed in HSCs isolated from animals undergoing stress-induced hematopoiesis or cultured on feeder layers in vitro (Figures 2F, bottom, and S2), consistent with the notion that full-fledged HSC activation relies on mitochondrial expansion, increased OXPHOS, and higher intracellular ROS levels (Chandel et al., 2016Chandel N.S.

Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Indeed, ROS levels/cell increased in HSCs recovering from 5-FU myeloablation, peaking at day 9 in correspondence with the maximum output of differentiated cells and returning to normal by day 21. The increase in intracellular ROS levels was more pronounced in MEK1-cKO than in F/F HSCs (Figure 3A) and correlated with a transient increase in DNA damage, but not apoptosis or senescence (Figures S3A–S3E), in line with the concept that HSCs incur and repair DNA damage when induced to exit quiescence (Walter et al., 2015Walter D. Lier A. Geiselhart A. Thalheimer F.B. Huntscha S. Sobotta M.C. Moehrle B. Brocks D. Bayindir I. Kaschutnig P. et al.Exit from dormancy provokes DNA-damage-induced attrition in haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2015; 520: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in the other models tested (Figures 3B and S3). Treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which counteracts ROS-induced damage, significantly increased the survival of MEK1-cKO mice undergoing myelotoxic chemotherapy, showing that increased ROS production contributes to the phenotype in vivo (Figure 3C). The increase in ROS levels was observed in all MEK1-deficient, lineage-BM cells (Figure S3F). Mitochondria are the major producers of intracellular ROS; these radicals, in turn, can cause mitochondrial damage (Murphy, 2009Murphy M.P. How mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species.Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (5274) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed whether ROS production correlated with increased mitochondrial mass and/or mitochondrial damage (defined as a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, Δψ) during emergency hematopoiesis. Mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential/cell did not significantly differ in F/F and cKO HSCs recovering from a single 5-FU injection (Figure S3G). However, mitochondrial mass was increased and membrane potential (Δψ) was decreased in MEK1-cKO HSCs and multipotent progenitors upon repetitive 5-FU stress, as well as in cKO HSCs in LTCs (Figures 3D, 3E, and S3F), suggesting an accumulation of damaged mitochondria in these models. Damaged mitochondria are cleared by PINK1/PARK2-mediated mitophagy (Pickrell and Youle, 2015Pickrell A.M. Youle R.J. The roles of PINK1, parkin, and mitochondrial fidelity in Parkinson’s disease.Neuron. 2015; 85: 257-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar), which supports HSC maintenance downstream of the PML/PPARδ pathway (Ito et al., 2012Ito K.

The PINK1 gene was downregulated in the cKO (Table S1), and PINK1 protein expression was reduced in MEK1-cKO HSCs from 5-FU-treated mice or from LTCs (Figure 3F). Confocal microscopy revealed reduced co-localization of mitochondria with lysosomes (labeled with Tom20 [translocase of outer membrane 20] and LAMP1 [lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1] antibodies, respectively) in cKO HSCs from 5-FU-treated mice or from LTCs (Figure 3G), suggesting decreased mitophagy. The data above show that MEK1 dials down proliferation, OXPHOS, and the accumulation of ROS and damaged mitochondria in HSC stimulated to proliferate in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the MEK1-dependent mechanisms governing these key parameters of reversible HSC activation, we combined surface marker and intracellular (phospho)protein FACS analysis and focused on MEK-related HSC signaling during the recovery from a single 5-FU injection (for antibody validation, see Mendeley Data, https://doi.org/10.17632/7rdg6mjk5h.1).

We analysed the clonal evolution of squamous skin carcinomas induced by DMBA/TPA treatment using the K5CreER-Confetti mouse and stage-specific lineage tracing. We show that benign tumours are polyclonal, but only one population contains the Hras driver mutation. Thus, benign papillomas are monoclonal in origin but recruit neighbouring epithelial cells during growth. Papillomas that never progress to malignancy retain several distinct clones, whereas progression to carcinoma is associated with a clonal sweep. Newly generated clones within carcinomas demonstrate intratumoural invasion and clonal intermixing, often giving rise to metastases containing two or more distinct clones derived from the matched primary tumour. These data demonstrate that late-stage tumour progression and dissemination are governed by evolutionary selection pressures that operate at a multicellular level and, therefore, differ from the clonal events that drive initiation and the benign-malignant transition."
https://openalex.org/W2803766971,"Ribonucleoprotein enzymes require dynamic conformations of their RNA constituents for regulated catalysis. Human telomerase employs a non-coding RNA (hTR) with a bipartite arrangement of domains-a template-containing core and a distal three-way junction (CR4/5) that stimulates catalysis through unknown means. Here, we show that telomerase activity unexpectedly depends upon the holoenzyme protein TCAB1, which in turn controls conformation of CR4/5. Cells lacking TCAB1 exhibit a marked reduction in telomerase catalysis without affecting enzyme assembly. Instead, TCAB1 inactivation causes unfolding of CR4/5 helices that are required for catalysis and for association with the telomerase reverse-transcriptase (TERT). CR4/5 mutations derived from patients with telomere biology disorders provoke defects in catalysis and TERT binding similar to TCAB1 inactivation. These findings reveal a conformational ""activity switch"" in human telomerase RNA controlling catalysis and TERT engagement. The identification of two discrete catalytic states for telomerase suggests an intramolecular means for controlling telomerase in cancers and progenitor cells."

JMJD1A has been shown to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, but its molecular role in CRC is unclear. Here, we report that JMJD1A is overexpressed in CRC specimens and that its expression is positively correlated with that of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). JMJD1A knockdown decreased the expression of proliferative genes such as c-Myc, cyclin D1, and PCNA, suppressed CRC cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle progression, and reduced xenograft tumorigenesis. Furthermore, JMJD1A knockdown inhibited CRC cell migration, invasion, and lung metastasis by decreasing matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) expression and enzymatic activity. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis of GEO profile datasets revealed that JMJD1A expression in human CRC specimens is positively correlated with the expression of Wnt/β-catenin target genes, including c-Myc, cyclin D1, and MMP9. Mechanistically, JMJD1A enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling by promoting β-catenin expression and interacting with β-catenin to enhance its transactivation. JMJD1A removed the methyl groups of H3K9me2 at the promoters of c-Myc and MMP9 genes. In contrast, the JMJD1AH1120Y variant, which lacked demethylase activity, did not demethylate H3K9me2 at these promoters, failed to assist β-catenin to induce the expression of Wnt/β-catenin target genes, and failed to promote CRC progression. These findings suggest that JMJD1A's demethylase activity is required for Wnt/β-catenin activation. Of note, high JMJD1A levels in CRC specimens predicted poor cancer outcomes.

Although JMJD1A recently was shown to be able to maintain tumorigenic potentials of human colorectal cancer stem cells via enhancing Wnt/β-catenin signaling (18Li J. Yu B. Deng P. Cheng Y. Yu Y. Kevork K. Ramadoss S. Ding X. Li X. Wang C.Y. KDM3 epigenetically controls tumorigenic potentials of human colorectal cancer stem cells through Wnt/β-catenin signalling.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 (28440295)1514610.1038/ncomms15146Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the role of JMJD1A in CRC growth and metastasis as well as how JMJD1A enhances Wnt/β-catenin signaling remain to be further elucidated. In this study, we showed that JMJD1A was overexpressed in human CRC specimens and promoted CRC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, tumorigenesis, and metastasis by interacting with β-catenin to enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and the demethylase activity of JMJD1A was required for its functions. To determine the role of JMJD1A in CRC, Western blot analysis was used to determine the protein levels of JMJD1A in a set of 31 pairs of human CRC specimens and the surrounding nontumorous tissues. The results showed that the protein levels of JMJD1A were overexpressed in 23 (74.2%) of 31 human CRC specimens compared with the surrounding nontumorous tissues (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, the proliferation marker PCNA was also up-regulated in tumor specimens (Fig. 1, A and C). Moreover, a positive correlation between the expression of JMJD1A and PCNA was identified (Fig. 1D). These results implicate that JMJD1A might play a promoting role in CRC progression. Because JMJD1A was overexpressed in CRC tumor specimens and positively correlated with PCNA, we postulated that JMJD1A might promote CRC cell proliferation. To test this, human CRC cell lines HCT116 and SW480 were stably transfected with two different human JMJD1A-knockdown shRNA constructs (pll3.7-shJMJD1A-1 and pll3.7-shJMJD1A-2), respectively, and then MTT assay and cell cycle progression assay were performed to measure the effects of JMJD1A knockdown on CRC cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, JMJD1A knockdown led to a down-regulation of several proliferation-related genes such as c-Myc, cyclin D1, and PCNA, a reduction of cell proliferation rate, and an arrest of cell cycle progression at the G1 phase. Furthermore, rescue of c-Myc or cyclin D1 expression in JMJD1A-knockdown HCT116 cells restored cell proliferation (Fig. S1, A and B). These results suggest that knockdown of JMJD1A could inhibit CRC cell proliferation at least in part through reducing the expression of c-Myc and cyclin D1. To determine the effect of JMJD1A knockdown on the tumorigenesis of CRC cells, the colony formation assay and xenograft tumor formation assay were performed. Knockdown of JMJD1A decreased the colony formation abilities of both JMJD1A-knockdown HCT116 and SW480 cells (Fig. 2C). Knockdown of JMJD1A in HCT116 cells markedly reduced xenograft tumor growth and tumor weight (Fig. 2, D and E). Furthermore, knockdown of JMJD1A significantly reduced the number of Ki67-positive CRC cells in tissue sections from JMJD1A-knockdown tumors (Fig. 2F). These results indicate that JMJD1A knockdown inhibits the tumorigenesis of CRC cells. Invasion and metastasis are two important characteristics of malignant tumor cells. Therefore, we determined whether JMJD1A plays a role in CRC cell invasion and metastasis. We first measured the effects of JMJD1A knockdown on the migratory and invasive abilities of CRC cells by using transwell cell migration and invasion assays. The results showed that knockdown of JMJD1A reduced the migratory and invasive abilities of CRC cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, knockdown of JMJD1A reduced the protein levels and enzyme activity of MMP9 (Fig. 3, A and B), a matrix metalloproteinase that plays an important role in the migration and invasion of a variety of tumor cells. Furthermore, rescue of MMP9 expression in JMJD1A-knockdown HCT116 cells restored cell migration and invasion (Fig. S2). These results indicate that JMJD1A knockdown inhibits the migratory and invasive potential of CRC cells at least in part through down-regulation of MMP9. We next measured the effects of JMJD1A knockdown on CRC metastasis in vivo by injecting JMJD1A knockdown and control HCT116 cells into nude mice through the tail vein, respectively. Twenty days after cell injection, the lung tissues were harvested for analysis. Knockdown of JMJD1A significantly decreased lung metastasis (Fig. 3C). Ki67 staining for lung tissue sections from JMJD1A knockdown and control HCT116 tumors displayed that knockdown of JMJD1A significantly reduced the number of Ki67-positive HCT116 cells (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that JMJD1A knockdown inhibits CRC metastasis. Having shown that c-Myc, cyclin D1, and MMP9, the downstream target genes of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Fig. S3), were down-regulated in JMJD1A knockdown cells, we postulated that JMJD1A might enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling to up-regulate the transcription of c-Myc, cyclin D1, and MMP9 genes. To test this, we first detected whether JMJD1A knockdown could reduce the mRNA levels of c-Myc, cyclin D1, and MMP9. As shown in Fig. 4A, knockdown of JMJD1A decreased the mRNA levels of c-Myc, cyclin D1, and MMP9, implicating that JMJD1A may regulate the expression of c-Myc, cyclin D1, and MMP9 at the transcriptional level. Next, we transfected JMJD1A and/or β-catenin expression plasmids, together with c-Myc or the MMP9 promoter reporter into 293T cells, respectively, and then performed dual-luciferase activity assays. The results showed that overexpression of JMJD1A and β-catenin synergistically enhanced the promoter activities of c-Myc and MMP9 (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of overexpression of JMJD1A and β-catenin on the activity of the Topflash reporter, a well-established Wnt/β-catenin reporter. As shown in Fig. 4C, JMJD1A and β-catenin synergistically enhanced Topflash reporter activity in the absence or presence of LiCl, a Wnt/β-catenin activator. Taken together, these results suggest that JMJD1A can up-regulate the expression of c-Myc, cyclin D1, and MMP9 by cooperating with β-catenin to enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Because JMJD1A can enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling, we first examined whether JMJD1A can regulate β-catenin expression. The results showed that knockdown of JMJD1A reduced the protein and mRNA levels of β-catenin (Fig. 4. D and E), whereas overexpression of JMJD1A increased the protein and mRNA levels of β-catenin (Fig. 4, F and G), suggesting that JMJD1A can positively regulate β-catenin expression. To determine whether JMJD1A regulates β-catenin expression at transcriptional level, we co-transfected the β-catenin promoter reporter and JMJD1A expression plasmid into 293T cells and then performed dual-luciferase activity assays. As shown in Fig. 4H, JMJD1A dose-dependently enhanced the β-catenin promoter reporter activity. Furthermore, we used ChIP assay to detect whether JMJD1A can be recruited to the β-catenin promoter to demethylate H3K9me2. Our results showed that overexpressed JMJD1A increased the recruitment of JMJD1A to the β-catenin promoter (Fig. 4I) but reduced the H3K9me2 levels at the β-catenin promoter (Fig. 4J). In contrast, knockdown of JMJD1A reduced the recruitment of JMJD1A (Fig. 4K) but increased the H3K9me2 levels at the β-catenin promoter (Fig. 4L). These results suggest that JMJD1A enhances Wnt/β-catenin signaling at least in part by promoting β-catenin expression. We next asked whether JMJD1A could interact with β-catenin. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, the interaction between endogenous JMJD1A and β-catenin in HCT116 and SW480 cells was able to be detected by Co-IP assay using anti-JMJD1A and anti-β-catenin antibodies, respectively. This result is consistent with a previous report showing that JMJD1A can interact with β-catenin (18Li J. Yu B. Deng P. Cheng Y. Yu Y. Kevork K. Ramadoss S. Ding X. Li X. Wang C.Y. KDM3 epigenetically controls tumorigenic potentials of human colorectal cancer stem cells through Wnt/β-catenin signalling.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 (28440295)1514610.1038/ncomms15146Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To determine whether JMJD1A can directly bind to β-catenin, the GST pulldown assay was performed by incubating Escherichia coli–produced GST–β-catenin protein with JMJD1A protein produced by an E. coli extract-based cell-free protein synthesis system. The results showed that the GST–β-catenin protein, but not GST, was able to pull down JMJD1A (Fig. 5C), indicating that JMJD1A directly binds to β-catenin. Furthermore, GST pulldown assays showed that β-catenin interacted with the zinc finger domain of JMJD1A (Fig. 5D), whereas JMJD1A interacted with the Arm 3–10 domain of β-catenin (Fig. 5E). Taken together, our data suggest that JMJD1A enhances Wnt/β-catenin signaling at least through two mechanisms: one is to increase the expression of β-catenin, and the other is to interact with β-catenin to enhance its transactivation. Because JMJD1A can cooperate with β-catenin to enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling, it was expected that knockdown of JMJD1A reduced the promoter activities of c-Myc, MMP9, and Topflash in HCT116 cells in the absence or presence of LiCl (Fig. 6A). To determine whether JMJD1A could be recruited to the promoters of c-Myc and MMP9 to demethylate H3K9me2 when Wnt/β-catenin signaling is activated, HCT116 cells were treated with LiCl, and then the recruitment of β-catenin and JMJD1A to the promoters of c-Myc and MMP9 was detected by ChIP assay. As shown in Fig. 6B, LiCl treatment increased the recruitment of β-catenin, indicating that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is activated by LiCl. LiCl treatment led to an increase of JMJD1A recruitment (Fig. 6C), but a decrease of H3K9me2 levels at the promoters of c-Myc and MMP9 (Fig. 6D), indicating that activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling could enhance the recruitment of JMJD1A to the promoters of c-Myc and MMP9 to demethylate H3K9me2. In contrast, down-regulation of β-catenin reduced the recruitment of β-catenin (Fig. 6E) and JMJD1A (Fig. 6F) to the promoters of c-Myc and MMP9 but increased the H3K9me2 levels at the promoters of c-Myc and MMP9 (Fig. 6G). When down-regulation of JMJD1A reduced the recruitment of JMJD1A (Fig. 6H), but increased the levels of H3K9me2 at the promoters of c-Myc and MMP9 (Fig. 6I), the recruitment of β-catenin was markedly decreased (Fig. 6J), indicating that JMJD1A can enhance the recruitment of β-catenin to the promoters of c-Myc and MMP9. It has been reported that the histidine at amino acid 1120 of JMJD1A (His-1120) is essential for its histone demethylase function (12Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wong J. Zhang Y. JHDM2A, a JmjC-containing H3K9 demethylase, facilitates transcription activation by androgen receptor.Cell. 2006; 125 (16603237): 483-49510.1016/j.cell.2006.03.027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). We found that JMJD1AH1120Y variant failed to reduce the levels of H3K9me2 at the promoters of c-Myc and MMP9 as compared with WT JMJD1A (Fig. 7A), suggesting that the demethylase activity of JMJD1A is required for reducing the levels of H3K9me2 at the promoters of c-Myc and MMP9. Furthermore, we found that although the JMJD1AH1120Y variant could bind to β-catenin (Fig. S4), it was unable to assist β-catenin to enhance the promoter activities of c-Myc, MMP9, and Topflash (Fig. 7, B and C), and it was unable to induce the expression of β-catenin target genes such as c-Myc, cyclin D1, and MMP9 (Fig. 7D). These results indicate that the demethylase activity of JMJD1A is required for JMJD1A to enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Furthermore, we determined whether the demethylase activity of JMJD1A is required for cell proliferation, migration, invasion, xenograft tumor formation, and metastasis. We transfected WT JMJD1A and JMJD1AH1120Y expression plasmids into shJMJD1A-expressing (JMJD1A-knockdown) HCT116 cells, respectively, and then measured cell proliferation, migration, invasion, xenograft tumor formation, and lung metastasis. The results showed that WT JMJD1A could but the JMJD1AH1120Y variant could not increase the shJMJD1A-expressing HCT116 cell proliferation rate (Fig. 7E), migration and invasion rate (Fig. 7F), tumor size (Fig. 7G), tumor weight (Fig. 7H), and lung metastasis (Fig. 7I), implicating that the demethylase activity of JMJD1A is required for enhancement of cell proliferation, migration, invasion, xenograft tumor formation, and metastasis by JMJD1A. To validate our findings genetically, the AOM/DSS-induced mouse CRC formation model was performed to investigate whether JMJD1A deficiency protects against CRC progression in mice. After three cycles of AOM/DSS treatment, WT mice developed a prominent CRC phenotype featuring the appearance of abundant colon tumors, whereas JMJD1A-deficient mice had significantly less and smaller colon tumors (Fig. 8A). Results from Ki67 staining showed that JMJD1A-deficient colon tumors exhibited markedly less cell proliferation compared with WT tumors (Fig. 8B). Consistently, the protein and mRNA levels of c-Myc, cyclin D1, and PCNA were much lower in colon tumors from JMJD1A-deficient mice than from WT mice (Fig. 8, C and D). These results provide the genetic evidence to show that JMJD1A promotes CRC progression by enhancing Wnt/β-catenin signaling. To corroborate the findings that JMJD1A promotes human CRC progression by enhancing Wnt/β-catenin signaling clinically, we analyzed the relationship between the expression of JMJD1A and the target genes of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human CRC specimens by searching the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset (GSE24514). The expression of JMJD1A was much higher in CRC specimens than the surrounding nontumorous specimens (Fig. 9A) and positively correlated with PCNA (Fig. 9B), c-Myc (Fig. 9C), cyclin D1 (Fig. 9D), and MMP9 (Fig. 9E), supporting the findings that JMJD1A promotes human CRC progression by enhancing Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Furthermore, TCGA data showed that the prognosis of CRC patients who have higher levels of JMJD1A in tumors was poorer than the CRC patients with lower levels of JMJD1A in tumors (Fig. 9F). Increasing evidence indicates that JMJD1A is overexpressed in a multitude of cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, and bladder cancer (8Fan L. Peng G. Sahgal N. Fazli L.

ISY1 regulates microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, yet its role and relevance to ESC biology remain unknown. Here, we find that highly dynamic ISY1 expression during the naive-to-primed ESC transition defines a specific phase of ""poised"" pluripotency characterized by distinct miRNA and mRNA transcriptomes and widespread poised cell contribution to mouse chimeras. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments reveal that ISY1 promotes exit from the naive state and is necessary and sufficient to induce and maintain poised pluripotency, and that persistent ISY1 overexpression inhibits the transition from the naive to the primed state. We identify a large subset of ISY1-dependent miRNAs that can rescue the inability of miRNA-deficient ESCs to establish the poised state and transition to the primed state. Thus, dynamic ISY1 regulates poised pluripotency through miRNAs to control ESC fate."
https://openalex.org/W2804440787,"Adenosine is an important neuromodulator in the central nervous system, and tissue adenosine levels increase during ischemic events, attenuating excitotoxic neuronal injury. Recently, our lab developed an electrochemical fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) method that identified rapid, spontaneous changes in adenosine concentrations that last only about 3 seconds. Here, we investigated the effects of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion on the concentration and frequency of transient adenosine release in the caudate-putamen. In anesthetized rats, data were collected for four hours: two hours of normoxia, 30 min of cerebral ischemia induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, and 90 min of reperfusion. Transient adenosine release was increased during the cerebral ischemia period and remained elevated during reperfusion. The total number of adenosine transients increased by 52% during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion compared to normoxia. The concentration of adenosine per event did not increase but the cumulative adenosine concentration during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion increased by 53% because of the higher frequency of events. Further, we evaluated the role of A2A antagonist, SCH442416, a putative neuroprotective agent to affect adenosine transients. SCH442416 significantly decreased the transient frequency during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion by 27% and the cumulative concentration by 31%. Our results demonstrate that this mode of rapid adenosine release increases during early cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Rapid adenosine release could provide fast, local neuromodulation and neuroprotection during cerebral ischemia."

However, substantial uncoupling between these paired elements during lentiviral production has been reported, especially as the distance between elements increases. We detail that PCR amplification is another major source of uncoupling, and becomes more pronounced with increased amounts of DNA template molecules and PCR cycles. To lessen uncoupling in systems that use paired elements for detection, we recommend minimizing the distance between elements, using low and equal template DNA inputs for plasmid and genomic DNA during PCR, and minimizing the number of PCR cycles. We also present a vector design for conducting combinatorial CRISPR screens that enables accurate barcode-based detection with a single short sequencing read and minimal uncoupling."

In a first trial (infection model), 32 Swiss Large White piglets (age: 24 days; average BW: 7.8 ± 0.8 kg) were randomly assigned to two experimental groups (infected [INF], noninfected [NINF]). In a subsequent trial, 72 Swiss Large White piglets (age: 26 days; average BW: 7.4 ± 1.5 kg) were blocked by BW and assigned within block to four experimental groups: NINF-CO: not infected and fed a standard control starter diet (CO); INF-CO: infected and fed the CO diet; NINF-TA: not infected and fed the CO diet supplemented with 1% chestnut extract containing 54% of hydrolysable tannins (TA); and INF-TA: infected and fed the TA diet.

https://openalex.org/W2804414244,"A hallmark of naive pluripotency is the presence of two active X chromosomes in females. It is not clear whether prevention of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is mediated by gene networks that preserve the naive state. Here, we show that robust naive pluripotent stem cell (nPSC) self-renewal represses expression of Xist, the master regulator of XCI. We found that nPSCs accumulate Xist on the male X chromosome and on both female X chromosomes as they become NANOG negative at the onset of differentiation. This is accompanied by the appearance of a repressive chromatin signature and partial X-linked gene silencing, suggesting a transient and rapid XCI-like state in male nPSCs. In the embryo, Xist is transiently expressed in males and in females from both X chromosomes at the onset of naive epiblast differentiation. In conclusion, we propose that XCI initiation is gender independent and triggered by destabilization of naive identity, suggesting that gender-specific mechanisms follow, rather than precede, XCI initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2804016787,"The objective of this study was to estimate and compare the occurrence of AMR in wild red foxes in relation to human population densities. Samples from wild red foxes (n = 528) included in the Norwegian monitoring programme on antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from food, feed and animals were included. All samples were divided into three different groups based on population density in the municipality where the foxes were hunted. Of the 528 samples included, 108 (20.5%), 328 (62.1%) and 92 (17.4%) originated from areas with low, medium and high population density, respectively. A single faecal swab was collected from each fox. All samples were plated out on a selective medium for Enterobacteriaceae for culturing followed by inclusion and susceptibility testing of one randomly selected Escherichia coli to assess the overall occurrence of AMR in the Gram-negative bacterial population. Furthermore, the samples were subjected to selective screening for detection of E. coli displaying resistance towards extended-spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. In addition, a subset of samples (n = 387) were subjected to selective culturing to detect E. coli resistant to carbapenems and colistin, and enterococci resistant to vancomycin. Of these, 98 (25.3%), 200 (51.7%) and 89 (23.0%) originated from areas with low, medium and high population density, respectively. Overall, the occurrence of AMR in indicator E. coli from wild red foxes originating from areas with different human population densities in Norway was low to moderate (8.8%). The total occurrence of AMR was significantly higher; χ2 (1,N = 336) = 6.53, p = 0.01 in areas with high population density compared to areas with medium population density. Similarly, the occurrence of fluoroquinolone resistant E. coli isolated using selective detection methods was low in areas with low population density and more common in areas with medium or high population density. In conclusion, we found indications that occurrence of AMR in wild red foxes in Norway is associated with human population density. Foxes living in urban areas are more likely to be exposed to AMR bacteria and resistance drivers from food waste, garbage, sewage, waste water and consumption of contaminated prey compared to foxes living in remote areas. The homerange of red fox has been shown to be limited thereby the red fox constitutes a good sentinel for monitoring antimicrobial resistance in the environment. Continuous monitoring on the occurrence of AMR in different wild species, ecological niches and geographical areas can facilitate an increased understanding of the environmental burden of AMR in the environment. Such information is needed to further assess the impact for humans, and enables implementation of possible control measures for AMR in humans, animals and the environment in a true ""One Health"" approach."
https://openalex.org/W2803481071,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize the conserved molecular patterns in microorganisms and trigger myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and/or TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) pathways that are critical for host defense against microbial infection. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern TLR signaling remain incompletely understood. Regulator of calcineurin-1 (RCAN1), a small evolutionarily conserved protein that inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity, suppresses inflammation during Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Here, we define the roles for RCAN1 in P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated TLR4 signaling. We compared the effects of P. aeruginosa LPS challenge on bone marrow-derived macrophages from both wild-type and RCAN1-deficient mice and found that RCAN1 deficiency increased the MyD88-NF-κB-mediated cytokine production (IL-6, TNF and MIP-2), whereas TRIF-interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE)-mediated cytokine production (IFNβ, RANTES and IP-10) was suppressed. RCAN1 deficiency caused increased IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activity in the MyD88-dependent pathway, but impaired ISRE activation and reduced IRF7 expression in the TRIF-dependent pathway. Complementary studies of a mouse model of P. aeruginosa LPS-induced acute pneumonia confirmed that RCAN1-deficient mice displayed greatly enhanced NF-κB activity and MyD88-NF-κB-mediated cytokine production, which correlated with enhanced pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils. By contrast, RCAN1 deficiency had little effect on the TRIF pathway in vivo. These findings demonstrate a novel regulatory role of RCAN1 in TLR signaling, which differentially regulates MyD88 and TRIF pathways."

Unexpectedly, Flag-H1.0 and MeCP2 occupied similar genomic regions and the Flag-H1.0 binding was not changed upon MeCP2 depletion. Furthermore, mild overexpression of H1.0 did not alter MeCP2 binding, suggesting that the functional binding of MeCP2 and H1.0 are largely independent."
https://openalex.org/W2803467429,"Although numerous studies have investigated the neurotrophic factors and hippocampal activity in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) separately each other, it is unclear whether an association between neurotrophic factors and hippocampal activity is present. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional changes in hippocampus before and after treatment with escitalopram and to associate these changes with peptides related to neuronal growth in patients with chronic PTSD and trauma survivors without PTSD. Fifteen earthquake survivors with chronic PTSD and thirteen drug naïve trauma exposed individuals without PTSD underwent fMRI scans in a block design. Serum levels of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) were measured before and after 12 weeks treatment with escitalopram. Baseline median serum level of NGF was significantly lower in patients with chronic PTSD than trauma survivors; however, 12 weeks of treatment with escitalopram significantly increased it. Higher activation was found both in left and right hippocampus for chronic PTSD group than trauma survivors. Treatment with escitalopram was significantly associated with suppression of the hyperactivation in left hippocampus in patients with chronic PTSD. Bilateral hyperactivation in hippocampus and lowered NGF may associate with neurobiological disarrangements in chronic PTSD. Treatment with escitalopram was significantly associated with both improvement in the severity of PTSD symptoms and biological alterations. Patients diagnosed with PTSD may have further and complicated deteriorations in hippocampal networks and neurotransmitter systems than individuals who had not been diagnosed with PTSD following the same traumatic experience."
https://openalex.org/W2804615786,"There are no defined correlates of protection for any intracellular pathogen, including the bacterium Francisella tularensis, which causes tularemia. Evaluating vaccine efficacy against sporadic diseases like tularemia using field trials is problematic, and therefore alternative strategies to test vaccine candidates like the Francisella Live Vaccine Strain (LVS), such as testing in animals and applying correlate measurements, are needed. Recently, we described a promising correlate strategy that predicted the degree of vaccine-induced protection in mice given parenteral challenges, primarily when using an attenuated Francisella strain. Here, we demonstrate that using peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) in this approach predicts LVS-mediated protection against respiratory challenge of Fischer 344 rats with fully virulent F. tularensis, with exceptional sensitivity and specificity. Rats were vaccinated with a panel of LVS-derived vaccines and subsequently given lethal respiratory challenges with Type A F. tularensis. In parallel, PBLs from vaccinated rats were evaluated for their functional ability to control intramacrophage Francisella growth in in vitro co-culture assays. PBLs recovered from co-cultures were also evaluated for relative gene expression using a large panel of genes identified in murine studies. In vitro control of LVS intramacrophage replication reflected the hierarchy of protection. Further, despite variability between individuals, 22 genes were significantly more up-regulated in PBLs from rats vaccinated with LVS compared to those from rats vaccinated with the variant LVS-R or heat-killed LVS, which were poorly protective. These genes included IFN-γ, IL-21, NOS2, LTA, T-bet, IL-12rβ2, and CCL5. Most importantly, combining quantifications of intramacrophage growth control with 5–7 gene expression levels using multivariate analyses discriminated protected from non-protected individuals with greater than 95% sensitivity and specificity. The results therefore support translation of this approach to non-human primates and people to evaluate new vaccines against Francisella and other intracellular pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2803334179,"Recent reports have revealed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to arise from cancer stem cells phenotypically similar to physiological hematopoietic stem cells. Myelodysplastic hematopoiesis maintains a hierarchical organization, but the proportion of several hematopoietic compartments is skewed and multiple surface markers are aberrantly expressed. These aberrant antigen expression patterns hold diagnostic and therapeutic promise. However, eradication of MDS requires targeting of early myelodysplasia propagating stem cells. This warrants an exact assessment of the differentiation stage at which aberrant expression occurs in transformed hematopoiesis. Here, we report results on the prospective and extensive dissection of the hematopoietic hierarchy in 20 patients with either low-risk MDS or MDS with excess blasts and compare it to hematopoiesis in patients with non-malignancy-associated cytopenia or B cell lymphoma without bone marrow infiltration. We found patients with MDS with excess blasts to exhibit characteristic expansions of specific immature progenitor compartments. We also identified the aberrant expression of several markers including ALDH, CLL-1, CD44, and CD47 to be specific features of hematopoiesis in MDS with excess blasts. We show that amongst these, aberrant CLL-1 expression manifested at the early uncommitted hematopoietic stem cell level, suggesting a potential role as a therapeutic target."

To carry out a molecular epidemiology analysis of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus in Warao individuals from the Delta Amacuro State of Venezuela. A total of 548 sera were tested for serological and molecular markers for HBV and HCV. The prevalence of active infection (presence of HBV surface antigen, HBsAg), exposure to HBV (presence of Antibody to HBV core antigen, anti-HBc) and anti-HCV, was 1.8%, 13% and 0% respectively. HBV exposure was significantly lower in men below 18 years old and also lower than rates previously reported in other Amerindian communities from Venezuela. Thirty one percent (31%, 25/80) of individuals without evidence of HBV infection exhibited anti-HBs titer ≥ 10U.I / ml, being significantly more frequent in individuals younger than 20 years. A higher HBV exposure was observed among HIV-1 positive individuals (33% vs 11%, p <0.005). A high prevalence of occult HBV infection was also observed (5.6%, 11/195). Phylogenetic analysis of S gene and complete HBV genomes showed that F3 is the only circulating subgenotype, different from the F2 subgenotype found in 1991 in this population. These results suggest a recent introduction of subgenotype F3, with a low divergence among the isolates. These results highlight the importance of molecular epidemiology studies for viral control, and support the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing transmission of HBV."

C6orf106 suppresses the synthesis of interferon (IFN)-α/β and proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α in response to the dsRNA mimic poly(I:C) and to Sendai virus infection. Unlike canonical inhibitors of antiviral signaling, C6orf106 blocks interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and, to a lesser extent, NF-κB activity without modulating their activation, nuclear translocation, cellular expression, or degradation. Instead, C6orf106 interacts with IRF3 and inhibits IRF3 recruitment to type I IFN promoter sequences while also reducing the nuclear levels of the coactivator proteins p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP). In summary, we have defined C6orf106 as a negative regulator of antiviral immunity that blocks IRF3-dependent cytokine production via a noncanonical and poorly defined mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2804466367,"Background Activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an attractive approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. AMPK activation reduces glucose levels in animal models of type 2 diabetes by increasing glucose uptake in skeletal muscles and reducing hepatic glucose production. Furthermore, AMPK activation ameliorates hepatic steatosis in animal models. For the clinical development of AMPK activators it is essential to have a reliable target engagement marker for appropriate dose finding and to support proof of clinical principle. While the activation of AMPK by quantification of the phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 in target tissues can be assessed pre-clinically, this is not feasible in clinical studies. Therefore, we attempted to identify and translate a peripheral target engagement biomarker downstream of AMPK activation for clinical use in blood samples. Methods For pharmacological activation of AMPK, two AMPK activators were synthesized (compound 1 and 2). A compound with structural similarities but no pharmacological effect on AMPK phosphorylation was synthesized as negative control (compound 3). Whole blood from healthy volunteers was incubated with an AMPK activator for up to 6 hours and mRNA sequencing was performed. Additionally, human PBMCs were isolated to evaluate Thr172-phosphorylation of AMPK in Western blots. In order to enable identification of translatable biomarker candidates, blood samples from HanWistar rats treated for two weeks with an AMPK activator were also subjected to mRNA sequencing. Furthermore, concentration-response curves for four biomarker candidates were recorded in human blood samples using Nanostring nCounter technology. Finally, ZDF rats were treated with increasing doses of compound 2 for five weeks to investigate the glucose-lowering efficacy. To investigate changes of mRNA expression of two selected biomarker candidates in this ZDF rat study, qRT-PCR was performed. Results Pharmacological activation of AMPK in human PBMCs revealed an increase in Thr172-phosphorylation of AMPK, confirming target engagement in these blood cells. RNA sequencing of human blood samples identified 608 deregulated genes after AMPK activation. Additionally, AMPK activation led to deregulation of 367 genes in whole blood from HanWistar rats which mapped to the respective human genes. 22 genes out of the intersection of genes deregulated in both species are proposed as potential translatable target engagement biomarker candidates. The most prominent genes were transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB, osteoactivin), calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGLYRP1) and Ras homolog gene family, member B (RHOB). Specificity for AMPK was shown by testing inactive compound 3 in HanWistar rats. The exposure-effect relationship for GPNMB was investigated in a subchronic study in diabetic ZDF rats. GPNMB showed a dose-dependent up-regulation both acutely and after subchronic dosing. GPNMB up-regulation correlated with an increased Thr172-phosphorylation of AMPK in liver and quadriceps muscle in rats. Conclusion GPNMB has been identified as a translatable target engagement biomarker for use in clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2804490133,"White adipose tissue expands through both adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia and it is hypothesized that fibrosis or excess accumulation of extracellular matrix within adipose tissue may limit tissue expansion contributing to metabolic dysfunction. The pathways that control adipose tissue remodeling are only partially understood, however it is likely that adipose tissue stromal and perivascular progenitors participate in fibrotic remodeling and also serve as adipocyte progenitors. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of the secreted extracellular matrix protein aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP) on adipose progenitor differentiation in the context of adipose tissue fibrosis. Treatment of 10T1/2 mouse cells with recombinant ACLP suppressed adipogenesis and enhanced myofibroblast differentiation, which was dependent on transforming growth factor-β receptor kinase activity. Mice fed a chronic high fat diet exhibited white adipose tissue fibrosis with elevated ACLP expression and cellular fractionation of these depots revealed that ACLP was co-expressed with collagens primarily in the inflammatory cell depleted stromal-vascular fraction (SVF). SVF cells isolated from mice fed a high fat diet secreted increased amounts of ACLP compared to low fat diet control SVF. These cells also exhibited reduced adipogenic differentiation capacity in vitro. Importantly, differentiation studies in primary human adipose stromal cells revealed that mature adipocytes do not express ACLP and exogenous ACLP administration blunted their differentiation potential while upregulating myofibroblastic markers. Collectively, these studies identify ACLP as a stromal derived mediator of adipose progenitor differentiation that may limit adipocyte expansion during white adipose tissue fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2804015522,"Knowledge of the biomechanical properties of the human cornea is crucial for understanding the development of corneal diseases and impact of surgical treatments (e.g., corneal laser surgery, corneal cross-linking). Using a Surface Force Apparatus we investigated the transient viscous response of the anterior cornea from donor human eyes compressed between macroscopic crossed cylinders. Corneal biomechanics was analyzed using linear viscoelastic theory and interpreted in the framework of a biphasic model of soft hydrated porous tissues, including a significant contribution from the pressurization and viscous flow of fluid within the corneal tissue. Time-resolved measurements of tissue deformation and careful determination of the relaxation time provided an elastic modulus in the range between 0.17 and 1.43 MPa, and fluid permeability of the order of 10−13 m4/(N∙s). The permeability decreased as the deformation was increased above a strain level of about 10%, indicating that the interstitial space between fibrils of the corneal stromal matrix was reduced under the effect of strong compression. This effect may play a major role in determining the observed rate-dependent non-linear stress-strain response of the anterior cornea, which underlies the shape and optical properties of the tissue."

In this study, we report that activation of SMO with SHH (Sonic Hedgehog) or a small agonist, purmorphamine, rapidly causes a prolongation of the action potential duration that is sensitive to a SMO inhibitor. In contrast, neither of the SMO agonists prolonged the action potential in cardiomyocytes from transgenic GiCT/TTA mice, in which Gi signaling is impaired, suggesting that the effect of SMO is mediated by Gi proteins. Investigation of the mechanism underlying the change in action potential kinetics revealed that activation of SMO selectively reduces outward voltage-gated K+ repolarizing (Kv) currents in isolated cardiomyocytes and that it induces a down-regulation of membrane levels of Kv4.3 in cardiomyocytes and intact hearts from WT but not from GiCT/TTA mice. Moreover, perfusion of intact hearts with Shh or purmorphamine increased the ventricular repolarization time (QT interval) and induced ventricular arrhythmias.

Recently, however, an L-glucose catabolic pathway has been discovered in Paracoccus laeviglucosivorans, and the genes responsible cloned. Scyllo-inositol dehydrogenase is involved in the first step in the pathway that oxidizes L-glucose to produce L-glucono-1,5-lactone with concomitant reduction of NAD+ dependent manner. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ternary complex of scyllo-inositol dehydrogenase with NAD+ and L-glucono-1,5-lactone at 1.8 Å resolution. The enzyme adopts a homo-tetrameric structure, similar to those of the inositol dehydrogenase family, and the electron densities of the bound sugar was clearly observed, allowing identification of the residues responsible for interaction with the substrate in the catalytic site. In addition to the conserved catalytic residues (Lys106, Asp191, and His195), another residue, His318, located in the loop region of the adjacent subunit, is involved in substrate recognition. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the role of these residues in catalytic activity. We also report the complex structures of the enzyme with myo-inositol and scyllo-inosose. The Arg178 residue located in the flexible loop at the entrance of the catalytic site is also involved in substrate recognition, and plays an important role in accepting both L-glucose and inositols as substrates. On the basis of these structural features, which have not been identified in the known inositol dehydrogenases, and a phylogenetic analysis of IDH family enzymes, we suggest a novel subfamily of the GFO/IDH/MocA family. Since many enzymes in this family have not biochemically characterized, our results could promote to find their activities with various substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2803609631,"Treatment failures in advanced lung cancer are frequent events affecting patients during or after first-line chemotherapy. International guidelines recommend second-line chemotherapy. However, around one half of patients who experience disease progression enter a systemic second-line therapy. In the herein qualitative study, we investigated patients' thoughts and attitudes determining the decision to undergo a second-line chemotherapy.Thirty-three purposively selected patients who recently accepted second-line or palliative chemotherapy were invited to participate in this survey consisting of semi-structured in-depth interviews. Grounded theory was applied to investigate participants' perceptions of the context that have surrounded their decision to undergo palliative chemotherapy.For most patients, tumor burden and reduced quality of life in relation with lung cancer itself were major drivers of the decision-making process. There was a balance between two different attitudes: making a decision to undergo a new line of chemotherapy or starting a psychological process in order to accept end of life. Choosing between these two attitudes allowed the patient to keep the matter of palliative care at a distance. Even in case of low chance of success, many patients who worried about their life partner's future would accept a new chemotherapy line. Some patients experienced ambivalent thoughts regarding social network, particularly about their family as daily function impairment required an increased need for relative's support. The initial ""Worrying about others"" thoughts left place to in an increasing self-need of care as those provided by relatives; this phenomenon might increase patients' self- perception of being a burden for others. Confidence previously established with formal caregiver support was another major decision driver: some patients with sustained confidence in their medical staff may have privileged this formal support rather than family support when the latter was perceived as weak, insufficient or intrusive.This study identified three domains involved into a complex interplay for lung cancer patients' decision regarding second-line palliative chemotherapy: (i) perception of the definitive loss of health, (ii) interactions between idiosyncrasy (hope, disease burden) and environment (healthcare and social network support), and (iii) patient's subjective evaluation of chemotherapy benefit-risk."

Flowering and fertilization occur above ground, while the following processes of pod formation and development proceed in the soil. The zygote divides only few times to develop into pre-embryo and then further embryo developmental process stops when the gynoecium is exposed to light condition or normal day/night period. In this study, eight phytochrome genes were identified in two wild peanuts (four in Arachis duranensis and four in Arachis ipaensis). Using RACE and homologous cloning, the full CDS of AhphyA, AhphyA-like, AhphyB and AhphyE were acquired in cultivated peanut. Protein structure analysis showed that the conservative coding domains of phytochromes from a number of other plant species were found in these proteins. The C-terminal of AhphyA, AhphyA-like and AhphyB could interact with phytochrome-interacting factor 3 in vitro. The expression patterns of these genes in various tissues were analyzed by qRT-PCR, and significant differences were observed. Interestingly, the expression levels of AhphyA-like changed significantly during gynophore growth and early pod development. Furthermore, protein accumulation patterns of AhphyA and AhphyB in gynophore were different during early pod development stages in that AhphyA and AhphyB proteins were not detected in S1 and S2 gynophores, while significant accumulation of AhphyA and AhphyB were detected in S3 gynophore. These results provided evidence that phytochromes mediated light signal transduction may play key roles in peanut geocarpy development."

While numerous studies have analysed its psychometric properties using exploratory and various kinds of confirmatory factor analyses, only few studies used Rasch models and none a multidimensional one. Methods The present study applies a multidimensional Rasch model using a sample of 518 respondents representative for the Austrian general population aged 18 to 65. A one-dimensional model, a four-dimensional model reflecting the subscale structure suggested by [1], and a four-dimensional model with the background variables gender and age were applied. Results While the one-dimensional model showed relatively good fit, the four-dimensional model fitted much better. EAP reliability indices were generally satisfying and the latent correlations varied between 0.31 and 0.88. In the analysis involving background variables, we found a limited effect of the participants’ gender. DIF effects were found unveiling some peculiarities. The two-items subscale Interpersonal Difficulties showed severe weaknesses and the Positive Affect subscale with the reversed item wordings also showed unexpected results. Conclusions While a one-dimensional over-all score might still contain helpful information, the differentiation according to the latent dimension is strongly preferable. Altogether, the CES-D can be recommended as a screening instrument, however, some modifications seem indicated."
https://openalex.org/W2803861785,"This paper presents a robust 3D point cloud registration algorithm based on bidirectional Maximum Correntropy Criterion (MCC). Comparing with traditional registration algorithm based on the mean square error (MSE), using the MCC is superior in dealing with complex registration problem with non-Gaussian noise and large outliers. Since the MCC is considered as a probability measure which weights the corresponding points for registration, the noisy points are penalized. Moreover, we propose to use bidirectional measures which can maximum the overlapping parts and avoid the registration result being trapped into a local minimum. Both of these strategies can better apply the information theory method to the point cloud registration problem, making the algorithm more robust. In the process of implementation, we integrate the fixed-point optimization technique based on the iterative closest point algorithm, resulting in the correspondence and transformation parameters that are solved iteratively. The comparison experiments under noisy conditions with related algorithms have demonstrated good performance of the proposed algorithm."

The mean number of patients with CRBSI per 1000 patients was of 3.49 (0.42; 12.57), 6.82 (1.86; 17.38), 26.04 (14.64; 42.58), and 23.05 (12.32; 39.09) for CHG-T1, CHG-T4, PVI-T1, and PVI-T4, respectively. In comparison to the 1-time PVI solution, the 1-time CHG solution avoids 22.55 CRBSI /1,000 patients, and saves €1,076 per patient. This saving is not statistically significant at a 0.05 level because of the overlap of 95% confidence intervals for mean costs per patient in each group. Conversely, the difference in effectiveness between the CHG-T1 solution and the PVI-T1 solution is statistically significant.The CHG-T1 solution is more effective at the same cost than the PVI-T1 solution. CHG-T1, CHG-T4 and PVI-T4 solutions are statistically comparable for cost and effectiveness. This study is based on the data from the RCT from 11 French intensive care units registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01629550)."

Full-Text PDF Open Access Since their discovery more than 50 years ago, iron–sulfur (Fe-S) clusters have been shown to play essential functions in a vast array of proteins, reflecting their ancient origin and functional versatility (1Johnson D.C.

Fe-S clusters in proteins exist as various combinations of iron and sulfur atoms, including cubane-type [4Fe-4S] clusters, [2Fe-2S] and [3Fe-4S], as well as the [8Fe-7S] clusters found in nitrogenases from Azotobacter vinelandii. Fe-S clusters are typically bound by cysteinyl ligands, although other amino acid residues have been reported to be involved in Fe-S cluster coordination or stabilization (2Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N.

In cells, Fe-S clusters serve as conduits for electron transport in photosynthetic and respiratory complexes, sensors for iron and oxygen (3Rouault T.A.

Because of these essential functions, efforts to study the consequences of disruption to the Fe-S cluster assembly pathways have been stymied. A new study by Crooks et al. (6Crooks D.R. Maio N.

Fe-S clusters can spontaneously assemble in solution, but Fe-S cluster assembly in cells, although not fully understood, is a tightly controlled and well-orchestrated process. In prokaryotes, several Fe-S cluster biogenesis machineries, each involving multiple proteins, have been identified, including nitrogen fixation (NIF), sulfur utilization factor (SUF), and iron–sulfur cluster (ISC) 2The abbreviations used are:ISCiron–sulfur clusterLIASlipoic acid synthase. 2The abbreviations used are:ISCiron–sulfur clusterLIASlipoic acid synthase. systems (7Netz D.J.

A functionally related ISC system exists in yeast and mammals, but the presence of organelles complicates the situation (3Rouault T.A. Mammalian iron-sulphur proteins: Novel insights into biogenesis and function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 (25425402): 45-5510.1038/nrm3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For instance, in addition to the mitochondrial ISC system, maturation of cytosolic and nuclear Fe-S proteins requires the cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly (CIA) machinery (7Netz D.J. Mascarenhas J. Stehling O. Pierik A.J. Lill R. Maturation of cytosolic and nuclear iron-sulfur proteins.Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24 (24314740): 303-31210.1016/j.tcb.2013.11.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and other components for Fe-S cluster trafficking. Furthermore, some evidence suggests the possible de novo synthesis of Fe-S clusters in the cytosolic and nuclear compartments (3Rouault T.A. Mammalian iron-sulphur proteins: Novel insights into biogenesis and function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 (25425402): 45-5510.1038/nrm3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). iron–sulfur cluster lipoic acid synthase. iron–sulfur cluster lipoic acid synthase. One key step in the biogenesis of Fe-S clusters, in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, is their assembly onto an intermediate scaffold protein called iron–sulfur cluster assembly enzyme (ISCU) prior to their ATP-dependent transfer to recipient proteins. Thus, ISCU is a key target for scientists seeking to understand the outcomes of Fe–S cluster assembly disorders. However, in agreement with its central function, complete loss of ISCU activity leads to acute Fe-S cluster deficiency, a condition that is lethal for all organisms (8Nordin A. Larsson E. Thornell L.E. Holmberg M. Tissue-specific splicing of ISCU results in a skeletal muscle phenotype in myopathy with lactic acidosis, while complete loss of ISCU results in early embryonic death in mice.Hum. Genet. 2011; 129 (21165651): 371-37810.1007/s00439-010-0931-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). How then can we investigate the effects of ISCU deficiency and acute loss of Fe-S proteins on cellular physiology? To address this tricky question, Crooks et al. (6Crooks D.R. Maio N. Lane A.N. Jarnik M. Higashi R.M. Haller R.G. Yang Y. Fan T.W.-M. Linehan W.M. Rouault T.A. Acute loss of iron–sulfur clusters results in metabolic reprogramming and generation of lipid droplets in mammalian cells.J. Biol.

Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Structure, function, and formation of biological iron-sulfur clusters.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74 (15952888): 247-28110.1146/annurev.biochem.74.082803.133518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Early studies have shown that a conserved aspartate residue (Asp-37 in A. vinelandii) adjacent to one of the cysteine residues ligating the Fe-S cluster is responsible for releasing ISCU's nascent Fe-S cluster to recipient proteins (2Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N. Cash V.L. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. NifS-directed assembly of a transient [2Fe-2S] cluster within the NifU protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97 (10639125): 599-60410.1073/pnas.97.2.599Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The authors thus changed the corresponding residue (Asp-71) in the human ISCU homolog to obtain a mutant scaffold with a more stably bound Fe-S cluster that should not be transferable. In addition, they constructed another mutant in which one of the coordinating cysteine residues (Cys-69) was mutated, with the aim of preventing Fe-S cluster formation on ISCU. These two mutants were each integrated into a human cell line (HEK293 Flp-InTM cells) under a doxycycline-controlled promoter, which tightly repressed their expression. When doxycycline was added to the cell medium, growth was halted, but no significant cell death was measured, suggesting a cytostatic effect of the mutations. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analyses showed that the expression levels and binding of NFS1, ISD11, and frataxin, three well-known binding partners of ISCU, were not changed compared with the WT ISCU, demonstrating that the mutants have not lost their interaction properties. However, EM revealed dramatic morphological alterations in mitochondria, and two reporter systems indicated that the cells were experiencing iron starvation. One of these reporter systems reads out the activity of aconitase, which interconverts citrate and isocitrate dependent on the correct insertion of an Fe-S cluster; this readout clearly showed a loss of both mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitase activities. A broader analysis including the radical SAM enzyme lipoic acid synthase (LIAS) (9Cicchillo R.M. Booker S.J. Mechanistic investigations of lipoic acid biosynthesis in Escherichia coli: Both sulfur atoms in lipoic acid are contributed by the same lipoyl synthase polypeptide.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127 (15740115): 2860-286110.1021/ja042428uCrossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) revealed a decrease in LIAS abundance upon expression of the ISCU mutants. Because lipoate, the product of LIAS, is crucial for several mitochondrial enzymes, Crooks et al. (6Crooks D.R. Maio N. Lane A.N. Jarnik M. Higashi R.M. Haller R.G. Yang Y. Fan T.W.-M. Linehan W.M. Rouault T.A. Acute loss of iron–sulfur clusters results in metabolic reprogramming and generation of lipid droplets in mammalian cells.J. Biol.

Consistent with the decrease in LIAS expression, the authors measured a decrease in lipoylation but not necessarily a reduced expression of known lipoylated proteins, similar to what is observed in some human pathologies linked to a defect in Fe-S cluster assembly (3Rouault T.A. Mammalian iron-sulphur proteins: Novel insights into biogenesis and function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 (25425402): 45-5510.1038/nrm3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Given that citrate is a central metabolite in several biochemical pathways, the authors performed metabolic analysis to gauge the impact of these profound changes in protein expression and enzyme activity. They observed major consequences: an 11-fold increase in levels of citrate, the inhibition of glycolysis (likely through citrate-mediated inhibition of the kinase PFK-1), a decrease in total cellular AMP and ADP levels, and the shunting of glucose 6-phosphate into the pentose phosphate pathway, a route that does not require Fe-S cluster–dependent enzymes. Another metabolic pathway that is independent of iron or Fe-S clusters is the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, which can also use the now abundant citrate as a substrate. As the authors elegantly showed, de novo fatty acid biosynthesis was indeed induced, and, as visible consequence, cytosolic lipid droplets accumulated (Fig. 1) (10Krahmer N. Farese Jr, R.V. Walther T.C. Balancing the fat: Lipid droplets and human disease.EMBO Mol. Med. 2013; 5 (23740690): 973-98310.1002/emmm.201100671Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Collectively, the study by Crooks et al. (6Crooks D.R. Maio N. Lane A.N. Jarnik M. Higashi R.M. Haller R.G. Yang Y. Fan T.W.-M. Linehan W.M. Rouault T.A.

It also illustrates how acute Fe-S cluster deficiency impacts metabolism, leading to profound metabolic reprogramming with dramatic cellular consequences. Unexpectedly, one of the major findings was that the carbon flux is diverted to iron-independent pathways with the notable induction of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. More broadly, these findings hold significance for the biochemical and medical communities because the cellular phenotype induced mirrors pathological conditions encountered, for example, in nonadipose tissues such as heart and liver with possible connections to Friedreich's ataxia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Further research at the intersection between Fe-S cluster biogenesis and cellular metabolism is thus more than likely to bring unexpected insights into the pathogenesis of poorly understood diseases."

In this study, we analyze the usability of iBG-STAR, the first blood glucose meter connectable to a smartphone. This technology records glucometer measurements, removing the burden of documentation from diabetic patients. This study assesses the potential for implementation of iBG-STAR in routine care. Twelve long-term diabetic patients (4 males; median age of 66.5 years) were enrolled in the study. N = 4/12 reported diabetic polyneuropathy. Reported subjective mental workload for all tasks related to iBG-STAR was on average lower than 12 points, corresponding to the verbal code 'nearly no effort needed'. A ""Post Study System Usability Questionnaire"", evaluated the glucometer at an average value of 2.06 (SD = 1.02) on a 7-Likert-scale (1 = 'I fully agree' to 7 = 'I completely disagree') for usability. These results represent a positive user-experience. Patients with polyneuropathy may experience physical difficulties in completing the tasks, thereby affecting usability. Technologically savvy patients (n = 6) with a positive outlook on diabetes assessed the product as a suitable tool for themselves and would recommend to other diabetic patients. The main barrier to regular use was treating physicians' inability to retrieve digitally recorded data. This barrier was due to a shortcoming in interoperability of mobile devices and medical information systems."

Changes in food web structure have the potential to alter trophic transfer, partitioning, and biogeochemical cycling of elements in the ocean. Here we investigated the impact of realistic end-of-the-century CO2 concentrations on the development and partitioning of the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and silica pools in a coastal pelagic ecosystem (Gullmar Fjord, Sweden). We covered the entire winter-to-summer plankton succession (100 days) in two sets of five pelagic mesocosms, with one set being CO2 enriched (~760 μatm pCO2) and the other one left at ambient CO2 concentrations. Elemental mass balances were calculated and we highlight important challenges and uncertainties we have faced in the closed mesocosm system. Our key observations under high CO2 were: (1) A significantly amplified transfer of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus from primary producers to higher trophic levels, during times of regenerated primary production. (2) A prolonged retention of all three elements in the pelagic food web that significantly reduced nitrogen and phosphorus sedimentation by about 11 and 9%, respectively. (3) A positive trend in carbon fixation (relative to nitrogen) that appeared in the particulate matter pool as well as the downward particle flux. This excess carbon counteracted a potential reduction in carbon sedimentation that could have been expected from patterns of nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes. Our findings highlight the potential for ocean acidification to alter partitioning and cycling of carbon and nutrients in the surface ocean but also show that impacts are temporarily variable and likely depending upon the structure of the plankton food web."

Spectral data obtained from swabs placed directly on the spectrometer were divided into calibration and testing sets for developing and validating discriminant models set up to provide yes/no predictions of: vaginal vs. non-vaginal use, presence vs. no presence of each test product, and presence vs. no presence of semen. Further validation of models was performed using vaginal swabs collected from a clinical study evaluating vaginally administered placebo insert formulations.For each discriminant model developed to predict vaginal vs. non-vaginal use, presence vs. no presence of each test product, and presence vs. no presence of semen, classified validation samples not included in the model development were correctly identified into their respective classes with minimal prediction error. Clinically obtained vaginal swabs collected 15-60 minutes after placebo insert use were also correctly identified, further validating the models.Our findings demonstrate the proof of concept that IR spectroscopy can be a method for rapid detection and characterization of microbicide products and biological fluids present in vaginal swabs.

In this work, we employed an in silico approach to study the genes coding for enzymes of the genomes of three commercially important plants, soybean (Glycine max), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and corn (Zea mays), as well as 15 plant pathogens (4 bacteria and 11 fungi), focusing on revealing a set of essential and non-homologous isofunctional enzymes (NISEs) that could be prioritized as drug targets. By combining sequence and structural data, we obtained an initial set of 568 cases of analogy, of which 97 were validated and further refined, revealing a subset of 29 essential enzymatic activities with a total of 119 different structural forms, most belonging to central metabolic routes, including the carbohydrate metabolism, the metabolism of amino acids, among others.

https://openalex.org/W2805007236,"Purpose Osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells. An imbalance in the differentiation of these lineages could affect the preservation of bone integrity. Several studies have suggested the importance of this imbalance in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis after kidney transplant (KT), but the role of bone marrow adiposity in this process is not well known, and if the treatment with the anti-absorptive (zoledronic acid-ZA) drugs could attenuate bone loss. Thus, our objective was compare bone marrow adiposity, osteoblasts and osteocytes before and after KT, verify an association between bone remodeling process (Turnover, Volume, and Mineralization—TMV classification), the osteocyte sclerostin expression to evaluate if there is a role of Wnt pathway, as well as the effect of ZA on these cells. Methods We studied 29 new living-donor KT patients. One group received ZA at the time of KT plus cholecalciferol for twelve months, and the other group received only cholecalciferol. Bone biopsies were performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. Histomorphometric evaluation was performed in bone and bone marrow adipocytes. Sclerostin (Scl) expression in osteocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Results Some bone marrow adiposity parameters were increased before KT. After KT, some of them remained increased and they worsened with the use of ZA. In the baseline, lower bone Volume and Turnover, were associated with increased bone marrow adiposity parameters (some of them). After KT, both groups showed the same associations. Osteocyte Scl expression after KT decreased with the use of ZA. We observed also an inverse association between bone adiposity parameters and lower osteocyte sclerostin expression 12 months after KT. Conclusion In conclusion, the present study suggests that KT fails to normalize bone marrow adiposity, and it even gets worse with the use of ZA. Moreover, bone marrow adiposity is inversely associated with bone Volume and Turnover, which seems to be accentuated by the antiresorptive therapy."

The ratio of truncal fat to total body fat mass (%FMtrunk/FMtotal) was calculated as a representative parameter for truncal fat distribution. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite of ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization (TVR), non-procedural myocardial infarction, cardiac death at 5 years.During the median follow-up duration of 1780 days, MACE occurred in 22.0% of patients, with the highest-quartile group of %FMtrunk/FMtotal having a higher rate than the lowest quartile group (27.8% vs. 15.3%; log rank p = 0.026). The difference was driven by a higher rate of ischemia-driven TVR (25.9% vs. 9.9%; log rank p = 0.008). In multivariable Cox regression analyses, %FMtrunk/FMtotal was independently associated with MACE (hazard ratio: 1.075; 95% CI: 1.022-1.131; p = 0.005), but body mass index (BMI) was not.In DES-treated patients, truncal fat distribution is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes and is more clinically relevant than BMI."
