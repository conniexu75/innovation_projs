https://openalex.org/W1557712018,"The presence of heme-containing catalase in rat heart mitochondria (20 +/- 5 units/mg) was demonstrated by biochemical and immunocytochemical analysis. Intact rat heart mitochondria efficiently consumed exogenously added H2O2. The rate of H2O2 consumption was not influenced by succinate, glutamate/malate, or N-ethylmaleimide but was significantly inhibited by cyanide. Hydrogen peroxide decomposition by mitochondria yielded molecular oxygen in a 2:1 stoichiometry, consistent with a catalytic mechanism. Mitochondrial fractionation studies and quantitative electron microscopic immunocytochemistry revealed that most catalase was matrix-associated. Electrophoretic analysis and Western blotting of the mitochondrial matrix fraction indicated the presence of a protein with similar electrophoretic mobility to bovine and rat liver catalase and immunoreactive to anti-catalase antibody. Myocardial tissue has a lower catalase-specific activity and a greater mitochondrial H2O2 production/g of tissue than most organs. Thus catalase, representing 0.025% of heart mitochondrial protein, is important for detoxifying mitochondrial derived H2O2 and represents a key antioxidant defense mechanism for myocardial tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1517806507,"The molecular mechanism by which interleukin (IL)-1 inhibits insulin secretion and ultimately causes destruction of the pancreatic beta-cell remains unknown. Evidence is presented which suggests that IL-1 beta-induced inhibition of insulin secretion is dependent on the metabolism of L-arginine to nitric oxide. NG-Monomethylarginine, a competitive inhibitor of the L-arginine-dependent enzyme nitric oxide synthase, completely prevents IL-1-induced inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion as well as nitrite production by islets. It is further shown that IL-1 beta induces nitric oxide formation in islets as evidenced by an electron paramagnetic resonance feature at g = 2.04 which is similar to previously reported iron-nitrosyl complexes formed from the destruction of iron-sulfur centers by nitric oxide. Inhibition of the nitric oxide synthase by NG-monomethylarginine completely prevents the formation of this EPR signal in islets. These results show that IL-1-induced inhibition of insulin secretion is mediated through formation of nitric oxide and suggest that the generation of nitric oxide may represent the cellular mechanism responsible for beta-cell destruction."
https://openalex.org/W1526360825,"A peripheral membrane protein with a relative molecular mass of 93,000 Da is associated with cytoplasmic domains of the inhibitory glycine receptor of mammalian spinal cord. Here, evidence is given that this 93-kDa protein binds to polymerized tubulin. First, tubulin cofractionated with the 93-kDa protein upon affinity purification of the glycine receptor. Second, tubulin bound to the isolated 93-kDa protein in an overlay procedure. Third, in assays containing the purified glycine receptor, the 93-kDa protein as well as the glycine receptor alpha and beta subunits coassembled with tubulin and microtubules. The interaction of the 93-kDa protein with tubulin displayed high affinity (KD approximately 2.5 nM) and significant cooperativity (Hill coefficient approximately 2.1) and approached a stoichiometry of approximately 1:4 under saturating conditions. These data suggest that the 93-kDa protein anchors the glycine receptor at postsynaptic sites via binding to subsynaptic tubulin."
https://openalex.org/W1526116399,"To define functionally critical regions of the high affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RI), we stably transfected P815 cells with mutated cDNAs coding for subunits with truncated cytoplasmic domains (CD). In addition, to examine further the role of the beta subunit, stable transfectants expressing chimeric Fc epsilon RI without beta subunits were generated. Transfectants were tested for receptor-mediated changes in intracellular Ca2+, for stimulated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, and for protein tyrosine phosphorylation. In all cases these biochemical signals were affected coordinately, suggesting that they are coupled, possibly in a single pathway. Truncation of the alpha subunit or of the NH2-terminal CD of the beta subunit had no effect, but Fc epsilon RIs with beta subunits missing the COOH-terminal CD were inactive. Interestingly, receptors in cells transfected only with human Fc epsilon RI(alpha) (which utilize the gamma chains endogenously synthesized by the P815 cells but which contain no beta subunits) responded normally. Therefore, the beta subunit influences the functions studied but is not essential. Although structural analysis excluded a straightforward mechanism, truncation of the CD of the gamma chain led to loss of signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1532161523,"The rat erbA alpha locus encodes two overlapping mRNAs, alpha 1 and alpha 2, which are identical except for their most 3' exons. alpha 1 mRNA encodes a thyroid hormone receptor, while alpha 2 encodes an altered ligand binding domain of unknown function. Previous studies have shown that the ratio of alpha 1 to alpha 2 is highest in cells expressing a high level of a third RNA, Rev-ErbA alpha mRNA, which is transcribed in the opposite direction and is complementary to alpha 2 but not alpha 1 mRNA. It was hypothesized that base pairing with Rev-ErbA alpha blocks splicing of alpha 2 mRNA, thereby favoring formation of the non-overlapping alpha 1. To test this model, a system was developed in which alpha 2 pre-mRNAs were accurately spliced in vitro. Splicing was inhibited by the addition of a 5-fold excess of antisense RNAs containing the 3' end of Rev-ErbA alpha mRNA. Both an antisense RNA extending across the 3' splice site and a shorter RNA complementary only to exon sequences efficiently blocked splicing. However, splicing was only inhibited by complementary RNAs. These observations are consistent with a mechanism in which base pairing with a complementary RNA regulates alternative processing of alpha 1 and alpha 2 mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1600746052,"Treatment of rat hepatocytes with epidermal growth factor (EGF) produced an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) in conjunction with the mobilization of Ca2+. Approximately 30% of the total PLC-gamma was tyrosine-phosphorylated with a maximum being reached after 30 s of incubation with EGF. Pretreatment of the rats with pertussis toxin prior to isolation of the hepatocytes blocked EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma and Ca2+ mobilization but had no effect on autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor or Ca2+ responses elicited by angiotensin II or phenylephrine. Under these conditions Gi protein alpha subunits were fully ADP-ribosylated. A 41-kDa Gi protein alpha subunit was found to be present in the anti-PLC-gamma immune complex after EGF stimulation as shown by in vitro ADP-ribosylation using [32P]NAD+ and activated pertussis toxin. The kinetics of association between PLC-gamma with Gi alpha protein reached a maximum after 1 min of incubation with EGF. Antibodies specific for the EGF receptor also coimmunoprecipitated a Gi protein alpha subunit. Treatment of hepatocytes with EGF caused first an increase and then a decrease in the amount of Gi protein alpha subunit associated with the EGF receptor. In contrast, studies with cultured rat liver (WB) cells, a cell line in which EGF stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis is not inhibited by pertussis toxin, showed that a stable complex of Gi alpha was not formed with either PLC-gamma or EGF receptor immunoprecipitates. These results indicate that a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi protein is uniquely involved in the signal transduction pathway mediating EGF-induced activation of PLC-gamma and Ca2+ mobilization in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1886195916,"The effects of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (G-kinase), a major cellular receptor of cGMP, were investigated in activated human neutrophils. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that G-kinase translocated from a diffuse localization in the cytoplasm to the cytoskeleton and nucleus after stimulation with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), and transiently co-localized with the intermediate filament protein, vimentin. During this time period, the most remarkable co-localization of G-kinase and vimentin was observed between 1-2.5 min stimulation with fMLP. At that time co-localization of G-kinase and vimentin was predominantly confined to filaments which extended from regions adjacent to the nucleus into the uropod. Distinctive localization for only G-kinase was observed at the microtubule organizing center and euchromatin of the nucleus. The filamentous staining pattern for G-kinase and vimentin was enhanced in the presence of 8-Br-cGMP. Coincident with co-localization of G-kinase and vimentin in adherent neutrophils was a transient increase in cGMP levels and an increase in the phosphorylation of vimentin in fMLP-stimulated cells. The increase in cGMP levels was dependent upon cell adherence, was enhanced by preincubating neutrophils with L-arginine (the precursor for nitric oxide synthesis), and attenuated with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Phosphorylation of vimentin in the fMLP-stimulated neutrophil was observed in the presence or absence of exogenous cGMP, although in the presence of low concentrations of 8-Br-cGMP a more rapid phosphorylation of vimentin was observed that correlated with the enhanced co-localization of G-kinase and vimentin. Phosphorylation of vimentin was not observed in non-activated cells treated with 8-Br-cGMP, suggesting that phosphorylation only occurs when G-kinase is co-localized with vimentin. The presence of the protein kinase C inhibitors, staurosporine or H-7, did not inhibit vimentin phosphorylation during fMLP stimulation, while 8-Br-cGMP enhanced phosphorylation in fMLP-treated cells. This suggests that neither protein kinase C nor cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalyze the phosphorylation of vimentin in neutrophils activated by fMLP. These results indicate that vimentin and G-kinase are co-localized in neutrophils and that vimentin is phosphorylated by G-kinase in response to the co-localization of the two proteins. A model for the targeting of G-kinase and vimentin is presented which hypothesizes that the transient redistribution of G-kinase may regulate neutrophil activation."
https://openalex.org/W1480839249,"In this study we describe the activation of a protein kinase which phosphorylates a peptide, T669, comprising amino acids 663-681 of the epidermal growth factor receptor and containing the phosphate acceptor site Pro-Leu-Thr669-Pro. In the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line KB, T669 kinase activity in cytosolic extracts peaked (up to 15-fold compared with basal levels) 15-30 min after addition of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and closely paralleled receptor occupancy with a half-maximally effective concentration of approximately 100 pM IL-1 alpha. IL-1 treatment elevated T669 kinase activity to a variable extent in selected fibroblast lines, the hepatoma cell line HepG2, and the murine thymoma EL4 6.1. An IL-1 receptor-negative EL4 variant and the B cell lines 70Z/3, CB23, and RPMI 1788 did not respond in this way. All of the cell lines except 70Z/3 showed increased levels of T669 kinase when treated with the protein kinase C activator phorbol myristate acetate and/or with epidermal growth factor. This finding is in agreement with a previous study (Countaway, J. L., Northwood, I. C., and Davis, R. J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 10828-10835). Activators of protein kinase A did not mimic the ability of IL-1 to stimulate T669 kinase activity, nor did the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine abrogate the effect of IL-1. T669 kinase activity from IL-1-stimulated KB cells was partially purified by ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and size exclusion chromatography. The partially purified enzyme phosphorylated myelin basic protein, a characteristic substrate of microtubule-associated protein-2 kinase (MAP-2 kinase) and the peptide Arg-Arg-Arg-(Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser)4 from RNA polymerase II. Western blotting of chromatographic fractions revealed that T669 kinase activity corresponded with two proteins of 43 and 45 kilodaltons which cross-reacted with antibodies raised against peptide sequences of rat extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/microtubule-associated protein-2 kinase. T669 kinase activity was critically dependent on the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. Since both the 43- and 45-kDa proteins, immunoprecipitated from [32P]phosphate-labeled cells, demonstrated a dramatic increase in their levels of serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation after brief treatment with IL-1, we conclude that IL-1 modulates the activity of these extracellular signal-regulated kinase/microtubule-associated protein-2 kinases by altering the level of their phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1500256341,"The binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to its cell surface receptor (EGF-R) results in a number of intracellular responses including the activation of the receptor intracellular tyrosine kinase. Receptor oligomerization induced by ligand binding has been suggested to play an important role in signal transduction. However, the mechanisms involved in oligomerization and signal transduction are poorly understood. We have produced and purified several milligrams of recombinant extracellular domain of the EGF receptor (EGF-Rx) using the baculovirus/insect cell expression system. The baculovirus-generated EGF-Rx is glycosylated, has had its signal peptide correctly cleaved, and exhibits a dissociation constant for EGF similar to that for solubilized full-length receptor, of about 100 nM. The binding of EGF to EGF-Rx leads to the formation of receptor dimers and higher oligomerization states which are irreversibly captured using the covalent cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate. Interestingly, purified receptor monomers and dimers, stabilized by the cross-linker in the presence of EGF, exhibit increased binding affinity toward EGF as compared with receptor monomers which have not been exposed to EGF. It appears that the high affinity state of receptor can be maintained by the covalent cross-linking agent. These results indicate that in addition to ligand binding, the extracellular domain of EGF receptor possesses the inherent ability to undergo ligand-induced dimerization and that the low affinity state is converted to a high affinity state by EGF."
https://openalex.org/W1518359286,"The gamma complex (gamma delta delta' chi psi) subassembly of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme transfers the beta subunit onto primed DNA in a reaction which requires ATP hydrolysis. Once on DNA, beta is a sliding which tethers the polymerase to DNA for highly processive synthesis. We have examined beta and the gamma complex to identify which subunit(s) hydrolyzes ATP. We find the gamma complex is a DNA dependent ATPase. The beta subunit, which lacks ATPase activity, enhances the gamma complex ATPase when primed DNA is used as an effector. Hence, the gamma complex recognizes DNA and couples ATP hydrolysis to clamp beta onto primed DNA. Study of gamma complex subunits showed no single subunit contained significant ATPase activity. However, the heterodimers, gamma delta and gamma delta', were both DNA-dependent ATPases. Only the gamma delta ATPase was stimulated by beta and was functional in transferring the beta from solution to primed DNA. Similarity in ATPase activity of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme accessory proteins to accessory proteins of phage T4 DNA polymerase and mammalian DNA polymerase delta suggests the basic strategy of chromosome duplication has been conserved throughout evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1547233041,"The first exon of the human thyrotropin-beta (hTSH beta) gene has been demonstrated in our laboratory to contain a major thyroid hormone inhibitory element. In order to characterize fully this element, we have performed a detailed functional and structural scanning mutational analysis of this element. Various -1192 to +37 (base pairs) bp fragments of the hTSH beta gene containing consecutive five deoxythymidine substitution mutations of the first exon were inserted into a luciferase reporter plasmid and transiently transfected into human embryonal cells (293) and stably transfected into rat pituitary cells (GH3). Two domains (domain 1 and 2) were identified by scanning mutations that were essential for function of the thyroid hormone inhibitory element: +3 to +13 bp and +28 to +37 bp. Biotinylated DNA fragments containing -12 to +43 bp of the hTSH beta gene and the identical scanning mutations demonstrate that in vitro synthesized c-erbA-beta binding is disrupted as much as 95% by mutations from -3 to +17 bp and to a lesser extent (20-30%) by mutations from +23 to +27 bp and from +33 to +43 bp. Domain 1 displayed a higher affinity for c-erbA-beta than domain 2 in avidin-biotin complex DNA-binding and gel-mobility assays. Using increasing amounts of in vitro synthesized c-erbA-beta, we were unable to demonstrate more than one protein-DNA complex in gel-mobility assays. However, using the avidin-biotin complex DNA-binding assay and the cross-linking reagent, 1,6-bismaleimidohexane, we were able to demonstrate thyroid hormone receptor dimer formation on domain 1 but not to any significant extent on domain 2. In conclusion, functional and DNA-binding studies suggest that the thyroid hormone receptor binds to two distinct regions in the first exon of the hTSH beta gene. The upstream site (domain 1) binds c-erbA-beta with higher affinity and is capable of binding c-erbA-beta as a dimer under some conditions, while the downstream site (domain 2) appears to bind a single molecule of c-erbA-beta with lower affinity. These results suggest that thyroid hormone receptor, binding to at least two sites in the first exon, act in conjunction to mediate T3 inhibition of hTSH beta expression."
https://openalex.org/W1547671792,"Transcription of the gene for the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) (PEPCK) in the liver is regulated by many hormones including thyroid hormone (T3). In order to identify the elements in the promoter which are required for transcriptional induction by T3, we cotransfected a T3 receptor expression vector with a PEPCK-CAT reporter gene into HepG2 cells. Using vectors with deletions in the PEPCK promoter, we identified a single T3 response element (TRE) between positions -332 and -308. This element binds [125I]T3-labeled T3 receptor contained in nuclear extracts prepared from rat liver. Furthermore, the P3(I) element (-250 to -234), a previously described cis-sequence involved in mediating the induction of PEPCK gene transcription by cAMP, is also required for the T3 responsiveness of the promoter. In the absence of either the TRE or the P3(I) binding sites, no stimulation of transcription from the PEPCK promoter by T3 was observed, indicating that both elements are required for the T3 transcriptional regulation. Finally, a synergistic induction of PEPCK gene transcription by T3 and cAMP is described. This interaction requires both T3- and cAMP-responsive cis-acting elements."

https://openalex.org/W1602768166,"Regulation of expression of nhaA, the gene which encodes a Na+/H+ antiporter in Escherichia coli has been studied. Two promoters have been identified in the upstream sequence of the gene and the corresponding start point of transcription mapped by primer extension. Monitoring the beta-galactosidase activity of a chromosomal translation fusion of nhaA‘-‘lacZ show that at pH 7.5 the gene is induced, within 1 h, by 100 mM of either Li+ or Na+. Change of pH between 6.5 and 8.5 by itself does not increase expression of the gene but it markedly increases the sensitivity of the expression system to the ions. At pH 7.5 maximal induction is obtained by 100 mM NaCl, whereas at pH 8.6, 10 mM NaCl elicit similar response. The pattern of regulation of nhaA reflects its importance in adaptation to high salinity and alkaline pH in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1562659374,"Abstract Expression of ras oncogenes in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts results in the acquisition by these cells of an invasive potential concomitant with the appearance of cell surface asparagine-linked complex-type glycan structures of a higher average molecular weight (Bolscher, J.G. M., van der Bijl, M. M. W., Neefjes, J. J., Hall, A., Smets, L.A., and Ploegh, H.L. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 3361-3368). We have investigated the enzymatic basis for the altered glycosylation by assessing the activities of all major Golgi glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of these structures. Use was made of a stable transfectant cell line (T15) containing the N-ras-protooncogene under the control of a glucocorticoid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. Upon induction of the ras gene with dexamethasone: 1) the levels of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and II were essentially unaltered, indicating an unaffected potential to synthesize complex-type glycans; 2) the activities of the branching N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III and V were elevated 2- to 2.5-fold suggesting the formation of increased amounts of bisected glycans and of structures carrying a Gal beta 1----GlcNAc beta 1----6Man-branch; 3) the levels of the elongating beta 4-galactosyltransferase and beta 3-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase were increased 5- to 7-fold indicating a strongly enhanced capacity to synthesize polylactosaminoglycan chains; 4) the level of the major chain-terminating enzyme, alpha 3-galactosyltransferase, was slightly decreased (0.7-fold), whereas those of the alpha 3- and alpha 6-sialyltransferases were slightly elevated (1.3- and 2-fold, respectively), suggesting a shift from termination by alpha-galactosyl residues to termination by sialic acid moieties. Studies on the acceptor specificities of the different glycosyltransferases indicate that these changes occur in a coordinated manner in which the effects of altered glycosyltransferase expression levels amplify each other. Analysis of the size of cell surface complex-type glycopeptides before and after digestion with neuraminidase and endo-beta-galactosidase suggested an increased sialic acid density, an increase in the number and/or length of polylactosaminoglycan chains, and an increased branching of the glycans upon N-ras induction. The enzymatic results explain these structural changes and allow us to define the alterations in glycosylation pathways associated with ras expression."
https://openalex.org/W2111241008,"The DnaC protein of Escherichia coli is essential for replication in vivo and in vitro. In the initiation of replication of a minichromosome at its origin, DnaC delivers the DnaB helicase from a DnaB.DnaC complex to the future replication fork and then departs. However, if an excess of DnaC was present in subsequent steps, it severely inhibited replication by slowing the DnaB helicase at the replication fork. When DnaB was present at a level equimolar with the excess DnaC, the inhibition was relieved, implying that the ratio of DnaC to DnaB is critical for achieving optimal replication activity and avoiding inhibition by DnaC. In vivo, overproduction of DnaC slowed cell growth. This slowing was alleviated by overproducing DnaB at the same time. E. coli strains with a dnaCts gene defective in chromosomal initiation were complemented by the wild-type gene in trans. On the other hand, strains with an elongation-defective dnaCts gene were not complemented by the wild-type dnaC gene. The dominance of the mutant protein suggests that it remains tightly complexed with DnaB at the replication fork, inhibiting elongation even in the presence of the wild-type DnaC."
https://openalex.org/W1540123888,"The murine Mx1 protein is an interferon-inducible nuclear protein and confers resistance to influenza virus infection even though the resistance mechanism is yet unclear. The Mx1 protein contains a tripartite GTP-binding domain consisting of GXXXXGKS, DXXG, and T/NKXD motifs. In the GTPase gene superfamily such as p21ras protein, signal-transducing G protein, and translation elongation factor, the GTPase activity plays a key role in each protein function. Here we show that GTPase activity is indeed associated with the intact Mx1 protein purified from Escherichia coli expressing Mx1 cDNA. Amino acid substitution within the GTP-binding motif led to significant reduction in the GTPase activity. Yeast vacuolar protein sorting (VPS1) protein and the rat microtubule-associated mechanochemical enzyme dynamin were found to be homologous to Mx1 not only in the tripartite GTP-binding motif, but also in the amino-terminal region of approximately 300 amino acids in length. The function of Mx1 is discussed in comparison with these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1496640920,"We have examined the role of autophosphorylation in insulin signal transmission by oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis of seven potential tyrosine autophosphorylation sites in the human insulin receptor. Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with these receptors were analyzed for insulin stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake, thymidine incorporation, endogenous substrate phosphorylation, and in vitro kinase activity. We found that phosphorylation on tyrosine residues 953, 1316, and 1322 were not necessary for receptor-mediated signal transduction. Mutation of tyrosine 960 reduced but did not abolish the signaling capabilities of the receptor. Finally, the simultaneous mutation of tyrosine residues 1146, 1150, and 1151 (the numbering system is that of Ullrich et al. (Ullrich, A., Bell, J. R., Chen, E. Y., Herrera, R., Petruzzelli, L.

https://openalex.org/W1637351436,"A series of chemically synthesized oligomannosides that contain mannose 6-phosphate residues were utilized as inhibitors of the binding of beta-galactosidase to high (CI-MPR, 215 kDa) and low (CD-MPR, 41-46 kDa) molecular mass mannose 6-phosphate receptor from bovine testes in order to probe the specificity of each receptor. Mannobioside phosphorylated in the terminal position and linked alpha(1,2) was a 6-fold better inhibitor than the corresponding alpha(1,3)- and alpha (1,6)-linked isomers. Inhibition observed with a monophosphorylated alpha(1,2)-linked mannotrioside was approximately 6-fold greater than that with the corresponding mannobioside. Penultimate glycosidic linkages of the oligomannosides played little or no role in the inhibition of binding of ligand to the receptors. Monophosphorylated oligomannosides containing phosphomonoester groups on penultimate mannose residues were not inhibitors. Binding inhibition observed for biantennary oligomannosides with phosphate on terminal mannose residues of either alpha(1,3) or alpha(1,6) chains closely approximated the values obtained with analogous trimannosides. A biantennary oligomannoside on which each antennary chain contained a terminal phosphate exhibited approximately an 8-fold greater inhibition than monophosphorylated compounds. Although the receptors exhibited similar relative specificities for phosphomonoesters, phosphodiesters did not inhibit binding of ligand to CD-MPR and only weakly inhibited binding to CI-MPR."
https://openalex.org/W1491475975,"The possibility that chronic activation of the phosphoinositide-mediated signaling pathway modifies the Ca(2+)-mobilizing action of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) was examined. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were exposed to carbachol, permeabilized electrically, loaded with 45Ca2+, and 45Ca2+ mobilization in response to exogenous InsP3 was assessed. In control permeabilized cells, InsP3 released 65 +/- 2% of sequestered 45Ca2+ (EC50 = 0.32 +/- 0.05 microM). Pre-treatment with carbachol reduced both maximal InsP3-induced 45Ca2+ release (to 34 +/- 3%, with half-maximal and maximal inhibition at approximately 3 and 6 h, respectively) and the potency of InsP3 (EC50 = 0.92 +/- 0.13 microM). This inhibitory effect of carbachol was half-maximal at approximately 5 microM, was mediated by muscarinic receptors, and was reversible following withdrawal of agonist. Pretreatment with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate did not alter the maximal effect of InsP3 but doubled its EC50. Evidence suggesting that the inhibitory effects of carbachol pretreatment resulted from altered Ca2+ homeostasis was not forthcoming; both 45Ca2+ uptake and release induced by ionomycin and thapsigargin were identical in control and pretreated permeabilized cells, as were the characteristics of reuptake of released Ca2+. In contrast, carbachol pretreatment, without altering the affinity of InsP3 (Kd = 64 +/- 7 nM), reduced the density of [32P]InsP3-binding sites from 2.0 +/- 0.1 to 1.0 +/- 0.1 pmol/mg protein with a time course essentially identical to that for the reduction in responsiveness to InsP3. This effect was not mimicked by pretreatment of cells with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. These data indicate that chronic activation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis can reduce the abundance of InsP3 receptors and that this causes a reduction in size of the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ store. This modification, possibly in conjunction with a protein kinase C-mediated event, appears to account for the carbachol-induced suppression of InsP3 action. As intracellular InsP3 mass remained elevated above basal for at least 24 h after addition of carbachol, suppression of the Ca(2+)-mobilizing activity of InsP3 represents an important adaptive response to cell stimulation that can limit the extent to which intracellular Ca2+ is mobilized."
https://openalex.org/W1670670197,"NAD(+)-coupled formate dehydrogenase has been purified to near-homogeneity from the obligate methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. The inclusion of stabilizing reagents in the purification buffers has resulted in a 3-fold increase in specific activity (98 microM/min/mg; turnover number 600 s-1) and as much as a 25-fold increase in yield over previously reported purification protocols. The enzyme, (molecular weight 400,000 +/- 20,000) is composed of four subunit types (alpha, 98,000; beta, 56,000; gamma, 20,000; delta, 11,500) apparently associated as 2 alpha beta gamma delta protomers. The holoenzyme contains flavin (1.8 +/- 0.2), iron (46 +/- 6), inorganic sulfide (38 +/- 4), and molybdenum (1.5 +/- 0.1). The flavin is optically similar to the common flavin cofactors, but it is chromatographically distinct. Anaerobic incubation of the enzyme with formate, NADH, or sodium dithionite, resulted in approximately 50% reduction of the iron and elicited an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum (approximately 2.5 spins/protomer) from which the spectra of five distinct EPR-active centers could be resolved in the g = 1.94 region. Four of these spectra were characteristic of [Fe-S]x clusters. The fifth (gave = 1.99; approximately 0.1 spins/protomer) was similar to that observed for the molybdenum cofactor of xanthine oxidase, and it exhibited the expected hyperfine splitting when the enzyme was enriched with 95Mo (I = 5/2). Mossbauer spectroscopy showed that all of the iron in the enzyme became reduced upon the addition of a redox mediator, proflavin, to the dithionite reduced enzyme at pH 8.0. Nevertheless, a decrease in the EPR-active spin concentration in the g = 1.94 region of the spectrum occurred and was attributed to the reduction of the molybdenum center to the EPR-silent Mo(IV) state (S = 1). The fully reduced enzyme also exhibited a new species with an S = 3/2 ground state (1-2 spins/protomer). Addition of 50% ethylene glycol to the fully reduced enzyme revealed no new species, but caused an increase in the EPR-detectable spin quantitation to 5-6 spins/protomer. This suggests that cluster spin-spin interactions may occur in both the partially and fully reduced native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1673668891,"A UV-inducible, damage-specific DNA-binding (DDB) protein with high affinity for double-stranded UV-irradiated DNA has been identified recently in monkey kidney (CV-1) cells (Hirschfeld, S., Levine, A. S., Ozato, K., and Protic, M. (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10, 2041-2048). We have now purified the DDB protein from extracts of CV-1 cells using hydroxylapatite, phosphocellulose, Mono S, and DNA-affinity column chromatography. The DDB activity, either from mock-treated or UV-induced cells, is heterodisperse in column chromatography, and separation of three forms of the protein was obtained on a phosphocellulose column. Analysis of purified preparations by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that greater than 90% of all three forms is a protein of approximately 126 kDa. The size of the native DDB protein was deduced from gel filtration and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be approximately 210 kDa, which suggests that the native DDB protein in solution is a homodimer. Preparations of partially purified DDB protein from UV-treated cells have enhanced levels of DDB activity and the protein when compared with similar preparations from mock-treated cells. This damage-recognition protein, alone or in conjunction with other subunits, may be of general importance for the initial recognition of DNA damage in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1814747440,"We have identified several transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) binding proteins in solubilized and glycoprotein-enriched porcine uterus membrane fractions by affinity cross-linking and in-gel ligand binding using 125I-labeled TGF-beta 1. By a ligand affinity chromatography using a column of immobilized recombinant TGF-beta 1, four components of apparent molecular weights 160,000, 80,000, 50,000, and 40,000 under reducing conditions were eluted at a pH of 3.5; the 160-,80-, and 40-kDa components were demonstrated to bind TGF-beta 1 specifically by the 125I-TGF-beta 1 binding assays. Further purification was performed by gel chromatography using a Superose 12 column eluted in 70% formic acid. The 40-kDa component was purified to an apparently homogenous form, whereas the 160-kDa component eluted in a broad peak overlapping the peak of the 80-kDa component. It remains to be elucidated whether these TGF-beta 1 binding proteins are related to cell surface receptors for TGF-beta s."
https://openalex.org/W1493854017,"TaM-BMI is a genetically engineered chimeric protein consisting of the first 55 amino acids of cardiac troponin C (but with the normally inactive first Ca2+ binding domain reactivated by site- directed mutagenesis) ligated to the last three domains of chicken calmodulin (George, S.E., VanBerkum, M.F., Ono, T., Cook, R., Hanley, R.M., Putkey, J.A., and Means, A. R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 9228-9235). This protein binds chicken smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (smMLCK) but fails to activate the enzyme, thus functioning as a potent competitive inhibitor (Ki = 66 nM). We have created 29 mutants of calmodulin designed to identify the minimal number of alterations which must be introduced in the first domain to convert the protein to a competitive inhibitor of smMLCK. Alterations of three amino acids predicted to lie on the external surface of calmodulin (E14A, T34K, S38M) recapitulated the phenotype of TaM-BMI and exhibited a Ki of 38 nM. Both the triple mutant and TaM-BMI activated phosphodiesterase and bound a synthetic peptide analog of the calmodulin binding region of smMLCK with an affinity similar to that of native calmodulin (Kact and Kd values of approximately 2 and 3 nM respectively). When a synthetic peptide analog of the myosin light chain phosphorylation site was used as substrate rather than the 20-kDa light chains, TaM-BMI and the triple mutant were partial agonists: the Km for peptide substrate was increased 100- and 60-fold, and catalytic activity was 45 and 60%, respectively, relative to calmodulin. These data suggest TaM-BMI and E14A/T34K/S38M may interact with the calmodulin binding domain of smMLCK in a manner similar to calmodulin. However, alterations in electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions created by the three amino acid substitutions prevent the conformational change in the enzyme usually produced by calmodulin binding. Lack of such changes results in loss of catalytic activity and light chain binding. Additionally, our results show that altering only 3 amino acids residues converts calmodulin to an enzyme-selective antagonist, thus demonstrating the ability to separate calmodulin binding to smMLCK from calmodulin-induced activation of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1570483040,"Cardiolipin is a specific and functionally important phospholipid of mitochondria, and its biosynthesis is considered to be crucial for the assembly of this organelle. However, little information is available about the enzyme cardiolipin synthase, largely because it has not yet been isolated. We solubilized cardiolipin synthase from rat liver mitochondrial membranes with Zwittergent 3-14 and purified it by Mono Q anion exchange chromatography, Superose 12 gel filtration, and Mono P chromatofocusing. Cardiolipin synthase is one of the most acidic mitochondrial proteins (isoelectric point, pH 4-5) and appears as a 50-kilodalton band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme requires CO2+ for activity, has an alkaline pH optimum (pH 8-9), and exhibits Km values of 45 and 1.6 microM for phosphatidylglycerol and CDP-diacylglycerol, respectively. Cardiolipin synthase loses activity during purification, and the activity can be partially reconstituted by the addition of phospholipids. The most effective phospholipid is phosphatidylethanolamine which reactivates in a cooperative manner. Cardiolipin reactivates hyperbolically at low concentrations but inhibits the enzyme at higher concentrations. In addition, cardiolipin shifts the sigmoidal reactivation curve of phosphatidylethanolamine toward lower concentrations. It is suggested that cardiolipin synthase requires interaction with several molecules of phosphatidylethanolamine and at least one molecule of cardiolipin for full enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1492980984,"We have examined the distribution of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor and five acid hydrolases in early and late endosomes and a receptor-recycling fraction isolated from livers of estradiol-treated rats. Enrichment of mannose 6-phosphate receptor mass relative to that of crude liver membranes was comparable in membranes of early and late endosomes but was even greater in membranes of the receptor-recycling fraction. Enrichment of acid hydrolase activities (aryl sulfatase, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, tartrate-sensitive acid phosphatase, and cholesteryl ester acid hydrolase) and cathepsin D mass was also comparable in early and late endosomes but was considerably lower in the receptor-recycling fraction. The enrichment of two acid hydrolases, acid phosphatase and cholesteryl ester acid hydrolase, in endosomes was severalfold greater than that of the other three examined, about 40% of that found in lysosomes. Acid phosphatase and cholesteryl ester acid hydrolase were partially associated with endosome membranes, whereas cathepsin D was found entirely in the endosome contents. These findings raise the possibility that lysosomal enzymes traverse early endosomes during transport to lysosomes in rat hepatocytes and suggest that the greater enrichment of some acid hydrolases in endosomes is related to their association with endosome membranes. Despite the substantial enrichment of lysosomal enzymes in hepatocytic endosomes, we found that two, cholesteryl ester acid hydrolase and cathepsin D, did not degrade cholesteryl esters and apolipoprotein B-100 of endocytosed low density lipoproteins in vivo, presumably because they are inactive at the pH within endosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1592728139,"Receptors for insulin and epidermal growth factor contain cysteine-rich domains in the extracellular portion of the molecule. His209 (insulin receptor numbering system) is 1 of 2 amino acid residues that are identically conserved in the cysteine-rich domains of insulin receptors, epidermal growth factor receptors, and other homologous receptors. Previously, we have identified a patient with leprechaunism who is homozygous for a mutation substituting Arg for His209 in the insulin receptor gene (Kadowaki, T., Kadowaki, H., Rechler, M. M., Serrano-Rios, M., Roth, J., Gorden, P., and Taylor, S. I. (1990) J. Clin. Invest. 86, 254-264). In this investigation, the Arg209 mutant receptor was expressed by transfection of mutant cDNA into NIH-3T3 cells. The mutation impairs several steps in the post-translational processing of the insulin receptor:dimerization of 190-kDa proreceptors into a disulfide linked species, proteolytic cleavage of the proreceptor into alpha- and beta-subunits, and terminal processing of the high mannose form of N-linked oligosaccharide into complex carbohydrate. In addition, the defects in post-translational processing within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus are associated with a marked inhibition in transport of receptors to the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, a small number (approximately 10%) of the receptors are transported to the cell surface. These receptors on the cell surface bind insulin with normal affinity and have normal tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1506172251,"Since Giardia lamblia trophozoites are exposed to high concentrations of fatty acids in their human small intestinal milieu, we determined the pattern of incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid and myristic acid into G. lamblia proteins. The pattern of fatty acylation was unusually simple since greater than 90% of the Giardia protein biosynthetically labeled with either [3H]palmitate or myristate migrated at approximately 49 kDa (GP49) in reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis during both growth and differentiation. GP49, which partitions into the Triton X-114 detergent phase, is localized on the cell surface since it is 125I-surface-labeled. GP49 was also biosynthetically labeled with [14C]ethanolamine and [3H]myoinositol, suggesting that it has a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Moreover, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) or mild alkaline treatment released free fatty acids, indicating a diacylglycerol moiety with ester linkages. Finally, a 3H- and 14C-labeled species was released by nitrous acid deamination from [14C]palmitate- and [3H]myoinositol-labeled GP49. The GPI anchor of GP49 is unusual, however, because purified GP49 was cleaved by Bacillus cereus phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific PLC, but not by Staphylococcus aureus PI-PLC, or plasma PLD, and did not react with antibody against the variant surface glycoprotein cross-reactive determinant. Moreover, the double-labeled deaminated GP49 anchor migrated faster than authentic PI in TLC and produced [3H]glycerophosphoinositol after deacylation. In contrast to the variable cysteine-rich G. lamblia surface antigens described previously, GP49 was identified in Western blots of every isolate tested, as well as in subclones of a single isolate which differ in expression of a major cysteine-rich 85/66-kDa surface antigen, which does not appear to be GPI-anchored. These observations suggest that GP49, the first common surface antigen to be described in G. lamblia, may play an important role in the interaction of this parasite with its environment."
https://openalex.org/W1554718847,"We have investigated the intracellular localization and synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by analyzing membrane fractions that were obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. After labeling the cells for 24 h with [3H]inositol, the bulk of [3H] PtdInsP2 was found in the plasma membrane fraction, yet this lipid was also distinctly present in the microsomal fraction (20% of total cellular [3H]PtdInsP2). To determine the origin of this microsomal PtdInsP2, gradient fractions from unlabeled CHO cells were incubated with [3H]inositol in the presence of an ATP-generating system. Under these conditions of labeling, [3H]PtdIns was exclusively present in the microsomal fractions and found to be partially converted to [3H] phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate ([3H]PtdInsP) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate ([3H]PtdInsP) and [3H]PtdInsP2. The ability of microsomes to synthesize PtdInsP and PtdInsP2 was confirmed by assaying the gradient fractions for PtdIns and PtdInsP kinase activity using endogenous substrate and [gamma-32P]ATP. In the presence of exogenous substrate and Triton X-100, PtdInsP kinase activity was particularly high in the plasma membrane fractions. When phosphoinositide synthesis was studied in permeabilized CHO cells under conditions of sustained membrane vesicle flow (Helms, J. B., Karrenbauer, A., Wirtz, K. W. A., Rothman, J. E., and Wieland, F. T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 20027-20032), no lag-time could be detected between the synthesis of [3H]PtdIns and the formation of [3H]PtdInsP2. Moreover, when lipid transport pathways were blocked in these permeabilized cells either by omission of membrane-free cytosol, addition of GTP gamma S and brefeldin A, or temperature block, PtdInsP2 formation still occurred at normal levels. These results strongly suggest that PtdInsP2 can be formed at the site of PtdIns synthesis, i.e. the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The relationship between PtdInsP2, generated in the ER, and PtdInsP2 present in the plasma membrane, remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1567665062,"Highly charged polyanionic ligands of the scavenger receptor trigger macrophage secretion of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). In experiments reported here, we have investigated the intracellular and extracellular regulation of polyanion-induced macrophage plasminogen activation. Exposure of a macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) to either fucoidan or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulates the secretion of uPA, whereas calcium ionophore or dibutyryl cyclic AMP had no effect. Moreover, preincubation of macrophages with inhibitors of protein kinase C reduced (50-60%) the ability of both fucoidan and PMA to trigger the secretion of uPA, whereas aspirin and eicosatetraenoic acid had no effect. Both PMA and fucoidan treatment of RAW264.7 cells resulted in a rapid and transient increase in the steady state levels of uPA mRNA. However, in marked contrast to that observed with PMA, fucoidan-induced expression of RAW264.7 uPA activity was partially insensitive to cycloheximide and actinomycin D. In addition, fucoidan-induced uPA activity was detected in conditioned media in as little as 15 min, whereas PMA-induced uPA activity did not increase until 2 h. In addition to stimulating macrophage secretion of uPA, fucoidan bound uPA and had a small stimulatory affect on uPA activity. The binding does not interfere with the catalytic site on the B chain, or require the receptor binding or kringle domains on the A chain."
https://openalex.org/W1660861487,"The venom of the North American funnel-web spider Agelenopsis aperta contains a variety of arylamine toxins (the alpha-agatoxins) that paralyze insects by blocking glutamatergic neuromuscular transmission. We have tested six synthetic alpha-agatoxins for their ability to antagonize glutamate receptor function in mammalian brain. These compounds produce, at submicromolar concentrations, noncompetitive inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated elevations in the concentration of cytosolic free calcium in cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons. In contrast, the alpha-agatoxins are relatively weak antagonists of elevations in the cytosolic free calcium concentration induced by non-NMDA receptor agonists. The alpha-agatoxins also produce reversible suppression of the NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential in rat hippocampal slices at concentrations that have little effect on the non-NMDA receptor-mediated population spike. We conclude that the alpha-agatoxins are selective and reversible noncompetitive antagonists at NMDA receptors in mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W1489672282,"The Na+/K(+)-ATPase enzyme is a pivotal regulator of intracellular electrolyte levels in animal cells. Changes in the rate of its synthesis have been demonstrated to mediate a number of physiological responses. The cellular mechanisms implicated in such regulatory responses though remain poorly defined. Specifically, no intracellular mediators have previously been established. We now describe for the first time, one putative mediator: [Ca2+]i. Elevations in [Ca2+]i stimulate levels of mRNA alpha 1 and mRNA beta 1, sequences which encode both the catalytic subunit of the enzyme, the alpha subunit, and the glycosylated subunit, the beta subunit. These results suggest that elevations in [Ca2+]i modulate the synthetic rate of the active enzyme, and consequently changes in [Ca2+]i may mediate the regulation of its synthetic rate in a range of physiological settings. The mRNA alpha 1 response to the elevation of [Ca2+]i appears, at least partly, to reflect an increase in transcription rate. However, no such increase in transcription rate of the beta 1 subunit gene was detectable. Thus the mRNA beta 1 response, under conditions of elevated [Ca2+]i, may be explained by a decrease in specific mRNA degradation rate."
https://openalex.org/W1508237943,"The effects of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and insulin were compared in wild-type human insulin receptors (HIRc cells) and human insulin receptors lacking 43 COOH-terminal amino acid residues (HIR delta CT cells). TPA increased total phosphorylation of the wild-type insulin receptor and inhibited insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation by 32 +/- 10% in HIRc cells. TPA inhibited insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation by 46 +/- 14% in HIR delta CT cells and also caused a 65% decrease in basal phosphorylation. Insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity for poly(Glu4/Tyr1) was inhibited by TPA in HIRc and HIR delta CT cells by 50 and 40%, respectively. TPA decreased insulin-stimulated glucose incorporation into glycogen by 50% in HIRc cells and to near basal levels in HIR delta CT cells; this inhibitory effect of TPA was reversed in both cell lines by staurosporine. In conclusion, 1) TPA-induced inhibition of insulin receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation was linked to concomitant inhibition of the biological effects of insulin in cells expressing either wild-type or COOH-terminal truncated insulin receptors; and 2) the inhibitory effects of TPA were not dependent upon phosphorylation of COOH-terminal residues and furthermore appeared to be independent of phosphorylation of any insulin receptor serine/threonine residues. These findings suggest a novel protein kinase C mechanism that results in altered insulin receptor function without increasing phosphorylation of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1728162925,"The effects of vanadate (Na3VO4) on pancreatic B-cell function were studied in normal mouse islets. Vanadate did not affect basal insulin release but potentiated the effect of 7-30 mM glucose at concentrations of 0.1-1 mM. This effect was progressive and slowly reversible. It was abolished by omission of extracellular Ca2+ but unaffected by blockers of adrenergic or muscarinic receptors. Comparison of the changes in membrane potential, 86Rb efflux and 45Ca efflux that vanadate and ouabain produced in B-cells made it possible to exclude the hypothesis that vanadate increases insulin release by blocking the sodium pump. Vanadate was also without effect on cAMP levels. On the other hand, it markedly changed the characteristics of the Ca(2+)-dependent electrical activity and of the oscillations of cytoplasmic Ca2+ recorded in B-cells stimulated by 15 mM glucose. In the steady state, Ca2+ influx was increased by vanadate, and this resulted in a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+. The exact mechanisms underlying these changes could not be established but a blockade of K channels was excluded. In the presence of LiCl, vanadate markedly increased inositol phosphate levels in islet cells. This effect was attenuated but not suppressed by omission of Ca2+. A small increase in inositol bisphosphate was still produced by vanadate in the absence of LiCl. These results suggest that vanadate both stimulates phosphoinositide breakdown and inhibits inositol phosphate degradation. In conclusion, vanadate does not induce insulin release, but markedly potentiates the stimulation by glucose. This property is not due to an inhibition of the sodium pump or to a rise in cAMP concentration. It results from a complex interplay between changes in B-cell membrane potential, phosphoinositide metabolism and Ca2+ handling."
https://openalex.org/W1551693235,"Two electrophoretically distinct proteins with fructokinase (ATP:fructose-6-phosphotransferase) activity were detected in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis K1. Whereas fructokinase I was induced specifically by growth of the organism on sucrose, fructokinase II was derepressed during growth on ribose, galactose, maltose, and lactulose. Fructokinase I was purified about 1000-fold to electrophoretic homogeneity (specific activity 112 units/mg). The amino acid composition, N-terminal sequence, nucleoside triphosphate, and metal requirement(s) of the enzyme are reported. Ultracentrifugal analysis showed that the enzyme was primarily dimeric with subunits of 33.5 kDa (+/- 5%). When completely reduced, fructokinase I migrated as a single protein (Mr = 32,000) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but in the absence of reducing agent two polypeptides (apparent Mr = 29,000 and 31,000) were detected. Isoelectric focusing also revealed two polypeptides (pI 5.6 and 5.8), and both species catalyzed the phosphorylation of fructose and mannose. Hybridization studies showed that: (i) a sucrose-negative mutant lacking the fructokinase I gene (scrK) retained fructokinase II activity and (ii) scrK is closely linked to scrA and scrB which encode Enzyme IIScr and sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase, respectively. In L. lactis K1, these genes and the N5-(1-carboxyethyl)-L-ornithine synthase gene (ceo) are encoded on the sucrose-nisin transposon Tn5306 in the order ceo-scrKAB."
https://openalex.org/W1587345792,"Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) produce platelet-activating factor (PAF) by a remodeling pathway involving a phospholipase A2 followed by an acetyl-CoA-dependent acetyltransferase which acetylates a lyso-PAF intermediate to form PAF and is stimulated by a variety of agents that generate inflammatory and allergic responses. A second route for PAF synthesis in mammalian tissues is a de novo pathway, which requires the participation of three enzymes: 1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (alkyllyso-GP): acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate phosphohydrolase, and dithiothreitol (DDT)-insensitive 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (alkylacetyl-G):CDP-cholinecholinephosphotransferase. In the present study we show that protein kinase C activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induces PAF production in HUVEC by an increase of both alkyllyso-GP:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase and DTT-insensitive alkylacetyl-G:CDP-choline choline-phosphotransferase. PAF synthesis, labeled precursors [( 3H]acetate and [methyl-3H]choline) incorporation, and both enzyme activities of the de novo pathway increase concomitantly in response to different doses of PMA. PMA does not activate the enzymes of the remodeling pathway. We conclude that both remodeling and the de novo pathway for PAF synthesis are present in HUVEC and might be alternatively activated depending on the conditions of cell stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W1490889712,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is present in endothelial and epithelial cells of various tissues as well as in the circulating plasma. The structural relationship between the cellular and the secreted forms of ACE and the pathways to their biosynthesis have not been determined as yet mainly because of the unavailability of a natural cell line expressing ACE in tissue culture. To circumvent this problem we have permanently transfected a mouse epithelial line with an expression vector containing the recently cloned rabbit testicular ACE cDNA. Clonal derivatives of this line secreted large quantities of enzymatically active ACE. When these cells were cultured in serum-free medium, the only detectable protein in the culture medium was ACE. It has been suggested that a hydrophobic domain near the carboxyl terminus of the enzyme anchors it to the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis we established cell lines expressing a truncated form of the active enzyme which is missing the putative anchoring domain. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the truncated ACE was secreted from the cells much faster than the native enzyme. Moreover, the secreted form of the native enzyme had a lower molecular weight than the corresponding cellular form. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the hydrophobic domain is instrumental in keeping the enzyme cell-bound, and secretion is achieved physiologically by removal of this domain from the enzyme by a specific proteolytic cleavage."

A steady state kinetic analysis of the enzyme isolated from HSV-1-infected CV-1 cells or insect cells expressing the enzyme after infection with recombinant baculoviruses has shown it to possess two sites capable of hydrolyzing nucleoside triphosphates in a DNA-dependent manner. One site (Site I) hydrolyzes both ATP and GTP; the second (Site II) hydrolyzes only ATP. These two sites are contained within a subassembly of the helicase-primase formed by coexpression of the UL5 and UL52 genes in insect cells. Sites I and II are activated by separate DNA effector sites, both of which support DNA helicase action. These findings are likely to be of importance in understanding how helicases in general catalyze the unwinding of duplex DNA and, in particular, how the helicase-primase functions at the HSV-1 replication fork."

The increases are limited to phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a distinct tumor promoter and protein kinase C activator, also induces serine/threonine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and is known to modulate receptor functions. Comparison of okadaic acid and TPA influences on the EGF receptor show significant differences. Okadaic acid did not promote phosphorylation of Thr-654, a major site of TPA-induced phosphorylation. However, other sites of phosphorylation were similar for the two tumor promoters. In vitro experiments with purified protein phosphatase 2A demonstrate the insensitivity of Thr-654 phosphorylation, which regulates EGF receptor function, to dephosphorylation by this okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatase. In contrast to TPA, okadaic acid did not attenuate the tyrosine kinase activity or ligand binding capacity of the EGF receptor. However, okadaic acid did produce a decrease in EGF-stimulated inositol phosphate formation in a manner distinct from that of TPA."

Pharmacol. 147, 192-207) bound to the guinea pig uterine oxytocin receptor with high affinity (apparent Kd = 0.74 nM). The introduction of a 4-azidophenylamidino group at Orn8 resulted in the photoreactive ligand [Mca1,Tyr(O-Me)2,Thr4,Orn(4-azidophenylamidino)8,Tyr9- NH2]oxytocin, which retained the high binding affinity (Kd = 0.69 nM) of the parent compound. The photoreactive antagonist monoiodinated at Tyr9 had approximately double (Kd = 0.39 nM) the affinity of the photoreactive antagonist and several times that of oxytocin (Kd = 2.6 nM) for the guinea pig uterine oxytocin receptor. In photo-affinity labeling experiments using myometrial membranes obtained from guinea pigs during late pregnancy, the 125I-labeled photoreactive antagonist specifically labeled a protein with an apparent molecular mass of between 68 and 80 kDa: the labeling of this protein was completely suppressed by a 100-fold molar excess of oxytocin and oxytocin receptor-specific agonists, but not by vasopressin analogues specific for V1 or V2 receptors or by other peptide hormones. The ability of oxytocin to suppress labeling was decreased in the presence of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) or in the absence of Mn2+. Digestion of the photolabeled oxytocin receptor with endoglycosidase F gave rise to a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 38 +/- 2 kDa. The endoglycosidase F effect and the lack of endoglycosidase H action show that the myometrial oxytocin receptor is highly glycosylated with asparagine-linked complex oligosaccharide chains. Our results suggest that the radioiodinated photoreactive oxytocin antagonist could be a helpful tool in the isolation and further characterization of the oxytocin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W982679801,"Transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group of ATP to riboflavin is catalyzed by flavokinase, which prefers Zn(II), and is essential in the biosynthesis of the flavocoenzyme, FMN. To study the mechanism and steric disposition of ATP binding, adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) (ATP beta S) and adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S) were tested in comparison to ATP with representative divalent metal ions. Activities with 0.1 mM Zn(II) for 1 mM ATP thio analogues compared to ATP with flavokinase were 60% for the S-isomer of ATP beta S, 312% for the R-isomer of ATP beta S, and 14% for ATP gamma S. With Mg(II), flavokinase showed stereospecificity for the R-isomer of ATP beta S with a Vmax ratio, S/R = 0.125. With Cd(II), the enzyme showed preference for the S-isomer of ATP beta S with a Vmax ratio, S/R = 1.261. The Vmax ratio progressively increases from Mg(II) to Cd(II) in the order of affinity for sulfur. The ratios, (Vmax/Km)Mg/(Vmax/Km)Cd, for the diastereomers of ATP beta S were expectedly greater than 1 for one diastereomer (R = 6.597) and less than 1 for the other (S = 0.292). Activities with ATP gamma S were much lower than with ATP or ATP beta S. With Mg(II), the gamma analogue was a good substrate; however, with Cd(II), it was hardly active. Altogether these results indicate that flavokinase uses the lambda, beta, gamma-bidentate Zn.ATP as a substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1512541121,"Abstract Polyclonal antibodies, raised against cyclic AMP (cAMP) by the immunization of animals with a 2'-O-succinyl cAMP/bovine albumin conjugate, have been reported to be dependent upon the presence of calcium ion (Ca2+) for antigen binding. They also exhibit a major bridge effect whereby 2'-O-succinyl and 2'-O-acetyl derivatives are bound more avidly than the parent nucleotide. Since cAMP and these derivatives bind Ca2+ very weakly, they do not present substantially in the chelated form over the range of Ca2+ concentrations used. Thus direct antigen modification is excluded as an explanation for the observed ion dependence of the reaction. Instead, we propose a mechanism based on reaction coupling. The actual antigens are the Ca2+ chelates of these nucleotides, whose formation in the absence of antibody is rapid but not favored (as indicated by their weak association constants). When antibody is added, the chelates act as transient intermediates whose concentration remains low but which is replenished as they are consumed by antibody. The coupled reaction is driven by the antibody-antigen step which occurs more slowly but with a substantial gain in free energy. The reaction is limited by the availability of Ca2+. It also appears that the rabbit antibody-forming cell responds preferentially to the Ca(2+)-bound form of the 2'-O-succinyl cAMP/bovine albumin conjugate which may appear to be more foreign than the unbound form of the hapten containing the ubiquitous nucleotide cAMP."

We demonstrated that the system accurately initiates transcription from the LDH promoter. Analysis of the competitive effects of linker-scanning mutants showed that the wild-type LDH promoter exhibited the highest competitive effect and reduced the rate of basal transcription, whereas LDH promoter fragments with a mutated cAMP-responsive element had little competitive activity. Cyclic AMP and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase stimulated the rate of transcription from the wild-type promoter, an effect which was inhibited by the catalytic subunit inhibitor protein. A beta-galactosidase-cAMP-responsive element binding protein fusion protein had no effect on the basal rate of transcription. Addition of beta-galactosidase-cAMP-responsive element binding protein together with cAMP or the catalytic subunit, however, enhanced the rate of transcription. The demonstrated regulatory effects indicate that the sensitivity of the transcription system makes it suitable for the functional analysis of homologous LDH and possibly heterologous transcription regulatory elements."

https://openalex.org/W1584088130,"The effects of cholecystokinin (CCK) and other pancreatic secretagogues on phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis were studied in isolated rat pancreatic acini. When acini were incubated with [3H]choline in the presence of 1 nM CCK-octapeptide (CCK8) for 60 min, the incorporations of [3H]choline into both water-soluble choline metabolites and PC in acini were reduced by CCK8 to 74 and 41% of control, respectively. Pulse-chase study revealed that CCK8 reduced both the disappearance of phosphocholine and the synthesis of PC. Other Ca(2+)-mobilizing secretagogues such as carbamylcholine, bombesin, and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 also reduced PC synthesis to the same extent as did CCK8. When combined with 1 nM CCK8, A23187 or carbamylcholine did not further inhibit PC synthesis. Furthermore, W-7 or W-5, a calmodulin antagonist, reversed the inhibition by CCK8 of PC synthesis, suggesting that a Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent pathway may be involved in CCK-induced inhibition of PC synthesis in acini. By contrast, neither cAMP-dependent secretagogues such as secretin and dibutyryl cAMP nor a phorbol ester had any effect on PC synthesis in acini. Staurosporine or H-7, a protein kinase C inhibitor, did not affect the inhibition by CCK of PC synthesis. The analysis of enzyme activity involved in PC synthesis via CDP-choline pathway showed that CCK treatment of acini reduced CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity in both cytosolic and particulate fraction, a finding consistent with the delayed disappearance of phosphocholine induced by CCK in pulse-chase study. By contrast, CCK treatment of acini did not alter the activities of choline kinase and phosphocholine transferase in acini. The extent of inhibition by CCK of cytidylyltransferase activity became much larger when subcellular fractions of acini were prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. In addition, W-7 reversed the inhibitory effect of CCK treatment on cytidylyltransferase activity in acini. When acini were labeled with [3H]myristic acid and chased, CCK8 (1 nM) reduced the synthesis of [3H]myristic acid-labeled PC to 27% of control after a 60-min chase period. This inhibition of PC synthesis induced by CCK was accompanied by a delayed disappearance of [3H]diacylglycerol, the radioactivity of which was 225% of control at 60 min. These results indicate that CCK inhibits PC synthesis by inducing both the reduction of choline uptake into acini and the inhibition of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity. Furthermore, the results suggest the possibility that the activation of Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent kinase in response to CCK may phosphorylate cytidylyltransferase thereby decreasing this enzyme activity in pancreatic acinar cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1543467186,"Radical production from alkyl hydrazines (i.e. phenelzine and benzylhydrazine) in rat liver microsomes has been proposed to occur via cytochrome P-450-catalyzed one-electron oxidation followed by beta-scission of an alkyl radical. In microsomes treated with phenelzine (2-phenylethylhydrazine), NADPH, and the spin trap alpha-(4-pyridyl 1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (4-POBN), the 4-POBN/2-phenylethyl radical adduct was detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The addition of catalase and superoxide dismutase resulted in a 28.5 and 24% decrease in radical production, respectively. The concentration of the 4-POBN/2-phenylethyl radical adduct decreased significantly in the presence of metal chelators, i.e. EDTA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), or deferoxamine mesylate. When phenelzine was incubated with deferoxamine mesylate-washed microsomes and NADPH in Chelex-treated incubation buffer, no significant radical adduct formation was detected. Addition of iron-chelator complexes (either Fe(3+)-DTPA or Fe(3+)-EDTA) greatly stimulated production of the 4-POBN/2-phenylethyl radical adduct in this system. These results show that the 2-phenylethyl radical produced from phenelzine in a microsomal system arises via a trace transition metal-catalyzed reaction. This reaction may occur through oxidation of phenelzine by the hydroxyl radical, which has also been spin-trapped with 4-POBN in this system."
https://openalex.org/W1573984881,"Our previous studies showed that the AP-1 recognition element (ARE) present within the SV40 72-base pair (bp) enhancer will activate transcription in yeast when placed upstream of a truncated CYC1 promoter. However, the AP-2/AP-3 recognition element (also known as the core sequence TGTGGAAAG) from the SV40 enhancer was not able to activate CYC1-dependent transcription. In this report, we show that the core sequence, when cloned next to a yeast UAS (upstream activation sequence), can inhibit the transcriptional stimulatory activity of the UAS. We refer to this sequence as the upstream repressor element (URE) in yeast. Repression occurs in an orientation-independent fashion and irrespective of the placement of the URE between the UAS and TATA box or upstream of both of these elements. Furthermore, repression is seen when the URE is separated from the UAS by up to 214 bp. Interestingly, multiple copies of an activator site can overcome this repression. Gel-shift analysis and URE-probed proteins blots indicate the presence of two polypeptide chains capable of binding the URE in yeast. The experimental evidence suggests that either the repression associated with the URE sequence is mediated by a direct, one-to-one interaction between the proteins recognizing the URE and GCRE, or alternatively, that there is a direct interaction between the activator and repressor for a general transcription factor."
