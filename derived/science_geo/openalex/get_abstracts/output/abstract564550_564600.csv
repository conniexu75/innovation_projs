https://openalex.org/W2470453245,"Recent studies have aimed to convert cultured human pluripotent cells to a naive state, but it remains unclear to what extent the resulting cells recapitulate in vivo naive pluripotency. Here we propose a set of molecular criteria for evaluating the naive human pluripotent state by comparing it to the human embryo. We show that transcription of transposable elements provides a sensitive measure of the concordance between pluripotent stem cells and early human development. We also show that induction of the naive state is accompanied by genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, which is reversible except at imprinted genes, and that the X chromosome status resembles that of the human preimplantation embryo. However, we did not see efficient incorporation of naive human cells into mouse embryos. Overall, the different naive conditions we tested showed varied relationships to human embryonic states based on molecular criteria, providing a backdrop for future analysis of naive human pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2468940180,"APS1/APECED patients are defined by defects in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) that mediates central T cell tolerance to many self-antigens. AIRE deficiency also affects B cell tolerance, but this is incompletely understood. Here we show that most APS1/APECED patients displayed B cell autoreactivity toward unique sets of approximately 100 self-proteins. Thereby, autoantibodies from 81 patients collectively detected many thousands of human proteins. The loss of B cell tolerance seemingly occurred during antibody affinity maturation, an obligatorily T cell-dependent step. Consistent with this, many APS1/APECED patients harbored extremely high-affinity, neutralizing autoantibodies, particularly against specific cytokines. Such antibodies were biologically active in vitro and in vivo, and those neutralizing type I interferons (IFNs) showed a striking inverse correlation with type I diabetes, not shown by other anti-cytokine antibodies. Thus, naturally occurring human autoantibodies may actively limit disease and be of therapeutic utility."
https://openalex.org/W2464751873,"Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) can be modeled using oscillatory interference or attractor dynamic mechanisms that perform path integration, a computation requiring information about running direction and speed. The two classes of computational models often use either an oscillatory frequency or a firing rate that increases as a function of running speed. Yet it is currently not known whether these are two manifestations of the same speed signal or dissociable signals with potentially different anatomical substrates. We examined coding of running speed in MEC and identified these two speed signals to be independent of each other within individual neurons. The medial septum (MS) is strongly linked to locomotor behavior, and removal of MS input resulted in strengthening of the firing rate speed signal, while decreasing the strength of the oscillatory speed signal. Thus, two speed signals are present in MEC that are differentially affected by disrupted MS input."

Flexibility in the nuclear genetic code has been demonstrated in ciliates that reassign standard stop codons to amino acids, resulting in seven variant genetic codes, including three previously undescribed ones reported here. Surprisingly, in two of these species, we find efficient translation of all 64 codons as standard amino acids and recognition of either one or all three stop codons. How, therefore, does the translation machinery interpret a “stop” codon? We provide evidence, based on ribosomal profiling and “stop” codon depletion shortly before coding sequence ends, that mRNA 3′ ends may contribute to distinguishing stop from sense in a context-dependent manner. We further propose that such context-dependent termination/readthrough suppression near transcript ends enables genetic code evolution.

The first exceptions to the supposed universality of eukaryotic nuclear genetic codes were reported in ciliates (Caron and Meyer, 1985Caron F. Meyer E.

Subsequently, additional genetic codes were discovered in other ciliates, all due to stop codon reassignments, and appear to recur independently in different ciliate lineages (Lozupone et al., 2001Lozupone C.A.

Genetic code deviations in the ciliates: evidence for multiple and independent events.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3262-3267PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic code evolution is considered to have both an ancient phase, which gave rise to the standard genetic code before the radiation of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, and a modern phase, which led to diversification from the standard code (Sengupta and Higgs, 2015Sengupta S. Higgs P.G. Pathways of Genetic Code Evolution in Ancient and Modern Organisms.J. Mol. Evol. 2015; 80: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus far, alternative nuclear genetic codes have only been found in three major eukaryotic lineages other than ciliates. The first alternative nuclear genetic code, discovered in ciliates, with the UAA and UAG stop codons reassigned to glutamine, is also present in green algae (Acetabularia and Batophora) (Schneider and de Groot, 1991Schneider S.U. de Groot E.J.

A non-canonical genetic code in an early diverging eukaryotic lineage.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2285-2290PubMed Google Scholar). Alternative nuclear genetic codes, with CUG reassigned from leucine, also occur in the yeasts Candida albicans (predominantly to serine) and Pachysolen tannophilus (to alanine) (Gomes et al., 2007Gomes A.C.

The CUG codon is decoded in vivo as serine and not leucine in Candida albicans.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Other than the diversity of genetic codes in ciliates, the greatest number of variant genetic codes are found in mitochondria (Knight et al., 2001Knight R.D. Freeland S.J. Landweber L.F. Rewiring the keyboard: evolvability of the genetic code.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), whose diversification may have been facilitated by their small genomes and strong mutational biases, which increase the likelihood of loss and reassignment of rare codons (Osawa and Jukes, 1989Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Codon reassignment (codon capture) in evolution.J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 28: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Expressed ciliate genomes (macronuclear genomes) are not especially small (typically 50–100 Mb) (Swart et al., 2013Swart E.C. Bracht J.R. Magrini V. Minx P. Chen X. Zhou Y. Khurana J.S. Goldman A.D. Nowacki M. Schotanus K. et al.The Oxytricha trifallax macronuclear genome: a complex eukaryotic genome with 16,000 tiny chromosomes.PLoS Biol. 2013; 11: e1001473Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and the manner in which changes in their genetic codes arose may not be as straightforward as that in smaller mitochondrial genomes. Alternative explanations for the evolution of ciliate genetic codes, such as the abolishment of recognition of certain stop codons by mutations in the stop-recognizing translation termination factor eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) allowing codon reassignment have therefore been proposed (Lozupone et al., 2001Lozupone C.A. Knight R.D. Landweber L.F. The molecular basis of nuclear genetic code change in ciliates.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 65-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). While the genetic code is classically taught as being unambiguous, and indeed may largely be so, we now know this is an oversimplification. Since the original discovery of the standard genetic code, alternative translational interpretations of codons have been found, most notably in the use of the UGA codon for selenocysteine incorporation, in the context of special mRNA stem-loops in the UTRs of a small number of protein-coding genes (Nasim et al., 2000Nasim M.T. Jaenecke S. Belduz A. Kollmus H. Flohé L. McCarthy J.E. Eukaryotic selenocysteine incorporation follows a nonprocessive mechanism that competes with translational termination.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14846-14852Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). An additional form of codon ambiguity, translational readthrough of stop codons, is now also recognized as pervasive, but usually weak, in eukaryotes, occurring at a few percent or less compared to the non-readthrough form (e.g., Dunn et al., 2013Dunn J.G. Foo C.K. Belletier N.G. Gavis E.R. Weissman J.S.

Leszyk J.D. Mangus D.A. Jacobson A. Nonsense suppression by near-cognate tRNAs employs alternative base pairing at codon positions 1 and 3.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 3038-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Translational readthrough usually gives rise to short protein extensions, e.g., a median length of 35 amino acids in Drosophila (Jungreis et al., 2011Jungreis I. Lin M.F. Spokony R. Chan C.S. Negre N. Victorsen A. White K.P. Kellis M. Evidence of abundant stop codon readthrough in Drosophila and other metazoa.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 2096-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Readthrough is enabled by near-cognate pairing of tRNAs to codons, with either the first or third anticodon base noncanonically paired (Blanchet et al., 2014Blanchet S. Cornu D. Argentini M. Namy O. New insights into the incorporation of natural suppressor tRNAs at stop codons in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 10061-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, there is competition for the same codons between eRF1 and tRNAs. Although the options for engineering of new genetic codes with artificial amino acids have been proliferating (Lemke, 2014Lemke E.A. The exploding genetic code.ChemBioChem. 2014; 15: 1691-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), many important questions about natural genetic codes remain unresolved. Among these questions, are basic ones of how codons are recognized in variant genetic codes with stop codon reassignments and whether there is competition between eRF1 and stop-cognate tRNAs for the same codons. Experimental evidence attempting to address the former problem has been conflicting, supporting either loss or ongoing recognition of reassigned stop codons by eRF1 (Eliseev et al., 2011Eliseev B. Kryuchkova P. Alkalaeva E. Frolova L.

With extensive sequence data spanning a wide range of eukaryotes, including ciliates, now available, uncertain genetic codes may be properly determined, and consequently, the proposed basis for nuclear genetic code diversification is also ripe for reinvestigation. We present the new genetic codes we discovered in the course of screening a large collection of eukaryotic transcriptomes, how codons may have multiple meanings in two of these codes, and the consequences of tolerance of genetic code ambiguity for genetic code evolution. To identify and classify reassigned codons, we used a computational screening approach to search the Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP) transcriptomes (Keeling et al., 2014Keeling P.J. Burki F. Wilcox H.M. Allam B. Allen E.E. Amaral-Zettler L.A. Armbrust E.V. Archibald J.M. Bharti A.K.

We found that like Bembidion americanum, Bradyrhizobium japonicum uses UGA as a tryptophan codon, although it does so at low levels (0.059%) and hence this reassignment may easily go undetected in small sequence samples (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B). Thus, given this reassignment and previous experimental results (Eliseev et al., 2011Eliseev B. Kryuchkova P. Alkalaeva E. Frolova L. A single amino acid change of translation termination factor eRF1 switches between bipotent and omnipotent stop-codon specificity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we deduce that B. japonicum’s eRF1 and at least one of its tryptophan tRNAs may be in competition for the same codon.Figure S1Predicted Codon Translations of Parduczia sp. and B. japonicum, Related to Figure 1Show full captionStop codons in the standard genetic code are highlighted by orange rectangles.

Because MMETSP represents the current broadest eukaryotic molecular diversity survey (Keeling et al., 2014Keeling P.J. Burki F. Wilcox H.M. Allam B. Allen E.E. Amaral-Zettler L.A. Armbrust E.V. Archibald J.M. Bharti A.K.

In our screen, we discovered three new genetic codes among 24 ciliate species (Figures 1A, 1B and S1; Data S1A), but no new codes in the remaining 265 eukaryotes (Data S1B). Unexpectedly, in two of these genetic codes, belonging to the heterotrichous ciliate Condylostoma magnum and an unclassified karyorelict (18S rRNA 95% identical to that of Parduzcia orbis [Edgcomb et al., 2011Edgcomb V.P. Leadbetter E.R. Bourland W. Beaudoin D. Bernhard J.M. Structured multiple endosymbiosis of bacteria and archaea in a ciliate from marine sulfidic sediments: a survival mechanism in low oxygen, sulfidic sediments?.Front Microbiol. 2011; 2: 55Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar]; Parduzcia sp. hereafter) all three “stop” codons are predicted to be reassigned to amino acids: UAA = Q, UAG = Q, UGA = W. As the remaining C. magnum and Parduzcia sp. codons encode standard amino acids (Figures 1A and S1A), all 64 of their codons are translated. Hence, the question is if and how translation termination occurs given these codes. Because the UGA codon usage in C. magnum, Parduczia sp., and B. japonicum is relatively low (0.042%, 0.120%, and 0.059%, respectively), to computationally assess the hypothesis that the C. magnum and Parduczia sp. genes with in-frame UGA codons are functional, and not simply pseudogenes with in frame stops, we sought essential single copy genes with in-frame UGAs and examined their substitution rates. In-frame UGA codons are present in critical genes, such as C. magnum tryptophan-tRNA ligase (Figure 2B; MMETSP0210: CAMNT_0008287141) and eRF1 of Parduczia sp. (MMETSP1317: CAMNT_0047593165). Substitution rates of genes such as these support the hypothesis of functionality since they indicate strong purifying selection, e.g., for C. magnum tryptophan-tRNA ligase aligned to Oxytricha trifallax tryptophan-tRNA ligase, dN/dS is 0.013 (dN/dS = nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site over synonymous substitutions per synonymous site; dN/dS <1 indicates purifying selection) (Yang, 2007Yang Z. PAML 4: phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (8226) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that UGA codons are translated was assessed experimentally in two ways: we determined that UGA codons are translated as tryptophan by protein mass spectrometry (Data S1D and S1E); using ribosome profiling we observe that ribosomes efficiently translate through UGA codons, as they also do through UAG and UAA codons (Figures 2B and S3E). Given evidence that all three “stop” codons in the C. magnum and Parduczia sp. genetic codes can be translated, we wished to assess how translation termination occurs. To investigate the nature of translation termination in C. magnum and Parduczia sp. we began by examining histone H4 coding sequence ends, since the proteins encoded by these sequences are among the most highly conserved proteins and typically have the same C-terminal residues (e.g., 95% of 105 reviewed UniProt histone H4 proteins end with two glycines; Feb 9, 2015). With respect to the conserved C-terminal amino acid of histone H4 homologs in other eukaryotes, each of the C. magnum histone H4 paralog coding sequences is expected to end with a C-terminal glycine codon (Figure 2C). The codon immediately following this, either UAG or UGA, is therefore a candidate stop. The coding sequence of the single histone H4 in the Parduzcia sp. transcriptome is followed by a UGA codon at the expected stop position (Figure 2C). With respect to aligned homologs from other organisms, all the Parduczia sp. transcripts we inspected have a UGA where a stop codon would normally be expected. C. magnum also has transcripts that have only the possibility of UAA stops in proximity to where stops are expected (Figures S2B–S2D). From the sequence alignments, we therefore infer that C. magnum’s eRF1 recognizes all three standard stop codons and hence needs to outcompete stop cognate tRNAs to terminate translation. To test whether translation termination occurs at the putative histone H4 stop codons, we used ribosome profiling (ribo-seq). For C. magnum’s histone H4.1b and H4.1c forms, it can be seen that translation terminates precisely at the predicted stop codons (Figure 2D), whereas it does so with a small amount of imprecision for H4.1d (Figure 3A; H4.1a was insufficiently covered by ribo-seq reads to assess termination). In general, translation terminating C. magnum translation terminating ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) end 11/12 nucleotides (nt) after stop codon 3′ nt (Figure 3D—compare to sense codons in Figure 3C; Figure 2D is a typical example). Consequently, both the primary and secondary H4.1d stop codons, UAG and UAA, trigger translation termination, and the typical histone H4 C-terminus may occasionally be extended by one or more amino acids. While readthrough is conventionally classified as translation of stop codons by near-cognate tRNAs, in C. magnum, which has stop cognate tRNAs (see next section), translation through stop codons by near-cognate tRNAs is effectively indistinguishable from translation by cognate tRNAs in ribo-seq data. Therefore, for the sake of simplicity, in C. magnum, we classify readthrough as translation through codons that typically trigger translation termination (as for H4.1d). It should be noted that in C. magnum, multiple translation termination opportunities often exist before the ribosome translates into poly(A) tails (on average approximately five codons intervene between the primary and additional downstream non-primary stops). As a consequence, if extensions result from readthrough they are typically expected to be very short. Even though multiple possible stop codons exist, examples of imprecise termination as in H4.1d are in the minority: ∼90% of transcripts examined with >20 RPFs situated at their stops show no readthrough. Thus, overall readthrough is quite low, e.g., a mean of <1.8% and median of 0% (Figure S3K). The small amount of readthrough that does occur is most readily detected when the ribosome occupies downstream stops (Figure 3E). Multiple lines of evidence therefore demonstrate that “stop” codons as a class in the C. magnum and Parduczia sp. genetic codes are ambiguous, whereas their individual codons are typically recognized unambiguously as either sense or stops, solving the translation termination paradox. All model ciliates have “suppressor” tRNAs that are complementary to and permit translation of reassigned stop codons (Eisen et al., 2006Eisen J.A. Coyne R.S. Wu M. Wu D. Thiagarajan M. Wortman J.R.

Although we found a comprehensive set of tRNAs in our C. magnum genome assemblies, including glutamine tRNAs capable of recognizing UAA and UAG codons (Figures 4A and 4B ; Data S1G), we were unable to detect tRNATrps with UCA anticodons. Given the high sequence coverage of the C. magnum macronuclear genome, it is unlikely that we missed tRNATrp(UCA)s. Ciliates possess both a micronuclear and a macronuclear genome, with the former predominantly unsequenced in our C. magnum assembly due to its comparatively low ploidy. It is also unlikely that tRNATrp(UCA)s have gone undetected because they are micronuclear genome-encoded: although these genomes are transcriptionally active during ciliate sexual development they are generally inactive during vegetative growth (Chen et al., 2014Chen X.

To test if CCA → UCA anticodon editing produces a UGA-cognate tRNATrp, we sequenced RT-PCR products targeting nuclear genome-encoded tRNATrps and examined tRNA reads from small RNA sequencing data, but found no signs of significant anticodon editing (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). All sequenced ciliate mitochondrial genomes encode a UGA-cognate tRNATrp(UCA) (Swart et al., 2013Swart E.C. Bracht J.R. Magrini V. Minx P. Chen X. Zhou Y. Khurana J.S. Goldman A.D. Nowacki M.

Experiments in cell-free lysates show cytoplasmic ribosomes can use yeast mitochondrial tRNATrp(UCA) to translate UGA codons (Tuite and McLaughlin, 1982Tuite M.F. McLaughlin C.S. Endogenous read-through of a UGA termination codon in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-free system: evidence for involvement of both a mitochondrial and a nuclear tRNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 490-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine whether C. magnum’s mitochondrial tRNATrp(UCA)s are used to translate its mRNA UGA codons, it will be necessary to show these tRNAs are accessible to cytoplasmic ribosomes in quantities adequate for translation. In standard genetic code organisms, readthrough UGA stop codons are preferentially translated as tryptophan (e.g., for Saccharomyces cerevisiae: UGA: 86% W, 7% C, 7% R) (Roy et al., 2015Roy B. Leszyk J.D. Mangus D.A. Jacobson A. Nonsense suppression by near-cognate tRNAs employs alternative base pairing at codon positions 1 and 3.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Near-cognate pairing of tRNATrp(CCA) to UGA may also be substantially enhanced through particular mutations, e.g., in Escherichia coli a tRNATrp(CCA) D-stem point mutation leads to 30× more tryptophan translation at UGA stop codons than the wild-type tRNA (Hirsh, 1971Hirsh D. Tryptophan transfer RNA as the UGA suppressor.J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 58: 439-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, Hirsh and Gold, 1971Hirsh D. Gold L.

C. magnum has three types of tRNATrp(CCA) (Figures S4B and S4C), and it will be necessary to experimentally assess if any of these tRNAs permits efficient translation of its mRNA UGA codons. We assessed two hypotheses for how sense codons are distinguished from stop codons in ambiguous codes: (1) that there are sequence-specific features (motifs) allowing discriminating protein factors to bind nearby sense and stop codons, and (2) that proximity to transcript ends results in recognition of stops. We reject the hypothesis that specific sequences are necessary for stop/sense discrimination for the following reasons: (1) the base composition around sense “stop” codons is not constrained (Figure S5A), and (2) although the bases flanking C. magnum stop codons are weakly biased (Figure S5B), and such biases exist in other eukaryotes, where they are associated with enhanced termination efficiency (McCaughan et al., 1995McCaughan K.K. Brown C.M. Dalphin M.E. Berry M.J. Tate W.P. Translational termination efficiency in mammals is influenced by the base following the stop codon.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 5431-5435Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), it is trivial to find sense “stop” codons with the preferred stop codon flanking Us, thus flanking bases cannot be sufficient to distinguish stop codons. We next assessed if the proximity of the “stop” codon to transcript ends might determine sense/stop state. While analyzing ciliate 3′ UTRs we were struck by how short they are, with those of heterotrichs the shortest of all (median lengths, excluding the poly(A) tail and stop codon: 21–23 nt; Figure 5A). In the literature, we could find no eukaryotes with shorter 3′ UTRs. In comparison, yeast, metazoan, and plant 3′ UTRs typically have a >100 nt length mode and may be considerably longer (Aoki et al., 2010Aoki K. Yano K. Suzuki A. Kawamura S. Sakurai N. Suda K. Kurabayashi A. Suzuki T. Tsugane T.

Because poly(A) tails of certain C. magnum transcripts, especially those with UAA stop codons, start immediately after their stop codon (Figures 5B–5D) stops can be situated adjacent to poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) in vivo, and hence translation may be terminated with no additional information encoded by 3′ UTRs. Because the ribosome occupies 11 or 12 nucleotides downstream of C. magnum stop codons, even for those transcripts with 3′UTRs, there may be little room for ribosomes to maneuver passed stop codons without displacing PABPs. Given such short 3′ UTRs in ciliates, we therefore propose that nearby protein-bound poly(A) tails may contribute to discriminating stop from sense."

Excessive fear or fear that persists in the absence of threat is dysfunctional, as in phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Milad and Quirk, 2012Milad M.R. Quirk G.J.

The formation and expression of fear memory involves the extended amygdala and its connected brain areas (Janak and Tye, 2015Janak P.H. Tye K.M.

The circuit between the amygdala and the limbic prefrontal cortex is critical for reducing fear responses during the extinction phase (Herry et al., 2010Herry C. Ferraguti F. Singewald N.

Mechanisms of fear extinction.Mol. Psychiatry. 2007; 12: 120-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). However, the functions and molecular mechanisms of extra-amygdalar circuits in fear extinction remain unclear. The habenulo-interpeduncular pathway may regulate aversive responses (Figures S1A and S1B). In mammals, the medial habenula (MHb) in the epithalamus receives excitatory signals from brain areas that promote fear and anxiety (Yamaguchi et al., 2013Yamaguchi T. Danjo T. Pastan I. Hikida T.

A majority of MHb neurons express cholinergic markers and corelease glutamate and acetylcholine to activate their postsynaptic neurons in the midbrain interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) (Frahm et al., 2015Frahm S.

IPN neurons then project caudally to a set of brainstem nuclei, where neurons send their outputs back to the limbic forebrain areas (Goto et al., 2001Goto M. Swanson L.W. Canteras N.S.

It remains unclear whether the findings from the studies of fish apply to mammals, because the fish MHb homolog receives direct sensory but not limbic inputs (Stephenson-Jones et al., 2012Stephenson-Jones M. Floros O. Robertson B. Grillner S. Evolutionary conservation of the habenular nuclei and their circuitry controlling the dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HT) systems.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E164-E173Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Habenula cholinergic neurons express a particularly high level of GABAB receptors along their axonal projections to the IPN (Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 1999Margeta-Mitrovic M. Mitrovic I. Riley R.C. Jan L.Y. Basbaum A.I. Immunohistochemical localization of GABA(B) receptors in the rat central nervous system.J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 405: 299-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). GABAB is a key receptor for the major neurotransmitter GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid), and GABAB has to date been considered to be exclusively inhibitory (Gassmann and Bettler, 2012Gassmann M. Bettler B. Regulation of neuronal GABA(B) receptor functions by subunit composition.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 380-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Activating GABAB suppresses transmitter release at presynaptic sites and hyperpolarizes membrane potentials at postsynaptic sites (Dutar and Nicoll, 1988aDutar P. Nicoll R.A.

Nicoll R.A. Direct hyperpolarizing action of baclofen on hippocampal pyramidal cells.Nature. 1984; 308: 450-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Altered GABAB signaling is associated with anxiety and fear disorders (Cryan and Kaupmann, 2005Cryan J.F. Kaupmann K. Don’t worry ‘B’ happy!: a role for GABA(B) receptors in anxiety and depression.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 36-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The GABAB agonist baclofen has been used to treat PTSD in clinical trials (Drake et al., 2003Drake R.G. Davis L.L. Cates M.E. Jewell M.E. Ambrose S.M. Lowe J.S. Baclofen treatment for chronic posttraumatic stress disorder.Ann. Pharmacother. 2003; 37: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Manteghi et al., 2014Manteghi A.A. Hebrani P.

Psychopharmacol. 2014; 34: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role in fear control for GABAB receptors that are expressed in MHb neurons. However, no studies have as yet addressed the behavioral functions, physiological effects, or molecular mechanisms of GABAB signaling in the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway. Here, we analyzed the functions of habenula cholinergic neurons and their GABAB receptors in the acquisition and expression of cued fear memory. We found that both the neuronal activity and the presynaptic GABAB signaling of these neurons are critical for extinguishing fear memory. Critically, GABAB mediates its behavioral effect by strongly potentiating the corelease of multiple neurotransmitters. At the molecular level, GABAB produces presynaptic excitation by facilitating Ca2+ entry through the Cav2.3 channel. Our data demonstrate that GABAB signaling in a specific synapse of an evolutionarily-conserved pathway controls expression of fear memory, hence suggesting alternative therapeutic approaches to treating fear disorders. We first ablated cholinergic neurons in the MHb to test whether they are required for forming or expressing fear memory. To selectively kill these neurons, we infused the Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector AAV-flex-taCasp3-TEVp into the bilateral habenula of a ChAT-Cre mouse, which expressed the Cre recombinase under the promoter of the gene encoding choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (Figures 1A and 1B ). As a control for the accuracy of the ChAT-Cre driver line (Gong et al., 2007Gong S. Doughty M. Harbaugh C.R. Cummins A. Hatten M.E. Heintz N. Gerfen C.R. Targeting Cre recombinase to specific neuron populations with bacterial artificial chromosome constructs.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 9817-9823Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), infusion of the AAV-DIO-EmGFP vectors led to the expression of enhanced membrane green fluorescent protein (EmGFP) in ChAT-immunopositive neurons within the MHb of these mice (henceforth referred to as MHb-ChAT-EmGFP mice for simplicity; Figure 1C). This approach also selectively labeled ChAT-expressing axons from the MHb to the IPN (Figure S1C). Consistent with the effect of taCasp3 on inducing cell apoptosis (Yang et al., 2013Yang C.F. Chiang M.C. Gray D.C. Prabhakaran M. Alvarado M. Juntti S.A. Unger E.K. Wells J.A. Shah N.M. Sexually dimorphic neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus govern mating in both sexes and aggression in males.Cell. 2013; 153: 896-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), injecting AAV-flex-taCasp3-TEVp into the ChAT-Cre (abbreviated as MHb-ChAT-taCasp3) mice eliminated cholinergic neurons in the MHb and abolished cholinergic axonal terminals in the IPN (Figures 1C, S1C, and S1D). The ChAT expression pattern remained unchanged in other major cholinergic brain areas (Figures S1E–S1G), indicating that the vector-induced loss of cholinergic neurons was restricted within the MHb and that cholinergic inputs to the IPN arose predominantly from the MHb. We compared the MHb-ChAT-taCasp3 mice with the MHb-ChAT-EmGFP control mice on a test of cued fear memory. In this test, we conditioned mice by presenting a 20-s auditory tone (conditioned stimulus [CS]) that co-terminated with a 1-s footshock for five trials (Figure 1D). As training progressed, both groups became increasingly immobilized (freezing) during the tone. The two groups of mice exhibited similar freezing levels during the conditioning phase (Figure 1E; see Table S1 for statistical analysis), suggesting that habenula cholinergic neurons are dispensable for forming fear memory. We then examined whether ablating these neurons affected fear memory expression. Following behavioral protocols for testing fear extinction (Milad and Quirk, 2002Milad M.R. Quirk G.J. Neurons in medial prefrontal cortex signal memory for fear extinction.Nature. 2002; 420: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, Soria-Gómez et al., 2015Soria-Gómez E. Busquets-Garcia A. Hu F. Mehidi A. Cannich A. Roux L. Louit I. Alonso L. Wiesner T. Georges F. et al.Habenular CB1 receptors control the expression of aversive memories.Neuron. 2015; 88: 306-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we placed a mouse in a test chamber that was distinct from the training chamber and repetitively delivered CS tones in the absence of footshock (ten trials with random intervals) (Figure 1D). The MHb-ChAT-EmGFP control mice showed the normal response pattern: freezing responses decreased gradually within a session and became fully extinguished after ∼3 days. The freezing levels of MHb-ChAT-taCasp3 mice were initially similar to those of control mice, but decayed more slowly, resulting in significantly higher freezing ratios, even after 5 days (Figures 1F and 1G; Table S1). In a different experiment, we tested animal freezing responses to a 180-s continuous auditory tone (Soria-Gómez et al., 2015Soria-Gómez E. Busquets-Garcia A. Hu F. Mehidi A. Cannich A. Roux L. Louit I. Alonso L. Wiesner T. Georges F. et al.Habenular CB1 receptors control the expression of aversive memories.Neuron. 2015; 88: 306-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Figure 1D). In both test sessions on days 1 and 6, the MHb-ChAT-taCasp3 mice showed long-lasting freezing responses during the tones, resulting in significantly higher total freezing time than for control mice (Figures 1H and 1I; Table S1). Ablating habenula cholinergic neurons did not affect locomotor activity (Figures S1H and S1I; Table S1), thus ruling out the possibility that a general suppression of locomotor activity caused the freezing increase. Therefore, habenula cholinergic neurons are necessary for reducing fear responses to conditioned stimuli that no longer actively predict threat. We next examined whether activating habenula cholinergic neurons would be sufficient for reducing freezing responses. In these experiments, we used ChAT-ChR2-EYFP mice, in which the light-sensitive cation channel ChannelRhodopsin2 (ChR2) was selectively expressed in the somata and axons of cholinergic neurons (Figures 1J, S1J, and S1K) (Ren et al., 2011Ren J. Qin C. Hu F. Tan J. Qiu L. Zhao S. Feng G. Luo M. Habenula “cholinergic” neurons co-release glutamate and acetylcholine and activate postsynaptic neurons via distinct transmission modes.Neuron. 2011; 69: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the fact that the axons of bilateral MHb neurons converge into a single nucleus along the midline, we used one optical fiber to activate the bilateral cholinergic inputs. The optical fiber was implanted into the dorsal IPN with its tip tapered to minimize tissue damage (Figures 1J and S1L). We induced strong fear responses by conditioning ChAT-ChR2-EYFP mice with ten tone-footshock pairs (Figure S1M). During the extinction phase in the following days, the mice in the stimulation group received light pulses to activate the cholinergic terminals during auditory tones (Figure 1K). Optogenetic stimulation resulted in significantly lower levels of freezing throughout the test. As a control, delivering light pulses to wild-type littermate mice and omitting light pulses to the control ChAT-ChR2-EYFP mice had no effect (Figures 1L and 1M; Table S1). These results therefore suggest that activating habenula cholinergic neurons can effectively substitute for fear extinction. We investigated how GABAB receptors in habenula cholinergic neurons may affect fear behavior. Both essential subunits, GABAB(1) and GABAB(2), are richly expressed in habenula cholinergic neurons and their axon terminals within the IPN (Figures 2A, 2B , and S2A–S2C ). To genetically inactivate the GABAB(1)-encoding gene (Gabbr1) in cholinergic neurons, we generated GABAB(1) conditional knockout (ChAT-GABAB(1)-KO; CKO) mice by crossing the ChAT-Cre mouse line with the GABAB(1)lox511/lox511 line. In the ChAT-GABAB(1)-KO mice, GABAB(1) expression was abolished in the cholinergic neurons in the MHb and in their axonal terminals within the central and rostral IPN (Figures 2C and 2D and S2D–S2F); GABAB(1) expression appeared normal in the lateral IPN, cortex, and hippocampus of these mice (Figures S2G–S2I). This allowed us to investigate the potential role in fear memory expression for the GABAB activity of cholinergic neurons.Figure S2Genetically Inactivating GABAB Receptors in Habenula Cholinergic Neurons Affects Fear Memory Expression but Not the General Locomotor Activity, Anxiety Level, or Pain Sensitivity, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A–C) GABAB(2) expression (red) in ChR2-EYFP+ (green) cholinergic neurons within the MHb (A) and their axonal terminals within the IPN (B and C) of a ChAT-ChR2-EYFP mouse.

(H and I) Similar GABAB(1) expression in the cortex (H) and hippocampus (I) of a control mouse and a CKO mouse. (J and K) Time-course freezing responses (J) and total freezing responses (K) of the CKO mice and their wild-type littermate control (ctrl). (L) CKO mice and ctrl mice exhibited similar levels of locomotor activity prior to the test session on day 1. (M–O) In an open field, CKO mice and control (ctrl) mice showed similar locomotor activity (M), center entry number (N), and center locomotion (O). (P–R) The control mice and CKO mice exhibited no significant difference in the exploration time in the open arms of an elevated plus maze (P), in the exploration time in the illuminated chamber in a light/dark box (Q), and in the pain threshold (R). The pain threshold was measured by the minimal footshock current that elicited vocalization responses. In (J), p < 0.0001 for difference between genotypes in both sessions, two-way ANOVA. In (K) to (R) ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; n.s., not significant; unpaired t tests. Error bars indicate SEM. See Table S1 for statistical analyses in detail. Both ChAT-GABAB(1)-KO mice and their wild-type littermates showed similar increases in freezing during the conditioning phase (Figure 2E; Table S1), indicating that the GABAB activity of cholinergic neurons is not required for forming cued fear memory. In the extinction sessions using discrete CS, a tone without shock elicited significant higher freezing levels from GABAB CKO mice, even after extinction training for 5 days (Figures 2F and 2G; Table S1). When tested with a continuous 180-s tone, wild-type mice gradually reduced their freezing, but the GABAB CKO mice continued to freeze and exhibited significantly higher freezing levels on days 1 and 6 (Figures S2J and S2K; Table S1). ChAT-GABAB(1)-KO mice did not show abnormality in locomotor activity before the tests, nor in general locomotion in an open field, nor in anxiety levels in heightened or illuminated open spaces, nor in pain sensitivity to footshock (Figures S2L–S2R; Table S1). Apparently GABAB activity of the cholinergic neurons does not affect various global functions. Rather, it is critical to controlling fear extinction. We then examined how pharmacological manipulation of GABAB activity in the IPN of wild-type mice would affect fear responses. C57BL6/N wild-type mice were conditioned with five tone-footshock pairs. Immediately before the extinction sessions, we infused the GABAB antagonist 2-OH-saclofen (saclofen) directly into the IPN (Figure S3A). Saclofen pretreatment significantly increased the freezing responses to both discrete trials of conditioned stimulus and a 180-s continuous tone (Figures 3A, 3B , S3B, and S3C; Table S1). Saclofen did not reduce locomotor activity prior to the presentation of auditory tone (Figure S3D; Table S1), again indicating that GABAB activity in the IPN reduces freezing levels but not general locomotion.Figure 3GABAB Activity in the Interpeduncular Nucleus Facilitates Fear ExtinctionShow full caption(A and B) The effects of pre-test intra-IPN infusion of the GABAB antagonist 2-OH-saclofen (saclofen; 300 pmol) on freezing responses across trials (A) and total freezing response levels (B) of C57BL6/N wild-type mice during the extinction sessions on days 1–3.(C and D) The effects of pre-test injection of baclofen (3 pmol) into the IPN on the freezing responses across trials (C) and overall freezing ratio (D) of wild-type mice.(E and F) Lack of significant effects by intra-IPN pretreatment of baclofen on the freezing responses across trials (E) and overall freezing ratio (F) of ChAT-GABAB(1)-KO mice.

https://openalex.org/W2461078780,"Prostate cancer is known to frequently recur in bone; however, how dormant cells switch its phenotype leading to recurrent tumor remains poorly understood. We have isolated two syngeneic cell lines (indolent and aggressive) through in vivo selection by implanting PC3mm stem-like cells into tibial bones. We found that indolent cells retained the dormant phenotype, whereas aggressive cells grew rapidly in bone in vivo, and the growth rates of both cells in culture were similar, suggesting a role of the tumor microenvironment in the regulation of dormancy and recurrence. Indolent cells were found to secrete a high level of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), which significantly stimulated the expression of BMP7 in bone marrow stromal cells. The secreted BMP7 then kept cancer cells in a dormant state by inducing senescence, reducing stemness, and activating dormancy-associated p38 MAPK signaling and p21 expression in cancer cells. Importantly, we found that SPARC was epigenetically silenced in aggressive cells by promoter methylation, but 5-azacytidine treatment reactivated the expression. Furthermore, high SPARC promoter methylation negatively correlated with disease-free survival of prostate cancer patients. We also found that the COX2 inhibitor NS398 down-regulated DNMTs and increased expression of SPARC, which led to tumor growth suppression in bone in vivo These findings suggest that SPARC plays a key role in maintaining the dormancy of prostate cancer cells in the bone microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2463983240,"Stimulus processing in fear conditioning is constrained by parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs) through inhibition of principal excitatory neurons. However, the contributions of PV-IN microcircuits to input gating and long-term plasticity in the fear system remain unknown. Here we interrogate synaptic connections between afferent pathways, PV-INs, and principal excitatory neurons in the basolateral amygdala. We find that subnuclei of this region are populated two functionally distinct PV-IN networks. PV-INs in the lateral (LA), but not the basal (BA), amygdala possess complex dendritic arborizations, receive potent excitatory drive, and mediate feedforward inhibition onto principal neurons. After fear conditioning, PV-INs exhibit nucleus- and target-selective plasticity, resulting in persistent reduction of their excitatory input and inhibitory output in LA but not BA. These data reveal previously overlooked specializations of amygdala PV-INs and indicate specific circuit mechanisms for inhibitory plasticity during the encoding of associative fear memories."

However, the intermediate molecules from stresses to neuronal atrophy remain elusive, which we have studied in the medial prefrontal cortices from depression mice.The mice were treated by the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) until they expressed depression-like behaviors confirmed by the tests of sucrose preference, forced swimming and Y-maze. High-throughput sequencings of microRNA and mRNA in the medial prefrontal cortices were performed in CUMS-induced depression mice versus control mice to demonstrate the molecular profiles of major depression. In the medial prefrontal cortices of depression-like mice, the levels of mRNAs that translated the proteins for the GABAergic synapses, dopaminergic synapses, myelination, synaptic vesicle cycle and neuronal growth were downregulated. miRNAs of regulating these mRNAs are upregulated.The deteriorations of GABAergic and dopaminergic synapses as well as axonal growth are associated with CUMS-induced depression."
https://openalex.org/W2469454278,"Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) specification is regulated by numerous defined factors acting locally within the hemogenic niche; however, it is unclear whether production can adapt to fluctuating systemic needs. Here we show that the CNS controls embryonic HSPC numbers via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal (HPA/I) stress response axis. Exposure to serotonin or the reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine increased runx1 expression and Flk1(+)/cMyb(+) HSPCs independent of peripheral innervation. Inhibition of neuronal, but not peripheral, tryptophan hydroxlyase (Tph) persistently reduced HSPC number. Consistent with central HPA/I axis induction and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation, GR agonists enhanced, whereas GR loss diminished, HSPC formation. Significantly, developmental hypoxia, as indicated by Hif1α function, induced the HPA/I axis and cortisol production. Furthermore, Hif1α-stimulated HSPC enhancement was attenuated by neuronal tph or GR loss. Our data establish that embryonic HSC production responds to physiologic stress via CNS-derived serotonin synthesis and central feedback regulation to control HSC numbers."

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is an established treatment for malignant diseases such as leukemia, myelodysplasia, and myelofibrosis as well as non-malignant disorders such as severe aplastic anemia and congenital immune or enzyme deficiencies, with >40,000 transplants undertaken worldwide (Aljurf et al., 2014Aljurf M.

Despite this success, ∼67% of patients who require allogeneic transplantation are not able to undergo this procedure due to the lack of matched donors (Oran and Shpall, 2012Oran B. Shpall E. Umbilical cord blood transplantation: a maturing technology.Hematology (Am Soc Hematol Educ Program). 2012; 2012: 215-222PubMed Google Scholar). Umbilical cord blood (CB) banks have the potential to alleviate these obstacles due to broader representation of histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) types, less restriction on HLA matching, reduced incidence of graft versus host disease (GvHD), and rapid access compared to registries. However, widespread use of CB is impaired due to insufficient hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) numbers in single CB units, resulting in extended times to full engraftment (Ballen et al., 2013Ballen K.K. Gluckman E. Broxmeyer H.E. Umbilical cord blood transplantation: the first 25 years and beyond.Blood. 2013; 122: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Transplants combining two unrelated CB units have attempted to overcome the shortfall in HSC number, although improvements are modest (Barker et al., 2001Barker J.N. Weisdorf D.J. Wagner J.E.

The unique self-renewal properties of HSCs are thought to be controlled by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic signaling networks that finely balance the equilibrium among quiescence, proliferation, and differentiation. Generating increased numbers of HSC could come from controlling self-renewal or inducing self-renewal in the more numerous progenitor compartment. To achieve the latter, numerous signaling pathways would have to be appropriately fine-tuned. Small, non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, and one miRNA can target hundreds of transcripts comprising an entire network of regulated genes, positioning miRNAs as pivotal regulators of cellular homeostasis (Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P.

This family consists of three paralogs (miR-125a, miR-125b1, and miR-125b2) sharing an identical seed sequence and exerting similar effects on HSPCs (Wojtowicz et al., 2014Wojtowicz E.E.

In the current study, we explored the potential of a single miRNA, miR-125a, to confer long-term repopulating ability to non-stem cell populations.

We sorted immunophenotypically defined HSC and progenitor cell subsets from human-lineage-depleted CB (Figure S1A) (Doulatov et al., 2010Doulatov S. Notta F. Eppert K. Nguyen L.T. Ohashi P.S.

We observed that the highest expression levels of miR-125a were restricted to the HSC-enriched CD34+CD38−CD45RA−CD90+CD49f+ and CD34+CD38−CD45RA−CD90−CD49f− (MPP) fractions and become significantly downregulated in multi-lymphoid progenitors (MLPs) and committed CD34+CD38+ progenitor fractions (common myeloid progenitor [CMP], granulocyte monocyte progenitor [GMP], and megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitor [MEP]) (Figure 1A). These data demonstrate an inverse correlation between differentiation state and miR-125a expression levels. To study the function of miR-125a in human HSPCs, we generated a lentiviral vector with miR-125a (miR-125OE) under a constitutive SFFV promoter using an orange fluorescent protein (OFP) reporter (Figure 1B). To determine the impact of increased miR-125a expression (Figure S1B) on human HSPC function, CD34+CD38− human CB HSPCs transduced with miR-125OE and control vector transduced cells were analyzed in xenotransplantation assays (Figure 1B). At 12 and 24 weeks after transplantation, we observed significant increases in human chimerism within distant BM sites in the miR-125aOE group compared to controls; chimerism levels in the injected femur (IF) were significantly increased only at 12 weeks (Figure 1C). Mice transplanted with miR-125OE cells also exhibited white BM and splenomegaly (Figure S1C). Furthermore, within enlarged spleens, we found increased proportions of CD19+CD10+CD20− B lymphoid cells, suggesting a partial B cell differentiation block at the pro-B cell stage (Figure S1D). Examination of the lineage distribution of OFP+ cells in the BM revealed that all lineages were present, with significant expansion of the CD41+ megakaryocyte population (Figure 1D) and an increased CD3+ T cell population. At the progenitor level (Figures 1E and S1E), we observed a trend for increased GMPs and decreased MEP frequency in the BM, whereas the frequency of the multi-lymphoid progenitor fraction (MLP) was significantly increased at the expense of immunophenotypic HSCs and MPPs in the primitive compartment (Figures 1F and S1E). These observations are in line with previous reports in murine HSPCs pointing to conservation of function across species (Gerrits et al., 2012Gerrits A. Walasek M.A. Olthof S. Weersing E. Ritsema M.

The self-renewal potential of transduced human HSC within primary engrafted mice was assessed using quantitative secondary transplantation assays. Recipients transplanted with miR-125OE cells showed higher chimerism levels compared to controls, and the HSC frequency increased by 4.4- and 5-fold in miR-125OE recipients in independent experiments (Figures 1G and S1F), similar to published murine studies (Gerrits et al., 2012Gerrits A. Walasek M.A. Olthof S. Weersing E. Ritsema M. Zwart E. van Os R. Bystrykh L.V. de Haan G.

Given the robust increase in HSC frequency upon miR-125a expression, we asked whether more committed cell populations might also be endowed with enhanced self-renewal. We flow sorted CD34+CD38− compartment sub-populations (HSC, MPP, and MLP) and CD34+CD38+ committed progenitors, transduced them with miR-125OE or control vectors, and transplanted cells into immuno-deficient mice measuring repopulation after 12 weeks. miR-125a overexpression in CD34+CD38+ progenitors produced a substantial graft that disseminated to distant BM locations after 12 weeks, whereas control transduced CD34+CD38+ cells generated a barely discernable graft (in one mouse recipient only) in the IF site (Figure 2A). As expected, only control transduced cells from sorted HSC (CD34+CD38−CD45RA−CD90+CD49f+) generated a disseminating graft in recipient mice (Figure 2B). Similarly, sorted HSCs and MPPs (CD34+CD38−CD45RA−CD90−CD49f−) transduced with miR-125OE generated robust engraftment within the IFs and distant BM locations (Figure 2B). Sorted and transduced MLP (CD34+CD38−CD45RA+) were unable to generate any detectable graft (Figure 2B). In all cases, xenografts generated by CD34+CD38+ and MPP transduced with miR-125OE showed multi-lineage repopulation (Figures 2C and 2D). To evaluate if the grafts derived from CD34+CD38+ committed progenitors and MPP were durable, we transplanted these cells into secondary recipients. Whereas control transduced progenitors did not generate a graft in secondary recipient mice, the CD34+CD38+ and MPP cells that overexpressed miR-125a generated a multi-lineage graft for 20 weeks (five out of seven and six out of ten mice, respectively; Figures 2E and 2F). Furthermore, MPP secondary grafts remained multi-lineage (Figure 2G), and in no case did we observe myeloproliferative disease or leukemia in mice engrafted with miR-125OE human CB cells. Finally, to evaluate the long-term self-renewal potential of miR-125a expressing MPP, we transplanted the secondary MPP grafts into tertiary recipients for another 10 weeks. After a total of 30 weeks in mice, we observed small but measurable multi-lineage grafts both from CD34+CD38− CB progenitors and MPP-expressing miR-125a (Figures S2A–S2D). To distinguish between rare contaminating HSCs or enhanced self-renewal of MPPs as the primary mechanism for the observed MPP phenotype in secondary and tertiary mice, we used a modified splinkerette PCR approach to assess the clonality of secondary miR-125OE MPP grafts. Our data demonstrate that miR-125OE MPP BM grafts were oligoclonal, with no lentivirus insertions near or within strong oncogenes (Table S1), suggesting that the enhanced self-renewal observed in miR-125OE MPP mice was not attributable to rare contaminating HSCs. Given that our data strongly suggests that MPPs are frequently endowed with enhanced self-renewal potential, we should be able to model this phenomenon at the clonal level. Using in vitro long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays that were established with presorted transduced MPP (Table S2), we found that miR-125OE increased the LTC-IC frequency of transduced MPPs by ∼4-fold compared to controls (1/11.9 versus 1/44.7, respectively, p = 0.0000000975), with a concomitant ∼9-fold increase in colonies/LTC-IC (6.6 ± 2.1 versus 54.4 ± 11.6, p = 0.0041). Together, these data strongly suggest that the enhancement of self-renewal by enforced expression of miR-125 occurs not only in HSCs but also in MPPs and in an as-yet-unidentified population within the CD34+38+ committed progenitor compartment. To assess whether this enhanced self-renewal induced by miR-125a is conserved in mice, we overexpressed miR-125a (Figure 3A) in Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+ cells, depleted from CD150+CD48− cells (hereafter referred as progenitors) and in LT-HSCs (Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+CD150+CD48−) (Figure S3A). We confirmed enforced overexpression by qPCR (Figure S3B) and performed a series of in vivo HSC assays. As controls, we included cells transduced with a vector expressing only GFP and a vector expressing a mutant form of miR-125a, where the fourth base of the seed sequence was modified (for a seed 5′-CCCTGAC-3′ miR-125mut4T→C) (Figure 3A). The mutant construct was as effectively expressed and processed as non-mutated miR-125a (Figure S3B). We competitively transplanted transduced cells in limiting dilution to lethally irradiated recipients together with a high dose of 2 × 106 fresh BM cells (Figure 3A) and monitored GFP+ chimerism over time. As expected, miR-125OE in LT-HSCs strongly increased their competitive reconstitution activity compared to controls, similar to what we and others have reported (Figure 3B) (Gerrits et al., 2012Gerrits A.

Control transduced progenitors (and the mutant construct; data not shown) were unable to provide long-term repopulation (Figure 3C). By contrast, miR-125OE progenitors generated robust, high levels of multi-lineage reconstitution up to 16 weeks post-transplantation (Figure 3C). Limiting dilution experiments demonstrated a 10-fold expansion of stem cell pool size (Figures 3D, 3E, and S4A). Importantly, miR-125OE progenitors sustained long-term blood cell production with an estimated frequency similar to control LT-HSCs (Figures 3D, 3E, and S4A). Using cellular barcoding (for gene transfer efficiency and cell doses, see Figure S4B), we observed a significant increase in the number of clones contributing to myeloid engraftment upon miR-125a overexpression, indicating that induction of stem cell activity in progenitors was not a rare event, and likely not from contamination of rare LT-HSC (Figure 3F). At week 20 post-transplantation, we observed a reduced number of clones compared to week 4, but overall, the numbers of contributing clones were comparable in all groups (Figure 3F). Similar to our human CB data, mouse 125OE progenitors were able to sustain multi-lineage potential with myeloid skewing represented by increased numbers of Gr-1+ cells (Figure 3G) and increased numbers of GMPs, at the expense of MEPs (Figure 3H). To assess the potential of miR-125a to induce self-renewal, we serially transplanted 107 BM cells from primary recipients into lethally irradiated secondary recipients. While the repopulating potential of control LT-HSCs in secondary recipients was restricted to short-term engraftment (up to 6 weeks, most probably due to the high dose of competitors used in the first round of transplantation), the secondary recipients transplanted with miR-125OE LT-HSCs or progenitors were highly reconstituted, with an increased frequency of myeloid cells 20 weeks post-transplantation in peripheral blood (Figures 4C and 4D ). No lethality was observed in primary recipients. However, in secondary mice, we observed ∼20% mortality, starting at week 32, in mice transplanted with either miR-125OE LT-HSC or progenitors. Necropsy revealed increased white blood cell (WBC) counts, splenomegaly, pale bones, and blast-like cells in the blood. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of BM and spleen revealed dominance of EGFP+ cells of myeloid origin (Gr-1+ and/or Mac-1+, a MPN-like phenotype, as previously described; Gerrits et al., 2012Gerrits A. Walasek M.A. Olthof S. Weersing E. Ritsema M. Zwart E. van Os R. Bystrykh L.V. de Haan G. Genetic screen identifies microRNA cluster 99b/let-7e/125a as a regulator of primitive hematopoietic cells.Blood. 2012; 119: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar; data not shown). In tertiary recipients, mortality further increased to 40% for 125OE progenitors, and 60% for 125OE LT-HSCs. Surviving mice in the tertiary transplantation showed no engraftment (Figure 4E). In addition, mice transplanted with 125OE progenitors exhibited an increased fraction of erythroid progenitors (Figures S5A and S5B). These data suggest that both LT-HSCs and progenitors overexpressing miR-125a remained functionally active for significantly longer periods of time compared to control cells (Figure 4F), and the cell type distribution of GFP+ cells in secondary recipients 20 weeks post-transplantation showed myeloid skewing in mice transplanted with LT-HSC overexpressing miR-125a. We postulated that the myeloproliferative disease observed within 125OE mice could be due to a combination of miR-125-induced intrinsic changes and replicative stress (Figure 4E). To explore the role of replicative stress, we transplanted control and miR-125OE LT-HSCs into non-irradiated W41 recipients (Figure 4G). During the 11-month follow-up period, chimerism levels in 125OE LT-HSCs increased from 26% at transplantation reaching upward of 90% after 9 weeks post transplantation and remained very high. I"
https://openalex.org/W2487368057,"The role of Forkhead Box F1 (FoxF1) transcription factor in carcinogenesis is not well characterized. Depending on tissue and histological type of cancer, FoxF1 has been shown to be either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most aggressive pediatric soft-tissue sarcoma. Although FoxF1 is highly expressed in alveolar RMS, the functional role of FoxF1 in RMS is unknown. The present study demonstrates that expression of FoxF1 and its closely related transcription factor FoxF2 are essential for RMS tumor growth. Depletion of FoxF1 or FoxF2 in RMS cells decreased tumor growth in orthotopic mouse models of RMS. The decreased tumorigenesis was associated with reduced tumor cell proliferation. Cell cycle regulatory proteins Cdk2, Cdk4/6, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E2 were decreased in FoxF1- and FoxF2-deficient RMS tumors. Depletion of either FoxF1 or FoxF2 delayed G1-S cell cycle progression, decreased levels of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and increased protein levels of the CDK inhibitors, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. Depletion of both FoxF1 and FoxF2 in tumor cells completely abrogated RMS tumor growth in mice. Overexpression of either FoxF1 or FoxF2 in tumor cells was sufficient to increase tumor growth in orthotopic RMS mouse model. FoxF1 and FoxF2 directly bound to and repressed transcriptional activity of p21Cip1 promoter through -556/-545 bp region, but did not affect p27Kip1 transcription. Knockdown of p21Cip1 restored cell cycle progression in the FoxF1- or FoxF2-deficient tumor cells. Altogether, FoxF1 and FoxF2 promoted RMS tumorigenesis by inducing tumor cell proliferation via transcriptional repression of p21Cip1 gene promoter. Because of the robust oncogenic activity in RMS tumors, FoxF1 and FoxF2 may represent promising targets for anti-tumor therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2469284364,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease, and 10–20% of patients with NAFLD progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with a high risk of cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite its high medical importance, the molecular mechanisms controlling progression from simple liver steatosis to NASH remain elusive. We recently identified serine/threonine protein kinase (STK)25 as a critical regulator of ectopic lipid deposition, systemic glucose, and insulin homeostasis. To elucidate the role of STK25 in the development of NASH, we challenged Stk25-knockout and transgenic mice with a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet. We show that Stk25-/- mice are protected against MCD-diet– induced NASH, as evidenced by repressed liver steatosis, oxidative damage, inflammation, and fibrosis, whereas STK25 transgenic mice developed a more severe NASH phenotype, compared with corresponding wild-type littermates. Consistently, NASH features were suppressed in STK25-deficient human hepatocytes cultured in MCD medium, and reciprocally enhanced in STK25-overexpressing cells. We also found a significant positive correlation in human liver biopsies between STK25 expression and NASH development. The study provides evidence for multiple roles of STK25 in NASH pathogenesis and future investigations to address the potential therapeutic relevance of pharmacological STK25 inhibitors in prevention and treatment of NASH are warranted.—Amrutkar, M., Chursa, U., Kern, M., Nuñez-Durán, E., Ståhlman, M., Sütt, S., Borén, J., Johansson, B.

https://openalex.org/W2465813776,"One of the major histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is cerebral deposits of extracellular β-amyloid peptides. Preclinical studies have pointed to glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptors as a potential novel target in the treatment of AD. GLP-1 receptor agonists, including exendin-4 and liraglutide, have been shown to promote plaque-lowering and mnemonic effects of in a number of experimental models of AD. Transgenic mouse models carrying genetic mutations of amyloid protein precursor (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS1) are commonly used to assess the pharmacodynamics of potential amyloidosis-lowering and pro-cognitive compounds. In this study, effects of long-term liraglutide treatment were therefore determined in two double APP/PS1 transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease carrying different clinical APP/PS1 mutations, i.e. the 'London' (hAPPLon/PS1A246E) and 'Swedish' mutation variant (hAPPSwe/PS1ΔE9) of APP, with co-expression of distinct PS1 variants. Liraglutide was administered in 5 month-old hAPPLon/PS1A246E mice for 3 months (100 or 500 ng/kg/day, s.c.), or 7 month-old hAPPSwe/PS1ΔE9 mice for 5 months (500 ng/kg/day, s.c.). In both models, regional plaque load was quantified throughout the brain using stereological methods. Vehicle-dosed hAPPSwe/PS1ΔE9 mice exhibited considerably higher cerebral plaque load than hAPPLon/PS1A246E control mice. Compared to vehicle-dosed transgenic controls, liraglutide treatment had no effect on the plaque levels in hAPPLon/PS1A246E and hAPPSwe/PS1ΔE9 mice. In conclusion, long-term liraglutide treatment exhibited no effect on cerebral plaque load in two transgenic mouse models of low- and high-grade amyloidosis, which suggests differential sensitivity to long-term liraglutide treatment in various transgenic mouse models mimicking distinct pathological hallmarks of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2478596546,"Effluents from hospital and aquaculture are considered important sources of quinolone resistance. However, little information is available on the impact of this effluent on nearby rivers. In this study, 188 ciprofloxacin-resistant bacterial isolates obtained from rivers near hospitals and aquaculture were screened for plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. Species identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and PMQR gene transferability assessment were conducted for PMQR-positive bacteria. Representative qnrS2-encoding plasmids were subsequently sequenced using a primer-walking approach. In total, 44 isolates (23.4%) were positive for qnr genes (16 qnrB2, 3 qnrS1, and 25 qnrS2) and 32 isolates (17.0%) were positive for aac(6′)-Ib-cr. Other PMQR genes were not detected. The qnrB2 and aac(6′)-Ib-cr genes had a higher prevalence in aquaculture samples than in hospital samples, and were significantly associated with Enterobacteriaceae (p < 0.05). In contrast, the prevalence of qnrS2 was not site-related, but was significantly associated with Aeromonas spp. (p < 0.05). All PMQR isolates were resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics. Eleven qnrS2-harboring plasmids from Aeromonas spp., including a novel conjugative plasmid pHP18, were selected for sequencing. These plasmids were small in size (6,388–16,197 bp) and belonged to the IncQ or IncU plasmid family, with qnrS2 being part of a mobile insertion cassette. Taken together, our findings suggest that aquaculture is a possible source for aac(6′)-Ib-cr and qnrB2 dissemination, and demonstrate the ubiquity of qnrS2 in aquatic environments. Finally, Aeromonas spp. served as vectors for qnrS2 with the help of IncQ-type plasmids."

FSH promotes the differentiation and proliferation of GCs and is essential for fertility. We recently reported that ERK activation is necessary for FSH to induce key genes that define the preovulatory GC. This research focused on the phosphoregulation by FSH of ERK within GCs. FSH-stimulated ERK phosphorylation on Thr202/Tyr204 was PKA-dependent, but MEK(Ser217/Ser221) phosphorylation was not regulated; rather, MEK was already active. However, treatment of GCs with the EGF receptor inhibitor AG1478, a dominant-negative RAS, an Src homology 2 domain-containing Tyr phosphatase inhibitor (NSC 87877), or the MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocked FSH-dependent ERK(Thr202/Tyr204) phosphorylation, demonstrating the requirement for upstream pathway components. We hypothesized that FSH via PKA enhances ERK phosphorylation by inhibiting the activity of a protein phosphatase that constitutively dephosphorylates ERK in the absence of FSH, allowing MEK-phosphorylated ERK to accumulate in the presence of FSH because of inactivation of the phosphatase. GCs treated with different phosphatase inhibitors permitted elimination of both Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphatases and implicated dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) in the dephosphorylation of ERK.

Luteinizing hormone then initiates meiosis and promotes ovulation and differentiation of remaining follicular cells into luteal cells.

Based on the relevance of the ERK signaling pathway to immature GC maturation, we sought to better understand the mechanism by which FSH activates ERK. ERK is canonically activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Ligand-dependent activation of RTKs recruits the RAS guanine exchange factor SOS to the plasma membrane, resulting in RAS and, subsequently, RAF activation (reviewed in Ref. 6Roskoski Jr., R.

The Ser/Thr kinase RAF then phosphorylates/activates the dual specificity kinase MEK that phosphorylates ERK. ERK then phosphorylates downstream kinases like ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK-2) (7Dalby K.N.

A second antibody directed against PTPBR7, another phosphatase sharing protein sequence homology with PTP-SL except for a 127-amino acid insertion in the N terminus (14Van Den Maagdenberg A.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 7167-7179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although the Ptprr gene that encodes PTP-SL is expressed in GCs (based on RNA sequencing results (22Herndon M.K. Law N.C. Donaubauer E.M. Kyriss B. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Forkhead box O member FOXO1 regulates the majority of follicle-stimulating hormone responsive genes in ovarian granulosa cells.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2016; 434: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)), we thus question whether the PTP activity at 100 kDa that is detected by an anti-PTL-SL antibody is the phosphatase that constitutively dephosphorylates MEK-phosphorylated ERK in the absence of FSH. The results below confirm that the ERK signaling pathway upstream of MEK is constitutively active in GCs, that ERK is constitutively phosphorylated by MEK but actively dephosphorylated in the absence of FSH, that MEK-phosphorylated ERK accumulates in the presence of FSH because of the inactivation of a phosphatase, and that FSH-stimulated ERK but not MEK phosphorylation is PKA-dependent. FSH-stimulated ERK activation is not inhibited either by inhibitors of the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase PP1 or PP2 or by the pan-PTP inhibitor Na2VO3. Rather, using a panel of DUSP inhibitors, our results show that inhibitors of MKP3(DUSP6) selectively enhance the phosphorylation of ERK in the absence of FSH to levels equivalent to those of ERK phosphorylated in the presence of FSH. ERK co-immunoprecipitates with Myc-FLAG-tagged MKP3(DUSP6), MKP3(DUSP6) inhibitors block ERK phosphatase activity in GC extracts in the absence of FSH in an in vitro phosphatase assay, and the selective PKA inhibitor PKI blocks the inactivation of the ERK phosphatase in the presence of FSH in an in vitro phosphatase assay. Together, these results suggest that ERK in GCs is maintained in a dephosphorylated state in the absence of FSH by MKP3(DUSP6) and that PKA inhibits the activity of this DUSP. We initially sought to confirm that the canonical ERK signaling pathway in GCs upstream of MEK is tonically active and independent of FSH. Our previous results demonstrated an apparent requirement for the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR based on results showing that the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (23Levitzki A. Gazit A. Tyrosine kinase inhibition: an approach to drug development.Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar) blocked FSH-stimulated ERK(Thr202/Tyr204) phosphorylation. However, we did not evaluate the effect of AG1478 on MEK(Ser217/Ser221) phosphorylation (10Cottom J. Salvador L.M. Maizels E.T. Reierstad S. Park Y. Carr D.W. Davare M.A. Hell J.W. Palmer S.S. Dent P. Kawakatsu H. Ogata M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Follicle-stimulating hormone activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase through a 100-kDa phosphotyrosine phosphatase.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7167-7179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To this end, GCs were pretreated with AG1478, followed by treatment without or with FSH. The results (Fig. 1A) show that MEK(Ser217/Ser221) phosphorylation is readily detected in vehicle-treated GCs and independent of FSH, whereas ERK(Thr202/Tyr204) phosphorylation depends on FSH, and that AG1478 not only abolishes ERK(Thr202/Tyr204) phosphorylation (95.1% ± 0.8% inhibition, n = 5) but also abolishes MEK(Ser217/Ser221) phosphorylation (89.0% ± 3.8% inhibition, n = 2). AKT(Ser308) phosphorylation served as a negative control, as FSH-dependent activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is independent of the EGFR in GCs. 3M. E. Hunzicker-Dunn, unpublished data. These results indicate that the signaling pathway that promotes MEK phosphorylation is active in the absence of FSH and that this pathway requires the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR. Although AG1478 primarily inhibits the kinase activity of the EGFR, it is also reported to inhibit non-kinase targets (24Choi B.H. Choi J.S. Rhie D.J. Yoon S.H. Min D.S. Jo Y.H. Kim M.S. Hahn S.J. Direct inhibition of the cloned Kv1.5 channel by AG-1478, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C1461-C1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As the EGFR canonically activates RAS, we utilized two additional approaches to confirm that the signaling pathway downstream of the EGFR was required for FSH to activate ERK and was tonically active in the absence of FSH. We transduced GCs with a dominant negative adenoviral (Ad)-(S17N)-RAS or control Ad-GFP and then treated GCs with vehicle or FSH. The results (Fig. 1B) show that the dominant negative RAS blocked MEK(Ser217/Ser221) phosphorylation (75.2% ± 4.7% inhibition, n = 3) both in the absence and presence of FSH as well as FSH-stimulated ERK(Thr202/Tyr204) phosphorylation (78.3% ± 10.0% inhibition, n = 4). cAMP-response element-binding protein(Ser133) phosphorylation served as a negative control that is independent of EGFR/RAS signaling (25Montminy M. Transcriptional regulation by cyclic AMP.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphatase SRC homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2) is also required for RTK signaling into MEK/ERK and is generally believed to contribute to the activation of RAS (26Dance M. Montagner A. Salles J.P. Yart A. Raynal P.

We determined whether SHP2 activity was required for the phosphorylation of MEK(Ser217/Ser221) by pretreating GCs without or with NSC 87877, a compound that selectively inhibits SHP1 (which is not expressed in rat GCs based on RNA sequencing results (22Herndon M.K. Law N.C. Donaubauer E.M. Kyriss B. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Forkhead box O member FOXO1 regulates the majority of follicle-stimulating hormone responsive genes in ovarian granulosa cells.Mol. Cell.

Discovery of a novel shp2 protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor.Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). NSC 87877 markedly attenuated MEK(Ser217/Ser221) phosphorylation (82.8% ± 2.5% inhibition, n = 2) in vehicle- and FSH-treated GCs and, hence, similarly reduced FSH-stimulated ERK(Thr202/Tyr204) phosphorylation (Fig. 1C) (92.9% ± 5.5% inhibition, n = 5). GAB2(Ser159) phosphorylation served as a negative control that is independent of SHP2 signaling (30Hunzicker-Dunn M.E. Lopez-Biladeau B. Law N.C. Fiedler S.E. Carr D.W. Maizels E.T. PKA and GAB2 play central roles in the FSH signaling pathway to PI3K and AKT in ovarian granulosa cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: E2979-E2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); FSH-stimulated GAB2(Tyr452) dephosphorylation shows the selectivity of the SHP2 PTP activity. Taken together, these results show that the signaling pathway that promotes MEK(Ser217/Ser221) phosphorylation in GCs is tonically active in the absence of FSH and requires the EGFR, RAS, and SHP2. FSH-stimulated ERK(Thr202/Tyr204) phosphorylation is also recognized to be dependent on PKA (9Andric N. Ascoli M.

In the following experiment, we sought to confirm that, although the PKA inhibitor PKI, which functions as a PKA catalytic subunit pseudosubstrate (31Kemp B.E. Cheng H.C. Walsh D.A. Peptide inhibitors of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), blocks FSH-stimulated ERK(Thr202/Tyr204) phosphorylation, it does not affect MEK(Ser217/Ser221) phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2, although transduction of GCs with Ad-PKI blocked FSH-stimulated ERK(Thr202/Tyr204) phosphorylation (89.3% ± 10.3% inhibition, n = 4), MEK(Ser217/Ser221) phosphorylation was unaffected. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the effect of PKA must be downstream of MEK at the level of ERK phosphorylation. Active MEK should constitutively phosphorylate ERK; however, phosphorylated ERK is not detected in the absence of FSH. This result suggests that a phosphatase is actively dephosphorylating ERK in the absence of FSH. It then follows that FSH via PKA must inactivate the ERK phosphatase. In the following experiments, we determined whether the phosphatase that dephosphorylates ERK on Thr202 and/or Tyr204 in GCs is a Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (PP1 or PP2) or a Tyr phosphatase.

https://openalex.org/W2484102037,"Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have better responses to radiotherapy and higher overall survival rates than do patients with HPV-negative HNSCC, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unknown. p16 is used as a surrogate marker for HPV infection. Our goal was to examine the role of p16 in HPV-related favorable treatment outcomes and to investigate the mechanisms by which p16 may regulate radiosensitivity. HNSCC cells and xenografts (HPV/p16-positive and -negative) were used. p16-overexpressing and small hairpin RNA-knockdown cells were generated, and the effect of p16 on radiosensitivity was determined by clonogenic cell survival and tumor growth delay assays. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were assessed by immunofluorescence analysis of 53BP1 foci; DSB levels were determined by neutral comet assay; western blotting was used to evaluate protein changes; changes in protein half-life were tested with a cycloheximide assay; gene expression was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction; and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas HNSCC project were analyzed. p16 overexpression led to downregulation of TRIP12, which in turn led to increased RNF168 levels, repressed DNA damage repair (DDR), increased 53BP1 foci and enhanced radioresponsiveness. Inhibition of TRIP12 expression further led to radiosensitization, and overexpression of TRIP12 was associated with poor survival in patients with HPV-positive HNSCC. These findings reveal that p16 participates in radiosensitization through influencing DDR and support the rationale of blocking TRIP12 to improve radiotherapy outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2494112659,"Accumulating evidence indicates that fractionated radiotherapy (RT) can result in distant non-irradiated (abscopal) tumour regression. Although preclinical studies indicate the importance of T cells in this infrequent phenomenon, these studies do not preclude that other immune mechanisms exhibit an addition role in the abscopal effect. We therefore addressed the question whether in addition to T cell mediated responses also humoral anti-tumour responses are modulated after fractionated RT and whether systemic dendritic cell (DC) stimulation can enhance tumour-specific antibody production. We selected the 67NR mammary carcinoma model since this tumour showed spontaneous antibody production in all tumour-bearing mice. Fractionated RT to the primary tumour was associated with a survival benefit and a delayed growth of a non-irradiated (contralateral) secondary tumour. Notably, fractionated RT did not affect anti-tumour antibody titers and the composition of the immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes. Likewise, we demonstrated that treatment of tumour-bearing Balb/C mice with DC stimulating growth factor Flt3-L did neither modulate the magnitude nor the composition of the humoral immune response. Finally, we evaluated the immune infiltrate and Ig isotype content of the tumour tissue using flow cytometry and found no differences between treatment groups that were indicative for local antibody production. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the 67NR mammary carcinoma in Balb/C mice is associated with a pre-existing antibody response. And, we show that in tumour-bearing Balb/C mice with abscopal tumour regression such pre-existing antibody responses are not altered upon fractionated RT and/or DC stimulation with Flt3-L. Our research indicates that evaluating the humoral immune response in the setting of abscopal tumour regression is not invariably associated with therapeutic effects."

https://openalex.org/W2461961303,"Previous research has pointed towards a link between emotion dysregulation and aggressive behavior in children. Emotion regulation difficulties are not specific for children with persistent aggression problems, i.e. oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder (ODD/CD), children with other psychiatric conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, have emotion regulation difficulties too. On a behavioral level some overlap exists between these disorders and comorbidity is high. The aim of this study was therefore twofold: 1) to examine emotion regulation difficulties in 65 boys with ODD/CD in comparison to a non-clinical control group (NC) of 38 boys (8–12 years) using a performance measure (Ultimatum Game), parent report and self-report, and 2) to establish to what extent emotion regulation in the ODD/CD group was correlated with severity of autism and/or attention deficit traits. Results on the Ultimatum Game showed that the ODD/CD group rejected more ambiguous offers than the NC group, which is seen as an indication of poor emotion regulation. Parents also reported that the ODD/CD group experienced more emotion regulation problems in daily life than the NC group. In contrast to these cognitive and behavioral measures, self-reports did not reveal any difference, indicating that boys with ODD/CD do not perceive themselves as having impairments in regulating their emotions. Emotional decision making within the ODD/CD group was not related to variation in autism or attention deficit traits. These results support the idea that emotion dysregulation is an important problem within ODD/CD, yet boys with ODD/CD have reduced awareness of this."
https://openalex.org/W2483805602,"It is well established that heavy ethanol consumption interferes with the immune system and inflammatory processes, resulting in increased risk for infectious and chronic diseases. However, these processes have yet to be systematically studied in a dose and sex-dependent manner. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic heavy ethanol consumption on gene expression using RNA-seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from female rhesus macaques with daily consumption of 4% ethanol available 22hr/day for 12 months resulting in average ethanol consumption of 4.3 g/kg/day (considered heavy drinking). Differential gene expression analysis was performed using edgeR and gene enrichment analysis using MetaCore™. We identified 1106 differentially expressed genes, meeting the criterion of ≥ two-fold change and p-value ≤ 0.05 in expression (445 up- and 661 down-regulated). Pathway analysis of the 879 genes with characterized identifiers showed that the most enriched gene ontology processes were “response to wounding”, “blood coagulation”, “immune system process”, and “regulation of signaling”. Changes in gene expression were seen despite the lack of differences in the frequency of any major immune cell subtype between ethanol and controls, suggesting that heavy ethanol consumption modulates gene expression at the cellular level rather than altering the distribution of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Collectively, these observations provide mechanisms to explain the higher incidence of infection, delay in wound healing, and increase in cardiovascular disease seen in subjects with Alcohol use disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2472179141,"Kunitz-type (KT) protease inhibitors are low molecular weight proteins classically defined as serine protease inhibitors. We identified a novel secreted KT inhibitor associated with the gut and parenchymal tissues of the infective juvenile stage of Fasciola hepatica, a helminth parasite of medical and veterinary importance. Unexpectedly, recombinant KT inhibitor (rFhKT1) exhibited no inhibitory activity toward serine proteases but was a potent inhibitor of the major secreted cathepsin L cysteine proteases of F. hepatica, FhCL1 and FhCL2, and of human cathepsins L and K (Ki = 0.4-27 nm). FhKT1 prevented the auto-catalytic activation of FhCL1 and FhCL2 and formed stable complexes with the mature enzymes. Pulldown experiments from adult parasite culture medium showed that rFhKT1 interacts specifically with native secreted FhCL1, FhCL2, and FhCL5. Substitution of the unusual P1 Leu15 within the exposed reactive loop of FhKT1 for the more commonly found Arg (FhKT1Leu15/Arg15) had modest adverse effects on the cysteine protease inhibition but conferred potent activity against the serine protease trypsin (Ki = 1.5 nm). Computational docking and sequence analysis provided hypotheses for the exclusive binding of FhKT1 to cysteine proteases, the importance of the Leu15 in anchoring the inhibitor into the S2 active site pocket, and the inhibitor's selectivity toward FhCL1, FhCL2, and human cathepsins L and K. FhKT1 represents a novel evolutionary adaptation of KT protease inhibitors by F. hepatica, with its prime purpose likely in the regulation of the major parasite-secreted proteases and/or cathepsin L-like proteases of its host. Kunitz-type (KT) protease inhibitors are low molecular weight proteins classically defined as serine protease inhibitors. We identified a novel secreted KT inhibitor associated with the gut and parenchymal tissues of the infective juvenile stage of Fasciola hepatica, a helminth parasite of medical and veterinary importance. Unexpectedly, recombinant KT inhibitor (rFhKT1) exhibited no inhibitory activity toward serine proteases but was a potent inhibitor of the major secreted cathepsin L cysteine proteases of F. hepatica, FhCL1 and FhCL2, and of human cathepsins L and K (Ki = 0.4-27 nm). FhKT1 prevented the auto-catalytic activation of FhCL1 and FhCL2 and formed stable complexes with the mature enzymes. Pulldown experiments from adult parasite culture medium showed that rFhKT1 interacts specifically with native secreted FhCL1, FhCL2, and FhCL5. Substitution of the unusual P1 Leu15 within the exposed reactive loop of FhKT1 for the more commonly found Arg (FhKT1Leu15/Arg15) had modest adverse effects on the cysteine protease inhibition but conferred potent activity against the serine protease trypsin (Ki = 1.5 nm).

Fasciola hepatica is a zoonotic parasitic helminth common in temperate and sub-tropical regions of the world. The parasite is responsible for causing the disease fasciolosis in hundreds of millions of livestock, principally sheep and cattle. This results in reduced feed conversion, decreased dairy production, inferior meat quality and parasite-related mortality, thus costing the agricultural industry an estimated United States $3 billion annually (1Howell A.

F. hepatica is also estimated to infect up to 17 million people throughout the world, primarily in developing countries, with ∼180 million at risk of infection (3Molina-Hernández V. Mulcahy G.

The mammalian host becomes infected following ingestion of grass or other vegetation contaminated with F. hepatica cysts (metacercariae). The parasites then exocyst in the host duodenum and penetrate through the intestinal wall before migrating to the liver and bile ducts. To facilitate this journey, the parasite excretes and secretes an array of molecules that come into contact with host cells and tissues, the most abundant being proteases and protease inhibitors (5Robinson M.W.

They contain six cysteine residues that form three conserved disulfide bonds in a 1–6, 2–4, and 3–5 arrangement that maintains structural integrity of the inhibitor and allows presentation of a protease-binding loop at its surface (see Fig. 2) (11Ranasinghe S.

A highly exposed P1 active site residue at position 15, which inserts into the S1 site of the cognate protease, is located at the peak of the binding loop and is of prime importance in determining the specificity of serine protease inhibition (14Krowarsch D.

A KT inhibitor with trypsin inhibitory activity has previously been identified in soluble extracts of adult F. hepatica taken from the bile ducts of ruminants (33Bozas S.E. Panaccio M. Creaney J. Dosen M. Parsons J.C. Vlasuk G.V. Walker I.D. Spithill T.W. Characterisation of a novel Kunitz-type molecule from the trematode Fasciola hepatica.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but its function remains obscure as it exhibited no activity against the major coagulation enzymes and only low activity (Ki = 143 nm) against trypsin. Here, we report the discovery of a KT protease inhibitor (FhKT1) from the infective and tissue invasive stage of F. hepatica that exhibits no inhibitory activity against serine proteases but has potent activity against cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases. Substitution of the atypical P1 Leu15 that projects from the exposed reactive loop of the inhibitor with an Arg residue modestly reduces its cysteine protease inhibition profile but endows the protein with trypsin-inhibitory activity. Molecular modeling of the interaction of FhKT1 with the major secreted parasite cathepsin L cysteine proteases and human cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases indicated the importance of the P1 Leu15 in docking the inhibitor into the S2 active site of these enzymes and suggested key inhibitor-enzyme interactions that impart FhKT1 its unique inhibitory properties. Transcriptome analysis of the newly excysted juvenile stage showed that fhkt1 is expressed by the early F. hepatica stages that invade the host. Differential gene expression analysis during the first 24 h post-excystment shows that fhkt1 gene is up-regulated in NEJs 24 h post-excystment compared with NEJs 3 h post-excystment (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis using anti-FhKT1 antibodies revealed an ∼7-kDa band in medium in which NEJs were cultured for 24 h (Fig. 1B, lane 2), confirming that FhKT1 is secreted by this parasite the 1st day after excystment. Mass spectrometry analysis of NEJ-secreted products revealed that FhKT1 is released into medium by both 3- and 24-h post-excystment NEJs (Fig. 1C and supplemental file 1). To localize FhKT1 expression within the NEJ, confocal microscopy was carried out on 3- and 24-h post-excystment NEJs. These were probed with polyclonal anti-FhKT1 antibodies and counter-stained with TRITC-labeled phalloidin to provide NEJ structural visualization of muscle tissue under fluorescence microscopy. Little fluorescence was observed in NEJs 3 h post-excystment using anti-FhKT1 (Fig. 1D, panels ii and iii). By contrast, in NEJs 24 h post-excystment, bright fluorescence was observed in the parenchymal tissue and particularly concentrated in parenchymal cell bodies (white arrowheads) (Fig. 1D, panels v and vi). Diffuse staining was observed within the NEJ gut (black arrowheads) (Fig. 1D, panels v and vi). This increase in fluorescence in 24-h NEJs compared with 3-h NEJs is consistent with the up-regulated transcript and protein expression observed in 24-h NEJs (Fig. 1, A and C). No FITC fluorescence was observed in negative control NEJs (3 and 24 h post-excystment) probed with pre-immune sera (Fig. 1D, panels i and iv). Surrogate expression of the fhkt1 gene in the yeast Pichia pastoris allowed us to produce and purify a recombinant form of the inhibitor (rFhKT1, Fig. 2). Surprisingly, in our initial screens we found that the purified rFhKT1 did not exhibit any inhibition against a variety of standard serine proteases, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, thrombin, kallikrein, and human cathepsin G (Fig. 3A). This was not due to the recombinant protein being functionally inactive as we subsequently discovered that rFhKT1 was a potent inhibitor of two F. hepatica cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases, FhCL1 and FhCL2. In further screens, rFhKT1 was shown to inhibit human cathepsin L and cathepsin K (Fig. 3A). In these initial inhibition screens, rFhKT1 was tested at 300 nm, and the activity of FhCL1, FhCL2, and human cathepsins K and L was reduced by 98.86% (±0.205), 90.29% (±0.025), 99.54% (±0.08), and 96.79% (±0.09), respectively (Fig. 3A). Of further relevance was our observations that at a 300 nm final concentration rFhKT1 did not show any inhibition of F. hepatica cathepsin B1 (FhCB1) and B2 (FhCB2) or of human cathepsin B and cathepsin S (Table 1). In parallel assays, we showed that the activity of trypsin, chymotrypsin, neutrophil elastase, and cathepsin G was completely inhibited by 300 nm BPTI and that thrombin and kallikrein were completely inhibited by 0.002 units of hirudin (data not shown). Given that the concentration of FhKT1 inhibitor required for the inhibition of the cathepsin L and K cysteine proteases was found to be lower than the concentration of enzyme required to produce a reliable activity curve in fluorogenic assays, these were considered to be tight-binding inhibitors, and thus enzymatic data were fitted to the Morrison equation (Fig. 4). Resulting Kiapp values were fitted to Equation 2 mentioned above to determine Ki values. Kinetic inhibition constants determined at pH 5.5 for rFhKT1 against the two parasite proteases differed substantially; the Ki for FhCL1 was 0.4 (±0.1) nm and for FhCL2 was 10 (±0.3) nm. The inhibition constant was 1.6 (±0.1) nm for human cathepsin L and 5 (±0.3) nm for human cathepsin K (Table 1).TABLE 1rFhKT1 and rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15 inhibition specificity against a panel of biologically relevant serine and cysteine proteases and relative inhibition constantsEnzyme (concentration)rFhKT1rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15Enzyme (concentration)InhibitionKiInhibitionKiCysteine proteasesF. hepatica cathepsin L1 (2.7 nm)+0.4 nm (± 0.1 nm)+0.7 nm (± 0.04 nm)F. hepatica cathepsin L2 (5 nm)+10 nm (± 0.3 nm)+27 nm (± 1.5 nm)F. hepatica cathepsin B1 (180 nm)−Not inhibited−Not inhibitedF. hepatica cathepsin B2 (180 nm)−Not inhibited−Not inhibitedHuman cathepsin L (0.2 nm)+1.6 nm (± 0.1 nm)+3 nm (± 0.1 nm)Human cathepsin K (2 nm)+5 nm (± 0.3 nm)+10 nm (± 0.2 nm)Human cathepsin S (2 nm)−Not inhibited−Not inhibitedHuman cathepsin B (3.6 nm)−Not inhibited−Not inhibitedSerine proteasesTrypsin (42 nm)−Not inhibited+1.5 nm (± 0.7 nm)Chymotrypsin (40 nm)−Not inhibited−Not inhibitedNeutrophil elastase (50 nm)−Not inhibited−Not inhibitedCathepsin G (100 nm)−Not inhibited−Not inhibitedThrombin (43 pm)−Not inhibited−Not inhibitedKallikrein (150 nm)−Not inhibited−Not inhibited Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4Plot of F. hepatica cathepsin L1 proteolytic activity with the substrate Z-Leu-Arg-NHMec, as a function of inhibitor concentration for rFhKT1 (solid circles) and rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15 (clear circles).

This variant form, termed rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15, retained its ability to inhibit F. hepatica FhCL1 and FhCL2 and human cathepsin L and K, but as with the wild-type rFhKT1, it did not inhibit FhCB1 and FhCB2 and human cathepsin B and S (Table 1). However, several key observations were made, including the following: (a) rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15 was less inhibitory than rFhKT1 with Ki 2–3-fold higher against the parasite and mammalian cysteine proteases (Table 1); (b) although the inhibition of FhCL1 and FhCL2 by both rFhKT1 and rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15 was effective over a broad pH range of 4.5–8.0 and optimal at neutral pH, the variant inhibitor was less effective in the lower pH range (Fig. 3, B and C); (c) in contrast to rFhKT1, the variant rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15 possessed potent inhibitory activity against the serine protease trypsin, with trypsin activity reduced by 88.92% (±0.89) in assays performed at 300 nm inhibitor (Fig. 3A). rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15 exhibited a Ki of 1.5 nm (±0.7 nm) against trypsin (Table 1), which demonstrates that the substitution of Leu to Arg is sufficient to endow this inhibitor with the ability to bind within the active site of this serine protease. However, it is noteworthy that this inhibitory constant is still 10 times higher than that recorded for BPTI (0.15 nm), and even at 300 nm, rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15 did not show any inhibition toward the other serine proteases tested, including chymotrypsin, elastase, thrombin, kallikrein, and human cathepsin G (Fig. 3A). The parasite cysteine proteases FhCL1 and FhCL2 are produced as inactive 37-kDa zymogens (Fig. 5, lane 1) that can be auto-catalytically activated in vitro at pH 4.5 (34Lowther J. Robinson M.W. Donnelly S.M. Xu W. Stack C.M. Matthews J.M. Dalton J.P. The importance of pH in regulating the function of the Fasciola hepatica cathepsin L1 cysteine protease.PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2009; 3: e369Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine whether rFhKT1 and rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15 could regulate the activation of the parasite proteases, these inhibitors were mixed with zymogens of FhCL1 and FhCL2 at pH 4.5, and the activation was monitored by LDS-PAGE. After 45 min of incubation at 37 °C in citrate phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, FhCL1 auto-activates to give rise to an ∼25-kDa mature active form and a released 6-kDa propeptide (Fig. 5, lane 2). Incubation of FhCL1 with rFhKT1 or rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15 prevented the appearance of both of these bands indicating that auto-catalytic cleavage was prevented (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4). Similar results were observed for FhCL2 (data not shown). For comparison, we showed that co-incubation of FhCL1 with the KT inhibitor BPTI did not prevent auto-catalytic activation of the zymogen (Fig. 5, lane 5). To examine the stability of inactivation of FhCL1 by rFhKT1 over time, FhCL1 was first auto-catalytically activated at pH 4.5 and then incubated with rFhKT1 for 6 h at 37 °C in citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, in the presence of substrate; the reaction was monitored by the release of the fluorophore (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin), and samples of the reactions were analyzed by LDS-PAGE (Fig. 6). rFhKT1 completely inactivated the FhCL1, and this inactivation was stable for the entire 6 h (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, the rFhKT1 remained intact over this time and was observed as a band at ∼6 kDa. However, a minor band at ∼5 kDa was observed at the 2- and 6-h time points (Fig. 6B). This band was not immunoreactive with anti-His tag monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 6D), but it was reactive with anti-rFhKT1 polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 6C), showing that this protein results from proteolytic clipping at the C terminus of rFhKT1 by FhCL1. A similar cleavage pattern was observed with rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15 and also when FhCL2 was used in the reactions (data not shown). Inhibition assays that were extended for up to 7 days showed that FhCL1 activity remained inhibited by rFhKT1 over this prolonged period. However, the activity of mature FhCL1 (in the absence of inhibitor) depleted by >99% over the course of the experiment, with activity reduced from 21,271.27 (± 961.52) RfU/min at 0 days to 65.73 (± 14.49) RfU/min at day 7 (data not shown). Reduction and alkylation of both rFhKT1 and rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15 were performed to break internal disulfide bridges and to disrupt the tertiary structure of the protein. This procedure depleted the inhibitory activity of both inhibitors against FhCL1 (Fig. 7A). Similarly, this treatment ablated the inhibitory activity of rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15 against trypsin (Fig. 7B). Interestingly, we discovered that both rFhKT1 and rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15 could partially re-nature to their functional form during a 10-day incubation period at 4 °C; over this time, the inhibitors regained between 60 and 80% of their inhibitory activity (Fig. 7A). Likewise, rFhKT1Leu15/Arg15 regained inhibitory activity against trypsin (Fig. 7B). Adult F. hepatica parasites secrete several cysteine proteases, both in vivo and in vitro. To demonstrate that FhKT1 can bind and inhibit native parasite proteases, the inhibitors were mixed with culture medium in which adult F. hepatica parasites had been maintained (F. hepatica excretory-secretory proteins), and activity was monitor"
https://openalex.org/W2461304515,"Neurons in the cerebral cortex respond inconsistently to a repeated sensory stimulus, yet they underlie our stable sensory experiences. Although the nature of this variability is unknown, its ubiquity has encouraged the general view that each cell produces random spike patterns that noisily represent its response rate. In contrast, here we show that reversibly inactivating distant sources of either bottom-up or top-down input to cortical visual areas in the alert primate reduces both the spike train irregularity and the trial-to-trial variability of single neurons. A simple model in which a fraction of the pre-synaptic input is silenced can reproduce this reduction in variability, provided that there exist temporal correlations primarily within, but not between, excitatory and inhibitory input pools. A large component of the variability of cortical neurons may therefore arise from synchronous input produced by signals arriving from multiple sources."

However, it remains unclear how SSRIs, which inhibit the plasma membrane serotonin transporter (SERT), modulate hemostasis. Here, we examine how sustained inhibition of SERT activity alters serotonergic signaling and influences platelet activation and hemostasis. Pharmaceutical blockade (citalopram dosing) or genetic ablation (SERT−/−) of SERT function in vivo led to reduced serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) blood levels that paralleled a mild bleeding phenotype in mice. Transfusion of wild-type platelets to SERT−/− mice normalized bleeding times to wild-type levels, suggesting that loss of SERTs causes a deficiency in platelet activation. Although SERT−/− platelets displayed no difference in P-selectin or αIIbβ3 activation upon stimulation with thrombin, ADP-mediated αIIbβ3 activation is reduced in SERT−/− platelets. Additionally, synergistic potentiation of αIIbβ3 activation by ADP and 5-HT is lost in SERT−/− platelets. Acute treatment of wild-type platelets with 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) antagonists or SSRIs revealed that functional 5-HT2ARs, not SERTs, are necessary for the synergistic activation of αIIbβ3 by dual 5-HT/ADP stimulation. Pharmacological studies using radiolabeled guanosine 5′-3-O-([35S]thio)triphosphate and [3H]ketanserin revealed that platelets isolated from SERT−/− or citalopram-treated mice have reduced activation of G-proteins coupled to 5-HT2ARs and receptor surface expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that sustained SERT loss of function reduces 5-HT2AR surface expression that is critical for the synergistic activation of αIIbβ3 by 5-HT and ADP.

Here, we have characterized a similar effect in two distinct mouse models of lost SERT function, suggesting that sustained loss of SERT function influences hemostasis.

Effects of serotonin on platelet activation in whole blood.Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 8: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Subthreshold concentrations of two different platelet agonists can exert a synergistic effect on platelet activation. One example includes dual ADP and 5-HT activation leading to increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] (13Thompson N.T. Scrutton M.C. Wallis R.B. Synergistic responses in human platelets. Comparison between aggregation, secretion and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration.Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the role of 5-HT during in vivo hemostasis remains unclear, particularly in the context of chronic SERT inhibition. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of SSRI effects on platelet aggregation, a better understanding of acute versus chronic inhibition of SERT function during platelet activation is required. Acute and chronic blockage of SERT function results in distinct scenarios regarding the effects on 5-HT homeostasis. Acute inhibition of SERT blocks the amount of 5-HT carried into the cytosol during platelet activation, whereas chronic blockage of SERT slowly depletes granule 5-HT, resulting in loss of 5-HT secretion and 5-HT signaling during platelet activation. Some have shown that acute SERT-mediated 5-HT uptake modulates platelet function (20Walther D.J. Peter J.-U. Winter S. Höltje M. Paulmann N. Grohmann M. Vowinckel J. Alamo-Bethencourt V. Wilhelm C.S.

However, the effects of chronic loss of SERT function on platelet activation remain unresolved. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which chronic inhibition of SERT alters hemostatic function using two independent models (SERT−/− and 6-day citalopram treatment). We hypothesized that the bleeding effects noted with the disruption of SERT function are due to altered 5-HT2AR signaling during platelet activation. Indeed, we found that mice lacking SERT function display a bleeding phenotype that can be rescued by the addition of wild-type platelets. Furthermore, we found that ADP-mediated αIIbβ3 activation was reduced in SERT−/− and citalopram-treated platelets due to loss of 5-HT2AR signaling and surface expression. To determine whether SSRIs alter blood 5-HT homeostasis, mice were exposed to citalopram-treated water for 6 days, 1 day beyond the lifetime of a circulating platelet in a mouse (22Malyszko J. Urano T. Knofler R. Taminato A. Yoshimi T. Takada Y. Takada A. Daily variations of platelet aggregation in relation to blood and plasma serotonin in diabetes.Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 569-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We used high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to measure whole blood levels of 5-HT and its major metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Whole blood from wild-type mice undergoing citalopram (Cit) treatment showed reduced 5-HT levels as compared with water-treated controls (Fig. 1A). No significant difference in 5-HIAA levels was found between water- and Cit-treated samples (Fig. 1B). To determine whether citalopram treatment alters hemostasis, we performed a tail bleed assay. We found that citalopram-treated mice exhibited a significantly longer tail bleed time as compared with water-treated controls (Fig. 1C). These findings indicate a phenotypic association between reduced 5-HT levels and increased bleeding time in mice treated with SSRIs. We observed very little measurable 5-HT in SERT−/− platelets (Fig. 1D). Similar to whole blood samples isolated from citalopram-treated mice, there was no significant difference in 5-HIAA between SERT+/+ and SERT−/− mice (Fig. 1E). We found that bleeding time was significantly increased in SERT−/− mice as compared with SERT+/+ (Fig. 1F). These data show that SERT function modulates whole blood 5-HT levels and that SERT inhibition is associated with increased bleeding time. As 5-HT potentiates platelet activation and previous studies have shown that SERT function alters platelet aggregation (5Carneiro A.M. Cook E.H. Murphy D.L. Blakely R.D. Interactions between integrin αIIbβ3 and the serotonin transporter regulate serotonin transport and platelet aggregation in mice and humans.J. Clin. Investig. 2008; 118: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the SERT−/− bleeding phenotype resulted from platelet functional defects. We first measured the number of platelets in SERT−/− and SERT+/+ whole blood samples. No significant difference in the number of platelets was observed between genotypes (Fig. 2A). To determine whether addition of SERT+/+ platelets rescued the SERT−/− bleeding phenotype, mice were transfused with gel-filtered platelets resuspended in saline via jugular vein injection. A tail bleed was performed 3 min after transfusion of SERT+/+ platelets to SERT+/+ and SERT−/− mice (Fig. 2B). In control experiments, saline-transfused SERT−/− mice showed a significantly longer tail bleed time as compared with SERT+/+ mice. We found that addition of gel-purified platelets (2 × 107 in 200 μl of saline) to SERT+/+ mice did not significantly alter tail bleed time. The difference in SERT+/+ and SERT−/− bleeding time was abolished following platelet transfusion, indicating that hemostasis was rescued in SERT−/− mice. These findings support the conclusion that the bleeding phenotype of the SERT−/− mice results from a defect in platelet function. Gel-filtered platelets from SERT+/+ and SERT−/− mice exposed to 10 and 200 nm thrombin had similar αIIbβ3 activation as measured by JON/A binding (Fig. 3A). Following thrombin stimulation, there were no significant differences between the SERT−/− and SERT+/+ platelet P-selectin expression (CD62p binding) following post-test analysis (Fig. 3B). These findings reveal that platelet activation with thrombin is not altered in SERT−/− platelets. We next tested ADP platelet activation in SERT−/− platelets. We found that 10 μm, but not 1 μm, ADP-mediated αIIbβ3 activation is significantly reduced in the SERT−/− platelets (Fig. 3C). No difference in P-selectin expression was observed in SERT−/− or SERT+/+ platelets (Fig. 3D). These data demonstrate that loss of SERT function leads to a deficiency in the ADP-mediated inside-out signaling that triggers activation of αIIbβ3. To examine the role of 5-HT in ADP-mediated platelet activation, we distinguished the role of two plasma membrane proteins that are responsive to 5-HT in platelets: SERT and the 5-HT2AR. We performed a dose-response curve with citalopram and paroxetine, two structurally distinct SSRIs, and found that they block intact 5-[3H]HT platelet uptake with an IC50 of 1.5 × 10−11 and 1.3 × 10−11, respectively (Fig. 4A). Platelet activation with 1 and 10 μm ADP was examined with the addition of either 5-HT2AR antagonists (ketanserin and methysergide) or SERT inhibitors (citalopram and paroxetine) 5 min before ADP activation. Both ketanserin and methysergide treatment significantly reduced ADP-mediated activation at 1 μm (Fig. 4B). Acute inhibition of 5-HT uptake by SERT with citalopram (10 nm) or paroxetine (10 nm) had no effect on ADP-mediated αIIbβ3 activation despite effectively blocking SERT-mediated 5-HT uptake. These data reveal a role for 5-HT2AR activation, but not 5-HT uptake, in ADP-mediated αIIbβ3 inside-out activation. To explore the role of 5-HT2AR signaling in the context of the SERT−/− model, we examined JON/A binding to activated αIIbβ3 in the context of simultaneous 5-HT and ADP receptor stimulation. 5-HT alone was unable to elicit activation of the αIIbβ3 integrin at either 1 or 10 μm concentration in either SERT+/+ or SERT−/− platelets (Fig. 4C). However, using a submaximal concentration of ADP (1 μm), we observed that 10 μm 5-HT potentiated the ADP-mediated activation of αIIbβ3 in SERT+/+ platelets. 5-HT was unable to potentiate ADP-mediated platelet activation in SERT−/− platelets (Fig. 4D). In a separate experiment, we found that incubation with ketanserin prevented the 5-HT-dependent potentiation of αIIbβ3 activation in SERT+/+ platelets (Fig. 4E). These results demonstrate that submaximal stimulation of ADP receptors is potentiated by co-stimulation of 5-HT2AR, which synergizes to mediate αIIbβ3 inside-out activation. Additionally, these data indicate a defect in 5-HT2AR signaling within SERT−/− platelets. We first explored whether the loss of ADP-mediated αIIbβ3 activation was due to a deficit in ADP-dependent signaling. We examined ADP receptor (P2Y1 and P2Y12) expression levels via [3H]ADP binding that was competitively blocked with ADP receptor-specific antagonists. This assay was optimized in SERT+/+ platelet membrane preparations and shown as percentage of total [3H]ADP binding blocked in the presence of 2,2′-pyridylisatogen tosylate, a P2Y antagonist (Fig. 5A). Competitive inhibition with MRS2179 (P2Y1-specific antagonist) and ticagrelor (P2Y12-specific antagonist) was used to determine relative receptor binding in SERT+/+ and SERT−/− platelet membrane preparations (Fig. 5, C and D). P2Y1 accounted for ∼46.42% of [3H]ADP binding, whereas P2Y12 accounted for ∼55.89% of total [3H]ADP binding. Inhibition at 1 μm for both MRS2179 and ticagrelor was used to determine percentage of [3H]ADP binding to P2Y1 in platelet membranes. We found no statistically significant difference in either P2Y12 or P2Y1 binding between SERT+/+ and SERT−/− membrane preparations. Additionally, we measured whole blood ADP levels using an ELISA and observed no difference between SERT+/+ and SERT−/− preparations (Fig. 5E). These data demonstrate that the ADP whole blood levels and receptor numbers are not different in SERT−/− platelets. Based on our findings, the 5-HT2AR plays an important role in ADP-mediated αIIbβ3 activation, and this effect is reduced in SERT−/− platelets. Therefore, we purified platelet membranes and measured [35S]GTPγS incorporation to 5-HT2AR following activation with 1-[2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl]-2-aminopropane (DOI), a 5-HT2AR-specific agonist. We observed a significant reduction in [35S]GTPγS incorporation to SERT−/− membrane preparations as compared with SERT+/+ (Fig. 5F; n = 8; p = 0.0002, Mann-Whitney test). To determine whether this reduction in G-protein activation was caused by reduced 5-HT2AR surface expression, we used radiolabeled [3H]ketanserin to measure surface levels of the 5-HT2AR on intact platelets. A saturation curve was performed to examine the number of surface receptors (Bmax) of 5-HT2AR (Fig. 5G). SERT−/− platelets showed significantly reduced Bmax for 5-HT2AR surface levels as compared with those observed in SERT+/+ platelets (Fig. 5H). There was no significant difference in Kd between SERT+/+ and SERT−/− [3H]ketanserin binding (SERT+/+ median, 7.32 nm; SERT−/− median, 6.71 nm; p = 0.134, Mann-Whitney test). These results show reduced 5-HT2AR signaling in SERT−/− platelets, likely resulting from reduced 5-HT2AR surface expression. To determine whether we could recapitulate the loss of 5-HT2AR surface expression using an alternative model of lost SERT function, we treated mice chronically with citalopram for 6 days. Similar to SERT−/− platelets, citalopram-treated platelets showed reduced ADP-dependent αIIbβ3 activation compared with water-treated controls (Fig. 6A). In control water-treated mouse platelets, αIIbβ3 activation by ADP was enhanced by 5-HT, whereas 5-HT potentiation of ADP signaling was absent in citalopram-treated mouse platelets (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, 5-HT2AR levels were reduced in platelets isolated from citalopram-treated mice (Fig. 6C). These findings establish that 6-day treatment with SSRI is sufficient to reduce platelet expression of 5-HT2AR and decrease the capacity of platelets to be synergistically activated by ADP and 5-HT. Additionally, these findings demonstrate that the loss of 5-HT2AR surface expression and platelet function in SERT−/− mice is not due to loss of the SERT protein but rather results from sustained loss of SERT function. Finally, to test whether premature exposure to 5-HT could alter ADP-mediated αIIbβ3 activation, wild-type platelets were incubated with serotonin (10 μm) for 15 min, washed, and resuspended. They were then activated with 10 μm ADP, and JON/A binding was measured (Fig. 6D). We found that platelets pretreated with 5-HT for 15 min lost ADP-mediated αIIbβ3 activation similarly to both SERT−/− and citalopram-treated platelets. These results suggest that the preactivation or possible desensitization of the 5-HT2AR reduces platelet ADP-mediated αIIbβ3 activation. Our research has demonstrated how loss of SERT function leads to platelet dysfunction, providing mechanistic insight into the increased bleeding times previously observed in patients taking SSRIs (4Bismuth-Evenzal Y. Gonopolsky Y. Gurwitz D. Iancu I. Weizman A. Rehavi M. Decreased serotonin content and reduced agonist-induced aggregation in platelets of patients chronically medicated with SSRI drugs.J. Affect.

Serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants and abnormal bleeding: a review for clinicians and a reconsideration of mechanisms.J. Clin. Psychiatry. 2010; 71: 1565-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We characterized a bleeding phenotype in two independent models of lost SERT function, genetic and pharmacologic. This effect was rescued by addition of purified platelets with intact SERT function, indicating that the actions of SSRIs are mediated primarily via alteration of platelet function. Sustained loss of SERT function reduces 5-HT2AR surface expression, leading to reduced ADP-mediated αIIbβ3 activation. Therefore, our findings support a novel mechanism for the reduced aggregation in SSRI-treated patients: reduced 5-HT2AR surface expression and defective ADP-mediated αIIbβ3 activation. There are three possibilities by which SSRIs may mediate their effects on platelets: 1) acute blockage of SERT function and 5-HT uptake, 2) depletion of granule 5-HT and loss of 5-HT secretion during activation, and 3) increased extracellular 5-HT levels. Many studies concluding that acute uptake of 5-HT contributes to platelet function used SSRIs as tool compounds to acutely inhibit 5-HT uptake. However, these studies utilized SSRIs at high concentrations (>10 μm) that are known to exert off-target effects (e.g. the σ1 receptor) (11Tseng Y.-L. Chiang M.-L. Huang T.-F. Su K.-P. Lane H.-Y.

Ther. 2009; 124: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Comparatively, our study uses concentrations of SSRIs that block platelet-mediated SERT uptake but are far below the reported concentrations resulting in off-target effects (10 nm; Fig. 4). Here, we observed no change in ADP-mediated αIIbβ3 activation following acute SSRI treatment, suggesting that acute 5-HT uptake is not required for inside-out activation of αIIbβ3 by weak agonists. However, we observed reduced ADP-mediated αIIbβ3 activation following chronic SSRI treatment. Others have suggested that acute uptake of 5-HT by SERT leads to a receptor-independent signaling pathway via the post-translational modification of intracellular proteins (20Walther D.J. Peter J.-U. Winter S. Höltje M. Paulmann N. Grohmann M. Vowinckel J. Alamo-Bethencourt V. Wilhelm C.S. Ahnert-Hilger G. Bader M.

In our experiments, we demonstrated no difference in P-selectin antibody as a measure for α-granule exocytosis in SERT−/− platelet following thrombin activation (Fig. 3B). These data would suggest that α-granule exocytosis is intact following the chronic loss of SERT function. Instead, we observed that chronic loss of SERT function led to reduced 5-HT2AR signaling and reduced ADP-mediated αIIbβ3 activation"
https://openalex.org/W2464107291,"Computational modeling of drug binding to proteins is an integral component of direct drug design. Particularly, structure-based virtual screening is often used to perform large-scale modeling of putative associations between small organic molecules and their pharmacologically relevant protein targets. Because of a large number of drug candidates to be evaluated, an accurate and fast docking engine is a critical element of virtual screening. Consequently, highly optimized docking codes are of paramount importance for the effectiveness of virtual screening methods. In this communication, we describe the implementation, tuning and performance characteristics of GeauxDock, a recently developed molecular docking program. GeauxDock is built upon the Monte Carlo algorithm and features a novel scoring function combining physics-based energy terms with statistical and knowledge-based potentials. Developed specifically for heterogeneous computing platforms, the current version of GeauxDock can be deployed on modern, multi-core Central Processing Units (CPUs) as well as massively parallel accelerators, Intel Xeon Phi and NVIDIA Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). First, we carried out a thorough performance tuning of the high-level framework and the docking kernel to produce a fast serial code, which was then ported to shared-memory multi-core CPUs yielding a near-ideal scaling. Further, using Xeon Phi gives 1.9× performance improvement over a dual 10-core Xeon CPU, whereas the best GPU accelerator, GeForce GTX 980, achieves a speedup as high as 3.5×. On that account, GeauxDock can take advantage of modern heterogeneous architectures to considerably accelerate structure-based virtual screening applications. GeauxDock is open-sourced and publicly available at www.brylinski.org/geauxdock and https://figshare.com/articles/geauxdock_tar_gz/3205249."
https://openalex.org/W2488427435,"The comb, as a secondary sexual character, is an important trait in chicken. Indicators of comb length (CL), comb height (CH), and comb weight (CW) are often selected in production. DNA-based marker-assisted selection could help chicken breeders to accelerate genetic improvement for comb or related economic characters by early selection. Although a number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes have been identified with advances in molecular genetics, candidate genes underlying comb traits are limited. The aim of the study was to use genome-wide association (GWA) studies by 600 K Affymetrix chicken SNP arrays to detect genes that are related to comb, using an F2 resource population. For all comb characters, comb exhibited high SNP-based heritability estimates (0.61-0.69). Chromosome 1 explained 20.80% genetic variance, while chromosome 4 explained 6.89%. Independent univariate genome-wide screens for each character identified 127, 197, and 268 novel significant SNPs with CL, CH, and CW, respectively. Three candidate genes, VPS36, AR, and WNT11B, were determined to have a plausible function in all comb characters. These genes are important to the initiation of follicle development, gonadal growth, and dermal development, respectively. The current study provides the first GWA analysis for comb traits. Identification of the genetic basis as well as promising candidate genes will help us understand the underlying genetic architecture of comb development and has practical significance in breeding programs for the selection of comb as an index for sexual maturity or reproduction."

This study examined the rate of celiac disease autoimmunity amongst patients with T1D and AITD in the Chinese population. The study included 178 patients with type 1 diabetes and 119 with AITD where 36 had both T1D and AITD, classified as autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 variant (APS3v). The study also included 145 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), 97 patients with non-autoimmune thyroid disease (NAITD), and 102 healthy controls. Serum islet autoantibodies, thyroid autoantibodies and TGA were measured by radioimmunoassay. TGA positivity was found in 22% of patients with either type 1 diabetes or AITD, much higher than that in patients with T2D (3.4%; p< 0.0001) or NAITD (3.1%; P < 0.0001) or healthy controls (1%; p<0.0001). The patients with APS3v having both T1D and AITD were 36% positive for TGA, significantly higher than patients with T1D alone (p = 0.040) or with AITD alone (p = 0.017). T1D and AITD were found to have a 20% and 30% frequency of overlap respectively at diagnosis. In conclusion, TGA positivity was high in the Chinese population having existing T1D and/or AITD, and even higher when both diseases were present. Routine TGA screening in patients with T1D or AITD will be important to early identify celiac disease autoimmunity for better clinical care of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2468868844,"Glycolysis is the primary step for major energy production in the cell. There is strong evidence suggesting that glucose consumption and rate of glycolysis are highly modulated by cytosolic pH/[H(+)], but those can also be stimulated by an increase in the intracellular [HCO3 (-)]. Because proton and bicarbonate shift concomitantly, it remained unclear whether enhanced glucose consumption and glycolytic rate were mediated by the changes in intracellular [H(+)] or [HCO3 (-)]. We have asked whether glucose metabolism is enhanced by either a fall in intracellular [H(+)] or a rise in intracellular [HCO3 (-)], or by both, in mammalian astrocytes. We have recorded intracellular glucose in mouse astrocytes using a FRET-based nanosensor, while imposing different intracellular [H(+)] and [CO2]/[HCO3 (-)]. Glucose consumption and glycolytic rate were augmented by a fall in intracellular [H(+)], irrespective of a concomitant rise or fall in intracellular [HCO3 (-)]. Transport of HCO3 (-) into and out of astrocytes by the electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBCe1) played a crucial role in causing changes in intracellular pH and [HCO3 (-)], but was not obligatory for the pH-dependent changes in glucose metabolism. Our results clearly show that it is the cytosolic pH that modulates glucose metabolism in cortical astrocytes, and possibly also in other cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2467857317,"Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) were extirpated from most of the continental United States by widespread use of the pesticide DDT in the 1960s. Populations have rebounded with banning of the pesticide and successful implementation of captive breeding and hacking programs. An essentially new population of Midwestern peregrines now exists that is comprised almost entirely of urban-nesting birds. The new population is considered to be of mixed ancestry, occurs at relatively high densities, and has nest sites in close proximity, factors that could influence breeding behaviors including mate fidelity, nest-site fidelity, extra-pair paternity, and natal dispersal. We investigated these behaviors using a combination of field observations and DNA microsatellite genotyping. Data for eleven microsatellite DNA markers, including eight newly developed for the species, were analyzed from a total of 350 birds from nine Midwestern cities, representing 149 broods collected at 20 nest sites. To document breeding behavior, parentage was inferred by likelihood techniques when both parents were sampled and by parental genotype reconstruction when only one parent was sampled. In cases where neither parent was sampled, a sibship reconstruction approach was used. We found high mate fidelity and nest-site fidelity in urban peregrines; in 122 nesting attempts made by long-term breeders, only 12 (9.8%) mate changes and six (4.9%) nest-site changes occurred. Only one brood (of 35 tested) revealed extra-pair paternity and involved a male tending two offspring of a recently acquired mate. Natal dispersal patterns indicated that female peregrines dispersed on average 226 km, almost twice the distance of males (average 124 km). Despite the novel environment of cities, our results suggest that monogamous breeding, nest fidelity, and female natal dispersal are high in urban peregrines, not unlike other raptors living in non-urban habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2484404423,"Although simple social structures are more common in animal societies, some taxa (mainly mammals) have complex, multi-level social systems, in which the levels reflect differential association. We develop a simulation model to explore the conditions under which multi-level social systems of this kind evolve. Our model focuses on the evolutionary trade-offs between foraging and social interaction, and explores the impact of alternative strategies for distributing social interaction, with fitness criteria for wellbeing, alliance formation, risk, stress and access to food resources that reward social strategies differentially. The results suggest that multi-level social structures characterised by a few strong relationships, more medium ties and large numbers of weak ties emerge only in a small part of the overall fitness landscape, namely where there are significant fitness benefits from wellbeing and alliance formation and there are high levels of social interaction. In contrast, 'favour-the-few' strategies are more competitive under a wide range of fitness conditions, including those producing homogeneous, single-level societies of the kind found in many birds and mammals. The simulations suggest that the development of complex, multi-level social structures of the kind found in many primates (including humans) depends on a capacity for high investment in social time, preferential social interaction strategies, high mortality risk and/or differential reproduction. These conditions are characteristic of only a few mammalian taxa."

However, a direct translation of knowledge between humans and mice is not possible, due to the fact that there are many species-associated differences in both agonist and antagonist recognition profiles by the receptors. This is clearly illustrated by the fact that fMLF, the potent prototype FPR1 agonist, is a very weak agonist for Fpr1 (14He R. Tan L. Browning D.D. Wang J.M. Ye R.D.

To our knowledge, the short formyl peptides formyl-MIVIL and formyl-MIFL from Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively, are the most potent Fpr1 agonists currently identified (16Southgate E.L.

By contrast, several FPR2-selective ligands have successfully been described and characterized. Potent and stable modulators targeting both human and mouse receptors (especially FPR2 and Fpr2) thus remain to be identified. Such compounds would facilitate Fpr-based studies in mouse models of disease, important for understanding the precise roles of FPRs in health and disease, and for the validation of potential drug lead candidates. A major obstacle for therapeutic use of peptides is their inherent susceptibility to degradation by endogenous proteases, resulting in low bioavailability. Thus, investigation of proteolytically stable peptidomimetics, partly composed of unnatural residues, appears advantageous. Stable peptidomimetics belonging to the class of α-peptide/β-peptoid hybrids, displaying a design with alternating cationic α-amino acids and lipophilic peptoid residues, have been shown to imitate the biological effects of natural antimicrobial peptides (e.g. antimicrobial activity, antibiofilm activity, and immunomodulatory activity) (17Jahnsen R.D.

This finding was not further explored, but we now show that the peptidomimetic F2M2 (i.e. Lau-((S)-Aoc)-(Lys-βNphe)6-NH2) in fact activates human neutrophils to produce/release superoxide anions (Fig. 3). The activity induced was concentration-dependent, with an EC50 of ∼150 nm with a maximal response reached at a concentration of ∼500 nm (Fig. 3B). Dose response of the FPR2-specific peptide agonist WKYMVM was included for comparison (Fig. 3C). The onset and overall kinetics of the F2M2-induced response, reaching the peak in <1 min and subsiding in <5 min (Fig. 3A), resembles that induced by other typical GPCR agonists. Based on the structural similarity to the earlier described FPR2 antagonist, F2M2 appeared to represent a novel FPR agonist. To establish the involvement of FPRs in the neutrophil-activating effect of F2M2, two different approaches were used: (i) reciprocal receptor desensitization induced by receptor-specific agonists, and (ii) inhibitory effects of receptor-specific antagonists. Reciprocal receptor desensitization is a process by which a receptor upon stimulation with a specific agonist becomes non-responsive (desensitized) to a second dose, not only of the same agonist but also of other agonists that bind to the receptor involved. Neutrophils triggered by F2M2 were desensitized, not only to a new dose of F2M2 but also to the FPR2-specific peptide agonists PSMα2 and WKYMVM (shown for WKYMVM in Fig. 4A). In contrast, F2M2-stimulated human neutrophils were fully responsive or even primed in response to FPR1 agonists (data not shown). The desensitization effect was reciprocal (i.e. independent of the order in which the agonists were applied) (Fig. 4A). These data suggest that F2M2 activates neutrophils selectively through FPR2 without interference by FPR1. The receptor preference of F2M2 was investigated also through the use of well-characterized selective FPR antagonists. The two FPR2-specific inhibitors PBP10 and F2M1 (22Skovbakke S.L. Heegaard P.M.

In contrast, no inhibitory effect was obtained with the FPR1-specific antagonist CsH (27Stenfeldt A.L. Karlsson J. Wennerås C. Bylund J. Fu H. Dahlgren C. Cyclosporin H, Boc-MLF and Boc-FLFLF are antagonists that preferentially inhibit activity triggered through the formyl peptide receptor.Inflammation. 2007; 30: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that F2M2 is a novel FPR2 agonist that triggers an activation of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase in human cells. Unequivocal confirmation of the inferred FPR2 specificity of F2M2 was obtained in studies of its ability to activate non-differentiated HL60 cells stably expressing FPR2, measured as an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. F2M2 proved capable of evoking an intracellular Ca2+ response in FPR2-expressing cells, with a maximal response at 250 nm and with an EC50 value of 50–100 nm (Fig. 5A). No response was induced in FPR1-overexpressing HL60 cells (that readily responded to the FPR1-specific agonist fMLF; Fig. 5B). To gain a deeper insight into the structure-function relationship for FPR2 activation by F2M2, we designed and synthesized an array of variants (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Different structural features were varied independently: (i) the length of the N-terminal fatty acid (i.e. F2M3–F2M6); (ii) the length of the linear alkyl side chain in the hydrophobic amino acid (i.e. F2M7–F2M9); (iii) the stereochemistry of the 2-aminooctanoic acid (Aoc) (i.e. F2M10); (iv) the backbone (α-peptide analogue F2M11); and (v) the hydrophobicity of the repetitive peptidomimetic part (i.e. F2M12–F2M14). The neutrophil-activating effects of the structural variants were investigated by their ability to trigger the production of superoxide anions, whereas their preference for FPR2 was evaluated in FPR1- and FPR2-overexpressing HL60 cells.TABLE 1Structure-activity relationships of lipidated peptidomimetics for stimulation of human FPR2Ca2+ response in HL60 cells overexpressingCompoundaAs indicated in Fig. 1.StructureNADPH-oxidase response EC50 valuebEC50 values are calculated based on data from three independent experiments. 95% confidence intervals (asymmetrical) are shown in parentheses.FPR2FPR1nmF2M2Lau-((S)-Aoc)-(Lys-βNphe)6-NH2167 (142–197)+++−Variation of N-terminal fatty acid lengthF2M3Oct-((S)-Aoc)-(Lys-βNphe)6-NH2−−−F2M4Dec-((S)-Aoc)-(Lys-βNphe)6-NH2≪+−F2M5Myr-((S)-Aoc)-(Lys-βNphe)6-NH2176 (153–202)++−F2M6Pam-((S)-Aoc)-(Lys-βNphe)6-NH2173 (151–198)++−Incomplete lipid headgroupF2M15Ac-((S)-Aoc-(S)-Aoc)-(Lys-βNphe)6-NH2−−−F2M16Ac-((S)-Aoc)-(Lys-βNphe)6-NH2−NT−F2M17Lau-(Lys-βNphe)6-NH2AntagonistcMeasured as inhibition of the response induced by WKYMVM.NT−F2M18Ac-(Lys-βNphe)6-NH2−NT−Variation of hydrophobic amino acidF2M7Lau-((S)-Nle)-(Lys-βNphe)6-NH2Antagonist−−F2M8Lau-((S)-OGly)-(Lys-βNphe)6-NH2Antagonist−−F2M9Lau-((S)-Dod)-(Lys-βNphe)6-NH2Antagonist−−Alternative stereochemistry of AocF2M10Lau-((R)-Aoc)-(Lys-βNphe)6-NH2≪++−Comparison with peptide backbone structureF2M11Lau-((S)-Aoc)-(Lys-Phe)6-NH2−−−Variation of β-peptoid hydrophobicityF2M12Lau-((S)-Aoc)-(Lys-βNF3phe)6-NH2−−−F2M13Lau-((S)-Aoc)-(Lys-βNFphe)6-NH275 (66–85)+++−F2M14Lau-((S)-Aoc)-(Lys-βNMephe)6-NH289 (78–102)+++−a As indicated in Fig. 1.b EC50 values are calculated based on data from three independent experiments. 95% confidence intervals (asymmetrical) are shown in parentheses.c Measured as inhibition of the response induced by WKYMVM. Open table in a new tab The fatty acid moiety linked to the N-terminal hydrophobic amino acid proved to be critical for the agonistic effect of F2M2 because F2M15, F2M16, and F2M18 (all lacking the fatty acid) were devoid of activity. The octanoyl analogue (F2M3), displaying an N-terminal fatty acid that was four carbons shorter than F2M2, was likewise devoid of agonistic effect in the tested concentration range (up to 2 μm). Decanoyl, myristoyl, and palmitoyl analogues (i.e. F2M4–F2M6), displaying alkyl chains that were two carbon atoms shorter or two and four carbon atoms longer than that present in the parent peptidomimetic F2M2, were active but with a reduced potency (Table 1). Shortening of the fatty acid resulted in considerable loss of activity, consistent with the lack of activity of F2M15, being the 2-acetamido-substituted analogue of F2M3. To test the importance of the hydrophobic amino acid, F2M17, which entirely lacked the Aoc unit, was evaluated for comparison. This lack of an additional alkyl side chain besides the fatty acid resulted in loss of all agonistic activity in the tested concentration range (up to 2 μm), and instead F2M17 acted as an FPR2 antagonist, reducing the response induced by the agonist WKYMVM (Table 1). To examine whether the length of the amino acid alkyl side chain was optimal in F2M2, three analogues were synthesized: F2M7 (displaying (S)-norleucine) with a two-carbon shorter side chain, F2M8 (analogue with (S)-octylglycine) with two additional carbon atoms in its side chain, and F2M9 (with (S)-2-aminododecanoic acid) with a four-carbon longer side chain (Fig. 2). All of these analogues lacked agonistic activity but maintained an interaction with FPR2, albeit as weak antagonists, underlining the importance of the exact structure of the lipid headgroup to confer agonistic activity. Noticeably, the analogue F2M10 with altered stereochemistry (i.e. the Aoc unit in F2M2 was changed from (S)-form to (R)-form), exhibited significantly reduced neutrophil activation as compared with that of F2M2 (Table 1). The influence of the peptidomimetic backbone on the agonistic activity of F2M2 was assessed by testing the α-peptide analogue (i.e. F2M11). The peptide was entirely inert in the activation assays, indicating that the α-peptide/β-peptoid peptidomimetic backbone is crucial for the ability of this novel agonist type to activate FPR2 (Table 1). Next, we examined the effects of increased hydrophobicity of the peptoid residues via introduction of fluorine or methyl substituents on the benzyl side chain of βNphe (F2M12–F2M14; Fig. 2). These more hydrophobic analogues displayed higher potencies in activating neutrophils as compared to the parental compound F2M2 (Fig. 6A and Table 1), suggesting a highly lipophilic binding site. Interestingly, peptidomimetics F2M13 and F2M14 inhibited/desensitized the response induced by FPR2 agonists but also by the FPR1 agonist fMLF as well as by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator that bypasses membrane receptors (Fig. 6B), indicating that increased hydrophobicity leads to reduced FPR2 selectivity. In addition, increasing hydrophobicity appeared to confer cytotoxic properties to the heavily fluorinated analogue F2M12, which activated neutrophils to produce superoxide at low concentrations (≤250 nm) but rendered the cells non-responsive at higher concentrations (up to 1 μm) and abrogated the responsiveness to a second stimulation with PMA (data not shown). All agonistic variants of F2M2, described above, displayed FPR2 selectivity, because the responses induced in human neutrophils were inhibited by the FPR2-specific inhibitor PBP10 but were unaffected by the FPR1-specific inhibitor CsH (data not shown). In addition, all peptidomimetic agonist variants triggered calcium transients in FPR2-overexpressing cells, but not in FPR1-overexpressing cells (Table 1). Taken together, F2M2 was the most potent FPR2-selective neutrophil-activating peptidomimetic of the variants tested. In accordance with this, the interaction of F2M2 with primary human neutrophils was investigated further to shed more light on how FPR2 regulation is mediated by this novel type of agonist. FPRs are known to couple to pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi-protein for signaling. To characterize the effect of pertussis toxin on the F2M2 response, neutrophils were treated with pertussis toxin at different time points before stimulation with F2M2. Also, the FPR2 agonist WKYMVM and the receptor-independent PMA were included as positive and negative controls, respectively, at each time point. Pertussis toxin treatment for 2 h abolished both the WKYMVM- and F2M2-induced superoxide production (Fig. 7A), showing that a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein is involved in signaling downstream from FPR2 upon F2M2 binding. The cell response to PMA was unaffected by pertussis toxin (Fig. 7A). To study the binding mode of F2M2 on FPR2, we quantified the binding of Cy5-WKYMVM to neutrophils in the presence or absence of F2M2 by flow cytometry. Binding of Cy5-WKYMVM was inhibited by excess (100-fold) non-labeled WKYMVM (Fig. 7B) but not by excess (500-fold) F2M2 (Fig. 7B). These data suggest that F2M2 and WKYMVM most likely interact with different binding sites. Neutrophil production/release of superoxide anions in response to other FPR agonist differs in magnitude, depending on the state of the cells, being either naive (low responders) or primed (high responders). Priming of neutrophils can be achieved with a non-activating cytokine, such as TNF-α. Disruption of the neutrophil cytoskeleton with an inhibitor of actin polymerization, such as latrunculin A, also primes the response to FPR agonists (9Onnheim K. Bylund J. Boulay F. Dahlgren C.

These factors include the Ets family, and in this study Elk3 that is activated by Ras oncogene /Erk signalling, and is involved in angiogenesis, malignant progression and epithelial-mesenchymal type processes. We previously described the identification and in-vitro characterisation of an inhibitor of Ras / Erk activation of Elk3 that also affects microtubules, XRP44X. We now report an initial characterisation of the effects of XRP44X in-vivo on tumour growth and metastasis in three preclinical models mouse models, subcutaneous xenografts, intra-cardiac injection-bone metastasis and the TRAMP transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer progression. XRP44X inhibits tumour growth and metastasis, with limited toxicity. Tumours from XRP44X-treated animals have decreased expression of genes containing Elk3-like binding motifs in their promoters, Elk3 protein and phosphorylated Elk3, suggesting that perhaps XRP44X acts in part by inhibiting the activity of Elk3. Further studies are now warranted to develop XRP44X for tumour therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2484803637,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne Alphavirus that causes severe and debilitating disease symptoms. Alarmingly, transmission rates of CHIKV have increased dramatically over the last decade resulting in 1.7 million suspected cases in the Western hemisphere alone. There are currently no antivirals for treatment of CHIKV infection and novel anti-alphaviral compounds are badly needed. nsP1 is the alphavirus protein responsible for the methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities necessary for formation of the 5' type 0 cap structure added to newly formed viral RNA. Formation of this cap depends on nsP1 binding GTP and transferring a methylated GMP to nascent viral RNA. We have developed a fluorescence polarization-based assay that monitors displacement of a fluorescently-labeled GTP analog in real time. Determining the relative affinities of 15 GTP analogs for nsP1 GTP revealed important structural aspects of GTP that will inform identification of inhibitors able to outcompete GTP for the nsP1 binding site. Validation of the assay for HTS was completed and a secondary orthogonal assay that measures guanylation activity was developed in order to evaluate hits from future drug screens. This platform provides an avenue for identification of potent nsP1 inhibitors, which would potentially provide compounds capable of treating disease caused by CHIKV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2471708415,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family. BVDV isolates are classified into two biotypes based on the development of cytopathic (cp) or non-cytopathic (ncp) effects in epithelial cell culture. BVDV isolates are further separated into species, BVDV1 and 2, based on genetic differences. Symptoms of BVDV infection range from subclinical to severe, depending on strain virulence, and may involve multiple organ systems and induction of a generalized immunosuppression. During BVDV-induced immune suppression, macrophages, critical to innate immunity, may have altered pathogen recognition receptor (PRR) signaling, including signaling through toll-like receptors (TLRs). Comparison of BVDV 2 strains with different biotypes and virulence levels is valuable to determining if there are differences in host macrophage cellular responses between viral phenotypes. The current study demonstrates that cytopathic (cp), noncytopathic (ncp), high (hv) or low virulence (lv) BVDV2 infection of bovine monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMΦ) result in differential expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to uninfected MDMΦ. A hallmark of cp BVDV2 infection is IL-6 production. In response to TLR2 or 4 ligation, as might be observed during secondary bacterial infection, cytokine secretion was markedly decreased in BVDV2-infected MDMΦ, compared to non-infected MDMΦ. Macrophages were hyporesponsive to viral TLR3 or TLR8 ligation. However, TLR7 stimulation of BVDV2-infected MDMΦ induced cytokine secretion, unlike results observed for other TLRs. Together, these data suggest that BVDV2 infection modulated mRNA responses and induced a suppression of proinflammatory cytokine protein responses to TLR ligation in MDMΦ with the exception of TLR7 ligation. It is likely that there are distinct differences in TLR pathways modulated following BVDV2 infection, which have implications for macrophage responses to secondary infections."
https://openalex.org/W2473576227,"We identified SA1684 as a Staphylococcus aureus virulence gene using a silkworm infection model. The SA1684 gene product carried the DUF402 domain, which is found in RNA-binding proteins, and had amino acid sequence similarity with a nucleoside diphosphatase, Streptomyces coelicolor SC4828 protein. The SA1684-deletion mutant exhibited drastically decreased virulence, in which the LD50 against silkworms was more than 10 times that of the parent strain. The SA1684-deletion mutant also exhibited decreased exotoxin production and colony-spreading ability. Purified SA1684 protein had Mn2+- or Co2+-dependent hydrolyzing activity against nucleoside diphosphates. Alanine substitutions of Tyr-88, Asp-106, and Asp-123/Glu-124, which are conserved between SA1684 and SC4828, diminished the nucleoside diphosphatase activity. Introduction of the wild-type SA1684 gene restored the hemolysin production of the SA1684-deletion mutant, whereas none of the alanine-substituted SA1684 mutant genes restored the hemolysin production. RNA sequence analysis revealed that SA1684 is required for the expression of the virulence regulatory genes agr, sarZ, and sarX, as well as metabolic genes involved in glycolysis and fermentation pathways. These findings suggest that the novel nucleoside diphosphatase SA1684 links metabolic pathways and virulence gene expression and plays an important role in S. aureus virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2467826104,"During nephrogenesis, POU domain class 3 transcription factor 3 (POU3F3 aka BRN1) is critically involved in development of distinct nephron segments, including the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL). Deficiency of POU3F3 in knock-out mice leads to underdevelopment of the TAL, lack of differentiation of TAL cells, and perinatal death due to renal failure. Pou3f3L423P mutant mice, which were established in the Munich ENU Mouse Mutagenesis Project, carry a recessive point mutation in the homeobox domain of POU3F3. Homozygous Pou3f3L423P mutants are viable and fertile. The present study used functional, as well as qualitative and quantitative morphological analyses to characterize the renal phenotype of juvenile (12 days) and aged (60 weeks) homo- and heterozygous Pou3f3L423P mutant mice and age-matched wild-type controls. In both age groups, homozygous mutants vs. control mice displayed significantly smaller kidney volumes, decreased nephron numbers and mean glomerular volumes, smaller TAL volumes, as well as lower volume densities of the TAL in the kidney. No histological or ultrastructural lesions of TAL cells or glomerular cells were observed in homozygous mutant mice. Aged homozygous mutants displayed increased serum urea concentrations and reduced specific urine gravity, but no evidence of glomerular dysfunction. These results confirm the role of POU3F3 in development and function of the TAL and provide new evidence for its involvement in regulation of the nephron number in the kidney. Therefore, Pou3f3L423P mutant mice represent a valuable research model for further analyses of POU3F3 functions, or for nephrological studies examining the role of congenital low nephron numbers."

Glass C.K. Signaling by nuclear receptors.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a016709Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). SRs present a modular architecture, with three well defined domains: an NH2-terminal activation domain (NTD), a central DNA binding domain, and a COOH-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD). Generally, the apo receptor resides in the cytosol forming a heterocomplex with other proteins including chaperones such as heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Ligand binding alters SR conformation, releasing it from the complex and promoting translocation to the nucleus, where it binds specific DNA sequences as a dimer and alters transcription of target genes by recruiting transcriptional co-regulators (2McKenna N.J.

Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation, and acetylation, modulate SR stability and different steps on the activation pathway, including receptor dimerization, DNA binding, and interaction with co-regulators (3Anbalagan M.

Until recently, it was widely assumed that SR ligand affinity is an intrinsic property defined by the structure of the LBD and not subject to modulation by post-translational modifications. However, Shibata et al. (4Shibata S. Rinehart J. Zhang J. Moeckel G. Castañeda-Bueno M. Stiegler A.L. Boggon T.J. Gamba G. Lifton R.P.

MR is closely related to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and can be activated under physiological conditions by mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone and glucocorticoids such as cortisol or corticosterone. MR has a wide variety of physiological and pathophysiological functions, with a prominent role in regulating transepithelial ion and fluid transport, which is essential for extracellular volume homeostasis and, therefore, blood pressure control. Phosphorylation of MR Ser-843 is restricted to intercalated cells of the distal nephron, where it has a physiological role in controlling the differential activation of MR by aldosterone under two different physiological conditions (volume depletion versus hyperkalemia) (4Shibata S.

Working with an MR phosphomimetic mutant, Shibata et al. (4Shibata S. Rinehart J. Zhang J. Moeckel G. Castañeda-Bueno M. Stiegler A.L. Boggon T.J. Gamba G. Lifton R.P.

Ligand binding affinity is decreased by 2 orders of magnitude (Kd for [3H]aldosterone changed from 0.64 nm in the wild-type receptor to 86 nm in mutant S843E) (4Shibata S. Rinehart J. Zhang J.

Structural modeling of the LBD suggested that phosphorylation of residue Ser-843 may affect the interaction between helices H6 and H7 in the ligand-bound state. Based on these results, we set out to answer two different but related questions. 1) Does the phosphorylation of Ser-843 result only in decreased binding affinity or does it also affect coupling between ligand binding and receptor activation? 2) How does the proportion of phosphorylated versus non-phosphorylated MR affect receptor function? Our results demonstrate that agonists at high concentrations are able to induce near-complete nuclear translocation of phosphomimetic mutant receptors, albeit at a much slower rate, but are ineffective in inducing agonist-dependent gene transactivation. This suggests altered coupling between ligand binding and receptor activation, resulting in impaired interaction with co-regulators. Moreover, phosphomimetic MR mutants have a dominant negative effect on WT receptor function, a feature that will amplify the physiological effect of LBD phosphorylation. This study used a previously described fluorescent derivative of mouse wild-type MR with insertion of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) after amino acid 147 of the MR sequence (5Aguilar-Sánchez C.

Phosphomimetic mutants S839D and S839E presented decreased affinity for aldosterone, with Kd values of 86.7 and 34.3 nm, respectively, which are in the same range of the Kd value described for the equivalent mutation S843E in the human MR clone. We then asked whether phosphorylation of MR at residue 843 impairs receptor activity exclusively by lowering ligand affinity or whether it also uncouples ligand binding from receptor activation. If the first option is correct, increasing aldosterone concentration should result in normal nuclear translocation and gene transactivation. To test this hypothesis we studied aldosterone-induced nuclear translocation using our fluorescent derivative of wild-type mouse MR (MR-WT) and compared it with the same receptor harboring phosphomimetic mutations. COS-7 cells transfected with WT, S839E, or S839D MR were left untreated or exposed overnight to increasing concentrations of aldosterone (0.1–100 nm) covering a range of physiological (0.1–2 nm) to supra-physiological levels. In the absence of ligand the vast majority of cells showed a predominantly cytosolic MR localization (Fig. 2, A and C) as previously described (7Hernández-Díaz I. Giraldez T. Arnau M.R. Smits V.A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 17549-17561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutations S839D or S839E did not change naïve MR subcellular localization (Fig. 2, A and C). When cells were stimulated overnight with increasing concentrations of aldosterone, MR-WT translocated to the nucleus, with >90% of the cells showing an exclusive MR nuclear localization with as little as 1 nm aldosterone (Fig. 2, A and C). In comparison, aldosterone partially translocated mutants MR-S839D and MR-S839E. The effect started to be apparent at 1 nm aldosterone and continued growing with up to 100 nm aldosterone, where ∼90% of cells showed a predominantly nuclear localization (Fig. 2, B and C). These results suggests that phosphorylation of MR impairs nuclear translocation but only to a limited extent, with a significant amount of receptor present in the nucleus. To test whether decreased nuclear localization induced by phosphorylation arises from slower nuclear import, we examined the kinetics of this process in COS-7 cells transfected with MR-WT or phosphomimetic mutation S839D (both tagged with YFP). To that end, living cells were placed under a confocal microscope in a temperature-controlled chamber at 37 °C and stimulated with 10 nm aldosterone. Images of the same cells were taken every 2 min for up to 60 min after the addition of the hormone, and the proportion of nuclear receptor was calculated in every cell for each time point. Representative images of WT and S839D MR translocation are shown in Fig. 3A. When compared with the WT receptor, mutant S839D showed very slow translocation kinetics, with <20% of the cytosolic receptor translocated over the period of 1 h (Fig. 3, A and B). This strongly suggests that impaired ligand-induced nuclear accumulation of the phosphomimetic MR mutant arises from slower nuclear import. This in turn may arise from lower affinity for the ligand but could also imply either decreased stability of aldosterone in the LBD or a defect in coupling ligand binding with receptor conformational change. We then tested the functional consequences of mutating mouse MR residue Ser-839 for MR-mediated gene transactivation. We tested non-phosphorylatable mutant S839A and phosphomimicking mutants S839D and S839E. Aldosterone dose-response luciferase reporter assays showed an EC50 of 0.4 nm for MR WT, whereas S839A EC50 was 2.8 nm. Upon stimulation with cortisol, WT MR displayed an EC50 of 9.8 nm, and MR-S839A had an EC50 of 19.3. As described with human MR-S843E, mouse MR-S839E and mouse MR-S839D did not display aldosterone or cortisol-dependent gene transactivation even at high doses of ligand (Fig. 4, A and B). Western blotting analysis showed that the lack of MR-S839D or MR-S839E transactivation and reduced MR-S839A transactivation were not due to impaired protein expression (Fig. 4C). The lack of any gene transactivation by MR-S839E or MR-S839D at ligand concentrations where there is significant nuclear translocation in the same time frame (compare FIGURE 2, FIGURE 4) supports the idea that phosphorylation of MR LBD not only lowers MR affinity for agonists but has a profound impact on the ability of the ligand to activate the receptor. Therefore, we hypothesized that the phosphomimetic mutant may prevent efficient interaction with co-regulators. To investigate this possibility we tested ligand-induced MR interaction with a well known co-activator, steroid receptor co-activator 1 (SRC-1) (9Amazit L. Le Billan F. Kolkhof P. Lamribet K.

SRC-1 displays a predominantly nuclear localization both in control and aldosterone-stimulated conditions, whereas MR shows the expected ligand-induced trafficking from cytosol to nucleus (Fig. 5A). To quantitatively assess MR-SRC-1 interaction, we used a proximity ligation assay (PLA). Co-transfection of MR-WT and SRC-1 resulted in a prominent PLA signal in the cell nucleus only in the presence of aldosterone (Fig. 5B). Omission of either one of the transfected plasmids resulted in the absence of signal (Fig. 5, B and C). Quantitative analysis demonstrated that PLA signal was drastically reduced (to ∼15% of the WT signal) when the phosphomimetic mutants MR-S839D or MR-S839E were co-transfected with SRC-1 (Fig. 5, B and C). Based on MR LBD crystal structure, Shibata et al. (4Shibata S. Rinehart J. Zhang J. Moeckel G. Castañeda-Bueno M. Stiegler A.L. Boggon T.J. Gamba G. Lifton R.P.

Indeed, their experimental measurements of WT and phosphomimetic mutant S843E Kd for aldosterone showed decreased affinity (from 0.63 nm to 86 nm) (4Shibata S. Rinehart J. Zhang J. Moeckel G. Castañeda-Bueno M. Stiegler A.L. Boggon T.J. Gamba G. Lifton R.P.

To further investigate the possible effects of phosphorylation at Ser-843, we modeled this post-translational modification using available crystal structures of MR LBD as templates (12Hasui T. Matsunaga N. Ora T. Ohyabu N. Nishigaki N. Imura Y. Igata Y. Matsui H. Motoyaji T. Tanaka T. Habuka N. Sogabe S. Ono M. Siedem C.S. Tang T.P. Gauthier C. De Meese L.A. Boyd S.A. Fukumoto S.

Chem. 2011; 54: 8616-8631Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Using this model we performed docking calculations to estimate the energy of interaction of aldosterone, cortisol, and spironolactone to MR LBD in the WT form with phosphorylated Ser-843 or introducing phosphomimetic mutation S843D (Table 1). To validate docking parameterization, we compared the position of aldosterone as calculated by docking with the position of aldosterone as determined by x-ray crystallography. Both were practically superimposable (not shown). Docking interaction energy for aldosterone was only slightly affected by phospho-Ser-843, S843D or S839E modifications (Table 1), suggesting that the decreased affinity observed by Shibata et al. (4Shibata S. Rinehart J. Zhang J. Moeckel G. Castañeda-Bueno M. Stiegler A.L. Boggon T.J. Gamba G. Lifton R.P.

Given that intercalated cells, where Ser-843 phosphorylation has been described, lack 11-β-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type 2 and its MR may, therefore, be activated by cortisol (4Shibata S. Rinehart J. Zhang J. Moeckel G. Castañeda-Bueno M. Stiegler A.L. Boggon T.J. Gamba G. Lifton R.P.

Angiotensin retains sodium by dephosphorylating mineralocorticoid receptors in renal intercalated cells.Cell Metab. 2013; 18: 609-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we also calculated docking energy for this hormone. In contrast to aldosterone, cortisol appears to bind slightly more stably to the modified LBD (Table 1), again suggesting that the absence of cortisol transactivation of phosphomimetic mutants observed previously (4Shibata S.

Spironolactone showed a decrease in docking energy interaction with Ser-843 phosphorylation and S843D mutation but not with S843E mutation (Table 1). Interestingly, interaction energies for the three ligands were almost identical in the model incorporating a phosphorylation of Ser-843 when compared with mutation S843D (Table 1) but not compared with mutation S843E, suggesting that using phosphomimetic mutation S843D may be a better approximation to study the effects of Ser-843 phosphorylation in MR function.TABLE 1Docking interaction energies (kcal mol−1) of ligands with modeled MR WT, mutant, or phosphorylated ligand binding domainMR LBD variantAldosteroneCortisolSpironolactoneSer-843−11.3−9.9−13.2S843D−10.8−10.8−12.2S843E−11.3−11.2−13.5Ser(P)-843−10.8−10.6−12.3 Open table in a new tab To investigate the functional impact of partial MR phosphorylation we co-expressed different proportions of WT and S843D receptors in COS-7 cells. To ensure that the different proportions of plasmids produced the desired protein expression levels, we performed Western blotting analysis of receptor expression. Both receptors were recognized by the same anti-MR antibody but could be differentiated due to their different molecular weight produced by fusing YFP to MR-S839D. Co-expression of both receptors using 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1 plasmid proportions gave the expected ratios between WT and mutant MR (Fig. 6A). To confirm that S843D mutation does not disrupt dimerization and it is able to form dimers with WT MR, we used PLA (Fig. 6B). Quantification of PLA results showed that MR dimerization was identical in the absence or presence of the S839D mutation (Fig. 6C). This result indicates that WT MR subunits do not discriminate between WT and S839D-containing subunits for dimerization. Therefore, we predicted that the distribution of WT·WT, WT·S839D, and S839D·S839D dimers when different proportions of WT MR and S839D mutant are co-transfected should follow a binomial distribution (calculated abundances of each type of dimer are shown in Table 2). We next investigated subcellular localization of three different conditions where WT·S839D proportions were variable (Fig. 6D). Subcellular distribution in the absence of ligand did not show any variation, as predicted by experiments transfecting each variant individually (shown in Fig. 1B). Subcellular localization of WT and S839D proteins in the presence of 10 nm aldosterone varied consistently with partially impaired nuclear localization of the S839D mutant (Fig. 6D and Table 3). Transactivation levels corresponded closely with the predicted amounts of WT homodimers (Fig. 7 and Table 2), indicating that heterodimers between WT and phosphomimetic S839D MR are transcriptionally inactive (Fig. 7). These results demonstrate that phosphorylation at residue Ser-839 has a dominant negative effect on MR activity.TABLE 2Expected subunit composition of wild type and S839D heterodimersTransfected proportionsType of dimer formedWT·WTWT·S839DS839D·S839D3:156.25%37.5%6.25%1:12550251:36.25%37.5%56.25% Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Subcellular localization of MR and MR-S839D co-expressed in COS-7 cells at different proportions and stimulated with 10 nm aldosterone for 16 hMR·MR-S839DaProportions of transfected plasmids.NN > CN + N > CbValues obtained by adding the percentage of cells in N and N>C categories.WTS839DWTS839DWTS839D1:091.5−6.6−98.1−0:1−1.0−78.6−79.63:193.716.74.464.898.181.51:190.43.88.679.699.183.41:381.71.917.678.799.380.6a Proportions of transfected plasmids.b Values obtained by adding the percentage of cells in N and N>C categories.

Using COS-7 cells as an expression model, Liu et al. (14Liu W. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Steroid receptor heterodimerization demonstrated in vitro and in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) demonstrated that co-expression of MR diminishes GR-dependent transactivation, likely due to weak transcriptional activity of heterodimers. To test whether phosphorylation of MR residue Ser-839 affects GR activity, we co-transfected COS-7 cells with GR, WT MR, or phosphomimicking mutant MR-S839D and assessed dose dependence of cortisol-induced transactivation. MR and GR co-expression at a 1:1 ratio decreased luciferase induction by 50% at saturating cortisol concentrations when compared with GR expressed alone (Fig. 8A), consistent with previously published data (14Liu W. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Steroid receptor heterodimerization demonstrated in vitro and in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). When GR was co-expressed with MR-S839D at a 1:1 ratio luciferase, transactivation further decreased to 25% that of maximum activity achieved when GR was expressed alone (Fig. 8A). The effect of MR-S839D co-expression on cortisol-induced MR activity was the same as the one detected with aldosterone (Fig. 8B). These observations are consistent with a model where MR·GR heterodimers possess very low or null transactivation capacity, with most of the detected cortisol-induced transactivation being conducted by GR·GR and MR·MR heterodimers. Because phosphorylated MR is inactive and acts as dominant negative toward non-phosphorylated MR, this post-translational modification would only further decrease cortisol-mediated gene transactivation in cells co-expressing MR and GR. Our results show that physiological and supra-physiological doses of aldosterone are able to induce at least partial translocation of phosphomimetic mutants MR-S839D and S839E, but the mutants are totally impaired for gene transactivation. This correlates with an inability to recruit a common MR co-activator, SRC-1. In silico modeling of the effect of Ser-839 phosphorylation on ligand docking energy suggests that this modification displays minor effects on steady-state ligand interaction. When co-expressed with WT receptor, MR-S839D decreased gene transactivation to an extent consistent with a dominant negative role in the SR dimer, consistent with a model where only one phosphorylated unit in the dimer will completely impair MR activity. Finally, our data suggest that MR phosphorylation at residue S839D will further impact cortisol-induced gene transactivation in cells co-expressing MR and GR. Based on the previous work by Shibata et al. (4Shibata S. Rinehart J. Zhang J. Moeckel G. Castañeda-Bueno M. Stiegler A.L. Boggon T.J. Gamba G. Lifton R.P. Mineralocorticoid receptor phosphorylation regulates ligand binding and renal response to volume depletion and hyperkalemia.Cell Metab. 2013; 18: 660-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and the data presented in this work, we can clearly see how there is good agreement between WT receptor Kd (1.07 nm) and EC50 (0.4 nm) for aldosterone. In contrast, there is a large difference when phosphomimetic mutants S839D or S839E (Ser-843 in the human sequence) are examined, with a Kd of 86.7 and 34.3 nm, respectively, but no gene transactivation detectable, even at 1 μm aldosterone (see Fig. 4A). This discrepancy between Kd and EC50 is reminiscent of MR activation by cortisol. Kd for cortisol and aldosterone are in the same order of magnitude (0.5–2 nm), but EC50 for cortisol is 10 nm (for review see Ref. 6Farman N. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Multiple aspects of mineralocorticoid selectivity.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F181-F192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The discrepancy between Kd and EC50 for cortisol-induced MR activation has been explained by the fast off-rate of cortisol from the complex (15Hellal-Levy C. Couette B. Fagart J. Souque A.

https://openalex.org/W2498875633,"Introduction Measurement of mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF) and pneumonia (PN) is a high priority since these are common reasons for hospitalization. However, mortality in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that are hospitalized for these common medical conditions is unknown. Methods A retrospective review of the 2005–2011 National Inpatient Sample (NIS), (approximately a 20% sample of discharges from community hospitals) was performed. A dataset for all patients with ICD-9-CM codes for primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia or congestive heart failure with a co-diagnosis of IBD, Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). 1:3 propensity score matching between patients with co-diagnosed disease vs. controls was performed. Continuous variables were compared between IBD and controls. Categorical variables were reported as frequency (percentage) and analyzed by Chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact test for co-diagnosed disease vs. control comparisons. Propensity scores were computed through multivariable logistic regression accounting for demographic and hospital factors. In-hospital mortality between the groups was compared. Results Patients with IBD, CD and UC had improved survival after AMI compared to controls. 94/2280 (4.1%) of patients with IBD and AMI died, compared to 251/5460 (5.5%) of controls, p = 0.01. This represents a 25% improved survival in IBD patients that were hospitalized with AMI. There was a 34% improved survival in patients with CD and AMI. There was a trend toward worsening survival in patients with IBD and CHF. Patients with CD and PN had improved survival compared to controls. 87/3362 (2.59%) patients with CD and PN died, compared to 428/10076 (4.25%) of controls, p < .0001. This represents a 39% improved survival in patients with CD that are hospitalized for PN. Conclusion IBD confers a survival benefit for patients hospitalized with AMI. A diagnosis of CD benefits survival in patients that are hospitalized with PN."

Strikingly, co-depletion of NatA, a heterodimeric NAT complex that physically interacts with Naa50, rescues the sister-chromatid cohesion defects and the resulting mitotic arrest caused by Naa50 depletion, indicating that NatA and Naa50 play antagonistic roles in cohesion. Purified recombinant NatA and Naa50 do not affect each other's NAT activity in vitro.

The presence of fatty liver was determined using ultrasound. Parametric Cox modeling was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the incidence of NAFLD.During 127,324.4 person-years of follow-up, 6249 participants developed NAFLD. Despite adjusting for possible confounders, the risk of development of NAFLD increased with increasing quartiles of WC change in a dose-response manner (p for trend < 0.001).

Relative expression of three GST genes was measured using RT-qPCR on days 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 in two independent experiments. Differential regulation was found for the Delta and the Sigma GSTs between 0.5 to 2 days, but not on day 5 in both experiments. The third GST, a microsomal, was not differentially expressed in either treatment or day. RT-qPCR results from the two experiments were similar, even though experimental females were collected from the Gulf of Maine on different dates and their reproductive output differed. In the second experiment, expression of 39 GSTs was determined on days 2 and 5 using RNA-Seq. Global gene expression analyses agreed with the RT-qPCR results. Furthermore, the RNA-Seq measurements indicated that only four GSTs were differentially expressed under the experimental conditions, and the response was small in amplitude. In summary, the A. fundyense diet led to a rapid and transient response in C. finmarchicus in three cytosolic GSTs, while a fourth GST (Omega I) was significantly up-regulated on day 5. Although there was some regulation of GSTs in response the toxic dinoflagellate, the tolerance to A. fundyense by C. finmarchicus is not dependent on the long-term up-regulation of specific GSTs."

Patients with unconfirmed and confirmed preDM tended to have more prevalent high blood pressure and depression as compared to the at-risk group. Based on the discrete survival analyses, patients with unconfirmed preDM and confirmed preDM were more likely to develop T2DM when compared to at-risk patients.Unconfirmed and confirmed preDM are strongly associated with the development of T2DM as compared to patients with only risk factors for disease."
https://openalex.org/W2472980588,"Animal populations occurring at high elevations are often assumed to be in peril of extinctions or local extirpations due to elevational-dispersal limitations and thermoregulatory constraints as habitats change and warm. However, long-term monitoring of high-elevation populations is uncommon relative to those occurring at lower elevations, and evidence supporting this assumption is limited. We analyzed 45 years of reproductive data for two Colorado populations of white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura), an alpine-endemic species with restricted distribution in western North America. Seasonal temperatures measured by the number of growing degree days warmed significantly at our study sites for pre-nesting, nesting, and brood-rearing seasonal periods (mean advance of 8 growing degree days per decade), and both populations advanced their reproductive phenology over the study period based on median hatch dates (median advance of 3.7 and 1.9 days per decade for the northern and southern sites, respectively). Reproductive performance measured by the number of chicks per hen declined significantly at one study site but not the other, and differences between sites may have been due to habitat degradation at one study area. Annual variability in chicks per hen was large at both sites but only weakly related to seasonal weather. An index of precipitation and temperature during the brood-rearing period was the best predictor for reproductive success with warm and dry conditions relating positively to number of chicks per hen. Our results provide evidence for two alpine ptarmigan populations that are remarkably invariant to fluctuations in seasonal weather with respect to reproductive success as measured by number of chicks per hen in the breeding population. These results are surprising given the general perception of alpine animal populations as being highly sensitive to warming temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2506659675,"An effective antibody response can assist drug treatment to contribute to better parasite clearance in malaria patients. To examine this, sera were obtained from two groups of adult patients with acute falciparum malaria, prior to drug treatment: patients who (1) have subsequent recrudescent infection, or (2) were cured by Day 28 following treatment. Using a Plasmodium falciparum antigen library, we examined the antibody specificities in these sera. While the antibody repertoire of both sera groups was extremely broad and varied, there was a differential antibody profile between the two groups of sera. The proportion of cured patients with antibodies against EXP1, MSP3, GLURP, RAMA, SEA and EBA181 was higher than the proportion of patients with recrudescent infection. The presence of these antibodies was associated with higher odds of treatment cure. Sera containing all six antibodies impaired the invasion of P. falciparum clinical isolates into erythrocytes. These results suggest that antibodies specific against EXP1, MSP3, GLURP, RAMA, SEA and EBA181 in P. falciparum infections could assist anti-malarial drug treatment and contribute to the resolution of the malarial infection."

https://openalex.org/W2480253238,"Perturbations in CREB binding protein (CREBBP) are associated with hematopoietic malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Mice hemizygous for Crebbp develop myelodysplasia with proliferative features, reminiscent of human MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm-unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U), and a proportion goes on to develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We have also shown that the Crebbp+/- non-hematopoietic bone marrow microenvironment induces excessive myeloproliferation of wild-type cells. We now report that transplantation of unfractionated Crebbp+/- bone marrow into wild-type recipients resulted in either early-onset AML or late-onset MDS and MDS/MPN-U. In contrast, purified Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit++ cells primarily gave rise to MDS with occasional transformation to AML. Furthermore, Crebbp+/- common myeloid progenitors and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors could trigger skewed myelopoiesis, myelodysplasia and late-onset AML. Surprisingly, the phenotypically abnormal cells were all of wild-type origin. MDS, MPN and AML can thus all be transferred from Crebbp+/- BM to wild-type hosts but fractionated bone marrow does not recapitulate the full disease spectrum of whole bone marrow, indicating that not only mutational status but also cellular context contribute to disease outcome. This has important consequences for structuring and interpreting future investigations into the underlying mechanisms of myeloid malignancies as well as for their treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2463052298,"Medical diagnostics is often a multi-attribute problem, necessitating sophisticated tools for analyzing high-dimensional biomedical data. Mining this data often results in two crucial bottlenecks: 1) high dimensionality of features used to represent rich biological data and 2) small amounts of labelled training data due to the expense of consulting highly specific medical expertise necessary to assess each study. Currently, no approach that we are aware of has attempted to use active learning in the context of dimensionality reduction approaches for improving the construction of low dimensional representations. We present our novel methodology, AdDReSS (Adaptive Dimensionality Reduction with Semi-Supervision), to demonstrate that fewer labeled instances identified via AL in embedding space are needed for creating a more discriminative embedding representation compared to randomly selected instances. We tested our methodology on a wide variety of domains ranging from prostate gene expression, ovarian proteomic spectra, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and breast histopathology. Across these various high dimensional biomedical datasets with 100+ observations each and all parameters considered, the median classification accuracy across all experiments showed AdDReSS (88.7%) to outperform SSAGE, a SSDR method using random sampling (85.5%), and Graph Embedding (81.5%). Furthermore, we found that embeddings generated via AdDReSS achieved a mean 35.95% improvement in Raghavan efficiency, a measure of learning rate, over SSAGE. Our results demonstrate the value of AdDReSS to provide low dimensional representations of high dimensional biomedical data while achieving higher classification rates with fewer labelled examples as compared to without active learning."
https://openalex.org/W2460217577,"Here, we demonstrate that a metal ion binding motif could serve as an efficient and robust tool for site-specific conjugation strategy. Cysteine-containing metal binding motifs were constructed as single repeat or tandem repeat peptides and their metal binding characteristics were investigated. The tandem repeats of the Cysteine-Glycine-Histidine (CGH) metal ion binding motif exhibited concerted binding to Co(II) ions, suggesting that conformational transition of peptide was triggered by the sequential metal ion binding. Evaluation of the free thiol content after reduction by reducing reagent showed that metal-ion binding elicited strong retardation of cysteine oxidation in the order of Zn(II)>Ni(II)>Co(II). The CGH metal ion binding motif was then introduced to the C-terminus of antibody heavy chain and the metal ion-dependent characteristics of oxidation kinetics were investigated. As in the case of peptides, CGH-motif-introduced antibody exhibited strong dependence on metal ion binding to protect against oxidation. Zn(II)-saturated antibody with tandem repeat of CGH motif retains the cysteine reactivity as long as 22 hour even with saturating O2 condition. Metal-ion dependent fluorophore labeling clearly indicated that metal binding motifs could be employed as an efficient tool for site-specific conjugation. Whereas Trastuzumab without a metal ion binding site exhibited site-nonspecific dye conjugation, Zn(II) ion binding to antibody with a tandem repeat of CGH motif showed that fluorophores were site-specifically conjugated to the heavy chain of antibody. We believe that this strong metal ion dependence on oxidation protection and the resulting site-selective conjugation could be exploited further to develop a highly site-specific conjugation strategy for proteins that contain multiple intrinsic cysteine residues, including monoclonal antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2477782327,"In vitro studies have previously found a class of vestibular nuclei neurons to exhibit a bidirectional afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in their membrane potential, due to calcium and calcium-activated potassium conductances. More recently in vivo studies of such vestibular neurons were found to exhibit a boosting nonlinearity in their input-output tuning curves. In this paper, a Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) type neuron model, originally developed to reproduce the in vitro AHP, is shown to produce a boosting nonlinearity similar to that seen in vivo for increased the calcium conductance. Indicative of a bifurcation, the HH model is reduced to a generalized integrate-and-fire (IF) model that preserves the bifurcation structure and boosting nonliearity. By then projecting the neuron model's phase space trajectories into 2D, the underlying geometric mechanism relating the AHP and boosting nonlinearity is revealed. Further simplifications and approximations are made to derive analytic expressions for the steady steady state firing rate as a function of bias current, μ, as well as the gain (i.e. its slope) and the position of its peak at μ = μ*. Finally, although the boosting nonlinearity has not yet been experimentally observed in vitro, testable predictions indicate how it might be found."
