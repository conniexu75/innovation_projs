https://openalex.org/W4229940949,"The development of artificially structured electromagnetic materials, termed metamaterials, has led to the realization of phenomena that cannot be obtained with natural materials. This is especially important for the technologically relevant terahertz (1 THz = 10(12) Hz) frequency regime; many materials inherently do not respond to THz radiation, and the tools that are necessary to construct devices operating within this range-sources, lenses, switches, modulators and detectors-largely do not exist. Considerable efforts are underway to fill this 'THz gap' in view of the useful potential applications of THz radiation. Moderate progress has been made in THz generation and detection; THz quantum cascade lasers are a recent example. However, techniques to control and manipulate THz waves are lagging behind. Here we demonstrate an active metamaterial device capable of efficient real-time control and manipulation of THz radiation. The device consists of an array of gold electric resonator elements (the metamaterial) fabricated on a semiconductor substrate. The metamaterial array and substrate together effectively form a Schottky diode, which enables modulation of THz transmission by 50 per cent, an order of magnitude improvement over existing devices."

In addition to roles in normal development, miRNAs have recently been implicated in a range of human diseases, including cancer. We recently demonstrated that a polycistronic cluster of miRNAs, miR-17–92, is oncogenic in a mouse model for Burkitt's lymphoma. This is due, in part, to a reduced apoptotic program. In an effort to understand the regulation of miR-17–92, we have studied the promoter structure of this miRNA cluster. The primary transcript initiates from a consensus initiator sequence downstream of a nonconsensus TATA box. The core promoter region contains two functional E2F transcription factor binding sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates that E2F3 is the primary E2F family member that occupies the promoter. These data place miR-17–92 in a regulatory loop between E2F3 and the miR-17 target E2F1. We propose a model whereby miR-17–92 promotes cell proliferation by shifting the E2F transcriptional balance away from the pro-apoptotic E2F1 and toward the proliferative E2F3 transcriptional network."

Analysis of TRAF6-deficient mice revealed a fundamental role of TRAF6 in osteoclastogenesis; however, the molecular mechanism underlying TRAF6 signaling in this biological process is not understood. Recent biochemical evidence has indicated that TRAF6 possesses ubiquitin ligase activity that controls the activation of IKK and NF-κB. Because these studies are primarily based on cell-free systems, the role of the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6 and its auto-ubiquitination to initiate the NF-κB pathway in vivo remain elusive. Here we show that an intact RING domain of TRAF6 in conjunction with the E2 enzyme Ubc13/Uev1A is necessary for Lys-63-linked auto-ubiquitination of TRAF6 and for its ability to activate IKK and NF-κB. Furthermore, a RING mutant of TRAF6 abolishes its ability to induce receptor activator of NF-κB-independent osteoclast differentiation and nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor NFATc1. Notably, we map the auto-ubiquitination site of TRAF6 to a single Lys residue, which if mutated renders TRAF6 unable to activate transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 and IKK and to cause spontaneous osteoclast differentiation. Additionally, we provide biochemical and in vivo evidence that TRAF6 serves as an E3 to directly ubiquitinate NEMO. Reconstituting TRAF6-deficent cells with various TRAF6 mutants, we clearly demonstrate the requirement for the TRAF6 RING domain and site-specific auto-ubiquitination of TRAF6 to activate IKK in response to interleukin-1. These data establish a signaling cascade in which regulated site-specific Lys-63-linked TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination is the critical upstream mediator of IKK.

Following receptor activation, these cytokines induce a cascade of signaling events leading to the activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP1 through upstream kinases, including IκB kinase (IKK) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs; JNK, p38, and ERK). These events culminate in the expression and regulation of numerous pro-inflammatory genes (1Baud V. Karin M.

Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) constitute a family of seven known adaptor proteins, and most of them participate in activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and members of the MAPKs (3Kobayashi T.

Several TRAF proteins interact directly with the intracellular regions of various members of the TNF receptor family through a highly conserved motif at their C terminus termed the TRAF domain. In contrast, the N-terminal domain of the TRAFs is less well conserved but consists of zinc finger motifs and in some TRAFs a RING (really interesting new gene) domain, which has been identified in a number of E3 ubiquitin ligases (6Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar).Recently, the N-terminal RING domain of TRAF6 has been included in a growing family of ubiquitin (Ub) ligases, also known as E3s (7Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). RING-type E3s contain a series of Cys and His residues distinctly separated to constitute a novel zinc-binding domain. The first hint that TRAF6 possesses Ub ligase activity came from biochemical reconstitution experiments that examined TRAF6-dependent activation of the IKK (8Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar, 9Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). IKK is a heterotrimeric complex composed of the kinase subunits IKKα and IKKβ and the regulatory subunit NEMO (also known as IKKγ). The dimeric Ub-conjugating enzyme Ubc13/Uev1A and the TAB2-TAK1 kinase complex were shown to be required for TRAF6-mediated IKK activation in vitro. In a cell-free system, it appears that by facilitating the synthesis of unique Lys-63-linked poly-Ub chains, rather than the conventional Lys-48-linked poly-Ub chains that target proteins for degradation, TRAF6 activates TAK1 by an unknown mechanism. TAK1 then phosphorylates and activates IKK for NF-κB activation. TAK1 also phosphorylates MKK6 and MKK7, which in turn activate the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways, respectively. Recent studies suggest that the TAK1-binding protein TAB2 and its homologue TAB3 contain a highly conserved C-terminal zinc finger domain that binds preferentially to Lys-63-linked poly-Ub chains and is required for TAK1 activation (10Kanayama A.

Cell. 2004; 15: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar).Among all of the TRAFs, TRAF6 plays a critical role in osteoclastogenesis as revealed by the severe osteopetrosis phenotype in TRAF6-deficient mice (11Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8766-8771Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which TRAF6 exerts this biological activity is not well understood. Indeed, the model of TRAF6-mediated kinase activation is exclusively based on in vitro reconstitution experiments. Nonetheless, it supports a novel Ub-dependent TRAF6 signaling pathway. However, there are many conceptual questions remaining about the potential downstream targets of the TRAF6 Ub ligase activity and the possible role of these ubiquitination events in the activation of signaling cascades. In this report, we performed a series of comprehensive studies to show that one of the most important targets of TRAF6 Ub ligase activity is TRAF6 itself. We show that TRAF6 is auto-ubiquitinated via Lys-63 linkages, which depends on an intact RING and the dimeric E2 enzyme Ubc13/Uev1A. Furthermore, the RING domain of TRAF6 is critical for the activation of NF-κB and for the induction of osteoclast differentiation through the stimulation of the transcription factor NFATc1. Strikingly, we identified a single critical Ub acceptor site residue (Lys-124) in TRAF6 that is required for TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination. In transient expression studies, mutation of this site abolished TRAF6-mediated NEMO ubiquitination, TAK1 and IKK activation, NF-κB activation, and osteoclast differentiation. Moreover, in stable TRAF6-deficient cells mutation of Lys-124 of TRAF6 prevents TRAF6 ubiquitination and IKK activation after IL-1 stimulation. These data establish that regulated site-specific Lys-63-linked TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination is the critical upstream mediator of IKK activation, which may have general implications in other TRAF6-mediated signaling processes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Reagents, and Antibodies—The mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (referred to as RAW) and HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and cultured as previously described (14Polek T.C.

All retroviral vectors were constructed in a modified pMX vector (19Kitamura T. Int. J. Hematol. 1998; 67: 351-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contained the gene of interest cloned upstream of an IRES-GFP with a puromycin-selectable maker. A region encoding residues 33-262 of mouse M-CSF (ATCC) was cloned in-frame with a FLAG tag in pCMV1-FLAG (Sigma), and then the entire coding sequence, including the preprotrypsin leader and FLAG tag of M-CSF, was cloned into pMX-IRESpuro. Human cDNAs for Ubc13, Uev1A, and MKK6 were amplified from a human thymus library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using gene-specific PCR primers and inserted in-frame with an N-terminal FLAG tag in pcDNA3 and in-frame with a His tag in pET45. Expression vectors for HA-Ub were subcloned from pRK5-HA-Ub into pcDNA3.1. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing.Transfection, Reporter Gene Assays, and Retroviral Infection—Transfection of HEK293 cells was performed essentially as described previously (16Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Transfection of HEK293 cells with a 3×-NF-κB-driven luciferase (0.5 μg/well) and β-actin Renilla luciferase (10 ng/well) constructs and analysis of reporter activity were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). For production of retroviral supernatants, GP2-293 cells were co-transfected with the indicated retroviral vector and pVSV-g (Clontech) using FuGENE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). After overnight transfection, the medium was removed and fresh medium was added. Viral supernatant was collected after 48-72 h and used to infect RAW, HEK293, mouse bone marrow-derived or spleen-derived monocytes, and MEFs with the addition of Polybrene (8 μg/ml). After 2 days, selection was initiated with puromycin (2-4 μg/ml). In some cases, stable pools of cells or clones were maintained in puromycin (2 μg/ml).In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay and Poly-Ub Chain Synthesis—Bound proteins used as E3 enzymes or substrates for in vitro ubiquitination were either immunopurified with anti-FLAG antibody and protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce) from HEK293 cells transfected with the appropriate construct or bacteria-purified GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). The auto-ubiquitination assay was performed in 20-μl reaction volumes with the following components: 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 25 μm MG132, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 59 μm His-Ub, 50 nm E1, 850 nm E2 (Ubc13/Uev1A), 1 mm ATP, 30 μm creatine phosphate, and 1 unit of creatine kinase. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 1-2 h with gentle agitation. The beads were washed several times in Buffer C and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an Ub-specific antibody. The in vitro ubiquitinationligase assay was carried out by incubating glutathione-agarose bound GST-TRAF6 or variants in 20 μl of reaction mixture described above for 2 h at 37°C. After incubation, 10 μl of cold 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) was added to the reaction, and samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C. A volume (20 μl) of the supernatant was collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an Ub-specific antibody.Molecular Modeling of TRAF6—We searched the Protein Data Bank for a potential structural template for the region of TRAF6 from the RING domain to the first zinc finger domain. The Rag1 dimerization domain (PDB ID 1RMD) aligned extremely well with this region of TRAF6, with only one single residue insertion in the entire alignment. Molecular modeling was then carried out using the program Swiss-Model (20Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4421) Google Scholar). The structure figure was generated using the program PyMol. 3W. L. DeLano (2002) DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA. Osteoclast Differentiation—RAW cells were infected with the indicated retrovirus in 6-well plates overnight and then treated with puromycin for 2 days, after which cells were trypsinized, counted, and seeded in 24-well plates at varying densities (20,000-50,000/well). After 4-6 days, cells were fixed and stained for TRAP. Osteoclast formation was assessed by counting the total number of multinucleated (>3 nuclei), TRAP-positive cells present per well in quadruplicate. For mouse bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMMs), tibiae and femurs were excised from 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice, and the bone marrow cells were harvested. Whole bone marrow was cultured in α-minimal essential medium (10% serum) and plated in a 10-cm dish over night. The next day the floating cells were collected, washed, and seeded with 10 ng/ml M-CSF. After 2 days, the cells were infected as described above for RAW cells. Spleen-derived monocytes from 6- to 8-week old C57BL/6 mice or from 10-day-old TRAF6-deficient mice (or a wild-type littermate) were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (10% serum) with 5 ng/ml mouse M-CSF (R&D, Minneapolis, MN) and plated in a 10-cm dish overnight. The next day the floating cells were collected, washed, and seeded with 5% L929-MCSF conditioned medium in α-minimal essential medium (10% serum). When the density of monocytes was sufficient for the experiment, the cells were then infected as described above.Western Blotting, Immunoprecipitation, and in Vitro Kinase Assays—Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated as indicated in the figure legends and washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline. Depending on the experiment, cells were lysed in the following buffers: Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mg/ml aprotinin) or Buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Protein was measured on the clarified lysates, and equal protein was then processed for Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, or kinases assays as previously described (14Polek T.C. Talpaz M.

The incorporation of 32P into the substrate was quantitated with a PhosphorImager and represented as -fold activation compared with vector or time zero. Immunoprecipitation was carried out at 4 °C for 2-4 h with end-over-end rotation and washed three times in the indicated buffer followed by two washes in low salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). In some experiments, possible protein-protein interactions were prevented by immunoprecipitating in Buffer C (Buffer A with the addition of 0.1% SDS and 0.5% deoxycholate) or where indicated boiled in 1% SDS (50 μl) for 5 min followed by the addition of 1 ml of Buffer A, then centrifuged and re-immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibody. To prevent the de-ubiquitination of some proteins, cells were lysed in Buffer A or B containing 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide.RESULTSTRAF6 Ubiquitination Is Auto-catalyzed and Dependent on Its Own RING Domain and the E2 Enzyme Ubc13/Uev1A—The RING domain of TRAF6 is believed to bind to an E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme and catalyze poly-ubiquitination of itself and potential downstream targets. As a prelude to understanding the RING-dependent Ub ligase activity of TRAF6, we constructed a mutant TRAF6 in which the highly critical Cys residue in its RING domain was mutated to Ala (TRAF6-C70A). When expressed in HEK293 cells along with HA-Ub, FLAG-tagged TRAF6 immunoprecipitates showed strong ubiquitination by immunoblotting with anti-HA, whereas TRAF6-C70A was not ubiquitinated (Fig. 1A). Utilizing an in vitro ubiquitination assay, immunopurified TRAF6, but not TRAF6-C70A, catalyzed its own ubiquitination in the presence of E1 and the dimeric E2 complex Ubc13/Uev1A (Fig. 1B, left). The autoubiquitination of TRAF6 is Lys-63-linked, because an Ub mutant containing only Lys-63 also supported TRAF6 autoubiquitination (Fig. 1B, right). To eliminate the possibility that this TRAF6 ubiquitination was mediated by an Ub ligase activity co-precipitating with TRAF6 from HEK293 cells, we expressed and purified TRAF6 from bacteria, which lacks an Ub system, and examined its auto-ubiquitination activity. Recombinant GST-TRAF6, but not GST-TRAF6-C70A, caused its own ubiquitination in the presence of Ubc13/Uev1A (Fig. 1C). Inclusion of different Ub mutants in the ubiquitination assay further indicated that this in vitro auto-ubiquitination of TRAF6 occurred through Lys-63 of ubiquitin as ubiquitination with Ub-K48, Ub-K63R, or an Ub mutant lacking all lysine residues (Ub-KO) was not observed (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these data show that TRAF6 catalyzes its own Lys-63-linked ubiquitination in a manner that depends on its RING domain and Ubc13/Uev1A.An Intact RING Domain of TRAF6 Is Required for NF-κB Activation and Biological Signaling—We next asked whether the RING domain of TRAF6, which is required for its autoubiquitination, is also essential for TRAF6 to activate signaling in cells. Transient expression of TRAF6, but not TRAF6-C70A, in HEK293 cells activated an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter (Fig. 2A) and JNK activity (data not shown). Additionally, a catalytic mutant of Ubc13 (Ubc13-C87A) dose-dependently blocked TRAF6-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results suggest that auto-ubiquitination of TRAF6 in conjunction with Ubc13 is linked to its ability to activate downstream signaling pathways (8Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E.

A, the RING domain structure of TRAF6 is required for NF-κB activation. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with empty vector or with increasing amounts of FLAG-TRAF6 or FLAG-TRAF6-C70A together with an NF-κB-luciferase reporter. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were harvested for luciferase activity and processed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Expression of the transfected TRAF6 and TRAF6-C70A constructs was determined by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG. B, Ubc13-C87A blocks TRAF6-dependent NF-κB activation. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with empty vector or with increasing amounts of FLAG-Ubc13-C87A in the absence or presence of TRAF6 together with an NF-κB-luciferase reporter and processed essentially as described in A. Expression of the transfected TRAF6 and Ubc13-C87A constructs was determined by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG. C, TRAF6, but not TRAF6-C70A, induces spontaneous osteoclast differentiation. RAW cells (left panels) or mouse BMM (right panels) were infected with the indicated retrovirus as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Images were then captured with a 10×-objective lens for phase (bright field) and fluorescence (GFP), after which some of the samples were fixed and stained for TRAP. D, osteoclasts derived from TRAF6 infection resorb bone and form actin rings. For pit formation, infected RAW cells were seeded in 24-well plates containing dentine slices (ALPCO) and after 1 week, the dentine slices were processed for pit formation. Cells from TRAF6 infection were plated on glass coverslips, fixed, and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin and Hoechst. E, TRAF6, but not TRAF6-C70A, induces nuclear expression of NFATc1. Cells from C were harvested, and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared. Protein from the nuclear extracts (NE) was immunoblotted with anti-NFATc1, and then the membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-tubulin. Cytoplasmic extracts (CE) were immunoblotted with anti-FLAG, and then the membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because TRAF6 plays a pivotal role in osteoclast differentiation, we explored the biological function of the RING domain of TRAF6 to support osteoclastogenesis in an osteoclast progenitor cell type, RAW, and in primary mouse BMM. We first established that retroviral expression of TRAF6, but not TRAF6-C70A, in either RAW cells or mouse BMM induced spontaneous formation of multinucleated, TRAP-positive osteoclasts in the absence of RANKL (Fig. 2C). The osteoclasts formed by infecting with TRAF6 were functional based upon bone resorption and actin ring formation assays (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, expression of TRAF6, but not TRAF6-C70A, induced nuclear accumulation of NFATc1, a transcription factor important in terminal differentiation of osteoclast progenitors (21Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T. Inoue J. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Kodama T. Taniguchi T.

Taken together, these results indicate that an intact RING domain of TRAF6 is required for its auto-ubiquitination and to activate downstream components of the IKK and MAPK machinery, and, when TRAF6 is overexpressed in an osteoclast progenitor, the intact RING domain is required for osteoclast differentiation and function.Identification of Lys-124 as the Key Ubiquitin Lysine Acceptor Site on TRAF6—The TRAF6-C70A mutation abolished the ligase activity of TRAF6 and consequently its auto-ubiquitination and signaling capacity. To address the role of the autoubiquitination of TRAF6 and its ligase activity in signaling events, it is essential to map"

Here we identify procyanidins as the principal vasoactive polyphenols in red wine and show that they are present at higher concentrations in wines from areas of southwestern France and Sardinia, where traditional production methods ensure that these compounds are efficiently extracted during vinification. These regions also happen to be associated with increased longevity in the population."

Cell Sci. 2005;118, 5691-5698). Here, we investigate the migration of fluorescently labeled AQP4+/+ and AQP4-/- astroglia after implantation into mouse brains in which directional movement was stimulated by a planar stab wound 3 mm away from the axis of the injection needle. Two days after cell injection we determined the location, elongation ratio, and orientation of labeled cells. Migration of AQP4+/+ but not AQP4-/- cells toward the stab was greater than away from the stab. AQP4+/+ astroglia moved on average 1.5 mm toward the stab compared with 0.6 mm for AQP4-/- cells. More than 25% of the migrating AQP4+/+ cells but <3% of AQP4-/- cells appeared elongated (axial ratio>2.5). In transwell assays, AQP4+/+ astroglia migrated faster than AQP4-/- cells in a manner dependent on pore size. At 8 h, approximately 50% of AQP4+/+ cells migrated through 8-microm diameter pores, whereas equivalent migration of AQP4-/- cells was found for 12-microm diameter pores. These results provide in vivo evidence for AQP4-dependent astroglial migration and suggest that modulation of AQP4 expression or function might alter glial scarring."

Proteomic analyses of LBs purified from human monocytic U937 cells detected, common to LBs in other cells, proteins involved in cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism, Rab GTPases, and many membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated proteins. Newly lipid body (LB)-associated proteins included MRP-14, potentially involved in arachidonate transport, and ribosomal subunit proteins and translation regulatory proteins. Ultrastructurally, in U937 cells as well as human neutrophils and eosinophils, ribosomes are attached to and distributed within LBs, and LBs contain extensive ER-like membranes.

Recent studies show that hyperoxia-induced cell death involves apoptosis, necrosis, or mixed phenotypes depending on cell type, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using murine lung endothelial cells, we found that hyperoxia caused cell death by apoptosis involving both extrinsic (Fas-dependent) and intrinsic (mitochondria-dependent) pathways. Hyperoxia-dependent activation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway and formation of the death-inducing signaling complex required NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species production, because this process was attenuated by chemical inhibition, as well as by genetic deletion of the p47phox subunit, of the oxidase. Overexpression of heme oxygenase-1 prevented hyperoxia-induced cell death and cytochrome c release. Likewise, carbon monoxide, at low concentrations, markedly inhibited hyperoxia-induced endothelial cell death by inhibiting cytochrome c release and caspase-9/3 activation. Carbon monoxide, by attenuating hyperoxia-induced reactive oxygen species production, inhibited extrinsic apoptosis signaling initiated by death-inducing signal complex trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane and downstream activation of caspase-8. We also found that carbon monoxide inhibited the hyperoxia-induced activation of Bcl-2-related proteins involved in both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signaling. Carbon monoxide inhibited the activation of Bid and the expression and mitochondrial translocation of Bax, whereas promoted Bcl-XL/Bax interaction and increased Bad phosphorylation. We also show that carbon monoxide promoted an interaction of heme oxygenase-1 with Bax.

The clinical treatment of respiratory failure often requires supplemental oxygen therapy. Prolonged exposure to an elevated oxygen tension (hyperoxia) in animal models causes acute and chronic lung injury that resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome. In rodent models, hyperoxia triggers an extensive inflammatory response in the lung that degrades the alveolar-capillary barrier, leading to impaired gas exchange and pulmonary edema (1Horowitz S.

Apoptosis signaling pathways play an important role in hyperoxia-induced lung cell death, regardless of whether the final phenotypic outcome resembles apoptosis or necrosis (10Wang X. Ryter S.W.

Mitochondria play key roles in directing the fate of cells by maintaining the cellular levels of ATP and by releasing apoptogenic factors upon cellular stimulation with pro-apoptotic signals. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins act as critical regulators of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Antiapoptotic members of this family, such as Bcl-XL, localize to the outer membrane of the mitochondria, whereas pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bax and Bid translocate to the mitochondria upon cellular stimulation with diverse agents. Bax forms channels upon assimilating into the mitochondria, thus increasing outer mitochondrial membrane permeability and thereby facilitating the release of cytochrome c and other proapoptotic molecules from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (11Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 12Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S Eskes R Martinou J.C. Biochem.

Alternatively, hyperoxia may directly cause irreversible mitochondrial damage, also leading to increases in mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (14Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Once released to the cytosol, cytochrome c forms an apoptosome complex with Apaf-1, which activates caspase-9 and, in turn, its downstream caspase-3, resulting in the morphological features of apoptosis (15Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the extrinsic apoptotic pathway initiates when a death ligand, such as the Fas ligand (FasL), interacts with its cell surface receptor (i.e. Fas), forming a death-inducing signal complex (DISC) (16Walsh C.M. Luhrs K.A. Arechiga A.F. J. Clin. Immunol. 2003; 23: 333-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Activation of Fas triggers its oligomerization and the rapid recruitment of FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein) and caspase-8. Activated caspase-8 subsequently cleaves Bid into truncated Bid (tBid), which translocates from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane, where it assists in Bax activation (16Walsh C.M. Luhrs K.A.

Physiol. 1999; 276: L688-L694PubMed Google Scholar), but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. CO occurs in nature as a product of the combustion of organic materials. CO also arises endogenously in cells and tissues as a product of heme oxygenase (HO) activity, which degrades heme to biliverdin-IXα and ferrous iron (19Tenhunen R. Marver H. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HO-1, the inducible form of HO, responds to transcriptional up-regulation by multiple forms of cellular stress. HO-1 confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo (20Ryter S.W. Alam J. Choi A.M. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 583-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar).

Additionally, CO inhibited plasma membrane DISC formation by attenuating ROS production and preventing DISC trafficking from the Golgi apparatus. We describe for the first time the occurrence of an interaction between HO-1 with Bax that is enhanced by CO treatment and that suggests a novel antiapoptotic mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Reagents—Antibodies anti-Bax, anti-Bid, anti-caspase-8, anti-caspase-9, anti-cytochrome c, anti-Fas, and protein A-agarose were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Bax 6A7 antibody was purchased from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-p110 was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Anti-heme oxygenase-1 was from Stressgen (Vancouver, Canada). The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay kit was from Roche Applied Science. Apocyanin and diphenyleneiodoniun were from Calbiochem. Digitonin and all other chemicals were from Sigma.Animals—The mice were acclimated for 1 week with rodent chow and water ad libitum. The animals were housed according to guidelines from the American Association for Laboratory Animal Care and Research Protocols and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine). C57BL/6 wild type mice and p47phox–/– mice (C57BL/6 background) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and used for preparation of endothelial cells as described below.Isolation and Culture of Murine Lung Endothelial Cells—The isolation of mouse lung endothelial cells (MLEC) by an immunobead protocol has been reported elsewhere (30Wang X. Zhou Y. Kim H.P. Song R. Zarnegar R. Ryter S.W. Choi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5237-5243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse lungs were digested in collagenase and filtered through 100-μm cell strainers, centrifuged, and washed twice with medium. Cell suspensions were incubated with a monoclonal antibody (rat anti-mouse) against platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice to remove unbound antibody and resuspended in a binding buffer containing washed magnetic beads coated with sheep anti-rat immunoglobulin G. Attached cells were washed four to five times in culture medium and then digested with trypsin/EDTA to detach the beads. Bead-free cells were centrifuged and resuspended for culture. After two passages, the cells were incubated with fluorescent-labeled diacetylated low density lipoprotein, which is only absorbed by endothelial cells and macrophages, and sorted to homogeneity by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.Cell Culture and Treatments—The MLEC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 6.32 g/liter Hepes, and 3.3 ml of endothelial cell growth supplements in humidified incubators at 37 °C. For adenoviral infections, the cells were grown to 30% confluence and changed to serum-free medium containing 106 plaque-forming units/ml of an adenoviral vector inserted with lacZ, or ho-1. Infected cells were incubated for 3 h and then restored to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for an additional 2 days of incubation. For hyperoxia treatment, the MLEC were grown to 95% confluence, changed to fresh medium, and transferred to a COY anaerobic chamber (COY Laboratory Products, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) containing a hyperoxic atmosphere (95% O2 and 5% CO2) in the absence or presence of CO (250 ppm). Control cells were cultured in standard tissue culture conditions (95% room air, 5% CO2).LDH Release Assay—LDH release was measured using a commercially available assay (cytotoxicity detection kit; Roche Applied Science). After gentle agitation, 200 μl of medium was removed at various times to be used for the assay. The samples were incubated (30 min) with buffer containing NAD+, lactate, and tetrazolium. LDH converts lactate to pyruvate generating NADH. The NADH then reduces tetrazolium (yellow) to formazan (red), which was detected by absorbance at 490 nm. Additionally, the percentage of cell death was determined by exclusion of trypan blue.ROS Measurement by DCFDA Fluorescence—The formation of ROS in MLEC was determined by the DCFDA fluorescence method (6Parinandi N.L. Kleinberg M.A. Usatyuk P.V. Cummings R.J. Pennathur A. Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. Garcia J.G. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L26-L38Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). MLEC were loaded with 10 μm DCFDA for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 environment. At the end of the incubation, the medium containing DCFDA was aspirated, and the cells were washed once in media. After the addition of 5 ml of growth media, the cultures were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2, 5% CO2) for 3 h in the absence or presence of CO (250 ppm). At the end of exposure to hyperoxia, the cultures were scraped on ice, and the resulting cell suspensions were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The medium was aspirated, and the cell pellet was washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then sonicated on ice with a probe sonicator at a setting of 5 for 15 s in 500 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to prepare cell lysates. The fluorescence of oxidized DCFDA in cell lysates, an index of formation of ROS, was measured on an Aminco Bowman series-2 spectrofluorometer at 490/530-nm excitation/emission, using appropriate blanks. The extent of ROS formation was expressed in arbitrary fluorescence units.Cell Fractionation—Cellular fractionation was performed essentially as previously described (31Wang X. Zhang J. Kim H.P. Wang Y. Choi A.M. Ryter S.W. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1826-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For mitochondrial isolation, at various times after exposure to hypoxia, MLEC were harvested in 0.05% of digitonin in extraction buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μl/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The cell extracts were spun at 700 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were moved to new tubes and then centrifuged again at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatants (cytosol) and the pellets were retained for Western blotting.For plasma membrane isolation, the homogenates of the cells in MBS (25 mm 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100 were adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose prepared in MBS and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–30% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above (4 ml of 5% sucrose, 4 ml of 30% sucrose, both in MBS lacking detergent) and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 18 h in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). A band at the interface of 5 and 30% sucrose was collected and used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting.The Golgi complex was isolated using sucrose density gradient centrifugation, as described elsewhere (31Wang X. Zhang J. Kim H.P. Wang Y. Choi A.M. Ryter S.W. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1826-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were harvested in G buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) containing 10 mm CaCl2 and protease inhibitors. The cells were disrupted with 20 strokes in a Potter-type homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was discarded. The resulting post nuclear supernatant was harvested, and the sucrose concentration was adjusted to a final concentration of 1.4 m. This suspension was loaded onto the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid in succession with 1.2, 1.0, and 0.8 m sucrose in G buffer. The samples were then centrifuged at 95,000 × g for 2.5 h. Two bands from the top, representing 0.8/1.0 and 1.0/1.2 m interfaces were carefully removed, diluted with G buffer without sucrose, collected by centrifugation at 80,000 × g for 30 min, and used for the experiments. Golgi fraction purity was assessed by enzymatic activity and immunoblotting methods as previously described (31Wang X. Zhang J. Kim H.P. Wang Y. Choi A.M. Ryter S.W. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1826-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—The proteins were isolated from MLEC cultures in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μl/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). For immunoprecipitation, 1 μg of antibody (anti-Fas, anti-6A7, anti-Bax, or anti-phosphoserine) was added to 500 μg of total protein in 500 μl, rotated for 2 h at 4°C, and then incubated with 20 μl of beads (protein A-sucrose; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h, spun down at 500 × g, and washed three times with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer. Then 20 μl of loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) was added. For SDS-PAGE, protein samples at the indicated and equal amounts were boiled in the loading buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk and stained with the primary antibodies for 2 h at the optimal concentrations. After five washes in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween 20, the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was applied, and the blot was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences).Caspase Activity Assays—Caspase-3 fluorogenic substrate, Ac-DEVD-AFC and caspase-8 fluorogenic substrate, and Ac-IETD-AFC were from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Caspase activity in cell lysates was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions, using an Aminco Bowman series-2 spectrofluorometer (440/500-nm excitation/emission), and expressed as arbitrary fluorescence units.Statistical Analysis—All of the values are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSHO-1 and CO Inhibit Hyperoxic MLEC Death—MLEC were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2, 5% CO2) in vitro and then monitored for hyperoxia-induced toxicity by assaying LDH in the supernatants. Hyperoxia caused a time-dependent cell death in MLEC as determined by viability and LDH release assays, evident at 24 h, which increased until 72 h of exposure (Fig. 1, A and B). Hyperoxia caused the time-dependent release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and corresponding increase in cytosolic cytochrome c levels in MLEC (Fig. 1C).Overexpression of HO-1 by infection with ho-1 containing adenovirus inhibited hyperoxia-induced cell death, as assessed by cell viability and LDH release assays (Fig. 1, A and B), relative to LacZ-infected cells. Furthermore, ho-1 infection dramatically decreased cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and corresponding accumulation in the cytosol (Fig. 1C). Because many of the effects of HO-1 expression can be duplicated by the exogenous application of CO and vice versa, we also tested the effect of CO on hyperoxia-induced cell death.The presence of CO at a concentration of 250 ppm in the hyperoxic environment significantly inhibited hyperoxia-induced cell death and LDH release (Fig. 2, A and B). The presence of CO (250 ppm) inhibited hyperoxia-dependent cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and its corresponding accumulation in the cytosol (Fig. 2C). We also examined the effect of CO on the hyperoxia-dependent execution of executioner caspases. CO inhibited hyperoxia-dependent caspase-9 activation (Fig. 2D) in MLEC. Finally, CO inhibited the time-dependent activation of caspase-3 during hyperoxic treatment of MLEC (Fig. 2E).FIGURE 2CO protected against hyperoxia-induced cell death. MLEC were cultured under 95% air/5% CO2 (normoxia), or 95% O2, 5% CO2 (hyperoxia) in the absence or presence of CO (250 ppm) for the times indicated. Viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion (A). Supernatants were analyzed by LDH release assay (B). Cytosolic or mitochondrial fractions were prepared from total lysates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The indicated fractions were subjected to immunoblotting (IB) to detect cytochrome c (C) or caspase-9 (D). The lysates were also assayed for caspase-3 activity (E). Western results are representative of three experiments. β-Actin served as the loading standard. The data represent the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CO Inhibits the Extrinsic Apoptotic Pathway—We tested the hypothesis that the antiapoptotic effects of CO during hyperoxic stress involve the inhibition of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. MLEC were exposed to hyperoxia for various periods of time in the absence or presence of CO (250 ppm). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Fas followed by immunoblotting with caspase-8 to detect DISC formation. Exposure of MLEC to hyperoxia induced time-dependent DISC formation associated with the recruitment of pro-caspase-8 to Fas, the cleavage of pro-caspase-8, and the appearance of caspase-8 activity (Fig. 3A). The presence of CO during the hyperoxia treatment decreased the DISC formation and delayed the cleavage of caspase-8 (Fig. 3A). We also examined cellular signaling events upstream of DISC formation in response to hyperoxia. Previously, several investigations have demonstrated interactions between Fas and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation of Fas by EGFR as a prerequisite for Fas plasma membrane trafficking and DISC formation (32Eberle A.

Using a transgenic mouse model, we here demonstrate that protein misfolding, detected with the use of tissue-type plasminogen activator and thioflavin T, markers of amyloid-like properties, results in breaking of tolerance. In wild-type mice, misfolding enhances protein immunogenicity. Several commercially available biopharmaceutical products were found to contain misfolded proteins. In some cases, the level of misfolded protein was found to increase upon storage under conditions prescribed by the manufacturer. Our results indicate that misfolding of therapeutic proteins is an immunogenic signal and a risk factor for immunogenicity.

Over the past decades, the use of therapeutic proteins has become common practice in medicine and as their use is very promising, many more biopharmaceuticals are under development (1Pavlou A.K.

Unfortunately, a major drawback of protein therapeutics is the risk of antibody formation (3Schellekens H. Nat. Rev.

For example, drug-induced neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin (EPO) 3The abbreviations used are: EPO, erythropoietin; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; ThT, thioflavin T; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; rhIFNα2b, human recombinant interferon α2b. 3The abbreviations used are: EPO, erythropoietin; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; ThT, thioflavin T; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; rhIFNα2b, human recombinant interferon α2b. result in pure red cell aplasia (9Bunn H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 522-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas drug-induced acquired anti-factor VIII (fVIII) antibodies worsen the pathology associated with hemophilia (10Goudemand J.

As more and more recombinant therapeutic proteins become licensed for marketing, the incidence of immunogenicity problems is expected to rise. Initially, when mainly proteins from animal origin were used for therapy, it was thought that their foreign (non-self) nature was the main cause of immunogenicity. Unexpectedly, however, both human plasma derived as well as recombinant human protein therapeutics such as EPO (11Casadevall N. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2002; 17: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and fVIII (12Oldenburg J. Schroder J. Brackmann H.H. Muller-Reible C. Schwaab R. Tuddenham E. Semin. Hematol. 2004; 41: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) also elicit immune responses. This suggests that the molecular characteristic evoking antibody responses is at least more complex than being self or non-self to the human immune system. Several additional factors contributing to immunogenicity have been proposed, including contaminants or impurities, protein aggregation (13Braun A. Kwee L. Labow M.A. Alsenz J. Pharmacol. Res. 1997; 14: 1472-1478Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar), chemical degradation and protein modification, such as differences in glycosylation or oxidation (14Wang W. Int. J.

Protein misfolding is an intrinsic and problematic property of proteins, which underlies a variety of degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease. These diseases are characterized by the occurrence of fibrillar deposits, classically termed amyloid, containing aggregates of misfolded proteins. Whereas the term amyloid is classically used to classify these fibrillar deposits, aggregation of proteins, irrespective of amino acid sequence, results in formation of amyloid-like properties with similar common features (16Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). Amyloid can be defined histochemically by affinity for amyloid-specific dyes, but also morphologically when 6–10-nm filaments are seen by microscopy. X-ray diffraction experiments can confirm the presence of cross-β structure, a structural element characteristic for amyloid. We have reported that amyloid proteins, positive for the amyloid markers described above, also are able to bind and activate tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in vitro (17Bouma B. Kroon-Batenburg L.M. Wu Y.P. Brunjes B. Posthuma G. Kranenburg O. de Groot P.G. Voest E.E. Gebbink M.F. J. Biol.

Concomitantly, it has been reported that denatured protein aggregates have the same capacity, whereas native proteins do not bind tPA (19Galantai R. Modos K. Fidy J. Kolev K. Machovich R. Biochem.

Amyloids and proteins with amyloid-like properties activate the immune system, which can lead to the formation of (auto-) antibodies (30Gruden M.A. Davudova T.B. Malisauskas M. Zamotin V.V.

Because protein misfolding is an intrinsic problematic propensity of proteins we hypothesized that protein misfolding processes in general could underlie immunogenicity of biopharmaceuticals. We investigated whether the common structural features of misfolded therapeutic proteins are detectable by markers for amyloid formation. We exposed biopharmaceuticals to denaturing conditions and investigated markers for amyloid formation in the preparations. Moreover, we analyzed several purchased biopharmaceuticals for the presence of misfolded proteins using these common markers for amyloid properties. Both experiments pointed out that biopharmaceuticals, like any other protein, are amyloidogenic and that misfolding, detected by amyloid markers, takes place in several preparations. These markers, however, are not necessarily specific for fibrillar amyloid, but also for smaller misfolded protein species. Next, we tested the main hypothesis that misfolded protein, detectable by these amyloid markers, is causative for increased risk of having immune reactions against biopharmaceuticals. We compared the immunogenicity of experimentally misfolded protein solutions to control solutions, containing native protein. The titer of antibody responses against the native protein was taken as a measure for immunogenicity. Although further study is required to identify the exact immunogenic misfolded species that mediates this mechanism, our experiments confirmed the hypothesis that misfolding leads to biopharmaceutical immunogenicity. Fluorescence of Thioflavin T (ThT; Sigma, T-3516) and Congo Red (Aldrich Chemical Company Inc.) was measured on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 435 nm and emission wavelength of 485 nm for ThT and an excitation wavelength of 550 nm and emission wavelength of 595 nm. Five μl of the various protein solutions were diluted in either 1 ml of 25 μm ThT in 50 mm glycine buffer, pH 9.0, or 1 ml of 25 μm Congo Red in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was measured in triplicate with an integration time of 5 s per reading. Background fluorescence of both protein in buffer and dye solution were subtracted from the total fluorescence signal. Five μg/ml of aggregated amyloid β (Aβ “dutch type” E22Q, residues 1–40; DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVV, produced by Peptide Synthesis Facility of the Dutch Cancer Institute NKI) was used as a positive control in all fluorescence assays. This positive control was prepared by dissolving lyophilized Aβ peptide at 50 mg/ml in a 1:1 mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol. After evaporating the solvent, the pellet was resuspended at 10 mg/ml in H2O and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Nunc Immobilizer plates (Nalge Nunc, number 436013) were coated with 50 μl containing 5 μg/ml of sample protein (unless indicated otherwise) in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, 0.05% (m/v) NaN3 for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.2, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and blocked with PBS containing 1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed twice with TBST and incubated, in duplicate, with a concentration series of either tPA (Actilyse, Alteplase; Boehringer-Ingelheim, Alkmaar, The Netherlands) or a truncated form of tPA (Reteplase; Rapilysin, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim Germany), lacking the amyloid binding domain, diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). Incubations were performed for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of 10 mm ϵ-amino caproic acid. ϵ-Amino caproic acid is a lysine analogue and is used to avoid potential binding of tPA to lysine-containing ligands via its kringle2 domain. Plates were washed five times with TBST and incubated with antibody 374b α-tPA (American Diagnostica, Instrumentation Laboratory, Breda, The Netherlands) diluted 1:1000 in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed five times with TBST and incubated with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulins (RAMPO; DAKOCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:3000 in PBST for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were washed five times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and stained with 100 μl/well of tetramethylbenzidine substrate (BIOSOURCE Europe, Nivelles, Belgium). The reaction was terminated with 50 μl/well of 2 m H2SO4 and substrate conversion was read at 450 nm on a Spectramax340 microplate reader. Curves were fitted with a one-site binding model (GraphPad Prism version 4.02 for Windows, Graphpad Software) from which Kd and Bmax were determined. Exiqon Peptide Immobilizer plates were blocked for 1 h with PBS, 1% Tween 20 and rinsed twice with distilled water. The conversion of the chromogenic substrate S-2251 (Chromogenix, Italy) by plasmin was kinetically measured at 37 °C on a Spectramax 340 microplate reader at a wavelength of 405 nm. The assay mixture contained 400 pm tPA, 100 μg/ml plasminogen (purified from human plasma), and 415 μm S-2251 in HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Denatured γ-globulins (100 μg/ml) with amyloid-like structure was used as reference and positive control. Lyophilized γ-globulins (Sigma) were dissolved in a 1:1 volume ratio of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol and trifluoroacetic acid and subsequently dried under air. Dried γ-globulins were dissolved in H2O to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and kept at room temperature for at least 3 days and subsequently stored at –20 °C. Maximal tPA activating capacity was determined from the linear increase seen in each activation curve and expressed as a percentage of the standardized positive control. To confirm tPA dependence of plasmin generation, all samples were assayed for their ability to convert plasminogen into plasmin in the absence of tPA. Protein therapeutics were obtained from the local hospital pharmacy and analyzed within the expiry limits as stated by the manufacturers. Five μl of the various protein therapeutics were tested for their ability to enhance both ThT and Congo Red fluorescence. tPA activating capacity of the protein therapeutics was determined in 1:10 diluted samples (unless indicated otherwise). tPA binding ELISAs were performed by coating protein therapeutics 1:10 in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, 0.05% (m/v) NaN3. To mimic accelerated stability testing several therapeutics were exposed to denaturing conditions and assayed for amyloid-like properties before and after treatment by tPA activation assay at 100 μg/ml protein and ThT fluorescence enhancement assay at 25 μg/ml protein. For this purpose, 5 mg/ml glucagon (Glucagen; Novo Nordisk Farma B.V., Alphen aan de Rijn, The Netherlands) was incubated at 37 °C in 0.01 m HCl for 48 h. One mg/ml Etanercept (Enbrel; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals B.V., Hoofddorp, The Netherlands) in 67 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, was gradually heated from 30 to 85 °C over a period of 12 min and afterward cooled to 4 °C for 5 min, this treatment was repeated 4 times. Abciximab (Reopro; Centocor B.V., Leiden, The Netherlands) and Infliximab (Remicade; Schering-Plough B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands) were incubated at 65 °C for 16 and 72 h, respectively. A detailed description of the composition of these biopharmaceuticals is listed in supplemental Table 1. Unformulated human recombinant interferon α2b (rhIFNα2b; kindly provided by Alfa Wasserman, Italy) was incubated at 300 μg/ml with 4 mm ascorbic acid, 40 μm CuCl2 for 3 h at room temperature, buffered by 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. This method for metal-catalyzed oxidation has been reported to result in oxidation of methionine residues in rhIFNα2b (32Hermeling S. Aranha L. Damen J.M. Slijper M. Schellekens H. Crommelin D.J.

The reaction was stopped with 1 mm EDTA and dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of PBS. For testing of dose-dependent immune reactivity toward amyloid-like properties in rhIFNα2b, mixtures of unmodified rhIFNα2b and oxidized rhIFNα2b were prepared containing 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% oxidized rhIFNα2b (total protein concentration of rhIFNα2b was equal in all samples). A solution of 1 mg/ml ovalbumin (Sigma) in 67 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, was gradually heated from 30 to 85 °C over a period of 12 min and afterward cooled on ice. The animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee. Wild type BALB/c and FVB/N mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and housed at the Central Laboratory Animal Institute (Utrecht University, The Netherlands). Food (Hope Farms, Woerden, The Netherlands) and water (acidified) were available ad libitum. Human IFNα2b transgenic mice were bred from a wild-type FVB/N strain. Groups of 5 mice received 10μg of the different rhIFNα2b preparations subcutaneously on days 0–4, 7–11, and 14–18. Groups of 5 wild-type female BALB/c mice (7–9 weeks old) received 10 μg of the different ovalbumin preparations subcutaneously on days 0–4, 7–11, and 14–18. Blood was taken from the vena saphena on days 0, 7, and 14 just before injection of the interferon or ovalbumin preparations, and on day 21. The blood samples were incubated on ice for 2 h. Sera were collected after centrifugation, stored at –20 °C, and analyzed later for the presence of anti-rhIFNα2b or anti-ovalbumin antibodies by ELISA. rhIFNα2b—Sera were analyzed for IgG antibodies against native rhIFNα2b, coated in microtiter plates. Microlon high-binding 96-well plates were coated with 100 μl of native rhIFNα2b (2 μg/ml in PBS) per well for 1 h. The wells were drained and washed 4 times with 300 μl of PBST. After washing, the wells were carefully tapped dry on a tissue. Wells were blocked by incubating with 200 μl of 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. The wells were drained and washed 2 times with 300 μl of PBST. After the last wash, wells were carefully tapped dry on a tissue. Sera (diluted 100-fold with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS) were added to the wells and the plates were incubated for 1 h. The plates were washed 4 times with 300 μlof PBST. After the last wash, wells were carefully tapped dry on a tissue. Because most immunogenicity problems of biopharmaceuticals are mediated by neutralizing the IgG, we chose to measure IgG titers against rhIFNα2b. Peroxidase-labeled antimouse IgG (Sigma) was added to the wells and the plates were incubated for 1 h. Plates were drained and washed 4 times with 300 μl of PBST and twice with 300 μl of PBS. After the last wash, wells were carefully tapped dry on a tissue. ABTS (2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) substrate (Roche) was added and the absorbance was recorded after 30 min on a Novapath microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at 415 nm and a reference wavelength of 490 nm. All incubations were in covered plates at room temperature with constant orbital shaking. Sera were defined positive when the absorbance of the 1:100 dilution minus the background was 3 times higher than the average absorbance value of the pretreatment sera minus the background. Antibody titers of the positive sera were determined by adding the sera in 3-fold serial dilutions (starting from 1:10) to plates coated with native rhIFNα2b. The other steps of the ELISA procedure were as described above and the absorbance values were plotted against log dilution. Curves were fitted with a sigmoidal curve (GraphPad Prism version 4.02 for Windows, Graphpad software). The dilution needed to obtain 50% of the maximum absorbance was taken as the titer of the serum. Ovalbumin—Sera were analyzed for antibodies against native ovalbumin coated in microtiter plates. Microlon high-binding 96-well plates (Greiner, Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands) were coated with 50 μl of native ovalbumin (5 μg/ml in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, 0.05% NaN3) per well for 1 h. Then the wells were drained and washed 2 times with 300 μl of PBST. After washing, the wells were tapped dry on a tissue. Wells were blocked by incubating with 200 μlof1× Roche blocking reagent (Roche) in PBS for 1 h. The wells were drained and washed twice with 300 μl of PBST. After the last wash, wells were tapped dry on a tissue. Antibody titers were determined by adding pooled sera of each experimental group (n = 5) in 3-fold serial dilutions (starting from 1:10, 50 μl/well) to plates coated with native ovalbumin. The plates were washed 4 times with 300 μl of PBST. After the last wash, wells were tapped dry on a tissue. RAMPO, diluted 1:3000 in PBST, was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. Plates were drained and washed 4 times with 300 μl of PBST and twice with 300 μl of PBS. After the last wash, wells were tapped dry on a tissue. The plates were stained for ∼5 min using 100 μl/well of tetramethylbenzidine substrate (BIOSOURCE Europe, Nivelles, Belgium), the reaction was stopped with 50 μl/well of 2 m H2SO4 and read at 450 nm on a Spectramax340 microplate reader. Analysis of obtained data were performed as described above. Various Biopharmaceuticals Display Amyloid-like Properties upon Exposure to Conditions of Stress, Indicating Protein Misfolding—During manufacturing and storage, biopharmaceuticals may also become exposed to various conditions of stress that can potentially underlie protein misfolding and the formation of amyloid-like properties. To mimic stability testing we examined whether exposure of biopharmaceuticals to conditions of stress, such as low pH or heat, induced amyloid-like properties. Fig. 1 shows that amyloid-like properties are adopted by Etanercept, Glucagon, Abciximab, and Infliximab upon exposure to these harsh denaturing conditions. Thus, like any protein, biopharmaceuticals can adopt common amyloid-like properties during misfolding and this phenomenon can be enhanced upon storage or under conditions of stress. The Presence of Misfolded Protein with Amyloid-like Properties in Various Biopharmaceuticals—Next, we examined whether proteins with amyloid-like properties are present in marketed biopharmaceuticals. As indicators for amyloid-like properties we measured the fluorescence of ThT, Congo Red, and binding and activation of tPA, all qualitative measures for the presence of amyloid cross-β structure conformation in proteins in solution (17Bouma B. Kroon-Batenburg L.M. Wu Y.P. Brunjes B. Posthuma G. Kranenburg O. de Groot P.G. Voest E.E. Gebbink M.F. J. Biol.

As shown in Table 1, several biopharmaceuticals showed significant potential to enhance fluorescence of thioflavin T and/or Congo Red, indicating the presence of amyloid-like structure. These biopharmaceuticals also bound tPA with high affinity and activated tPA-mediated plasminogen activation. These findings indicate that misfolded proteins with amyloid-like properties are present in various marketed therapeutic proteins.TABLE 1The presence of misfolded protein with amyloid-like properties in various biopharmaceuticalsTherapeutic proteinFluorescencetPA bindingtPA activation (maximum activation)ThTCongo RedBmax (OD450 nm)KdA.U. ± S.D.nm%AlbuminaPlasma purified drug products.1970 ± 5978 ± 21.22811.2247.67Somatropin1317 ± 10429 ± 20.93699.048113.95Insulin zinc suspension387 ± 7279 ± 60.7558105.417.44Insulin aspart172 ± 381 ± 23.617694.770.93Factor VIIIaPlasma purified drug products.306 ± 12290 ± 60.5398229.84.22Abciximab8 ± 825 ± 10.5329216.30Epoietin Alfa14 ± 219 ± 3NDbND, not determined.ND0Etanercept23 ± 3NDNDND0Infliximab19 ± 167 ± 2NDND0γ-GlobulinaPlasma purified drug products.25 ± 20 ± 1NDNDNDGlucagon48 ± 1NDNDND11.25a Plasma purified drug products.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Storage Increases the Level of Misfolded Protein in Biopharmaceuticals—Most protein pharmaceuticals can be stored for prolonged periods of time without losing their bioactivity. However, because proteins have the intrinsic propensity to loose their unique native structure, some fraction of proteins may gradually loose their structure and degrade. We examined the effect of storage on the level of protein with amyloid-like structure in a number of biopharmaceuticals, i.e. insulin, human albumin, and somatropin, proteins previously known to be able to form aggregates or amyloid under certain conditions. Fig. 2 shows that the level of protein with amyloid-like properties increases when these biopharmaceuticals were examined closer to their expiration date. These findings show that protein misfolding is time-dependent in biopharmaceuticals, when measured by elevated markers for amyloid structure. Immunogenicity of Misfolded IFNα2b—We then examined whether a biopharmaceutical solution, containing misfolded protein, could trigger antibody formation and break tolerance. We chose to use metal-catalyzed oxidized rhIFNα2b as a model protein because it is known that this modification induces unfolding and aggregation of rhIFNα2b, which correlates with its immunogenicity (32Hermeling S. Aranha L. Damen J.M. Slijper M. Schellekens H. Crommelin D.J. Jiskoot W. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2005; 22: 1997-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 33Hermeling S. Schellekens H. Maas C. Gebbink M.F. Crommelin D.J. Jiskoot W. J. Pharm. Sci. 2006; 95: 1084-1096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, oxidation of rhIFNα2b induces amyloid-like properties as exemplified by the finding that oxidized rhIFNα2b greatly enhances ThT fluorescence, and facilitates the binding and activation of tPA. Native rhIFNα2b does not enhance ThT fluorescence and hardly binds or activates tPA (Fig. 3, A-C, respectively). These findings indicate that oxidation of rhIFNα2b induces amyloid-like properties, which is indicative for protein misfolding. The generation of IgG antibodies in wild-type mice against a foreign antigen (rhIFNα2b) was found to be significantly accelerated when oxidized rhIFNα2b with amyloid-like properties was injected, compared with the native protein (Fig. 3D). In contrast, mice transgenic for rhIFNα2b remained tolerant to native protein (Fig. 3E). In hIFNα2b transgenic mice injected with rhIFNα2b with amyloid-like properties, tolerance was broken and a potent IgG response was induced (Fig. 3E). These findings strongly indicate that protein misfolding, detectable by markers for amyloid, induces an immune response. Next, we examined whether the immunogenic potential of rhIFNα2b was dependent on the level of misfolded rhIFNα2b with amyloid-like properties. We injected mice transgenic for hIFNα2b with preparations in which native and oxidized rhIFNα2b were mixed to obtain varying doses of protein with amyloid-like properties. ThT and tPA-activating potential of the mixtures was determined and found to be gradually increased (Fig. 4, A and B). Again, in mice injected with solely unmodified rhIFNα2b no breaking of tolerance was observed (Fig. 4C). In mice injected with increasing doses of rhIFNα2b with amyloid-like properties, both the number of mice in which tolerance was broken rose from 2 to al l5 and their respective antibody titers were increased from a mean IgG titer of 22 to a titer of more than 230 (Fig. 4C). These observations demonstrate that immune responses against misfolded proteins, with amyloid-like properties, are dependent on the extent of protein misfolding that has occurred in a sample. This concentration effect was found to influence both the magnitude of raised antibody titers and incidence of tolerance breaking. Besides formation of misfolded protein, oxidation of proteins also leads to modification of amino acids. To investigate whether immunogenicity could be induced by a misfolded protein with amyloid-like properties in the absence of amino acid modifications, we used ovalbumin, an immunological model protein, that has been shown to form amyloid-type cross-β structure after gradual heating (35Azakami H. Mukai A. Kato A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2005; 53: 1254-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As expected, the gradual heating of ovalbumin in solution led to both large increases in the enhancement of ThT fluorescence (Fig. 5) and increased in the capacity to activate tPA (Fig. 5B). Mice immunized with this heat-denatured ovalbumin developed 2 weeks after immunization with a 5-fold higher general antibody titer, compared with mice injected with freshly dissolved ovalbumin (Fig. 5C). This further indicates that immunogenicity is caused by common structural characteristics, i.e. amyloid-like properties, without the need of chemical protein modification. The advent of recombinant technology has enabled the large scale production of biopharmaceuticals, such as fVIII, EPO, IFN, and various monoclonal antibodies. The use of these biopharmaceuticals is very promising and the number of biopharmaceuticals is expected to rise rapidly (1Pavlou A.K. Reichert J.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1513-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the generation of antibodies against therapeutic proteins has posed a mystifying problem for biopharmaceutical manufacturers, medical practitioners, and scientists. We now show that adoption of generic amyloid-like properties, a hallmark for misfolded proteins, is a potential cause of drug-induced immunogenicity. So far, several seemingly unrelated factors have been described to influence biopharmaceutical immunogenicity. For instance, post-translational modifications such as oxidation, deamidation, and aggregation influence protein immunogenicity (14Wang W. Int. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 289: 1-30Crossref Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 15Shacter E. Drug Metab. Rev. 2000; 32: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Strikingly, specific modifications in formulations and packaging have also been correlated to biopharmaceutical immunogenicity (36Hermeling S. Schellekens H. Crommelin D.J. Jiskoot W. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2003; 20: 1903-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 37Boven K. Stryker S. Knight J. Thomas A. van Regenmortel M. Kemeny D.M. Power D. Rossert J. Casadevall N. Kidney Int. 2005; 67: 2346-2353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Most of these factors may influence the structural properties of a therapeutic protein molecule (23Nilsson M.R. Dobson C.M. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2637-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Ruiz L. Reyes N. Aroche K. Tolosa V. Simanca V. Rogriguez T. Hardy E. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 8: 207-216PubMed Google Scholar). Metal-catalyzed oxidation of rhIFNα2b was described to lead to increased immunogenicity (32Hermeling S. Aranha L. Damen J.M. Slijper M. Schellekens H. Crommelin D.J. Jiskoot W. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2005; 22: 1997-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We found that metalcatalyzed oxidation of rhIFNα2b resulted in a conformational change accompanied by adoption of amyloid-like properties, indicative for protein misfolding, that was far more immunogenic in vivo than its native counterpart and broke immune tolerance. We also found that, in general, biopharmaceuticals can have amyloid-like properties and that these properties can be induced upon storage or conditions of stress. These data indicate that misfolded proteins with amyloid-like properties can be responsible for enhanced immunogenicity of biopharmaceuticals and breaking of tolerance. Based on our results, we propose a unifying mechanism by which individual immunogenic factors, such as oxidation or formulation changes, via the formation of misfolded protein with common amyloid-like properties, ultimately lead to an (enhanced) immune response. Protein misfolding in biopharmaceutical solutions is expected to lead to a heterogeneous distribution of aggregates (39Soenderkaer S. Carpenter J.F. van de Weert M. Hansen L.L. Flink J. Frokjaer S. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2004; 21: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similarly, our preparations of misfolded rhIFNα2b and ovalbumin may very well contain multiple species of aggregates and protein in both native and misfolded conformations. However, once misfolding is induced, markers for amyloid increase and this dose-dependently correlates to the immunogenic potential of the preparation. Additional investigations are required to isolate the exact immunogenic misfolded protein species, but at present time it is difficult to predict and control the stability of fibrils and oligomeric species, especially in vivo. Hopefully, assays using antigen-presenting cells will help to answer this question and further elucidate the underlying mechanism. Our results point to a common mechanism by which the immune system perceives misfolded proteins. We hypothesize that this lies in the changed conformation of the protein backbone itself. This implies that the innate immune system may be activated by recognition of the amyloid-like properties of misfolded protein. Indeed, several cellular receptors for the amyloid-like protein fold have been identified: scavenger receptor A, CD36, receptor for advanced glycation end products, low density lipoprotein receptor-like protein, and scavenger receptor B type I (17Bouma B. Kroon-Batenburg L.M. Wu Y.P. Brunjes B. Posthuma G. Kranenburg O. de Groot P.G. Voest E.E. Gebbink M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41810-41819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Moreover, these receptors are expressed on dendritic cells and could initiate an immune response against these proteins (34Belz G.T. Vremec D. Febbraio M. Corcoran L. Shortman K. Carbone F.R. Heath W.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6066-6070Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38Ge J. Jia Q. Liang C. Luo Y. Huang D. Sun A. Wang K. Zou Y. Chen H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Drug formulation is an important factor in the development of biopharmaceuticals. This also affects immunogenicity, which, for example, has been observed with a specific formulation of EPO, that was far more immunogenic than its previous formulation (36Hermeling S. Schellekens H. Crommelin D.J. Jiskoot W. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2003; 20: 1903-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 37Boven K. Stryker S. Knight J. Thomas A. van Regenmortel M. Kemeny D.M. Power D. Rossert J. Casadevall N. Kidney Int. 2005; 67: 2346-2353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). One of the main problems in formulation development is maintaining protein stability, because chemical modification, adsorption, and most importantly, aggregation phenomena are generally difficult to prevent (14Wang W. Int. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 289: 1-30Crossref Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 29Frokjaer S. Otzen D.E. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that various biopharmaceuticals have a tendency to misfold, which may result in the generation of immunogenic proteins with amyloid-like properties in various drug products that are on the market. At this moment, it is difficult to predict those conditions that will preserve the native non-immunogenic fold of a protein pharmaceutical. Identification of conditions, compounds, excipients, and materials that induce amyloid-like properties in therapeutic proteins during production and/or storage may be valuable for improving the quality of biopharmaceuticals by reducing immunogenicity related adverse effects. Monitoring the formation of amyloid-like properties in a biopharmaceutical may even have predictive value toward pre-clinical determination of expiry dates for a drug, because it seems to be a marker for an immunogenic protein entity. Hereto, it is required to pinpoint the exact markers for amyloid-like properties that correlate best with immunogenicity and further develop sensitive and robust tools to detect these misfolded protein species. This may ultimately lead to development of better and safer drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2168169746,"Prohibitin (PHB) is an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed protein whose expression or function in intestinal diseases is not known. In this study, we examined the expression and role of PHB in oxidative stress associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Our results show that PHB primarily localizes to the mitochondria in intestinal epithelial cells. Its expression is down-regulated during active human Crohn's disease, experimental colitis in vivo, and oxidative stress in vitro. PHB overexpression increases the expression of glutathione-S-transferase pi and protects from oxidant-induced depletion of glutathione. Finally, PHB overexpression decreases accumulation of reactive oxygen metabolites, as well as increased permeability induced by oxidative stress in intestinal epithelial cells. Together, these results suggest that PHB constitutes a previously unrecognized cellular defense against oxidant injury. Thus, strategies to modulate PHB levels may constitute a novel therapeutic approach for intestinal inflammatory diseases, wherein oxidative stress plays a critical role in tissue injury and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1993124906,"It was recently reported that tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) improves Type 2 diabetes, possibly by decreasing insulin resistance. However, as both Type 2 and Type 1 diabetes are characterized by beta-cell dysfunction and death, we investigated whether imatinib counteracts diabetes by maintaining beta-cell function. We observed that imatinib counteracted diabetes in two animal models, the streptozotocin-injected mouse and the nonobese diabetes mouse, and that this was paralleled by a partial preservation of the beta-cell mass. In addition, imatinib decreased the death of human beta-cells in vitro when exposed to NO, cytokines, and streptozotocin. The imatinib effect was mimicked by siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Abl mRNA. Imatinib enhanced beta-cell survival by promoting a state similar to ischemic preconditioning, as evidenced by NF-kappaB activation, increased NO and reactive oxygen species production, and depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Imatinib did not suppress islet cell death in the presence of an NF-kappaB inhibitor, suggesting that NF-kappaB activation is a necessary step in the antiapoptotic action of imatinib. We conclude that imatinib mediates beta-cell survival and that this could contribute to the beneficial effects observed in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1980854377,"Nicotine has a therapeutic benefit in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study we show that nicotine decreases accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the cortex and hippocampus of APP (V717I) transgenic mice. Nicotine prevents activation of NF-kappaB and c-Myc by inhibiting the activation of MAP kinases (MAPKs). As a result, the activity of inducible NOS and the production of NO are down-regulated. RNA interference experiments show that the above nicotine-mediated process requires alpha7 nAChR. Nicotine decreases Abeta via the activation of alpha7nAChRs through MAPK, NF-kappaB, and c-myc pathways. Nicotine also inhibits apoptosis and cell cycle progression in this mouse line. The dissected signaling pathway of nicotine-mediated neuroprotection in the present study provides a mechanistic basis for the potential development of drug targets for treating AD."
https://openalex.org/W2027926046,"Plasma membrane potassium (K+) channels are required for cell proliferation. Evidence is growing that K+ channels play a central role in the development and growth of human cancer. Here we examine the contribution and the mechanism by which K+ channels control proliferation of T84 human colonic carcinoma cells. Numerous K+ channels are expressed in T84 cells, but only voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels influenced proliferation. A number of Kv channel inhibitors reduced DNA synthesis and cell number, without exerting apoptotic or toxic effects. Expression of several Kv channels, such as EagI, Kv 3.4 and Kv 1.5, was detected in patch clamp experiments and in fluorescence-based assays using a voltage sensitive dye. The contribution of EagI channels to proliferation was confirmed by siRNA, which abolished EagI activity and inhibited cell growth. Inhibition of Kv channels did not interfere with the ability of T84 cells to regulate their cell vol, but it restricted intracellular pH regulation. In addition, inhibitors of Kv channels, as well as siRNA for EagI, attenuated intracellular Ca2+ signaling. The data suggest that Kv channels control proliferation of colonic cancer cells by affecting intracellular pH and Ca2+ signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1973598278,"APOBEC3 proteins are cellular antiviral proteins that are targeted for proteasomal degradation by primate lentiviral Vif proteins. Vif acts as a substrate receptor for the Cullin5 (Cul5) E3 ubiquitin ligase, specifically interacting with Cul5 through a novel H-(x5)-C-(x17-18)-C-(x3-5)-H zinc binding motif. Using the membrane-permeable zinc chelator, N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN), we demonstrated a requirement for zinc for Vif function in vivo. Treatment with TPEN at an IC50 of 1.79 microM inhibits Cul5 recruitment and APOBEC3G (A3G) degradation. Zinc chelation prevented Vif function in infectivity assays, allowing the virus to become sensitive to the antiviral activity of A3G. Zinc chelation had no effect on cellular Cul5-SOCS3 E3 ligase assembly, suggesting that zinc-dependent E3 ligase assembly may be unique to HIV-1 Vif, representing a new target for novel drug design."
https://openalex.org/W1997808607,"Retina has long been considered less plastic than cortex or hippocampus, the very sites of experience-dependent plasticity. Now, we show that retinal development is responsive to the experience provided by an enriched environment (EE): the maturation of retinal acuity, which is a sensitive index of retinal circuitry development, is strongly accelerated in EE rats. This effect is present also in rats exposed to EE up to P10, that is before eye opening, suggesting that factors sufficient to trigger retinal acuity development are affected by EE during the first days of life. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is precociously expressed in the ganglion cell layer of EE with respect to non-EE rats and reduction of BDNF expression in EE animals counteracts EE effects on retinal acuity. Thus, EE controls the development of retinal circuitry, and this action depends on retinal BDNF expression."
https://openalex.org/W2164485346,"Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Its activity is carefully modulated in the synaptic cleft by glutamate transporters. The glial glutamate transporter EAAT2 is the main mediator of glutamate clearance. Reduced EAAT2 function could lead to accumulation of extracellular glutamate, resulting in a form of cell death known as excitotoxicity. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer disease, EAAT2 protein levels are significantly decreased in affected areas. EAAT2 mRNA levels, however, remain constant, indicating that alterations in EAAT2 expression are due to disturbances at the post-transcriptional level. In the present study, we found that some EAAT2 transcripts contained 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs) greater than 300 nucleotides. The mRNAs that bear long 5′-UTRs are often regulated at the translational level. We tested this possibility initially in a primary astrocyte line that constantly expressed an EAAT2 transcript containing the 565-nt 5′-UTR and found that translation of this transcript was regulated by many extracellular factors, including corticosterone and retinol. Moreover, many disease-associated insults affected the efficiency of translation of this transcript. Importantly, this translational regulation of EAAT2 occurred in vivo (i.e. both in primary cortical neurons-astrocytes mixed cultures and in mice). These results indicate that expression of EAAT2 protein is highly regulated at the translational level and also suggest that translational regulation may play an important role in the differential EAAT2 protein expression under normal and disease conditions.

EAAT2 is expressed mainly in glial cells throughout the brain and is responsible for up to 90% of all glutamate transport in adult tissue (9Tanaka K. Watase K. Manabe T. Yamada K. Watanabe M. Takahashi K. Iwama H. Nishikawa T. Ichihara N. Kikuchi T. Okuyama S. Kawashima N. Hori S. Takimoto M. Wada K. Science. 1997; 276: 1699-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 10Danbolt N.C. Storm-Mathisen J. Kanner B.I. Neuroscience. 1992; 51: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). A malfunction in the glutamate transport system can lead to accumulation of excessive glutamate in the synapse, which is harmful to neurons and could result in neurodegeneration (11Ikonomidou C. Qin Qin Y. Labruyere J. Olney J.W. J Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 12Rothstein J.D. Jin L. Dykes-Hoberg M. Kuncl R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6591-6595Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Over the past 15 years, it has been demonstrated that glutamate-mediated toxicity may play an important role in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer disease (AD). Rothstein and colleagues (13Rothstein J.D. Tsai G. Kuncl R.W. Clawson L. Cornblath D.R. Drachman D.B. Pestronk A. Stauch B.L. Coyle J.T. Ann. Neurol. 1990; 28: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) reported a significant increase in levels of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid of ALS patients and defective glutamate transport in the affected areas of ALS (14Rothstein J.D. Martin L.J. Kuncl R.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 1464-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated a dramatic and selective loss of EAAT2 protein in the affected areas of ALS (15Rothstein J.D. Van Kammen M. Levey A.I. Martin L.J. Kuncl R.W. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 38: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Defective glutamate transport and loss of EAAT2 protein were also reported in the affected areas of AD patients (16Li S. Mallory M. Alford M. Tanaka S. Masliah E. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 17Masliah E. Alford M. DeTeresa R. Mallory M. Hansen L. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 40: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This phenomenon also occurs in several rodent models of the diseases, including transgenic mice or rats expressing ALS-linked mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1) (18Dunlop J. Beal McIlvain H. She Y.

Mallory M. Rockenstein E. Moechars D. Van Leuven F. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 163: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These rodent models demonstrated that down-regulation of EAAT2 protein occurs during the final stage of the pathology. We (23Guo H. Lai L. Butchbach M.E. Stockinger M.P. Shan X. Bishop G.A. Lin C.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2519-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) modestly overexpressed EAAT2 in the SOD1G93A mouse to compensate for the loss of EAAT2 and demonstrated a delay in disease onset accompanied by a prolonged survival of motor neurons. In addition, Rothstein et al. (24Rothstein J.D. Patel S. Regan M.R. Haenggeli C. Huang Y.H. Bergles D.E. Jin L. Hoberg M.Dykes Vidensky S. Chung D.S. Toan S.V. Bruijn L.I. Su Z.Z. Gupta P. Fisher P.B. Nature. 2005; 433: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) recently reported that increased expression of EAAT2 by ceftriaxone ameliorated symptoms and prolonged the survival of SOD1G93A mice. These studies imply that impairment of glutamate transport is a late contributing mechanism and not a major culprit for neuron degeneration. The mechanism underlying the loss of EAAT2 is still unclear. It appears that this occurs due to disturbance at the post-transcriptional level, because EAAT2 mRNA is not decreased (15Rothstein J.D. Van Kammen M. Levey A.I. Martin L.J. Kuncl R.W. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 38: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 16Li S. Mallory M. Alford M. Tanaka S. Masliah E. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

In this study, we demonstrate that translation of EAAT2 mRNA is regulated by many factors. It is possible that reduced EAAT2 protein levels in ALS and AD may be partially due to lack of stimulating factors or the presence of inhibiting factors that repress translation of EAAT2 transcripts. Reagents—Corticosterone, retinol, T3 (triodo-l-thyronine), biotin, vitamin B12, and cycloheximide were obtained from Sigma. B-27, B-27 without antioxidants, and N-2 were obtained from Invitrogen. Identification of Initiation Sites—The 5′ end of the EAAT2 transcript was analyzed using the RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RLM-RACE) method according to the protocol provided with the FirstChoice™ RLMRACE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Briefly, total RNA (10 μg) was dephosphorylated with 2 μl of calf intestinal phosphatase. The cap structure was subsequently removed with 2 μl of tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to produce a phosphorylated RNA at the 5′ end, to which the 5′-RACE adapter (5′-GCUGAUGGCGAUGAAUGAACACUGCGUUUGCUGGCUUUGAUGAAA-3′) was ligated. The resulting RNA was reverse-transcribed using EAAT2 gene-specific primers (primer A1, 5′-GCTTGGGTTCCTCTGAGCCAAGATGACTGT-3′, corresponding to position +59 downstream of ATG; primer B1, 5′-GGTGGCAGGAGCCCAGGATCTAAG-3′, corresponding to position –771 upstream of ATG) and 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. The resulting cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the RACE 5′ outer primer (5′-GCTGATGGCGATGAATGAACACTG-3′) and EAAT2-specific primers A1 and B1. The resulting PCR products were amplified further by nested PCR using the RACE 5′ inner primer (5′-CGCGGATCCGAACACTGCGTTTGCTGGCTTTGATG-3′) and EAAT2-specific primers (A2, 5′-CCACCTGCTTGGGCATATTGTTGGCAC-3′, corresponding to position +17 downstream of ATG; B2, 5′-CTATTGTTTCCCCTGAAGCCCGC-3′, corresponding to position –800 upstream of ATG). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min, 85 °C for 2 min, followed by 10 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min and then 25 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min (increasing 0.5 s for each cycle). The reaction was then extended for 10 min at 72 °C. Nested PCR products were purified from 1% agarose gel and cloned using the PCR-Script™ Amp cloning kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Individual clones were sequenced for determination of the transcription start sites. Abundance of EAAT2 mRNAs—Normal human frontal cortex mRNA was isolated from postmortem frozen tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed by Oligotex Suspension kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First-strand cDNA was synthesized with Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using primer A1 (described above). As a control EAAT2 RNA, an EAAT2 transcript that contains the 565-nucleotide (nt) 5′-UTR and 395 nt of coding region was generated by in vitro transcription using RiboMAX™ large scale RNA production systems (Promega, Madison, WI). The template for the generation of this control RNA was prepared from pcDNA3/EAAT2 by restriction digestion with ScaI (Invitrogen). The following primer combinations (indicated in Fig. 1C) were used for PCR: primers A1 + C (5′-CCCGGCGTCCGCTTTCTCCCT-3′, corresponding to position –72 upstream of ATG), primers A1 + D (5′-CTGGGCGCATCGCTCTCTCG-3′, –310 upstream of ATG), and primers E (5′-GGTAAGCCCTTTAGCGCCTC-3′, –405 upstream of ATG) + F(5′-AAACCTTGCAATCCCTCCCTGGCCG-3′, –525 upstream of ATG). The MasterTaq kit (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY), which is designed to increase reproducible yields from GC-rich templates, was used, and PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, 85 °C for 2 min; 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles followed by 10 min of extension at 72 °C. The PCR products were resolved in 2% agarose gel, and the intensity of each band was analyzed by Kodak one-dimensional image analysis software (Eastman Kodak Co.). Cell Cultures—Mouse primary cortical cultures were obtained as described previously (23Guo H. Lai L. Butchbach M.E. Stockinger M.P. Shan X. Bishop G.A. Lin C.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2519-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortices were dissected out of the newborn (P0–P1) brains and incubated in activated papain for 30 min at 37 °C, triturated by repeated pipetting with a small bore pipette and plated onto poly-d-lysine (0.1 mg/ml)-coated plastic culture dishes or glass slides. These cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) containing 25 mm glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 19.4 μm pyridoxine hydrochloride, 2 mm glutamine, and 1% B-27 supplement (Invitrogen). Rat primary astrocyte cultures were obtained from Dr. Richard W. Burry (Department of Neuroscience, Ohio State University). The cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 cells) were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Generation of Plasmid DNA Constructs—To generate pcDNA3/EAAT2 with 76-nt 5′-UTR, DNA containing EAAT2 coding region and 76 bp of 5′-UTR was amplified by PCR using the primer set 5′-CCCGGCGTCCGCTTTCTCCCT-3′ and 5′-GGATCCAGACTCATATCCTTATTTCTCACG-3′ and pcDNA3/EAAT2 as template; this PCR product was inserted into pPCR-ScriptAmpSK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and then subcloned into pcDNA3 with EcoRI and NotI. pcDNA3/EAAT2 with a 310-nt 5′-UTR was generated in the same way as above except that the following PCR primers were used: 5′-CTGGGCGCATCGCTCTCTCG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCAGACTCATATCCTTATTTCTCACG-3′. To generate pcDNA3/EAAT2 with a 1091-nt 5′-UTR, the 5′-UTR sequence from –1117 to –239 was subcloned from TOPO/EAAT2 promoter into pcDNA3/EAAT2 using SspI and SacII. Generation of Stably Transfected Primary Astrocyte Cell Lines—Low passage (four passages) rat primary astrocyte cells were plated onto cell culture dishes and transfected with plasmid DNA (pcDNA3/EAAT2) using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to standard protocol. The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing Geneticin (0.9 mg/ml) 48 h post-transfection to select for EAAT2-expressing cells. Selection medium was replaced every 3 days until colonies formed (18–21 days later). Colonies were examined for EAAT2 expression by RT-PCR using EAAT2-specific primers and also by immunoblotting using a rabbit anti-EAAT2 pAb. RT-PCR—Total RNA from primary astrocytes or primary cortical cultures was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and first strand cDNA was synthesized with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using an EAAT2-specific primer (5′-ACGCTGGGGAGTTTATTCAAGAAT-3′). β-Actin was used as an internal control (primer, 5′-TGTCAAAGAAAGGGTGTAAAACGCAGC-3′). PCR primers 5′-GGCAACTGGGGATGTACA-3′ and 5′-ACGCTGGGGAGTTTATTCAAGAAT-3′ were used for EAAT2 cDNA, and primers 5′-CGGGACCTGACAGACTACCTCAT-3′ and 5′-TGTCAAAGAAAGGGTGTAAAACGCAGC-3′ were used for actin cDNA. PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, 85 °C for 2 min; 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles followed by 10 min of extension at 72 °C. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (26Guo H. Lai L. Butchbach M.E. Lin C.L. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2002; 21: 546-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the harvested samples were sonicated in PBS containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), assayed for protein concentration, resolved by SDS-PAGE (8% polyacrylamide), and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EAAT2 pAb (1:4000), rabbit anti-EAAT1 pAb (1:200), rabbit anti-EAAT3 pAb (1:200), rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) pAb (1:1000; Promega, Madison, WI), and goat anti-actin (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The immunoreactive bands were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's directions. Band intensities were analyzed with Scion Image Release Beta 4.0.2 (Scion Corp.). [3H]Glutamate Uptake Assay—Uptake of radiolabeled glutamate was monitored in cultured cells as described previously (27Butchbach M.E. Tian G. Guo H. Lin C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34388-34396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cultured cells grown on 6-well plates were washed with uptake sample buffer (320 mm sucrose in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with l-[3H]glutamate (0.5 μCi; Amersham Biosciences) in either Na+-containing or Na+-free Kreb's buffer supplemented with 40 μm unlabeled glutamate. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 mm NaOH. The amount of radiolabeled glutamate was measured using a Beckman Coulter LS6500 multipurpose scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The amount of l-[3H]glutamate transported into the cells was calculated as previously described (27Butchbach M.E. Tian G. Guo H. Lin C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34388-34396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Na+-dependent l-[3H]glutamate uptake was calculated by subtracting Na+-independent l-[3H]glutamate uptake (in Na+-free Kreb's buffer) from the total l-[3H]glutamate uptake (in Na+-containing Kreb's buffer). Protein concentrations were determined with the Coomassie Plus protein assay (Pierce). Na+-dependent l-[3H]glutamate uptake was expressed as nmol of l-[3H]glutamate/mg of protein/min. Immunofluorescence—Fixation of cultured cells and immunofluorescent staining were accomplished as described previously (27Butchbach M.E. Tian G. Guo H. Lin C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34388-34396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used in this study: purified rabbit anti-EAAT2 pAb (1:200), purified rabbit anti-EAAT3 pAb (1:200), rabbit anti-GFAP pAb (1:1000; Promega, Madison, WI), and mouse anti-MAP2 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Neomarker, Fremont, CA). Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 inverted microscope and AxioVision software. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Labeling of proteins on the plasma membrane was accomplished by cell surface biotinylation as described previously (23Guo H. Lai L. Butchbach M.E. Stockinger M.P. Shan X. Bishop G.A. Lin C.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2519-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with PBS/CaMg (100 μm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 in PBS, pH 7.4) at room temperature and then incubated with biotinylation buffer (1 mg/ml EZ-Link® Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS/CaMg) for 20 min at 4 °C with constant shaking. Cells were then incubated with quenching buffer (100 mm glycine in PBS/CaMg) for 30 min at 4 °C with constant shaking and scraped in quenching buffer. The samples were sonicated in PBS containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C. Biotinylated proteins were recovered by incubation with 100 μl of immobilized NeutrAvidin (50% slurry; Pierce) at 4 °C overnight with end-over-end rotation. The avidin beads were recovered by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C) and then washed four times with washing buffer (1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture). After washing, the beads were resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE loading dye. Pulse-Chase Experiments—PA-EAAT2 cells were first cultured in 10% FBS for 24 h, washed twice with sterile PBS/CaMg (100 μm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 in PBS, pH 7.4) at room temperature, and then incubated with sterile biotinylation buffer (1 mg/ml EZ-Link® Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS/CaMg) for 20 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking every 5 min. Cells were then incubated with sterile quenching buffer (100 mm glycine in PBS/CaMg) for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking every 5 min. After biotinylation, cells were cultured in DMEM with corticosterone (0.2 μg/ml) for 8 or 24 h and then harvested for biotin-labeled EAAT2 protein level analysis as described above. In Vitro Translation—Each form of EAAT2 cDNA in pcDNA3 vector was used as a DNA template for TNT quick coupled transcription/translation systems in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase and [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's protocols (Promega, Madison, WI). Equivalent copy numbers of plasmid DNAs were used in each assay. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 90 min. The synthesized protein products were electrophoretically resolved through an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was then dried and exposed to autoradiography film for 24 h. Drug Administration—Intrathecal administration of drugs was performed as described previously by Hylden and Wilcox (28Hylden J.L.K. Wilcox G.L. Eur. J. Phamacol. 1980; 67: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Normal FVB mice (20–25 g) were used throughout these experiments. Briefly, a disposable 30-gauge one-half-inch needle (BD Biosciences) attached to a 50-μl Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV) was inserted into the intervertebral space between L5 and L6 level of the spinal cord. The accuracy of each injection was indicated by a characteristic reflexive flick of the tail. 1 μg/μl of corticosterone in 10% ethanol was injected in a volume of 5 μl/mouse, and 5 μl of 10% ethanol was injected into the control mice. Statistical Analysis—The quantitative data in this study were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired Student's t test. There Are Multiple Transcriptional Initiation Sites of the EAAT2 Gene—Eukaryotic translation can be subdivided into three sequential phases of initiation, elongation, and termination. Frequently, it is the initiation phase that is targeted in translational regulation (29Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Such regulation is mainly determined by structural properties of the mRNA primarily within the 5′-UTR. Su et al. (30Su Z.Z. Leszczyniecka M. Kang D.C. Sarkar D. Chao W. Volsky D.J. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1955-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have reported that the major transcript of EAAT2 in primary human fetal astrocytes is initiated from an adenosine residue located 283 nt upstream of the ATG start codon. However, we found in a previous study (31Lin C.L. Bristol L.A. Jin L. Dykes-Hoberg M. Crawford T. Clawson L. Rothstein J.D. Neuron. 1998; 20: 589-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) that some human EAAT2 transcripts contain at least 428 nt of 5′-UTR. In addition, a human EAAT2 cDNA that we obtained from another laboratory contained the 565-nt 5′-UTR. Furthermore, mouse EAAT2 transcripts contain at least 660 nt of 5′-UTR (32Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and rat EAAT2 transcripts contain at least 621 nt of 5′-UTR (33Rozyczka J. Engele J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 133: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Su et al. (30Su Z.Z. Leszczyniecka M. Kang D.C. Sarkar D. Chao W. Volsky D.J. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1955-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) used primer extension analysis to determine the transcriptional initiation site. Shorter primer extension products can be generated if the primer target sequence is not close to the 5′ terminus of the mRNA. This is due to the tendency of reverse transcriptase to stop or pause in a region of high secondary structure in the template RNA. We used the computer program MFOLD (available on the World Wide Web at bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/mfold-simple.html) (34Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (9968) Google Scholar) to predict secondary structure of EAAT2 5′-UTR. There is a predicted region of strong secondary structure (ΔG = –99.3 kcal/mol) located from position –136 to –340 upstream of ATG. Moreover, we performed many RT-PCR experiments to amplify EAAT2 5′-UTR and learned that it is difficult to pass through the region around 250 nt upstream of ATG when using standard RT conditions. 5′ RLM-RACE is a reliable way to determine the transcriptional initiation site of the mRNA. Only authentic capped 5′ ends of mRNA are detected by RLM-RACE. We first used the computer program Promoter 2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/Promoter/) (35Knudsen S. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) to predict the potential transcriptional initiation sites. The result showed that there are three potential initiation sites within 1.2 kb upstream of ATG, each located at around –74, –345, and –1153 upstream of ATG. Primer A, which corresponds to position +59 downstream of ATG, was used to test the putative –74 and –345 initiation sites, whereas primer B, which corresponds to position –771 upstream of ATG, was used to test the putative –1153 initiation site. Tobacco acid pyrophosphatase-treated human frontal cortex mRNA was used as a template, since tobacco acid pyrophosphatase removes the cap structure from full-length mRNA, thereby leaving a free 5′-monophosphate to be ligated to an adapter for amplification. As shown in Fig. 1A, two PCR fragments were obtained when using primer A, and one PCR fragment was obtained when using primer B. No product was obtained when RNA was not treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase, indicating that these PCR fragments were derived from full-length capped mRNA. These PCR fragments were cloned and sequenced. They all contained adapter sequence and mapped the 5′ end of the mRNA to 76, 310, and 1091 nt upstream of the ATG start codon (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that there are multiple transcriptional initiation sites of the EAAT2 gene. What are the relative abundances of these three forms of EAAT2 mRNA in vivo? We initially attempted to answer this question by a ribonuclease protection assay but were not able to obtain reliable results, probably due to the strong secondary structure of the 5′-UTR. We then approached this question by using quantitative RT-PCR. mRNA samples from normal human front cortices (n = 3) and the control EAAT2 RNA, generated by in vitro transcription using EAAT2 cDNA as template, were subjected to RT. Primer A, which corresponds to position +59 downstream of ATG, was used for RT, which was performed at 60 °C using Thermoscript so as to easily pass through regions of high secondary structure. Serial dilutions of RT product were then subjected to PCR using primer sets indicated in Fig. 1C. The PCR product amplified by primer A and primer C represents all three forms of EAAT2 mRNA, whereas the PCR product amplified by primer A and primer D represents those mRNAs containing the 310- and 1091-nt 5′ UTRs, and the PCR product amplified by primer E and primer F represents those mRNAs containing a 1091-nt 5′-UTR. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1D). The intensity of each band was meas"

TIA-1 (T-cell intracellular antigen 1) and TIAR (TIA-1-related) proteins regulate alternative pre-mRNA splicing by promoting the use of suboptimal 5′ splice sites followed by uridine-rich intronic enhancer sequences. These proteins promote, for example, inclusion of Fas receptor exon 6, which leads to an mRNA encoding a pro-apoptotic form of the receptor at the expense of the form that skips exon 6, which encodes an anti-apoptotic form. Fas-activated serine/threonine kinase (FAST K) is known to interact with and phosphorylate TIA-1. Here we have tested the possibility that FAST K influences alternative pre-mRNA splicing by affecting the activity of TIA-1/TIAR. Depletion of FAST K form Jurkat cells leads to skipping of exon 6 from endogenous Fas transcripts. Conversely, FAST K overexpression enhances exon 6 inclusion of Fas reporters transfected in HeLa cells. Consistent with the possibility that the effects of FAST K are mediated by changes in the function of TIA-1/TIAR, the effects of FAST K overexpression (i) are largely suppressed by depletion of TIA-1 and TIAR and (ii) are significantly compromised by mutation of a TIA-1/TIAR-responsive enhancer present downstream of exon 6 5′ splice site. Furthermore, in vitro phosphorylation of TIA-1 by FAST K results in enhanced U1 snRNP recruitment. Interestingly, this enhancement is not due to increased binding of TIA-1 to the pre-mRNA. Taken together, the results connect Fas signaling with the activity of splicing factors that modulate Fas alternative splicing, suggesting the existence of an autoregulatory loop that could serve to amplify Fas responses.

Pre-mRNA splicing is a major control mechanism for modulating gene expression. Alternative splicing is a prevalent, versatile, and highly regulated process, by which a single mRNA precursor (pre-mRNA) can produce multiple different mRNAs and proteins. It is known that at least 74% of human multiexon genes encode alternatively spliced mRNAs and 80% of this alternative splicing events promote changes in the coded protein (for review, see Refs. 1Blencowe B.J.

The molecular basis of alternative splicing control is linked to the process of splice site selection. Splice site selection depends on the balance between positive and negative sequence elements and on changes in the activity and/or amount of cellular splicing factors under physiological or pathological conditions (3Black D.L.

TIAR can also enhance U6 snRNP assembly on a pseudo-5′ splice site followed by uridines, playing a role in alternative splicing of the calcitonin/CGRP gene (11Zhu H. Hasman R.A. Young K.M. Kedersha N.L. Lou H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5959-5971Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fas-activated serine/threonine kinase (FAST K) was identified as a TIA-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screening (13Tian Q. Taupin J. Elledge S. Robertson M. Anderson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This kinase is constitutively phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in Jurkat cells. In response to Fas ligation, FAST K is rapidly dephosphorylated and TIA-1 is concomitanly phosphorylated in serine residues (13Tian Q. Taupin J. Elledge S. Robertson M. Anderson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These results suggested that FAST K and TIA-1 may play a role in signaling Fas-induced apoptosis. The goal of this work was to determine whether FAST K can influence the activity of TIA-1/TIAR as splicing regulators. The results indicate that FAST K modulates the inclusion of Fas exon 6 through synergistic effects with TIA-1/TIAR as well as additional splicing factors, thus linking a signaling pathway with the activity of splicing factors and specific events in post-transcriptional gene regulation.

To study the function of FAST K in the regulation of Fas alternative splicing, the expression levels of this protein, as well as of TIA-1 and TIAR, in Jurkat cells were specifically reduced by electroporation of 21-nt specific siRNAs against FAST K or TIA-1 and TIAR mRNAs. Samples from siRNAs-treated Jurkat cells were analyzed after 72 h by Western blot using antibodies against FAST K, TIA-1, TIAR, or U2AF65 (used as a loading control). 80–90% depletion (quantification by densitometer) of FAST K, TIA-1, and TIAR proteins was reproducibly achieved under these conditions (Fig. 1, A–C). From the same samples, cytoplasmic RNA was isolated and used to analyze the splicing patterns of the endogenous Fas gene by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Consistent with previous results, TIA-1 and TIAR depletion promoted partial exon 6 skipping (Fig. 1D, lane 2). Reduced levels of FAST K resulted in complete Fas exon 6 skipping in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1D, lane 3). These results support a role for FAST K in promoting the synthesis of the mRNA encoding the Fas/CD95 membrane receptor isoform in Jurkat cells, with similar effects to overexpression of TIA-1/TIAR. To gain an additional evidence for the role of FAST K as Fas splicing activator, HeLa cells were cotransfected with recombinant FAST K, TIA-1, or TIAR and a mutated human Fas minigene (U-20C), which contains a uridine to cytidine substitution 20 nucleotides upstream from the 3′ splice of intron 5, which results in decreased levels of exon 6 inclusion (Fig. 2A, lane 1), as reported previously (9Izquierdo J.M. Majós N. Bonnal S. Martínez C. Castelo R. Guigó R. Bilbao D. Valcárcel J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 475-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The ectopic expression of recombinant proteins as well as endogenous levels of TIA-1 and TIAR in transfected cells was assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). As expected, overexpression of TIA-1 or TIAR resulted in increased exon 6 inclusion (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3), consistent with the notion that both proteins are Fas splicing activators that promote exon 6 inclusion (9Izquierdo J.M. Majós N. Bonnal S. Martínez C. Castelo R. Guigó R. Bilbao D. Valcárcel J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 475-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of FAST K also resulted in increased exon 6 inclusion (Fig. 2A, lane 4) consistent with the role of this kinase as an activator of exon 6 inclusion. Taken together, the siRNA-mediated knock-down of FAST K in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1) and its overexpression in HeLa cells (Fig. 2) argue for a function of FAST K as a regulator of the alternative splicing event that promotes Fas exon 6 inclusion. To investigate whether FAST K-dependent splicing activity is mediated by the activities of the splicing regulators TIA-1 and/or TIAR, a combination of overexpression of FAST K and depletion of TIA-1, TIAR, or TIA-1 and TIAR experiments were performed (Fig. 3). The results indicated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of TIA-1, TIAR, and TIA-1 plus TIAR resulted in gradual skipping of exon 6 from the U-20C Fas minigene (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–4). Overexpression of FAST K in cells depleted of any one of these proteins resulted in a significant increase of exon 6 inclusion (Fig. 3A, lanes 5–7). However, the depletion of both TIA-1 and TIAR significantly compromised the exon inclusion-promoting effects of FAST overexpression (Fig. 3A, lane 8). These results show that FAST K effects on Fas splicing regulation are mediated, at least in part, through the function of splicing factors TIA-1 and TIAR. The observation that some increase in exon 6 inclusion was observed under conditions of TIA-1 and TIAR depletion could be explained either by incomplete siRNA-mediated depletion of these factors or by effects of FAST K on other splicing factors that regulate this splicing event. To further document these conclusions, the complementary approach of testing the effect of FAST K on a Fas minigene containing mutations at an intronic enhancer sequence known to mediate the stimulatory effects of TIA-1/TIAR (9Izquierdo J.M. Majós N. Bonnal S. Martínez C. Castelo R. Guigó R. Bilbao D. Valcárcel J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 475-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This minigene (mURI6) contains mutations in the conserved uridine-rich sequence located downstream of the 5′ splice site of intron 6 (URI6) resulting in a prevalent exon 6 skipping (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 2 and 6). Whereas overexpression of TIA-1, TIAR, or FAST promoted inclusion of exon 6 using the U-20C Fas minigene (Fig. 3B, lanes 3–5), overexpression of TIA-1 or TIAR did not result, as expected, in higher levels of exon inclusion in the mUIR6 Fas minigene (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 3 and 4 and 7 and 8, respectively). Overexpression of FAST K resulted in levels of exon inclusion around 30–40% (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 5 and 9). We conclude that mutation of the sequences that mediate the effects of TIA-1/TIAR on exon inclusion decreases the effects of FAST K overexpression (compare lanes 5 and 9 in Fig. 3B), consistent with the effects of reducing the levels of these factors (Fig. 3A). The non-insignificant levels of exon 6 inclusion in the mURI6 upon FAST K overexpression could be due to either mediated by TIA-1/TIAR acting through other sequences (6Förch P. Puig O. Kedersha N. Martínez C. Granneman S. Seraphin B. Anderson P. Valcárcel J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) or to effects of FAST K on other splicing factors and associated splicing regulatory motifs. Given that the cellular activity of splicing factors can be regulated by its abundance, cellular localization, the availability of specific regulatory molecules, and/or post-translational modifications (2Izquierdo J.M. Valcárcel J. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar, 4Faustino N.A. Cooper T.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 419-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar), the effects of FAST K on Fas alternative splicing could be potentially explained by any of the mechanisms mentioned above. One possible scenario, based on the fact that FAST K and TIA-1 interact with each other and TIA-1 is phosphorylated by this kinase, is that TIA-1/TIAR phosphorylation results in increased levels of these factors in the nucleus, TIA proteins are known to shuttle between nucleus and the cytoplasm (16Zhang T. Delestienne N. Huez G. Kruys V. Gueydan C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5453-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), or a nuclear compartment engaging in functional interactions with splicing factors and/or nascent transcripts. A second, not mutually exclusive, possibility is that phosphorylation increases the biochemical activity of these factors in splicing regulation. To test this possibility, recombinant purified GST-TIA-1 was phosphorylated in vitro by incubation with immunoprecipitates of HA-epitope tagged FAST K expressed in HeLa cells, as described previously (13Tian Q. Taupin J. Elledge S. Robertson M. Anderson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Incubation under the same conditions in the absence of ATP was carried out as a control. Next, the activity of the phosphorylated and mock-phosphorylated proteins, which were repurified by affinity chromatography using gluthatione agarose beads, in promoting U1 snRNP binding was analyzed. Two weak 5′ splice sites followed by uridine-rich sequences were used, Fas exon 6 5′ splice site region and a 5′ splice site region from Drosophila gene male specific lethal-2, which were both previously characterized as a TIA-1-dependent 5′ splice site regions (6Förch P.

Base pairing between U1 snRNA and the 5′ splice site was detected using psoralen-mediated UV cross-linking, as reported previously (6Förch P. Puig O. Kedersha N. Martínez C. Granneman S.

Phosphorylated TIA-1 protein induced increased cross-linking of U1 snRNA with the 5′ splice site, both in nuclear extracts and using partially purified U1 snRNP (Fig. 4A–C). Significantly, the activity of the phosphorylated protein was found to be reproducibly higher than that of its mock-phosphorylated counterpart (Fig. 4, A–C, compare lane 3 with lane 4). Taken together, these results indicate that TIA-1 phosphorylation by FAST K results in higher U1 snRNP recruitment activity. Interestingly, this enhancement is not due to increased binding of the phosphorylated protein to its cognate sequences (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the effect of TIA-1 phosphorylation is to stimulate U1 snRNP binding through improved interaction with U1 C (6Förch P.

Other splicing factors that can be phosphorylated and have capacity to recruit U1 snRNP, such as SR proteins, SR-protein like factors, or even hnRNPs, may be specific substrates of FAST K, possibly explaining the potentially TIA-independent splicing regulatory effects of this kinase. Inclusion of Fas exon 6 results in the synthesis of the mRNA encoding the proapoptotic form of the Fas receptor at the expense of the soluble form that inhibits programmed cell death (17Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar, 18Cheng J. Zhou T. Liu C. Shapiro J.P. Brauer M.J. Kiefer M.C. Barr P.J. Mountz J.D. Science. 1994; 263: 1759-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Human Fas (Apo-1/CD95) mRNA encodes a type 1 transmembrane protein that mediates apoptosis upon ligation of the Fas ligand (FasL) (17Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). It seems plausible that a signaling pathway implicating FAST K, TIA-1, and/or TIAR, and probably additional splicing factors, may be operating as part of a positive autoregulatory loop whereby initial triggering of the Fas signaling pathway can lead to the accumulation of higher levels of membrane-bound receptor, which, in turn, can lead to higher levels of Fas-mediated activation. Such a scenario can operate, for example, during the activation of T cells, a process that requires an increase in exon 6 inclusion (17Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar, 19Liu C. Cheng J. Mountz J.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Indeed, defects in exon 6 inclusion lead to lymphocyte hyperproliferation and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (20Roesler J. Izquierdo J.M. Ryser M. Rosen-Wolff A. Gahr M. Valcárcel J. Lenardo M.J. Zheng L. Blood. 2005; 106: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Bidere N. Su H.C. Lenardo M.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 321-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although signaling cascades are known to affect alternative splicing decisions (22Shin C. Manley J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), in almost no case has it been possible to connect specific molecules in the signaling route with particular splicing factors being affected and having predictable effects on alternative splicing events of physiological significance. The balance between Fas 6 exon inclusion and skipping is tightly regulated in a number of other physiological and pathological situations. For example, increased levels of soluble Fas are found in the serum of patients with autoimmune diseases such as systematic lupus erythematosus, adult T lymphoma, lymphocytic leukemia, as well as in other diseases such as silicosis, hepatoma, hepatic C infections, and multiple sclerosis (18Cheng J. Zhou T. Liu C. Shapiro J.P. Brauer M.J. Kiefer M.C. Barr P.J. Mountz J.D. Science. 1994; 263: 1759-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 20Roesler J. Izquierdo J.M. Ryser M.

Immunol. 2006; 24: 321-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). An important goal for future studies will be to test whether some of these pathological conditions arise from deficient regulation of exon 6 inclusion caused by the unbalanced activities of FAST K/TIA-1/TIAR signaling pathway. Additional studies will also be required to assess the effects of FAST K on other cellular pre-mRNAs (e.g. CTFR exon 9, FGFR-2 exon IIIb,...) whose alternative splicing events are known to be regulated by TIA-1 and/or TIAR in either normal or pathological conditions (5Del Gatto-Konczak F.

The mature GGT is a heterodimer consisting of L- and S-subunits that is generated by posttranslational cleavage of the peptide bond between Gln-390 and Thr-391 in the precursor protein. Thr-391, which becomes the N-terminal residue of the S-subunit, acts as the active residue in the catalytic reaction. The crystal structure of a mutant GGT, T391A, that is unable to undergo autocatalytic processing, has been determined at 2.55-Å resolution. Structural comparison of the precursor protein and mature GGT demonstrates that the structures of the core regions in the two proteins are unchanged, but marked differences are found near the active site. In particular, in the precursor, the segment corresponding to the C-terminal region of the L-subunit occupies the site where the loop (residues 438–449) forms the lid of the γ-glutamyl group-binding pocket in the mature GGT. This result demonstrates that, upon cleavage of the N-terminal peptide bond of Thr-391, the newly produced C terminus (residues 375–390) flips out, allowing the 438–449 segment to form the γ-glutamyl group-binding pocket. The electron density map for the T391A protein also identified a water molecule near the carbonyl carbon atom of Gln-390. The spatial arrangement around the water and Thr-391 relative to the scissile peptide bond appears suitable for the initiation of autocatalytic processing, as in other members of the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase superfamily. γ-Glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) is an extracellular enzyme that plays a key role in glutathione metabolism.

Meister A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 39: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar): γ-glutamyl-X + H2O → glutamate + X (hydrolysis); γ-glutamyl-X + X′ → γ-glutamyl-X′ + X (transpeptidation). GGT, a member of the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolase superfamily, is an extracellular enzyme that is widely distributed from bacteria to mammals (1Tate S.S. Meister A. Mol. Cell.

Enzymol. 1998; 72: 239-278PubMed Google Scholar) and plays a variety of physiological roles. The most abundant substrates for GGT are glutathione (GSH; γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine) and GSH-conjugated compounds. GGT catalyzes the initial step of the degradation of GSH into constituent amino acids that are then transported into the cell and used as cysteine and nitrogen sources in Escherichia coli, yeast, and mammalian cells (4Suzuki H. Hashimoto W. Kumagai H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6038-6040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hanigan M.H. Ricketts W.A.

In mammals, GGT catalyzes the initial step of the conversion of GSH conjugates into mercapturic acid, which is subsequently excreted into bile and urine (3Taniguchi N. Ikeda Y. Adv. Enzymol. 1998; 72: 239-278PubMed Google Scholar). Mature GGT is a heterodimeric enzyme comprising one large (L) and one small (S) subunit (1Tate S.S. Meister A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 39: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 3Taniguchi N. Ikeda Y. Adv. Enzymol. 1998; 72: 239-278PubMed Google Scholar). GGT is generated from a precursor protein by posttranslational autocatalytic processing (7Ikeda Y. Taniguchi N. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 401: 408-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); other proteins, which undergo such processes, include Hedgehog proteins (8Perler F.B.

Mutation of the N terminus of the S-subunit in mature GGT (Thr-391) has significant effects on the processing activity (15Hashimoto W. Suzuki H. Nohara S. Kumagai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 16Hashimoto W. Suzuki H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. J. Biochem.

In particular, an alanine-substituted mutant, T391A, was isolated as the precursor form only, completely lacking posttranslational processing ability. Biochemical studies of T391S and T391C indicate that the posttranslational processing of GGT is an intramolecular autocatalytic event, and that Thr-391, which is the catalytic nucleophile in the mature enzyme, is also the catalytic residue for the processing reaction (16Hashimoto W. Suzuki H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Suzuki H. Kumagai H. J. Biol.

Uncoupling of enzymatic and auto-processing activities was verified for Helicobacter pyroli GGT (18Boanca G. Sand A. Barycki J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19029-19037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the recently determined crystal structure of E. coli mature GGT shows that the C-terminal region of the L-subunit is distant from the N-terminal region of the S-subunit (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This result apparently demonstrates that a large conformational change has occurred upon processing. We report here the crystal structure of E. coli GGT T391A mutant protein that lacks autocatalytic processing ability refined at 2.55-Å resolution. Structure comparison between the T391A protein and the mature GGT shows that marked structural changes occur during the maturation process in the segment corresponding to the C-terminal region of the L-subunit and in the segment that forms the substrate-binding pocket. Furthermore, the flexible nature of the loop that covers the substrate-binding pocket in the mature GGT in the resting state was demonstrated by the crystallographic analysis of its different crystal form. The molecular mechanism of processing is discussed on the basis of the structure around the scissile bond in the T391A protein. Expression and Purification of T391A Protein—E. coli strain SH641 (F– Δggt-2 rpsL recA56 srl300::Tn10) (20Suzuki H. Kumagai H. Echigo T. Tochikura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was transformed with plasmid pT391A, which contained ggtT391A mutant gene on pUC119, and strain HW428 was obtained (17Suzuki H. Kumagai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43536-43543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Strain HW428 was grown at 20 °C for 40 h in 4 liters of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and reciprocal shaking. The periplasmic fraction was prepared, and the 0–60% ammonium sulfate saturated fraction was subjected to chromatofocusing (PBE94 column, 1 × 26 cm; GE Healthcare) followed by gel filtration on a Cellulofine GC-700m column (1 × 113 cm; Seikagaku Kogyo) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) as described previously (17Suzuki H. Kumagai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43536-43543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The fractions containing the T391A protein were applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (10 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). T391A protein was eluted with the same buffer in a continuous gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl, precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 60% saturation, and stored at 4 °C until use. Crystallization and Data Collection—The ammonium sulfate T391A protein precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.0) and then desalted by repeated concentration using Vivaspin filter (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany) and dilution with the buffer. Crystallization conditions were screened with the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method using the PEG/Ion screen kit (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) and JB screen kit (Jena Bioscience, Jena, Germany). The hanging-drop was prepared by mixing 1 μl of protein solution (4 mg/ml) with 1 μl of reservoir solution and was equilibrated at 4 °C against 200 μl of reservoir solution. Promising crystals were grown in the drops when either B6 or C1 of JB screen no. 3 was used as the reservoir solution. Diffraction quality crystals were produced when the concentrations of PEG 4000 and isopropanol in the reservoir solution were optimized (18% PEG 4000 and 10% isopropanol in 0.1 m sodium citrate). The crystals grew in a week to a typical size of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.2 mm. Crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant solution, which was prepared by adding PEG 4000 and glycerol to the reservoir solution to final concentrations of 22.5 and 1%, respectively and flash-cooled with a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. Diffraction data for the T391A protein crystal were collected using synchrotron radiation and the Quantum 315 detector (Area Detector Systems, Poway, CA) at beamline BL41XU at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan). The mature GGT in the resting state was crystallized in the monoclinic form (space group P21; SeMet-GGT-P21) under the condition described previously (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant solution, which was prepared by adding glycerol to final concentration of 15% to the reservoir solution (20% PEG 4000 and 0.2 m CaCl2 in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5), and flash-cooled in a similar manner as for T391A. Diffraction data were collected using synchrotron radiation and the Jupiter 210 CCD detector (Rigaku/MSC, The Woodlands, TX) at beamline BL38B1 at SPring-8. All diffraction data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 suite (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38556) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of the T391A protein was solved by the molecular replacement method with MOLREP in the CCP4 suite (22Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19761) Google Scholar) using the atomic parameters of the A molecule of the mature GGT (Protein Data Bank code 2DBU) as the search model in which residues 375–390 of the L-subunit, which are assumed to take another conformation, were excluded, and Thr-391 was substituted with alanine. Two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit were located by a cross-rotation function and translation search. The Fo – Fc map calculated after the initial refinement using REFMAC5 (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13864) Google Scholar) at 2.55-Å resolution showed positive continuous density for residues 375–390. These residues occupied different sites in the T391A protein and the mature GGT; residues 385–390 in the T391A protein occupied the site where residues 442–447 are located in the mature GGT. In addition, the electron densities corresponding to residues 29–39, 114–146, 250–265, 341–390, and 430–459 were ambiguous, indicating that these residues were disordered or had different conformations from the model. After removing these residues, several cycles of translation/libration/screw and restraint refinement with REFMAC5 (24Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar) and manual revision of the model with XTALVIEW/XFIT (25McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar) were performed using 30–2.55-Å resolution data. The removed residues were incorporated into the model in the next cycle when the electron density was visible. When only the density for the main-chain atoms was visible, the residue was treated as alanine. Finally, water molecules were picked using XTALVIEW/XFIT, and further refinement was carried out with REFMAC5. Except for Lys-382 and Leu-383 in A molecule, all main-chain atoms and most side-chain atoms in the segment 375–390 could be located in the electron density map. The structure of SeMet-GGT-P21 was solved by the molecular replacement method in a similar manner as for the T391A protein. The structure was refined at 1.95-Å resolution in which the residues invisible in the electron density map (residues 438–449 in A molecule and 439–448 in B molecule) were excluded. The stereochemistry of each model was checked using PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The secondary structures were defined by DSSP (27Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12304) Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. Overall Structure of GGT T391A Protein—The T391A mutant protein, which lacked intramolecular autocatalytic processing activity (16Hashimoto W. Suzuki H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), was expressed in E. coli, purified, and crystallized. The crystal structure of the protein was refined to 2.55-Å resolution and Rwork and Rfree factors of 0.217 and 0.270, respectively. There are two molecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit. The conformation of the peptide segment containing Gln-390 to Ala-391, which corresponded to the processing site in the wild-type protein, was clearly defined in the electron density map (Fig. 1). The number of segments with high mobility was increased in the T391A protein relative to the mature GGT. Both the main- and side-chains of 108 residues and the side-chains of 20 additional residues (out of 1112 residues in the A and B molecules) were invisible in the T391A protein, whereas only 15 residues were invisible in the mature GGT (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A and B molecules of the T391A protein are superimposable with a r.m.s. (root mean square) deviation of 0.39 Å for 494 pairs of corresponding Cα atoms. The folding of the T391A protein (B molecule) is shown in Fig. 2A. The T391A protein has a stacked αββα core structure comprising two central β-sheets and surrounding α-helices, similar to the mature GGT (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Superimposition of the Cα traces of T391A and mature GGT is shown in Fig. 2B. Notably, in the mature GGT, the C-terminal residue of the L-subunit was far (∼36 Å; Fig. 2B) from the N-terminal Thr-391 of the S-subunit (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc.

We denote this segment as the P-segment. The P-segments in the T391A protein and in the mature GGT are directed to the opposite sides at Ile-378 because of differing ψ values (Fig. 2C; ψ = –45° in the T391A protein and ψ = 127° in the mature GGT). Major structural perturbation was found around the P-segment; significant shifts were observed in residues 194–214, 253–259, 331–353, and 411–416, some of which were residues that formed the active site in the mature GGT. Also, invisible residues are located near the P-segment (circled in green in Fig. 2B). Except for the P-segment and the residues near the P-segment, the structure of the T391A protein is similar to that of the mature GGT; 393 pairs of corresponding Cα atoms are superimposable with a r.m.s. deviation of 0.55 Å. Structural Rearrangements Accompanied by P-segment Displacement—The structures of the P-segments in T391A protein and mature GGT are compared in Fig. 3. The P-segment in the T391A protein shields the active site from solvent (Fig. 3). Displacement of the P-segment upon cleavage of the Gln-390 to Thr-391 peptide bond causes the rearrangement of several adjacent segments. The most notable structural change was seen in the segment from Pro-438 to Gly-449 (Fig. 3A). These residues form one side of the substrate-binding site in mature GGT (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), whereas they are disordered in the T391A protein. In other words, when the P-segment extending to Ala-391 in the T391A protein is moved out, the disordered segment 438–449 is able to sit on the site where the P-segment occupies. The 438–449 segment forms a lid of the substrate-binding pocket, and we denote this segment as the lid-loop. We had previously assumed that the P-segment extended near the lid-loop in the precursor protein because a continuous groove was seen on the molecular surface of mature GGT from Ser-375 to Thr-391 (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The present result, however, clearly demonstrates that the P-segment is replaced by the lid-loop upon processing. Displacement of the P-segment also rearranges residues 411–416 (Fig. 3B). These residues form one side of the substrate-binding site, and residues 482–485 form the other side. When the P-segment is moved out from the pocket, the 411–416 segment shifts markedly (>1 Å) toward residues 482–485, narrowing the substrate-binding pocket. In the γ-glutamyl-enzyme intermediate and the product-bound form of mature GGT, the length and width of the substrate-binding site are exactly sized to the γ-glutamyl moiety (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, the movement of residues 411–416 completes the structure of the substrate-binding pocket so that it is exactly able to recognize the γ-glutamyl moiety. Flexibility of Lid-loop—We had previously assumed that the lid-loop (residues 438–449) rigidly shielded the active site from solvent based on the observations that Tyr-444 hydrogen bonded to the substrate-binding residue, Asn-411, and that no conformational change in the lid-loop was observed in the reaction intermediate or enzyme·product complexes (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the analysis herein demonstrates that the lid-loop in the T391A protein is disordered, unlike that in the mature GGT and its complex with glutamic acid as well as in γ-glutamyl-enzyme intermediate. In addition, we noted that a Sm3+ ion occupies the lid-loop site in the samarium derivative of the mature GGT (SeMet-GGT-Sm) (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), indicating that the lid-loop in this derivative is disordered or has another conformation. The refined structure of SeMet-GGT-Sm has shown that the lid-loop was disordered (see supplemental material). The flexible nature of the lid-loop was directly shown by the crystallographic analysis of SeMet-GGT-P21. The electron density in the region corresponding to the loop in SeMet-GGT-P21 is compared with that in GGT-Glu complex (Fig. 4). Residues 438–449 were disordered in SeMet-GGT-P21. Except for these residues, the structure of SeMet-GGT-P21 is identical with that of GGT-Glu; the Cα atoms of the 529 residues of SeMet-GGT-P21 are superimposable on those of GGT-Glu with the r.m.s. deviation of 0.71 Å. The structure of SeMet-GGT-P21 indicates that when the substrate-binding pocket does not bind substrate or product, the lid-loop of the mature GGT is disordered. As noted previously, the Fo – Fc map for the mature GGT in the orthorhombic crystal (SeMet-GGT) shows a broad electron density in the substrate-binding pocket, suggesting that the pocket is partially occupied by small molecules (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this SeMet-GGT crystal, the neighbor molecule is situated near the lid-loop, which may also contribute to fixing its conformation. Together, the structures of the T391A protein, the γ-glutamyl-enzyme intermediate, and the product-bound form of mature GGT suggest that the substrate-binding pocket of mature GGT is open to the solvent for substrate introduction when the lid-loop is in the flexible form, and that the pocket is shielded by the lid-loop in the closed form when the substrate is bound to the pocket. Implications for the Mechanism of Autocatalytic Processing—Site-directed mutational studies of Ntn hydrolases have indicated that processing of the precursor protein proceeds via a rearrangement of the scissile peptide bond into an intermediate ester bond (N-O acyl shift), and that the ester intermediate is subsequently hydrolyzed to form new C and N terminus of peptides (10Tikkanen R. Riikonen A. Oinonen C. Rouvinen R. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2954-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J.

Henklein P. Frommel C. Lowe J. Huber R. Kloetzel P.M. Schmidt M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6887-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Time-course studies of in vitro processing of T391C and T391S mutant E. coli GGT proteins have demonstrated that precursor processing is an intramolecular autocatalytic event and that the catalytic nucleophile is the Oγ atom of Thr-391 (17Suzuki H. Kumagai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43536-43543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The structure of the T391A protein, a mimic of the E. coli GGT precursor protein, may provide a structural basis for understanding the mechanism of intermediate ester bond formation. A close-up view of the autocatalytic processing site of the T391A protein superimposed with the mature GGT model is shown in Fig. 5. The conformations of Ala-391 of the T391A protein and Thr-391 of the mature GGT are very similar. Biochemical studies have suggested that certain base is present that enhances the nucleophilicity of the Oγ atom of Thr-391 (17Suzuki H. Kumagai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43536-43543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The Fo – Fc map shows that a water molecule (W4) is located near the amide group of Gly-484 in the A molecule of the T391A protein. The distances between W4 and Ser-388 O and W4 and Gly-484 N are 3.2 and 3.3 Å, respectively. When the model of mature GGT is superimposed on that of T391A protein, the distance between W4 and Thr-391 Oγ is estimated to be 2.7 Å (Fig. 5). It is likely that rotation around the Cα-Cβ bond of Thr-391 and displacement of W4 occur in the precursor protein so as to optimize the hydrogen-bonding geometry of W4 with Ser-388 O, Thr-391 Oγ, and Gly-484 N (see supplemental Fig. 2S). In this model, the Oγ atom of Thr-391 is situated on the carbonyl carbon atom between Gln-390 and Thr-391. These findings suggest that W4 may be the base that enhances the nucleophilicity of Thr-391 Oγ. After the attack of Thr-391 Oγ on the Gln-390 C, the carbonyl carbon likely adopts a tetrahedral arrangement. Interestingly, Gln-390 O is hydrogen-bonded to the Oγ atom of Thr-409 (Fig. 5) in the T391A protein; Thr-409 may help stabilize the orientation of Gln-390 O. The collapse of the tetrahedral arrangement of Gln-390 C shifts the linkage from an amide bond between Gln-390 and Thr-391 to an ester bond between the carbonyl group of Gln-390 and the side-chain oxygen atom of Thr-391 (N-O acyl shift). The intermediate ester bond formed by N-O acyl shift is subsequently hydrolyzed, resulting in the production of the L- and S-subunits. It has been reported that a water molecule acts as a base to enhance the nucleophilicity of the catalytic residue during autocatalytic processing of the proteasome β-subunit and cephalosporin acylase, members of the Ntn hydrolase family, on the basis of the crystal structures of their precursor proteins (28Ditzel L.

Mice lacking the high affinity sulfonylurea receptor (Sur1KO), and thus KATP channels, have been developed as a model of congenital hyperinsulinism. Here, we compared [Ca2+]c and insulin secretion in overnight cultured islets from 2-week-old normal and Sur1KO mice. Control islets proved functionally mature: the magnitude and biphasic kinetics of [Ca2+]c and insulin secretion changes induced by glucose, and operation of the amplifying pathway, were similar to adult islets. Sur1KO islets perifused with 1 mm glucose showed elevation of both basal [Ca2+]c and insulin secretion. Stimulation with 15 mm glucose produced a transient drop of [Ca2+]c followed by an overshoot and a sustained elevation, accompanied by a monophasic, 6-fold increase in insulin secretion. Glucose also increased insulin secretion when [Ca2+]c was clamped by KCl. When Sur1KO islets were cultured in 5 instead of 10 mm glucose, [Ca2+]c and insulin secretion were unexpectedly low in 1 mm glucose and increased following a biphasic time course upon stimulation by 15 mm glucose. This KATP channel-independent first phase [Ca2+]c rise was attributed to a Na+-, Cl--, and Na+-pump-independent depolarization of β-cells, leading to Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels. Glucose indeed depolarized Sur1KO islets under these conditions. It is suggested that unidentified potassium channels are sensitive to glucose and subserve the acute and long-term metabolic control of [Ca2+]c in β-cells without functional KATP channels.

Fine control of insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells is critical for glucose homeostasis: excessive release causes hypoglycemia, whereas insufficient insulin leads to diabetes. Glucose exerts its control on β-cells via two major, hierarchical signaling pathways (1Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The triggering pathway requires functional ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels) 2The abbreviations used are: KATP channel, ATP-sensitive potassium channel; SUR1, sulfonylurea receptor 1; [Ca2+]c, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration; DiBAC4(3), bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol. 2The abbreviations used are: KATP channel, ATP-sensitive potassium channel; SUR1, sulfonylurea receptor 1; [Ca2+]c, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration; DiBAC4(3), bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol. to produce the essential rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) through the following sequence of events. When the glucose concentration increases, oxidative glycolysis in β-cells accelerates, leading to changes in cytosolic adenine nucleotides, which close KATP channels in the plasma membrane. The resulting depolarization opens voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, permitting Ca2+ influx and a rise in [Ca2+]c that triggers exocytosis of insulin granules (2Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr.

Simultaneously, glucose activates an amplifying pathway, also termed the augmentation or KATP channel-independent pathway, which does not increase [Ca2+]c further but augments the secretory response to the triggering Ca2+ signal. The mechanisms for this metabolic amplification have not been fully identified but are distinct from neuro-hormonal amplification (1Henquin J.C.

Smaller but distinct effects of glucose in the same model were also demonstrated by others (23Eliasson L. Ma X. Renstrom E. Barg S. Berggren P.O. Galvanovskis J. Gromada J. Jing X. Lundquist I.

Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previous in vitro studies of islets lacking KATP channels have been restricted to adult animals. Because β-cells undergo functional maturation during the postnatal period (25Grill V. Lake W. Freinkel N. Diabetes. 1981; 30: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Bliss C.R. Sharp G.W.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E890-E896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is unclear whether the behavior of adult Sur1KO islets is similar to that of young Sur1KO islets or has been altered by adaptative processes, thereby invalidating all extrapolations to a human pathology of infancy. In the present study we investigated the effects of glucose on islets from 2-week-old Sur1KO and normal mice. Our aim was to determine whether glucose can control insulin secretion in these young β-cells lacking KATP channels and to assess whether such control is exerted via changes in the triggering Ca2+ signal or via the amplifying pathway. In the course of these studies, we discovered that β-cell [Ca2+]c is under acute and long term control by glucose even in the absence of KATP channels. Our observations provide a plausible explanation for the lack of hypoglycemia in Sur1KO mice and indicate that KATP channels are not the only metabolic sensor involved in glucose regulation of Ca2+ influx in β-cells. The study was approved by, and the experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Research Committees of the respective institutions. Solutions and Reagents—The medium used for islet isolation was a bicarbonate-buffered solution containing (in mm): NaCl 120, KCl 4.8, CaCl2 2.5, MgCl2 1.2, and NaHCO3 24. It was gassed with O2:CO2 (94%:6%) to maintain pH 7.4 and was supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 mm glucose. A similar medium was used for most experiments after adjustment of the glucose concentration and addition of test substances. Increases in the KCl concentration (to 10 or 30 mm) were compensated for by decreases in NaCl. Na+-free solutions were prepared by substitution of NaCl and NaHCO3 with choline-chloride and choline-bicarbonate, respectively, and 1 μm atropine was added to prevent the muscarinic effects of choline. Cl--free solutions contained (in mm): sodium isethionate 125, KHCO3 4.8, calcium acetate 3.5, magnesium acetate 1.2, and NaHCO3 19.2. Total calcium was increased from 2.5 to 3.5 mm to maintain the same concentration of ionized Ca2+ as in Cl--containing solutions (27Hermans M.P. Gerard M. Henquin J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 889: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, reagents were from Sigma or Merck AG (Darmstadt, Germany). Diazoxide (a gift from Schering-Plough, Brussels) and tolbutamide were added from freshly prepared stock solutions in 0.1 n NaOH. Nimodipine (a gift from Bayer, Wuppertal, Germany), forskolin (Calbiochem), thapsigargin and ryanodine (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel), and UCL 1684 (Sigma or Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO) were added from stock solutions in Me2SO. Animals—The generation and characteristics of Sur1KO mice have been described previously (16Seghers V. Nakazaki M. DeMayo F. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9270-9277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Controls were C57Bl/6 mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Brussels. The mice were mated in our animal facilities in Brussels. Male and female pups were studied at 13–15 days, the day of birth being counted as day 1. The age distribution was similar in test and control groups: 23, 54, and 23% of Sur1KO group (n = 198), and 29, 48, and 23% of control group (n = 112) at 13, 14, and 15 days, respectively. The pups were taken from the mother and placed under a heating lamp for 60–90 min before being killed by decapitation. Preparation of Islets—Islets from young Sur1KO and control mice were aseptically isolated by collagenase digestion of the pancreas followed by hand selection as described previously for adult mouse islets (28Jonas J.C. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1266-1273PubMed Google Scholar). The islets were then cultured for ∼18 h in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) kept at 37 °C in a 95% air:5% CO2 atmosphere. The culture medium contained 5 or 10 mm glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Measurements of Insulin Secretion and Islet Insulin Content— Cultured islets were distributed in batches of 20–40 before being transferred into perifusion chambers (29Henquin J.C. Nenquin M. Stiernet P. Ahren B. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The islets were then perifused (flow rate, 1 ml/min) at 37 °C with test solutions the composition of which is indicated in the figure legends. Effluent fractions were collected at 2-min intervals and saved for insulin assay using rat insulin as a standard, and ethanol to precipitate bound insulin (30Heding L.G. Diabetologia. 1972; 8: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). At the end of the experiments, the islets were recovered and their insulin content was determined after extraction in acid-ethanol. Fractional insulin secretion rate was then calculated as the percentage of islet insulin content that was secreted per minute. Measurements of Islet [Ca2+]c—Cultured islets were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fura-PE3-AM (2 μm, Teflabs, Austin, TX) for 2 h in control medium containing 5 or 10 mm glucose according to the glucose concentration during the culture. Loaded islets were then placed into the perifusion chamber of a spectrofluorimetric system, equipped with a camera, and with which [Ca2+]c was measured at 37 °C as described previously (31Gilon P. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Measurements of Islet Cell Membrane Potential—Changes in β-cell membrane potential were evaluated using the bisoxonol fluorescent probe DiBAC4(3) (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) which, due to its anionic nature, equilibrates across the plasma membrane according to the membrane potential (32Epps D.E. Wolfe M. Groppi V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 69: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Upon depolarization, DiBAC4(3) enters the cell and binds to intracellular membranes and proteins, which results in an increase in fluorescence (33Brauner T. Hulser D.F. Strasser R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 771: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Conversely, hyperpolarization causes extrusion of the dye and decrease in fluorescence (32Epps D.E. Wolfe M. Groppi V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 69: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 34Langheinrich U. Daut J. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed with albumin-free solutions. Cultured islets were washed for 30 min in albumin-free control medium containing 1 mm glucose. This medium was then replaced by a similar solution supplemented with 300 nm DiBAC4(3) added from a 300 μm stock in Me2SO. 30 min later the islets were transferred to the recording chamber used for [Ca2+]c measurements. The experiments started with a 60-min period of perifusion with a medium containing 1 mm glucose, before addition of test substances. DiBAC4(3) was present at 300 nm in all solutions. Islet fluorescence (excitation at 490 nm and emission at 535 nm) was recorded beginning 10 min before addition of the first test substance. The results are expressed as a percentage of the islet fluorescence under basal conditions. Measurements of Islet cAMP—Cultured islets were distributed in batches and incubated for 60 min in control medium without forskolin (20 islets per batch) or with 1 μm forskolin (7 islets per batch). The glucose concentration was adjusted as required. At the end of the incubation, the islets were quickly washed with ice-cold acetate buffer, containing 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, before being boiled and sonicated in the same buffer. Islet cAMP content was then determined with a commercially available kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as described previously (35Henquin J.C. Meissner H.P. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1125-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Presentation of Results—All experiments have been performed with islets from three to eight different preparations. Results are presented as means ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between the means for Sur1KO and control islets was assessed by unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by a Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons. Characteristics of the Islets of 2-Week-old Control and Sur1KO Mice—Young Sur1KO mice were heavier (6.41 ± 0.06 g) than controls (5.68 ± 0.09 g, p < 0.001), and their glycemia was higher (5.8 ± 0.1 mm, range 2.6–10.3) than that of controls (5.1 ± 0.1 mm, range 2.2–9.6, p < 0.001). Islets of Sur1KO pups contained ∼15% more insulin than those of controls (37.0 ± 1.0 ng/islet, n = 34 versus 30.5 ± 1.0 ng/islet, n = 32, p < 0.001 after culture in 10 mm glucose, and 32.3 ± 1.1 ng/islet, n = 28 versus 28.0 ± 1.3 ng/islet, n = 14, p < 0.05 after culture in 5 mm glucose). We first ascertained that β-cells from young Sur1KO mice did not contain functional KATP channels. After overnight culture in 10 mm glucose, the islets were perifused with a control medium containing 15 mm glucose. In control islets diazoxide, a KATP channel opener, markedly lowered both [Ca2+]c and insulin secretion. Subsequent addition of tolbutamide, a KATP channel antagonist, reversed both effects. Neither [Ca2+]c nor the insulin secretory rate of Sur1KO islets was affected by these drugs, indicating the lack of KATP channels (data not shown). Glucose-induced [Ca2+]c and Insulin Secretion Changes in 2-Week-old Control and Sur1KO Islets Cultured in 10 mm Glucose—When islets from 2-week-old control mice were cultured for ∼18 h in 10 mm glucose and then tested in the absence of forskolin, their [Ca2+]c and insulin responses to high glucose were similar to those previously reported for adult mouse islets (22Nenquin M. Szollosi A. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32316-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Henquin J.C. Nenquin M. Stiernet P. Ahren B. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Gilon P. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Raising the glucose concentration from 1 to 15 mm induced a transient decrease in [Ca2+]c, followed by a large first phase increase, and a second phase characterized by oscillations that are partly masked by averaging (Fig. 1A, thick trace). Glucose-induced insulin secretion was also biphasic, with a large first phase and a flat, sustained second phase (Fig. 1C). When the experiments were carried out in the presence of 1 μm forskolin to raise islet cAMP levels (35Henquin J.C. Meissner H.P. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1125-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), basal [Ca2+]c and the glucose-induced first phase [Ca2+]c rise were unaffected, but steady-state [Ca2+]c was augmented slightly (282 ± 14 nm versus 248 ± 10 nm, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1D, thick trace). In contrast, insulin secretion was augmented during both first phase (∼3-fold) and second phase (∼8-fold) (Fig. 1F, note the different scales in panels C and F). When Sur1KO islets were cultured in 10 mm glucose and then perifused with a medium containing only 1 mm glucose, average [Ca2+]c was elevated compared with control islets (Fig. 1A, thin trace). This difference was larger when the low glucose medium contained forskolin, because [Ca2+]c in Sur1KO islets was further elevated (175 ± 5 versus 142 ± 7 nm, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1D). Upon stimulation with 15 mm glucose, [Ca2+]c in Sur1KO islets abruptly decreased before increasing following a biphasic time course. The initial peak was similar, but the “first phase” was slightly shorter and the steady-state level was lower than in controls (Fig. 1, A and D). However, steady-state [Ca2+]c in Sur1KO islets was significantly higher in 15 than 1 mm glucose, both in the absence (p < 0.001) and presence of forskolin (p < 0.01). Representative examples of these glucose-induced [Ca2+]c changes in Sur1KO islets are shown in Fig. 1 (B and E). Distinct [Ca2+]c oscillations were present in low glucose, and their amplitude and frequency were increased by high glucose, in the absence or presence of forskolin. In line with the elevation of [Ca2+]c, Sur1KO islets cultured in 10 mm glucose-secreted more insulin (p < 0.001) than control islets in the presence of 1 mm glucose (Fig. 1C), and this difference was augmented by forskolin (Fig. 1F). Upon stimulation with 15 mm glucose, the insulin secretory rate initially decreased, as did [Ca2+]c, before increasing ∼6-fold, albeit more slowly than in controls (Fig. 1, C and F). Glucose-induced [Ca2+]c and Insulin Secretion Changes in 2-Week-old Control and Sur1KO Islets Cultured in 5 mm Glucose—We also studied the islets after overnight culture in 5 mm glucose, a concentration closer to the average blood glucose level of the pups. Under these conditions, no insulin secretion could be measured unless the perifusion solutions were supplemented with forskolin. These experiments are presented in Fig. 2. Culturing 2-week-old control islets in the lower glucose concentration affected the acute glucose-induced [Ca2+]c rise as in adult islets studied in the absence of forskolin (31Gilon P. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar): the initial dip was deeper, whereas the first and second phase increases were smaller (compare Fig. 2A and Fig. 1D, thick traces). Glucose-induced insulin secretion was biphasic, however, with 2- to 3-fold smaller responses than after culture in G10 (Fig. 2C). Sur1KO islets were also cultured for ∼18 h in 5 mm glucose and studied in the presence of forskolin. When the perifusion medium contained 1 mm glucose, [Ca2+]c was low, similar to control islets (Fig. 2, A and B). Upon stimulation with 15 mm glucose, [Ca2+]c dropped, then increased following a biphasic time course that was similar to the controls during the first 6 min. The duration of the first phase increase was, however, shorter, and the average steady-state elevation was smaller (Fig. 2A). This second phase was typically characterized by small rapid and large slower [Ca2+]c oscillations (Fig. 2B). The insulin secretory rate of Sur1KO islets in 1 mm glucose was low, similar to controls, and glucose stimulation triggered biphasic insulin secretion, with a small, but well defined first phase and a regularly increasing second phase (Fig. 2C). Under these experimental conditions, glucose clearly induced biphasic responses in β-cells lacking KATP channels. The Amplifying Pathway in 2-Week-old Control and Sur1KO Islets—To test whether the amplifying pathway of glucose stimulation of insulin secretion is functional in young islets, KATP channels were held open by diazoxide during depolarization with 30 mm KCl (1Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). When control islets cultured in 10 mm glucose were perifused in the absence of forskolin, depolarization in low glucose raised [Ca2+]c and stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 3, A and B). Increasing the concentration of glucose to 15 mm induced a transient decrease in [Ca2+]c followed by a return to steady state (Fig. 3A). Simultaneously the insulin secretory rate was doubled (Fig. 3B). Returning to 1 mm glucose in the presence of 30 mm KCl lowered insulin secretion while [Ca2+]c increased slightly. This reversible increase in insulin secretion produced by glucose, without a further increase in [Ca2+]c, indicates that the amplifying pathway is functional in islets from 2-week-old control mice. Amplification of insulin secretion by glucose was also observed in Sur1KO islets cultured in 10 mm glucose and perifused in the absence of forskolin (Fig. 3, A and B) and in both types of islets cultured in 5 or 10 mm glucose and tested in the presence of forskolin (data not shown). Role of cAMP in the [Ca2+]c and Insulin Secretory Changes Induced by Culture of Sur1KO Islets in Low Glucose—The concentration of glucose in the culture medium (5 versus 10 mm) had no impact on the cAMP content of Sur1KO islets whether the test incubations were performed in the absence or presence of forskolin (Fig. 4, C and D). This shows that the lower basal and stimulated [Ca2+]c (Fig. 4, A and B) and insulin secretion (Fig. 4, E and F) after overnight culture in 5 mm glucose cannot be attributed to lower cAMP levels. Comparison of panels C and D in Fig. 4 (note the different scales) shows that 1 μm forskolin markedly augmented cAMP in young Sur1KO islets under all conditions, as previously reported for adult control islets (35Henquin J.C. Meissner H.P. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1125-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and adult Sur1KO islets (36Nakazaki M. Crane A. Hu M. Seghers V. Ullrich S. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3440-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). High glucose (G15) during the incubation increased islet cAMP levels only in the presence of forskolin (Fig. 4D), which indicates that an increase in cAMP could contribute to the responses of Sur1KO islets to 15 mm glucose in the presence of forskolin. However, all other comparisons show that the effects of glucose on [Ca2+]c or insulin secretion are not attributable to changes in cAMP. This conclusion is further supported by a series of experiments using Sur1KO islets cultured in 5 mm glucose and perifused with a medium containing 1 mm glucose and no forskolin, as in Fig. 4A. Acute addition of either 1 μm forskolin, 0.5 mm 8-bromo-cAMP or 25 nm exendin-4 did not evoke any increase in [Ca2+]c, whereas the subsequent application of 15 mm glucose was consistently effective (data not shown). Mechanism of Glucose-induced [Ca2+]c Rise in Sur1KO Islets—In this series of experiments we investigated the possible mechanisms underlying the biphasic increase in [Ca2+]c induced by 15 mm glucose in β-cells lacking KATP channels (Fig. 5A). Non-metabolized (37Hellman B. Idahl L.A. Lernmark A. Sehlin J. Taljedal I.B. Biochem. J. 1974; 138: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) 3-O-methylglucose did not mimic the effect of glucose (not shown). Diazoxide had no effect on basal [Ca2+]c or on the glucose-induced [Ca2+]c rise, and tolbutamide, even at high concentration, was similarly ineffective (Fig. 5, B and C), confirming that the phenomenon is KATP channel-independent. Pretreatment of the islets with thapsigargin, to block the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase and prevent Ca2+ release, suppressed the initial decrease in [Ca2+]c produced by high glucose but did not impair the subsequent [Ca2+]c rise (Fig. 5D). Pretreatment of the islets with 100 μm ryanodine to prev"
https://openalex.org/W2050235487,"Sulfonylurea receptors (SURs) constitute the regulatory subunits of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels). SUR binds nucleotides and synthetic KATP channel modulators, e.g. the antidiabetic sulfonylurea glibenclamide, which acts as a channel blocker. However, knowledge about naturally occurring ligands of SUR is very limited. In this study, we show that the plant phenolic compound trans-resveratrol can bind to SUR and displace binding of glibenclamide. Electrophysiological measurements revealed that resveratrol is a blocker of pancreatic SUR1/KIR6.2 KATP channels. We further demonstrate that, like glibenclamide, resveratrol induces enhanced apoptosis. This was shown by analyzing different apoptotic parameters (cell detachment, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and activities of different caspase enzymes). The observed apoptotic effect was specific to cells expressing the SUR1 isoform and was not mediated by the electrical activity of KATP channels, as it was observed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing SUR1 alone. Enhanced susceptibility to resveratrol was not observed in pancreatic β-cells from SUR1 knock-out mice or in cells expressing the isoform SUR2A or SUR2B or the mutant SUR1(M1289T). Resveratrol was much more potent than glibenclamide in inducing SUR1-specific apoptosis. Treatment with etoposide, a classical inducer of apoptosis, did not result in SUR isoform-specific apoptosis. In conclusion, resveratrol is a natural SUR ligand that can induce apoptosis in a SUR isoform-specific manner. Considering the tissue-specific expression patterns of SUR isoforms and the possible effects of SUR mutations on susceptibility to apoptosis, these observations could be important for diabetes and/or cancer research.

Sulfonylurea receptors (SURs) 2The abbreviations used are: SUR(s), sulfonylurea receptor(s); DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; HEK, human embryonic kidney; SUR1KO, SUR1 knock-out; AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin. are members of the ATP-binding cassette protein family (subfamily C). SURs are known to be the important regulatory subunits of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels). These channels are heteromeric complexes composed of four SUR subunits that surround a central pore formed by four subunits from the KIR6.x family. KATP channels found in various tissues exhibit distinct physiological and pharmacological properties because of the combination of different subunit isoforms (reviewed in Ref. 1Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In addition to two nucleotide-binding domains, SUR possesses binding sites for synthetic KATP channel modulators. The binding sites for blockers and openers are different, but they are linked via complex allosteric interactions (2Bray K.M. Quast U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11689-11692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Schwanstecher M. Brandt C. Behrends S. Schaupp U. Panten U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 106: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because of their nucleotide sensitivity, KATP channels couple the energy metabolism of a cell to the membrane potential. This is important in the pancreatic β-cell, in which closure of KATP channels triggers insulin secretion via membrane depolarization in response to changes in blood glucose levels (4Ashcroft S.J.H. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 187-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5Gribble F.M. Reimann F. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 875-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 6Bryan J. Vila-Carriles W.H. Zhao G. Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S104-S112Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). KATP channel-blocking drugs such as the sulfonylureas and the glinides can promote insulin secretion and are used in the treatment of diabetes type 2. Insulin secretion is also modulated and amplified by other pathways within the β-cell that are, in general, KATP channel-independent (7Doyle M.E. Egan J.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 105-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S48-S58Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, the extent of insulin secretion is also influenced by adaptive variation of the total number of β-cells. It has been observed that β-cell mass is often increased in obese non-diabetic patients and is significantly reduced in patients suffering from diabetes type 2 (9Butler A.E. Janson J. Bonner-Weir S. Ritzel R. Rizza R.A. Butler P.C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). Changes in β-cell mass can be achieved via controlled proliferation or apoptosis, but the molecular mechanisms are unknown (10Efanova I.B. Zaitsev S.V. Zhivotovsky B. Kohler M. Efendić S.

The mechanisms behind this drug-induced cell death have not been clarified, and its in vivo relevance for long-term treatment with lower, therapeutic concentrations remains to be proven. Using a recombinant cell model, we have shown that expression of the pancreatic isoform SUR1 can render cells more susceptible to glibenclamide-induced apoptosis (19Hambrock A. Bernardo de Oliveira Franz C. Hiller S. Osswald H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This effect was not observed in cells expressing the vascular smooth muscle isoform SUR2B or the mutant SUR1(M1289T), in which a single amino acid in the last C-terminal transmembrane helix 17 was exchanged with the corresponding amino acid of SUR2. The objective of this study was to investigate whether SUR1-specific programmed cell death can be induced by more potent apoptotic agents than glibenclamide. We hypothesized that trans-resveratrol (trans-3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene) is a ligand of SUR able to induce SUR1-specific apoptosis similar to glibenclamide. In addition to several other physiological effects, resveratrol has been shown to trigger apoptosis under certain conditions, depending on cell type and concentration. Resveratrol is present in many plants and plant products, e.g. in grapes, nuts, and wines, and as a phytoalexin, it is produced in large amounts in response to stress factors such as fungal infection (for review, see Refs. 20Pervaiz S.

To verify that resveratrol is a ligand of SUR and to compare its binding properties with those of glibenclamide, we performed competition binding assays with membranes from recombinant human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing different SUR forms. In these experiments, [3H]glibenclamide was used as the radioligand and resveratrol as the competitor. Electrophysiological studies on single β-cells were carried out to show that resveratrol blocks pancreatic SUR1/KIR6.2 channels. The apoptotic potency of resveratrol was compared in cells expressing SUR1, SUR2A (cardiac and skeletal muscle isoform), SUR2B, or SUR1(M1289T). The necessity of the additional expression of the pore-forming KATP channel subunit, KIR6.2, for resveratrol-induced apoptosis was investigated in SUR1-expressing HEK293 cells with or without coexpression of KIR6.2. The apoptotic action of resveratrol was analyzed by assessing different apoptotic parameters (cell detachment, nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activity). Because of the variety of different apoptotic cell death programs, we also determined the activities of key caspase enzymes (caspase-8, -9, and -12) to identify the possible induction of a specific pathway. The apoptotic effect of resveratrol was compared with that of etoposide, the action of which is not affected by SUR1 expression (19Hambrock A. Bernardo de Oliveira Franz C. Hiller S. Osswald H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this context, the potential value of resveratrol as a tool for exploring a possible new mechanism for β-cell apoptosis is discussed. Cell Culture—HEK293 cell lines were stably transfected with the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) containing the coding sequence of SUR1 (GenBank™ accession number X97279), SUR1(S1238Y), SUR1(M1289T), SUR2A (accession number D86037), SUR2B (accession number D86038), or SUR2B(Y1206S), or they were transfected with the empty pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). The mutants had been constructed from SUR1 or SUR2B cDNA using the QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene, Amsterdam), and the different cell lines were isolated and cultured according to Hambrock et al. (19Hambrock A. Bernardo de Oliveira Franz C. Hiller S. Osswald H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Transient cotransfections of HEK cells were performed as described (19Hambrock A. Bernardo de Oliveira Franz C. Hiller S. Osswald H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The cell lines HIT-T15 and RIN-m5F (expressing SUR1/KIR6.2 channels) and A-10 (expressing SUR2B/KIR6.2 channels) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing l-glutamine (HIT-T15 and RIN-m5F cells) or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and l-glutamine (A-10 cells) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. The cells were routinely grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 and passaged once a week after trypsin/EDTA detachment. Preparation of Pancreatic Islets—Experiments were performed on pancreatic islets of Langerhans isolated from wild-type C57BL/6 mice (Charles River GmbH, Sulzfeld, Germany) or from SUR1 knock-out (SUR1KO) mice (35Seghers V. Nakazaki M. DeMayo F. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9270-9277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Islets were obtained from male or female mice (age, 20-25 weeks; and weight, 25-35 g) by collagenase IV digestion of the pancreas. After microscopic selection, the islets were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Treatment with Resveratrol or Etoposide—At 60-80% confluence (HEK293 cell lines) or 50-70% confluence (HIT-T15, RIN-m5F, and A-10 cells), cells were treated with resveratrol or etoposide by addition of 10 or 20 μl, respectively, of a stock solution (100 mm resveratrol in Me2SO or ethanol or 50 mm etoposide in Me2SO) to 10 ml of culture medium. In control experiments, 10 or 20 μl, respectively, of solvent was added. Transient transfection of HEK cells or isolation of islets was performed 24 h before treatment. Drug exposure was carried out in at least two culture dishes per single experiment. Quantification of Cell Detachment—The numbers of adherent and detached cells were determined separately with a CASY TT analyzer system (Schärfe System GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany) according to Hambrock et al. (19Hambrock A. Bernardo de Oliveira Franz C. Hiller S. Osswald H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, three 100-μl aliquots from the supernatant of each culture dish were withdrawn for measurement. The adherent cells were then rinsed off with CASY electrolyte solution; the cell suspension was diluted, if necessary; and again, 100-μl aliquots were analyzed in triplicate. Determination of Apoptotic Nuclei—Condensed and fragmented apoptotic nuclei of adherent or detached cells were visualized by Hoechst 33258 (bisbenzimide) staining after paraformaldehyde fixation (3% in phosphate-buffered saline). DNA fragmentation was determined after agarose gel electrophoresis of cytoplasmic DNA isolated from combined adherent and detached cells. Both methods were performed according to Hambrock et al. (19Hambrock A. Bernardo de Oliveira Franz C. Hiller S. Osswald H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To quantify the degree of condensation and fragmentation, the number of total and apoptotic cells (adherent HEK, HIT-T15, or RIN-m5F cells or islet cells) was determined per 50 × 50-μm2 area. This field was randomly chosen within the cell layer or the islets. At least 1000 nuclei in 50-100 different fields were counted per treatment group. Determination of the Activities of Different Caspase Enzymes— The activities of different caspase enzymes were determined by cleavage of specific peptide substrates (DEVD, IETD, LEHD, or ATAD) conjugated to the fluorophore 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) and were monitored by fluorescence emission at 510 nm (excitation at 390 nm) with a Wallac 1420 VICTOR2 multilabel reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Rodgau-Jügesheim, Germany). Caspase activities were calculated as increase in fluorescence per min and normalized to the protein content of each sample. Despite the high substrate specificity of the different caspase isoenzymes, cleavage of the respective peptide substrates by other enzymes with lower affinity cannot be completely excluded. Hence, turnover of a specific substrate is, strictly speaking, due to the activities of “caspase isoform-like enzymes.” For determination of caspase-3 (DEVD-caspase), caspase-8 (IETD-caspase), and caspase-9 (LEHD-caspase) activities, cells were prepared and analyzed as described by Hambrock et al. (19Hambrock A. Bernardo de Oliveira Franz C. Hiller S. Osswald H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and measured at room temperature in 20-min intervals over a total period of 160 min. Caspase-12 (ATAD-caspase) activity was determined using a caspase-12 fluorometric assay kit (MBL International Corp., Woburn, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions at 37 °C in 30-min intervals over a total period of 120 min. The protein concentrations employed in the assays were 0.5-1.0 mg/ml (caspase-3), 0.7-1.5 mg/ml (caspase-8), and 1.3-2.1 mg/ml (caspase-9 and caspase-12). Radioligand Binding Assays—Binding of resveratrol to different SUR forms was determined in heterologous competition experiments using [3H]glibenclamide as the radioligand (SUR1, SUR1(M1289T), and pcDNA controls, 1 nm; SUR1(S1238Y), SUR2B, and pcDNA controls, 4-5 nm; and SUR2B(Y1206S), 3 nm). Resveratrol was dissolved in ethanol and added as the competitor. Membranes prepared from the respective cell lines (SUR1, SUR1(M1289T), and pcDNA controls, 0.05-0.10 mg/ml membrane protein; SUR2B, SUR2B(S1238Y), and pcDNA controls, 0.5-0.7 mg/ml membrane protein; and SUR2B(Y1206S), 0.1-0.2 mg/ml membrane protein) were incubated in the presence of 1 mm MgATP for 15 min at 37 °C, and binding properties were analyzed as described by Hambrock et al. (36Hambrock A. Kayar T. Stumpp D. Osswald H. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S128-S134Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding of [3H]glibenclamide was determined in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled glibenclamide or in membranes from pcDNA control cells. Electrophysiological Experiments—Patch-clamp experiments on single pancreatic β-cells were performed using an EPC 9 amplifier and Pulse software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). A bath solution of 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH) was used. The pipette solution consisted of 130 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 0.65 mm Na2ATP, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.15 adjusted with KOH). Whole cell KATP channel currents were recorded at 25-28 °C and measured at a holding potential of -70 mV and during 300-ms pulses to -80 and -60 mV at 15-s intervals. Pipettes were pulled with a DMZ puller (Zeitz Instruments, Munich, Germany) using borosilicate glass (Clark Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, UK). They had resistances of 3-5 megaohms when filled with pipette solution. The β-cells were obtained by dispersion of isolated pancreatic islets in Ca2+-free buffer containing 135 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm glucose, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH). Cells from at least two different cell preparations were used for each series of experiments. Data Analysis—Data were calculated as means ± S.E. from single experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego). For statistical comparisons, two-tailed unpaired Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance analysis in combination with Tukey's post hoc test were employed as appropriate. The equilibrium inhibition curves were analyzed using the logarithmic form of the Hill equation: y = 100 -A(1 + 10nH(px - pIC50))-1, where A denotes the extent of inhibition; nH is the Hill coefficient; IC50 is the midpoint of the curve, with pIC50 =-log IC50; and x is the concentration of the compound under study, with px =-log x. The IC50 values were converted into inhibition constants (Ki) by correcting for the presence of the radioligand (L) according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation: Ki = IC50(1+LKD-1)-1, where KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the radioligand. Fits of the equation to the data were performed according to the method of least squares using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). For determination of binding data, the parameters from individual experiments were analyzed and averaged assuming that amplitudes and pIC50 values were normally distributed (37Christopoulos A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 351-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Cambrex Bio Science Verviers S.p.r.l. (Verviers, Belgium). All other reagents used for cell culture or molecular biology were obtained from Invitrogen. AFC standards, glibenclamide, Hoechst 33258, and resveratrol were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). DEVD-AFC, IETD-AFC, and LEHDAFC caspase substrate were from BIOMOL International LP (Hamburg, Germany). ATAD-AFC caspase substrate was purchased from International Corp., and etoposide was from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). [3H]Glibenclamide (specific activity, 1.60 TBq (43.3 Ci/mmol)) and Ultima Gold scintillant were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Detachment of HEK293 Cells Expressing Different SUR Forms after Resveratrol Treatment—Fig. 1A compares the effects of resveratrol (100 μm, 24 h of treatment) on HEK293 cells stably transfected with different forms of SUR or on sham-transfected HEK293 control cells (pcDNA control cells). The relatively high concentration of 100 μm was chosen (i) to be able to compare the results of these experiments with those of other experiments performed with the same concentration of glibenclamide (19Hambrock A. Bernardo de Oliveira Franz C. Hiller S. Osswald H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or etoposide; (ii) to see clear effects after a short incubation period; and (iii) to avoid masking or falsifying these effects by side effects such as cell aging, depletion of nutrients, and accumulation of toxic metabolites. Resveratrol-induced cell detachment was enhanced by ∼2-fold in cells expressing SUR1 (but not SUR2B or the mutant SUR1(M1289T)) compared with pcDNA control cells. Detachment of cells expressing SUR2B or SUR1(M1289T) tended to be even slightly but not significantly lower than that of pcDNA control cells. No significant differences were observed in cells expressing the SUR2A isoform after resveratrol treatment compared with SUR2B-expressing or pcDNA control cells, and cell detachment of SUR2A-expressing cells was significantly lower than that of SUR1-expressing cells (SUR2A + resveratrol, 217 ± 41% of the pcDNA/solvent control; SUR2B + resveratrol, 203 ± 49%; pcDNA + resveratrol, 284 ± 39%; SUR1, 626 ± 140%; SUR2A + resveratrol versus SUR2B/pcDNA + resveratrol, p > 0.05; SUR2A + resveratrol versus SUR1 + resveratrol, p < 0.01). Treatment with etoposide (100 μm, 24h) also resulted in cell detachment; but no significant differences were detected between the tested cell lines, and detachment was not enhanced by SUR1 expression (Fig. 1B). Additional experiments were performed to assess the concentration dependence of the resveratrol effect, and the data revealed an obvious correlation between the concentration of resveratrol, time of treatment, and degree of cell detachment (Fig. 2). Differences between SUR1-expressing cells and pcDNA control cells were already seen at concentrations ≥15 μm after 4 days of resveratrol treatment, and these differences were significant at 25 μm (p = 0.0177). The number of detached SUR1-expressing cells after exposure to 20 μm resveratrol for 4 days was comparable with that observed after treatment with 100 μm resveratrol for 24 h. Nuclear Condensation and DNA Fragmentation in SUR-expressing HEK293 Cells after Resveratrol Treatment—Resveratrol treatment (100 μm, 24 h) produced visible changes in nuclei stained with the DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33258; many nuclei of the adherent cells were brightly stained, condensed, and fragmented after exposure to resveratrol, whereas their size, shape, and fluorescence intensity were unchanged after solvent treatment (Fig. 3). These typical signs of apoptosis were very frequent and pronounced in HEK cells expressing SUR1, but occurred only to a small extent in pcDNA control cells or SUR1(M1289T)- and SUR2B-expressing cells (SUR1 + resveratrol, 22.33 ± 1.86% apoptotic nuclei/total number of nuclei; SUR1 + solvent, 1.90 ± 0.67%; SUR1(M1289T) + resveratrol, 6.02 ± 0.90%; SUR1(M1289T) + solvent, 3.18 ± 0.77%; SUR2B + resveratrol, 4.46 ± 0.79%; SUR2B + solvent, 2.53 ± 0.62%; pcDNA + resveratrol, 5.89 ± 1.02%; pcDNA + solvent, 2.10 ± 0.53%; SUR1 + resveratrol versus pcDNA/SUR1(M1289T)/SUR2B + resveratrol, p < 0.001; SUR1 + resveratrol versus SUR1 + solvent, p < 0.001; pcDNA/SUR1(M1289T) + resveratrol versus pcDNA/SUR1(M1289T) + solvent, p < 0.05). In addition, fragmentation of nuclear chromatin, recognized by a characteristic DNA-laddering pattern after agarose gel electrophoresis (fragment length, 400-1500 bp), was observed after resveratrol treatment (data not shown). Etoposide treatment (100 μm, 24 h) also produced changes in nuclear morphology; but no differences were observed between the different cell lines, and the degree of nuclear alterations was comparable with that of pcDNA control cells after resveratrol treatment (data not shown). Changes in the Activities of Caspase Enzymes in SUR-expressing HEK293 Cells after Resveratrol Treatment—The activity of caspase-3 (DEVD-caspase) was significantly elevated among all the resveratrol-treated HEK cell lines in comparison with those after solvent treatment. If resveratrol-induced changes in caspase-3 activity were calculated in the form of “induction factors,” i.e. the ratio of the activity after substance treatment to the activity after solvent treatment, values of 2.14 ± 0.30 (pcDNA), 2.49 ± 0.30 (SUR1), and 1.81 ± 0.20 (SUR1(M1289T)) were obtained (Fig. 4A). Compared with pcDNA control cells, the activity of caspase-3 enzymes after solvent treatment was slightly higher in SUR1-expressing HEK cells and slightly lower in SUR1 mutant-expressing HEK cells, although these differences were not significant. With induction factors of ∼1, caspase-8 activity (IETD-caspase) was obviously not induced (induction factors, 1.02 ± 0.05 (pcDNA), 1.23 ± 0.11 (SUR1), and 0.87 ± 0.08 (SUR1(M1289T)) (Fig. 4B). The activity of caspase-9 (LEHD-caspase) was clearly enhanced, however, after resveratrol treatment, with an additional significant increase"
https://openalex.org/W2079190666,"The genome of Populus trichocarpa contains five methionine sulfoxide reductase A genes. Here, both cytosolic (cMsrA) and plastidial (pMsrA) poplar MsrAs were analyzed. The two recombinant enzymes are active in the reduction of methionine sulfoxide with either dithiothreitol or poplar thioredoxin as a reductant. In both enzymes, five cysteines, at positions 46, 81, 100, 196, and 202, are conserved.

Then Cys202 forms a disulfide bond with the second recycling cysteine Cys196 that is preferentially reduced by thioredoxin.

The production and accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, inherent to metabolic processes such as respiration or photosynthesis or to stress conditions, initiate oxidative reactions that affect the biochemical constituents of the cells (1Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1986; 240: 1302-1309Crossref Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 2Berlett B. Stadman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Living organisms use different strategies to prevent oxidative damage and lethal effects that would result from these compounds. Reactive species are trapped and degraded, or modifications that occur anyway are reversed by repair systems, and finally nonrepaired macromolecules can be degraded and removed. Methionine residues of proteins were shown to be one of the preferred targets of oxidation with the formation of methionine sulfoxide (MetSO) 3The abbreviations used are: MetSO, methionine sulfoxide; Msr, methionine sulfoxide reductase; DTT, dithiothreitol; Trx, thioredoxin; TNB-, thionitrobenzoate. (3Vogt W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Enzymes named methionine sulfoxide reductases were found to catalyze the reduction of MetSO back to methionine residues (4Brot N. Weissbach L. Werth J. Weissbach H.

The consequences of this side-chain modification are variable and can be partial to protein unfolding (6Gao J. Yin D.H. Yao Y. Sun H. Qin Z. Schoneich C. Williams T.D. Squier T.C. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Sometimes surface methionine residues can undergo oxidation without much impact on the protein properties, and this modification can be seen as a mechanism to scavenge oxidative species in a detoxification process based on methionine sulfoxide reductase activity (11Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S. Stadman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15036-15040Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Because of its asymmetric sulfur atom, MetSO exists as two stereoisomeric forms, Met-(S)-SO and Met-(R)-SO. Their reduction back to methionine is catalyzed by two structurally unrelated classes of Msr, MsrAs are specific for Met-(S)-SO, whereas Met-(R)-SO is the substrate of MsrBs. MsrAs and MsrBs display no significant sequence identity and have different three-dimensional structures. Only three MsrA x-ray structures from Escherichia coli, Bos taurus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and two MsrB structures from Neisseria species have been described so far (12Tete-Favier F.

Both classes of Msrs share, for most of them, a similar three-step chemical mechanism, including the following: 1) a nucleophilic attack of the catalytic CysA residue on the sulfur atom of the sulfoxide substrate leading to the formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate and to the release of 1 mol of Met per mol of enzyme; 2) a formation of an intramonomeric disulfide bond between the catalytic CysA and the recycling CysB with a concomitant release of 1 mol of water; and 3) a reduction of the CysA-CysB methionine sulfoxide reductase disulfide bond by thioredoxin (Trx) (Fig. 1) (17Boschi-Muller S.

Nevertheless, for MsrAs, at least three subclasses, based on the number and the position of the recycling Cys residues, have been proposed (20Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Branlant G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2272-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Neisseria meningitidis and M. tuberculosis MsrA represent the first subclass, characterized by the presence of the recycling CysB in the C-terminal end, and the Bacillus subtilis enzyme represents the second one with the CysB located three amino acids behind CysA. The third subclass, represented by E. coli and B. taurus MsrAs, contains two recycling Cys residues in the C-terminal end and requires the formation not of one but of two successive disulfide bonds. The first one is formed between the catalytic CysA and the recycling CysB. The second one, formed between CysB and the second recycling cysteine CysC, is the one preferentially reduced by Trx in the last step (18Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Talfournier F.

The denomination of the catalytic cysteines as CysA, -B, and -C is based on the primary structure order. Most of the MsrAs studied so far are bacterial or mammalian enzymes. In comparison, little has been done concerning plants. Five MsrA-like genes were identified in Arabidopsis thaliana; one encodes chloroplastic isoforms, and another one is predicted to be targeted to the secretory pathway, and three are cytosolic enzymes (21Sadanandom A. Poghosyan Z. Fairbairn D.J. Murphy D.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Romero H.M. Berlett B.S. Jensen P.J. Pell E.J. Tien M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3784-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The expression of the chloroplastic isoform, found mainly in photosynthetic tissues, is strongly induced by illumination of etiolated seedlings and is responsive to various oxidative stress conditions (21Sadanandom A. Poghosyan Z. Fairbairn D.J. Murphy D.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Romero H.M. Berlett B.S. Jensen P.J. Pell E.J. Tien M.

Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 909-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, this plastidial MsrA was also shown to maintain chaperonin activity of a small heat-shock protein Hsp21 by preventing its denaturation and consequently inactivation after methionine oxidation (24Gustavsson N. Kokke B.P. Harndahl U. Silow M. Bechtold U. Poghosyan Z. Murphy D. Boelens W.C. Sundby C. Plant J. 2002; 29: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Finally, the expression of cytosolic MsrAs was also shown to respond to various changing conditions as follows: (i) in the dark period of A. thaliana plants growing in short-day conditions (25Bechtold U. Murphy D.J. Mullineaux P.M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 908-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), (ii) during a pathogen infection by the cauliflower mosaic virus (21Sadanandom A. Poghosyan Z. Fairbairn D.J. Murphy D.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), or (iii) during softening of cold-hardened leaves (26In O. Berberich T. Romdhane S. Feierabend J. Planta. 2005; 220: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The previous reports about the plant MsrAs have focused essentially on their expression patterns, but the catalytic mechanism, in particular that related to Trx-dependent recycling process, and the three-dimensional structure of a plant MsrA have not yet been addressed. One of the first methionine sulfoxide reductase activities that was evidenced for a plant enzyme was established for a chloroplast-targeted MsrA from Brassica napus (28Jacquot J.P. Stein M. Suzuki A. Liottet S. Sandoz G. Miginiac-Maslow M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, the biochemical and catalytic properties of poplar MsrA are presented, in particular those related to the Trx-dependent recycling process. The crystal structure of a poplar MsrA in complex with a mercaptoethanol molecule bound to the catalytic CysA is also reported. Altogether, the data support a Trx-recycling process with formation of a disulfide bond first between the catalytic Cys46 (CysA) and Cys202 (CysC) and then between Cys202 and Cys196 (CysB). This latter disulfide bond was reduced by Trx. The open reading frame sequences encoding a cytosolic MsrA (cMsrA) and a plastidial MsrA (pMsrA) (respective GenBank™ accession numbers AAS46231 and AAS46232) were cloned by PCR into the expression plasmid pET-3d using as templates a root cDNA library of Populus × interamericana (clone Beaupré) and a leaf cDNA library of Populus tremula × tremuloides, respectively. Both reactions also contained Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and the forward and reverse MsrA oligonucleotides described in Table 1. In the pMsrA cloning, a codon for alanine was inserted downstream from the methionine closest to the putative cleavage site and the corresponding N-terminal amino acid sequence starts thus with MANIL. The five cysteines of cMsrA were substituted into serine one by one using either two complementary mutagenic primers per mutation (C46S, C81S, C100S, C196S cMsrA and C46S, C196S pMsrA) (Table 1), using a two-step procedure described previously (28Jacquot J.P. Stein M. Suzuki A. Liottet S. Sandoz G. Miginiac-Maslow M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), or a one-step procedure when the mutation is directly inserted in the reverse primers (C202S cMsrA and C202S pMsrA). In addition, various combinations of cysteine substitutions by serine were also introduced in cMsrA (C81S/C100S; C81S/C100S/C196S; C81S/C100S/C202S; and C81S/C100S/C196S/C202S cMsrAs). The introduction of the mutation in the cDNA sequence was verified by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Cloning and mutagenic oligonucleotidescMsrA forward5′-CCCCCCATGGCAACCAGCACCACCAAT-3′cMsrA reverse5′-CCCCGGATCCTTAACCATAGCATCTAATAGG-3′cMsrA C46S forward5′-GCTCAATTCGGAGCTGGAAGTTTCTGGGGGGTT-3′cMsrA C46S reverse5′-AACCCCCCAGAAACTTCCAGCTCCGAATTGAGC-3′cMsrA C81S forward5′-ACTTACAAGCTGGTATCCACCAACACCACCAAC-3′cMsrA C81S reverse5′-GTTGGTGGTGTTGGTGGATACCAGCTTGTAAGT-3′cMsrA C100S forward5′-TTTGACCCGGAAGTTTCCCCATATACCAACCTC-3′cMsrA C100S reverse5′-GAGGTTGGTATATGGGGAAACTTCCGGGTCAAA-3′cMsrA C196S forward5′-TCTGCTGAAAAAGGTTCCAATGACCCTATTAGA-3′cMsrA C196S reverse5′-TCTAATAGGGTCATTGGAACCTTTTTCAGCAGA-3′cMsrA C202S reverse5′-CCCCGGATCCTTAACCATAGCTTCTAATAGGGTCATTGCA-3′pMsrA forward5′-CCCCCCATGGCTAACATCCTTAGCAAACTAGGC-3′pMsrA reverse5′-CCCCGGATCCTTAGCCATAGCATCGGATTGGATC-3′pMsrA C46S forward5′-TTTGGAGCTGGTTCTTTTTGGGGTGTT-3′pMsrA C46S reverse5′-AACACCCCAAAAAGAACCAGCTCCAAA-3′pMsrA C196S forward5′-GCTGAGAAAGGATCCAATGATCCAATC-3′pMsrA C196S reverse5′-GATTGGATCATTGGATCCTTTCTCAGC-3′pMsrA C202S reverse5′-CCCCGGATCCTTAGCCATAGGATCGGATTGG-3′ Open table in a new tab The recombinant plasmids were used to transform the BL21(DE3) E. coli strain, which also contains the helper plasmid pSBET (29Schenk P.M. Baumann S. Mattes R. Steinbiss H.H. Bio-Techniques. 1995; 19: 196-200Google Scholar). Cultures of 5 liters of a kanamycin-resistant (50 μg/ml) and ampicillin-resistant (50 μg/ml) colony were grown at 37 °C and induced by 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in the exponential phase. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl) containing 20 mm DTT, and lysed by sonication. The soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 30 min). The recombinant wild-type pMsrA was in the soluble fraction and precipitated between 0 and 50% of ammonium sulfate. All the other recombinant proteins were produced essentially as inclusion bodies with only a small soluble part when cultures were grown at 30 °C without induction. When needed, the insoluble fraction was thus resuspended in buffer A in the presence of 20 mm DTT and 8 m urea, centrifuged, and then dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer A containing 500 mm urea for at least 5 h at 5°C (all subsequent steps were realized at that temperature). The extract was centrifuged, and the soluble fraction was dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer A for 5 h and finally centrifuged again. The resulting soluble fraction was purified by exclusion size chromatography onto an ACA 44 column equilibrated in buffer A. The fractions of interest were pooled, dialyzed to remove salts, and separated by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. The recombinant proteins were eluted around 100 mm NaCl using a linear gradient from 0 to 400 mm NaCl. The purity of the proteins was assessed using 15% SDS-PAGE. The protein concentrations were estimated spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of 25,700 m-1 cm-1 for cMsrA and pMsrA. The proteins were stored at -30 °C in buffer A either in the presence of 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol or 25 mm DTT. Crystallization of pMsrA was achieved using the hangingdrop vapor-diffusion method in Linbro multiwell tissue culture plates at room temperature. Many crystallization conditions resulted in very thin needles that were not usable for data collection and were impossible to improve. Only one condition described here gave suitable crystals for x-ray crystallography. The purified enzyme was concentrated to 40 mg/ml in a solution containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA. The crystals were grown from 4-μl droplets composed of equal volumes of the protein solution and of the precipitant solution (10% w/v polyethyleneglycol 6000, 2 m NaCl) and equilibrated against 700-μl reservoirs. Long needles (1 mm) with a thin triangular cross-section (0.03 mm) appeared after 6 weeks. Crystals were briefly soaked in a cryoprotectant solution (10% v/v methylpentanediol mixed with the precipitant solution) and flash-frozen by fast immersion in nitrogen gas stream at 100 K, maintained during the x-ray diffraction experiments performed on beamline BM30A (FIP) at the ESRF. Crystals belong to space group P31 with unit cell parameters a = b = 68.6 Å, c = 40.7 Å and contain one monomer per asymmetric unit. Using a wavelength of 1.009 Å, one native data set was collected up to a resolution of 1.7 Å and processed using DENZO (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar) of the CCP4 program suite. The initial model used in Molrep consisted of the core (41Gly-Pro194) of the E. coli MsrA structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1FF3). The molecular replacement solution was submitted to the Molrep mode and then to the warpNtrace mode of the Arp/wArp5.1 automatic model building and refinement program (32Perrakis A. Morris J.R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). It produced a model that contained four polypeptide chains representing 164 amino acids, with R and Rfree factors of 20.6 and 25.8%, respectively. Manual corrections (in particular, building of the missing residues) and automatic CNS refinement (33Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunsteleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

The final structure corresponds to 183 amino acids among 204 (residues 22Pro-Gly204), 183 water molecules, with R = 19.5%, Rfree = 20.1%.

Open table in a new tab Known concentrations (generally around 25 μm) of recombinant proteins were reduced with 50 mm DTT, extensively dialyzed, and then treated or not with 100 mm l-MetSO for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were then precipitated on ice by addition of 1 volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min. The proteins were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with 2% trichloroacetic acid. The pellets were resuspended in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 2% SDS. The concentrations of the proteins were determined spectrophotometrically at this stage, and then 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) was added to a final concentration of 100 μm, and the absorbance was read at 412 nm 1 h later. The thiol content was determined using a molar extinction coefficient of 13,600 m -1 cm-1 for thionitrobenzoate (TNB-). The sulfenic acid intermediate was characterized spectrophotometrically by using TNB- under nondenaturing conditions, as described previously (18Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Talfournier F. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35908-35913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, progress curves of TNB- disappearance were recorded at 412 nm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA buffer. Enzyme concentrations were 7.35 and 14.7 μm, and the TNB- concentration was 60 μm. The amount of TNB- consumed was calculated using an extinction coefficient at 412 nm of 13,600 m -1 cm-1. NMR Determination of Activity in the Presence of DTT—The catalytic activity was determined by monitoring the reduction of MetSO to Met using DTT as the reducing agent. The concentrations of the substrate and product of the reaction were obtained from the intensity of the resonance signals at 2.65 and 2.15 ppm corresponding to the MetSO methyl resonance and the Met methyl resonance, respectively. The assay conditions were 100 mm phosphate buffer, 50 mm DTT, 20 mm l-Met-(RS)-SO at pH 8.5 in 90/10% H2O/D2O. l-Alanine (10 mm) was used for internal concentration calibration. The enzyme was added directly in the NMR cell, and careful homogenization of the sample was performed just before recording. NMR spectra were recorded with eight scans at 27 °C every 79 s on Varian Inova 400 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance (1H, 13C, and 15N) probe including shielded z-gradients. Data were processed using FELIX 97 (Accelrys). Thioredoxin-dependent Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase Activity—The activity of cMsrA and pMsrA was also measured by following the NADPH oxidation at 340 nm in the presence of Trx and NADPH Trx reductase system. A 500-μl cuvette contained 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 200 μm NADPH, 2 μm A. thaliana NADPH thioredoxin reductase (purified as in Ref. 34Jacquot J.P. Rivera-Madrid R. Marinho P. Kollarova M.

After 1 min of incubation, MsrA was added to the reaction mixture. Poplar Trx h1 was purified as described previously (35Behm M. Jacquot J.P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 38: 363-369Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out at 30 °C with a Cary 50 spectrophotometer. The catalytic parameters for Trx and MetSO were determined at saturating concentrations of the other substrate and adjusted using GraFit. Stoichiometry of Methionine Formation in the Absence of Reductants—The different proteins were reduced by 50 mm DTT and dialyzed twice against 1 liter of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. A typical 200-μl reaction mixture containing 100-400 μm of recombinant proteins and 100 mm l-Met-(RS)-SO was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After adding 2% trifluoroacetic acid to stop the reaction, 100 μl were injected onto a Sephasil C18 column to quantify the concentration of Met formed as described previously (18Boschi-Muller S.

Genome and Sequence Analysis—Among the five isoforms found in the released genome of Populus trichocarpa, two very close genes (86% identity) are predicted to be located in plastids and two other (93% identity) to be cytosolic. Except for the presence of an N-terminal targeting sequence, the four genes are very similar. It is likely that these genes have been actually duplicated two by two. The fifth isoform (EST accession number DT503157) is quite divergent (28Jacquot J.P. Stein M. Suzuki A. Liottet S. Sandoz G. Miginiac-Maslow M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Schenk P.M. Baumann S. Mattes R. Steinbiss H.H. Bio-Techniques. 1995; 19: 196-200Google Scholar, 30Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The cDNA sequences of a chloroplastic and a cytosolic isoform, which we call here conveniently pMsrA (plastidial MsrA) and cMsrA (cytosolic MsrA), were isolated by PCR from poplar leaf and root cDNA libraries, respectively. Based on transit peptide prediction programs and amino acid comparisons with homologous proteins from A. thaliana, pMsrA (260 amino acids for the precursor) is predicted to present a 57-amino acid-long N-terminal chloroplastic transit peptide. The size of the mature recombinant pMsrA devoid of the transit peptide produced here (see “Materials and Methods”) is 204 amino acids (including the initial methionine and an alanine added for cloning facility). The cmsra open reading frame encodes a protein of 190 amino acids. The additional 14 amino acids of the plastidial form are all located in the N-terminal part of the sequence. The two mature enzymes possess 62% strict identity at the amino acid level. Fig. 2 displays an amino acid sequence comparison of various plant MsrAs with enzymes from other kingdoms with known catalytic mechanisms or structures. For the comprehensive analysis of this work, we used the numbering of the recombinant pMsrA both for pMsrA and cMsrA cysteines, although they are not exactly at the same position because of the N-terminal extension in pMsrA. Only the first cysteine at position 46, the catalytic CysA, is conserved among all the sequences presented here. In plants, there are three other strictly conserved cysteines at positions 81, 196, and 202, whereas a fourth at position 100 is present in all sequences but B. napus. The Cys at position 81 is equivalent to Cys86 of E. coli MsrA, which has been shown to play no role in the catalytic mechanism (18Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Talfournier F.

Ernst P. Lo K. Kim G.S. Turck C. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 15Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Ikaros is hypothesized to bind to DNA control elements of target genes and to aid in their recruitment to centromeric foci. This results in activation or repression of the target genes (16Brown K.E. Guest S.S. Smale S.T. Hahm K. Merkenschlager M. Fisher A.G.

Larger Ikaros isoforms like IK-V and IK-VI are thought to act synergistically and to be responsible for Ikaros function in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene expression. Smaller Ikaros isoforms lacking N-terminal zinc fingers do not bind DNA. Heterodimers between large and small isoforms bind DNA poorly, suggesting that small isoforms can act as dominant negative inhibitors of Ikaros (18Sun L. Crotty M.L. Sensel M. Sather H. Navara C. Nachman J. Steinherz P.G. Gaynon P.S. Seibel N. Mao C. Vassilev A. Reaman G.H. Uckun F.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2112-2120PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Malignant transformation is hypothesized to be a direct consequence of altered (or diminished) function of the larger Ikaros isoforms because of overexpression of the smaller, dominant negative ones (18Sun L.

Among these was IK-H, a splice variant of IK-VI that includes an additional 60 bases between exons 2 and 3 (Fig. 1A), thus making it the longest identified Ikaros isoform. (IK-H is designated Ik1+ in the nomenclature of Payne et al. (21Payne K.J. Nicolas J.H. Zhu J.Y. Barsky L.W. Crooks G.M. J.

Whereas IK-H protein is abundantly expressed in primary human B, NK, myeloid, and erythroid cells, it is barely detectable in primary murine hematopoietic cells (21Payne K.J. Nicolas J.H. Zhu J.Y.

Here we report the first functional studies of human Ikaros (hIK) 2The abbreviations used are: hIK, human Ikaros; HA, hemagglutinin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PC-HC, pericentromeric heterochromatin. proteins. For our analyses we used T cells, thus allowing for more valid comparisons between our human data and that obtained in murine studies. We report that the largest human Ikaros isoforms, hIK-VI and hIK-H, exhibit distinct DNA binding abilities and subcellular localization patterns. Increased expression of the largest Ikaros isoform (hIK-H) during T cell activation determines the DNA binding specificity of Ikaros complexes toward repetitive sequences located within PC-HC. We propose a model whereby coordinated expression of the largest Ikaros isoforms regulates Ikaros function in chromatin remodeling. Our results expose unique properties of human Ikaros proteins and suggest that Ikaros function in human hematopoietic cells may occur through more complicated mechanisms than in the mouse. Cells—Human CCRF-CEM (CEM) and MOLT-4 human leukemia T-cell lines, the Ramos B cell line, the human 293T endothelial kidney cell line, and the murine the NIH/3T3 (3T3) fibroblast cell line were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The murine 7OZ3 pre-B cell line, BAL17 B-cell line, and VL3-3M2 thymocyte cell line are a generous gift from the laboratory of Stephen Smale, HHMI, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA. Peripheral primary T cells were isolated from human donor peripheral blood (American Red Cross), or spleen of C57BL/6 mice using the nylon wool column method (23Matikainen S. Sareneva T. Ronni T. Lehtonen A. Koskinen P.J. Julkunen I. Blood. 1999; 93: 1980-1991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T-cell activation with PMA and anti-CD3 has been described previously (23Matikainen S. Sareneva T. Ronni T. Lehtonen A. Koskinen P.J. Julkunen I. Blood. 1999; 93: 1980-1991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies—Specific antibody against hIK-H protein was generated by immunizing rabbits with KLH-conjugated peptide TYGADDFRDFHAIIIPKSF. The resulting rabbit anti-serum was used at 1:1000 dilution. Antibodies used to detect the C terminus (IK-CTS) and the N terminus (IK-NTS) of murine and human Ikaros have been described previously (24Hahm K. Cobb B.S. McCarty A.S. Brown K.E. Klug C.A. Lee R.

Anti-Ikaros antibodies were visualized using FITC-goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The HA-specific mouse monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Covance Research Products, Harrisburg, PA), visualized with Texas Red goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immuno Research), was used to detect HA-tagged Ikaros isoforms. Anti-Helios antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Plasmids, Transfection, and Retroviral Transduction— cDNAs for hIK-VI and hIK-H, were amplified by RT-PCR from human peripheral T-cell total RNA and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Alanine substitution mutants for the hIK-H region N were generated using the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For retrovirus generation, hIK-H or HA-tagged hIK-VI or hIK-H (HA tag in N terminus) were amplified by PCR and cloned between BglII and EcoRI sites of the MSCV IRES GFP (MIG) vector (a generous gift from the laboratory of David Baltimore, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). 293T cells were transfected via the calcium phosphate method. CEM, VL3-3M2 or 3T3 cells were infected with amphotropic retrovirus. Confocal Microscopy—CEM, VL3-3M2, or 3T3 cells were infected with amphotropic retrovirus and analyzed by confocal microscopy as described previously (25Cobb B.S. Morales-Alcelay S. Kleiger G.

Images were acquired at room temperature by a Leica TCS-SP MP Confocal and Multiphoton Microscope with a Leica DM-LFS body (upright fixed-stage microscope) using a ×100 Leica HX PLAPO (Planapo) oil immersion lens with numerical aperture of 1.4 (Heidelberg, Germany). Biochemical Experiments—Nuclear extractions, Western blots, and gel shift experiments were performed as described previously (25Cobb B.S. Morales-Alcelay S. Kleiger G. Brown K.E. Fisher A.G.

Immunoprecipitations with IgG and no antibody were used as negative controls. Chromatin immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μlof sterile H2O, and 2 μl was used in each PCR.

PCR conditions were 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. Final PCR products were analyzed on agarose gels (2%) with ethidium bromide staining. All samples within a particular set (anti-Ikaros antibodies, IgG, and total chromatin control) were analyzed at the same time and electrophoresed on the same agarose gel. Results are representative of three independent experiments. IK-H Is Differentially Expressed in Mouse and Human Lymphoid Cells—Ikaros isoform H (IK-H) contains an additional 20 amino acids (region N) between exons 2 and 3 (Fig. 1A) that is not present in IK-VI (21Payne K.J. Nicolas J.H. Zhu J.Y. Barsky L.W. Crooks G.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1867-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32Nakayama H. Ishimaru F. Katayama Y. Nakase K. Sezaki N. Takenaka K. Shinagawa K. Ikeda K. Niiya K. Harada M. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 1232-1238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because abundant expression of IK-H has been detected in human, but not murine hematopoietic cells (22Payne K.J. Huang G. Sahakian E. Zhu J.Y. Barteneva N.S. Barsky L.W. Payne M.A. Crooks G.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3091-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it was important to study human Ikaros function in a cell type that expressed this isoform. We examined expression of Ikaros isoforms in human and murine lymphoid cell lines using an Ikaros antibody (IK-CTS) that recognizes the C terminus of both mouse and human Ikaros. IK-H was expressed in human T and B cell lines at a level comparable to IK-VI (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–3, whereas its expression was 10-fold lower than expression of IK-VI and IK-V in murine cell lines (Fig. 1B, lanes 4–6). Identical results were obtained using another antibody (IK-NTS) that recognizes the N terminus of mouse and human Ikaros (data not shown). To determine if the differing patterns of Ikaros isoform expression that we observed in murine and human cell lines were characteristic of normal T cells, Ikaros expression was examined in both resting and activated mouse and human primary T cells. In resting, human T cells we found expression of hIK-VI and hIk-V, but not hIK-H; however, following activation, all three isoforms were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–4). Thus, the expression of Ikaros proteins in activated, primary, peripheral human T cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4) is similar to that in human T-cell lines (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–3). Consistent with previous reports, in primary mouse T cells the expression of IK-H was 10-fold lower than expression of mIK-VI or mIK-V (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6), in both resting and activated cells (22Payne K.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 12854-12860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, human, but not murine, activated T cells express abundant IK-H. To verify that the top two bands seen in human T cells were hIK-H and hIK-VI, each isoform was expressed in 293T cells (which do not express endogenous Ikaros), and used as size markers (Fig. 1D). Overexpressed isoforms co-migrated with endogenous proteins in the MOLT-4 human T-cell line, confirming that the two top bands were hIK-H and hIK-VI. A polyclonal antibody against IK-H was prepared using an N region peptide as the epitope. Using MOLT-4 nuclear extract, we show that the IK-H antibody detects only the hIK-H isoform, whereas the IK-CTS antibody detected all of the three large human Ikaros isoforms (Fig. 1E). In studies reported here we will use the IK-H antibody to detect expression and localization of the hIK-H isoform. Specific Amino Acids within Region N Determine the Reduced DNA Binding Ability of IK-H—The potential binding sites for Ikaros within human pericentromeric DNA have not been identified. In mice, the DNA sequence of PC-HC is uniform for all chromosomes. In humans, PC-HC contains different sequences, often unique for each chromosome (34Lee C. Li X. Jabs E.W. Court D. Lin C.C. Chromosoma. 1995; 104: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We designed DNA probes derived from published DNA sequences of human PC-HC and used them to test the DNA binding ability of individual Ikaros isoforms in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (34Lee C.

Thus, to study DNA binding ability of individual isoforms, we used nuclear extracts of 293T cells transduced to express hIK-VI or hIK-H. The 293T cell line does not express Ikaros and it has been shown that transduced Ikaros has identical phosphorylation status and DNA binding abilities in 293T cells as in hematopoietic cells (41Dovat S. Ronni T. Russell D. Ferrini R. Cobb B.S. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2985-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 42Gomez-del Arco P. Maki K. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2797-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, 293T cells are an established model for studying DNA binding (25Cobb B.S. Morales-Alcelay S. Kleiger G. Brown K.E.

Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2797-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both the hIK-VI and the hIK-H isoforms bound the IKBS4 probe that contains two optimal Ikaros binding sites (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3). Both isoforms also exhibited similar DNA binding affinities on probes derived from the γ satellite region of chromosome 8 (γ sat 8) and the beta D repeat (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–9), both of which contained two Ikaros binding sites. However, the DNA binding ability of hIK-VI was stronger than that of hIK-H toward the probes derived from pericentromeric (PC-HC) that contains a single Ikaros consensus binding site: the γ satellite 8-2 region of human chromosome 8 (γ sat 8-2): 8-fold stronger; the consensus α satellite DNA sequence (α Sat): 10-fold stronger; and the CENP-B box: 6-fold stronger (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–9). A similar difference in DNA binding ability was observed when a probe derived from pJ alpha box was used (data not shown), while no binding was observed to the probe derived from γ satellite chromatin of human chromosome X (data not shown). These results reveal DNA binding specificities of human Ikaros within PC-HC and identified potential motifs that target Ikaros to the pericentromeric region of particular chromosomes. To establish whether actual binding of Ikaros isoforms to pericentromeric heterochromatin has occurred in vivo in 293T cells, we performed ChIP assays. Results showed that hIK-VI, expressed individually in 293T cells, binds in vivo to the pericentromeric repeats that contain two Ikaros binding sites (γ sat 8), as well as to the repeats that contain a single Ikaros binding site (γ sat 8-2, α sat and CENP-B) (Fig. 2C). ChIP assays show that the hIK-H isoform, expressed individually, binds in vivo a pericentromeric region that contains two Ikaros binding sites (γ sat 8), but not regions with a single Ikaros binding site (Fig. 2C). These data confirm that results observed by EMSA correlate to in vivo binding of Ikaros isoforms in 293T cells. We compared the DNA binding ability of murine and human Ikaros isoforms. The largest difference in binding ability was observed using a probe containing two Ikaros bindings motifs (from murine γ satellite A PC-HC) separated by 40 base pairs (Fig. 2D, probe IKBS40; lanes 1–4). Human IK-VI showed a DNA binding affinity over 10-fold that of murine IK-VI and 8 times that of hIK-H. Possible explanations for the observed data include an increased ability of hIK-VI to form multimers, which would enable it to bind to the probe containing two distant consensus sites, or increased affinity of hIK-VI toward a single Ikaros consensus site. To distinguish between these possibilities we tested the ability of Ikaros isoforms to bind a probe containing a single Ikaros binding site (supplemental Fig. S1A, lanes 1–4). The DNA binding ability of hIK-VI was 10-fold that of hIK-H, whereas mIK-VI was unable to bind the single site probe. These data suggest that the increased DNA binding ability of hIK-VI compared with mIK-VI and hIK-H is at least partly caused by increased affinity for the DNA contained in a single consensus Ikaros binding site. Human IK-H has identical amino acid sequence to hIK-VI except for the presence of region N, yet hIK-H has decreased DNA binding ability compared with hIK-VI. If the presence of specific amino acids within region N interferes with DNA binding, mutation of these should give hIK-H the ability to bind DNA with affinity similar to hIK-VI. Alanine-scanning mutations of region N were performed, and mutants were tested for DNA binding ability. Initially, two consecutive amino acids within region N were mutated to alanine. Results (Fig. 2D, lanes 5–14 and supplemental Fig. S1A, lanes 5–14) identified two pairs of amino acids whose mutation to alanine gave hIK-H the ability to bind DNA. Point mutations of glycine, phenylalanine, and to a lesser extent, histidine, were able to restore the DNA binding ability of mutated hIK-H when either IKBS40 (Fig. 2E) or the single site probe (supplemental Fig. S1B) was used in EMSA. Mutation of tyrosine did not seem to affect DNA binding ability. Thus, three specific amino acids within region N (Fig. 2F) are responsible for decreased DNA binding of hIK-H compared with hIK-VI. Human IK-H Exhibits Dual Centromeric and Noncentromeric Localization—In murine lymphocytes, Ikaros localizes to centromeric heterochromatin where it is hypothesized to recruit genes destined for inactivation (16Brown K.E.

We used confocal microscopy to examine subcellular localization of the largest human Ikaros isoforms (Fig. 3). To distinguish the localization pattern of hIK-VI from hIK-H, the CEM leukemia T-cell line was transduced to express HA-tagged hIK-VI. Subcellular localization of hIK-VI was detected using antibodies against the HA tag (red), whereas localization of endogenous hIK-H was detected with isoform-specific IK-H antibodies (green).

However, the absence of Fen1 in yeast results in a significant increase in trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion. There are then two possibilities. One is that TNRs do not always form stable secondary structures or that FEN-1 has an alternative approach to resolve the secondary structures. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that concerted action of exonuclease and gap-dependent endonuclease activities of FEN-1 play a role in the resolution of secondary structures formed by (CTG)n and (GAA)n repeats. Employing a yeast FEN-1 mutant, E176A, which is deficient in exonuclease (EXO) and gap endonuclease (GEN) activities but retains almost all of its flap endonuclease (FEN) activity, we show severe defects in the cleavage of various TNR intermediate substrates. Precise knock-in of this point mutation causes an increase in both the expansion and fragility of a (CTG)n tract in vivo. Taken together, our biochemical and genetic analyses suggest that although FEN activity is important for single-stranded flap processing, EXO and GEN activities may contribute to the resolution of structured flaps. A model is presented to explain how the concerted action of EXO and GEN activities may contribute to resolving structured flaps, thereby preventing their expansion in the genome.

One is that TNRs do not always form stable secondary structures or that FEN-1 has an alternative approach to resolve the secondary structures. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that concerted action of exonuclease and gap-dependent endonuclease activities of FEN-1 play a role in the resolution of secondary structures formed by (CTG)n and (GAA)n repeats. Employing a yeast FEN-1 mutant, E176A, which is deficient in exonuclease (EXO) and gap endonuclease (GEN) activities but retains almost all of its flap endonuclease (FEN) activity, we show severe defects in the cleavage of various TNR intermediate substrates. Precise knock-in of this point mutation causes an increase in both the expansion and fragility of a (CTG)n tract in vivo. Taken together, our biochemical and genetic analyses suggest that although FEN activity is important for single-stranded flap processing, EXO and GEN activities may contribute to the resolution of structured flaps. A model is presented to explain how the concerted action of EXO and GEN activities may contribute to resolving structured flaps, thereby preventing their expansion in the genome. Trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) 2The abbreviations used are: TNR, trinucleotide repeat; EXO, exonuclease; GEN, gap endonuclease; nt, nucleotide(s); WT, wild type; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; pol, polymerase; FEN, flap endonuclease. 2The abbreviations used are: TNR, trinucleotide repeat; EXO, exonuclease; GEN, gap endonuclease; nt, nucleotide(s); WT, wild type; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; pol, polymerase; FEN, flap endonuclease. are a member of a class of DNAs termed microsatellites, which are composed of multiple repeats of a 1–6-bp DNA motif in a head to tail configuration (1Toth G. Gaspari Z. Jurka J. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 967-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). TNR expansion at specific gene regions interferes with the expression or properties of their gene product and can manifest in disease. The expansion of TNRs is associated with at least 20 neurological disorders, including Huntington disease, fragile X syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, and Friedreich's ataxia (2Gatchel J.R. Zoghbi H.Y. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Stretches of (CAG)n and (CGG)n are more prone to secondary structure formation than (AGG)n, (AGT)n, and (CAA)n (3Moore H. Greenwell P.W. Liu C.P. Arnheim N. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, CAA/GTT repeats form no hairpins in vitro (6Spiro C. Pelletier R. Rolfsmeier M.L. Dixon M.J. Lahue R.S. Gupta G. Park M.S. Chen X. Mariappan S.V. McMurray C.T. Mol.

All but one of the diseases, Friedreich's ataxia, occurs due to the expansion of GAA repeats in the first intron of the human frataxin gene (8Campuzano V. Montermini L. Molto M.D. Pianese L.

Thus, multiple structures may play a role in genomic instability. The location of the secondary structure with respect to leading/lagging and nascent/template strands is also important in determining the repeat stability (15Freudenreich C.H. Stavenhagen J.B. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 16Miret J.J. Pessoa-Brandao L. Lahue R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12438-12443Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In vivo studies of TNR stability have taken advantage of model systems in Escherichia coli, yeast, mice, and cell lines. Processes implicated in repeat tract instability include replication slippage, the direction of replication fork progression, lagging strand errors, Okazaki fragment processing, mismatch repair, gap filling, double strand break repair, and recombination (17Cleary J.D. Pearson C.E. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2003; 100: 25-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and any combination of them may result in significant TNR expansion and a disease phenotype in higher organisms. Much attention has been focused on aberrations in DNA replication, a major source of TNR instability in proliferating cells. Chromosomal replication faces many obstacles during replication fork progression that could destabilize the genome and prove fatal if not overcome. One such obstacle stems from DNA secondary structure formation during replication. Studies have shown that TNRs associated with human diseases form stable secondary structures in vivo. Using an assay for hairpin formation, Moore et al. (3Moore H. Greenwell P.W. Liu C.P. Arnheim N. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1504-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) showed that CAG, CTG, CCG, or CGG heteroduplex loops are inefficiently repaired during meiotic recombination and were copied during the next round of DNA replication. In contrast, AAG/CTT or CAA/TTG loops did not form hydrogen-bonded structures and were therefore removed (3Moore H. Greenwell P.W. Liu C.P. Arnheim N. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1504-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). GAA/TTC repeats that cause Friedreich ataxia have also been shown to be destabilized during DNA replication (18Wells R.D.

However, non-structure-forming GTT repeats have a 1,000-fold lower expansion rate relative to hairpin forming CNG repeats (6Spiro C. Pelletier R. Rolfsmeier M.L. Dixon M.J. Lahue R.S. Gupta G.

This suggests that secondary structures can form in vivo and impair replication/repair enzymes. Studies in model organisms, such as S. cerevisiae, have shown that mutations in DNA replication enzymes, particularly Rad27 (yeast FEN-1 homolog), lead to TNR instability (6Spiro C. Pelletier R.

Rad27/FEN-1 is a multifunctional nuclease that plays a critical role in maintaining genome stability through RNA primer removal and long patch base excision repair. The role of FEN-1 in replication is well studied. During Okazaki fragment maturation, a 5′-flap is generated by polymerase δ (pol δ) strand-displacement synthesis. FEN-1 recognizes and cleaves the 5′-flap to create a nick, which is then ligated. FEN-1 interacts and works in a coordinated manner with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, pol δ, replication protein A, DNA ligase I, and DNA2 for efficient Okazaki fragment processing. In addition to its 5′-flap endonuclease activity (FEN), FEN-1 is also known as an obligate double-stranded DNA 5′ to 3′ exonuclease (EXO) that cleaves nick, gap, and 5′-recessed DNA as well as blunt ended DNA to a lesser extent (41Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 42Shen B. Singh P. Liu R. Qiu J. Zheng L. Finger L.D. Alas S. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recently, FEN-1 was also shown to possess a gap endonuclease (GEN) activity (29Parrish J.Z. Yang C. Shen B. Xue D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3451-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The GEN activity of FEN-1 cleaves the template strand of a gapped DNA fork and bubble substrates that mimic a stalled DNA replication fork (29Parrish J.Z. Yang C. Shen B. Xue D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3451-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Zheng L. Zhou M. Chai Q. Parrish J. Xue D. Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Yannone S.M. Chen D. Shen B. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). All three activities are reported to be important for the function of FEN-1 in replication, recombination, repair, and probably apoptosis (29Parrish J.Z. Yang C. Shen B. Xue D.

Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2349-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that FEN activity can only occur when FEN-1 can track along a single-stranded DNA flap but not double-stranded DNA to reach the cleavage site (31Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 32Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). If a hairpin or loop structure is formed by the displaced α-segment (the RNA primer and DNA segment that is synthesized by polymerase α), the FEN activity is inhibited. If that is the case in vivo, then the presence or absence of the Rad27 nuclease in yeast should make no difference in the rate of expansion during replication of the repeated sequence, such as (CTG)n. However, the expansion of (CTG)n in rad27 null mutants was 180-fold higher than in wild type yeast cells in the assay system employed by Spiro et al. (6Spiro C. Pelletier R. Rolfsmeier M.L. Dixon M.J. Lahue R.S. Gupta G. Park M.S. Chen X. Mariappan S.V. McMurray C.T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1079-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The results illustrate the dynamics of the hairpin structure formation and more importantly demonstrate that Rad27 nuclease plays a role in resolving the intrinsic secondary structure of the displaced α-segment of Okazaki fragments. We therefore hypothesize that Rad27 may use an alternative pathway to resolve the α-segment when a stable secondary structure is built in. We propose that the concerted action of EXO and GEN activities of Rad27/FEN-1 can resolve various secondary structures in eukaryotic cells. By screening a pool of more than 100 point mutations of FEN-1 (30Zheng L. Zhou M. Chai Q. Parrish J. Xue D. Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Yannone S.M. Chen D. Shen B. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), a human FEN-1 allele, FEN-1-E178A was characterized to abolish over 95% of the GEN activity and some of its EXO activity while it retained most of the FEN activity on 5′ double flap substrates. The substitution of glutamate at position 178 with alanine may cause a slight protein conformational change that alters substrate binding affinity, thereby biasing its nuclease activity profile. The E178A mutation is an ideal point mutation to study the effect of the loss of GEN and EXO activities on TNR expansion. The particular residue Glu178 is highly conserved across different species and lies near the active center important for catalysis. Since hFEN-1 and Rad27 share considerable sequence homology and are functionally conserved, we knocked the analogous point mutation E176A into the yeast genome. The point mutation led to considerable TNR instability and fragility but showed no mutator phenotype or sensitivity to UV or DNA-alkylating agents. We also purified the mutant and wild type yeast proteins to correlate the phenotype with the loss of each biochemical activity. Our study suggests that FEN activity is important for flap processing, whereas EXO and GEN activities may contribute to the resolution of the structured flap during Okazaki fragment maturation. Protein Expression and Purification—The construction of the protein expression vector encoding the His6-tagged wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad27 is as previously described (18Wells R.D.

The plasmid for expression of the His6-tagged Rad27-E176A mutant protein was generated by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using primers E176AF (TATGCCGCAGCAAGTGCAGATATGGACACACTC) and E176AR (GAGTGTGTCCATATCTGCACTTGCTGCGGCATA) (the substituted codon is underlined). The pET28b vector containing Rad27 and the mutant gene was transformed into E. coli Rosetta cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for overexpression. The protein expression was performed as previously described, and all purification steps were carried out at 4°C (18Wells R.D. Parniewski P. Pluciennik A. Bacolla A. Gellibolian R. Jaworski A. J.

To purify His6-tagged Rad27 or E176A, the harvested cells were lysed in 50 ml of Bugbuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen, San Diego, CA) containing two tablets of complete EDTA free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 50 μl of benzonase nuclease (Novagen, San Diego, CA), 5 mg of lysozyme, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The cell lysate was subsequently spun at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. An aliquot of 5 m NaCl was added to the cleared lysate to bring the final concentration of NaCl to 1 m and incubated on ice for 15–20 min. The lysate was again spun to obtain a clear supernatant containing recombinant Rad27 or E176A, which was then purified using a HisTrap™ FF column (Amersham Biosciences) according to a previously published protocol (18Wells R.D.

The fraction of interest was dialyzed overnight into buffer A (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.5% inositol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 30 mm KCl). The sample was then applied to a SP Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm MES, pH 6.0, with 0.02% sodium azide and 1 mm dithiothreitol). His6-tagged Rad27 or E176A was then eluted with buffer B using a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m). The fraction of interest was dialyzed overnight into buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 15% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The protein was quantified by Bradford Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad) using the microtiter plate assay and IgG as the protein standard. Nuclease Assays—32P-Labeled DNA substrates were prepared according to a previously described protocol (34Liu R. Qiu J. Finger L.D. Zheng L. Shen B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1772-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used for substrate preparation are specified in each experiment, and corresponding sequences are summarized in Table 1. The FEN, GEN, and EXO nuclease activities of Rad27 and E176A were assayed as previously described (30Zheng L. Zhou M. Chai Q. Parrish J. Xue D. Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Yannone S.M. Chen D. Shen B.

Briefly, an indicated concentration of Rad27 or E176A was incubated with FEN, GEN, or EXO DNA substrates, respectively, in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 5 mm Mg2+, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min if not specified. DNA substrates and cleavage products were resolved by DNA-sequencing PAGE, visualized with a PhosphorImager, and semiquantified with the ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).

The rad27 deletion mutant strain was made by PCR-based gene disruption with the KanMX module as described by Wach et al. (35Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). The point mutation E176A was knocked in by using the two-step gene replacement strategy (36Scherer S. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl.

Assays for trinucleotide repeat stability and fragility were done as described by Liu and Bambara (37Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13728-13739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mutator and Sensitivity Assays in Yeast—Mutation rates for the accumulation of Canr mutants and Hom+, Lys+ revertants were determined by fluctuation analyses by the method of the median (38Lea D.E.

Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). All rates are the average of two or three independent experiments. Mutation spectra were determined by DNA sequence analysis as previously described (39Marsischky G.T. Filosi N. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.

Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 364-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rad27-E176A Is Deficient in EXO and GEN Activities— FEN-1 possesses three activities that vary in efficacy, with FEN activity being the strongest and GEN activity being the weakest. As a result, increasing amounts of the proteins have to be used to visualize these activities in vitro. For biochemical characterization of Rad27-E176A and Rad27 proteins, the wild type and mutant proteins were overexpressed in E. coli cells and purified to >95% purity. Various substrates (i.e. double flap, nick, and gap) were tested. A double-flap substrate with a 1-nt 3′-flap is the optimal substrate for FEN-1 where the enzyme cuts at the base of the flap using its FEN activity (45Kao H.I. Henricksen L.A. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J.

Two sets of experiments (concentration-dependent and time course) were done to quantify the three activities. The results showed that the mutant E176A lost ∼40% of EXO (Figs. 1B and 2B) and ∼95% of GEN activity (Figs. 1C and 2C), whereas the FEN-1 activity was almost the same as wild type Rad27 protein (Figs. 1A and 2A).FIGURE 2Activities of Rad27 and E176A on double flap, nick, and gap substrates. DNA substrates were labeled with 32P as indicated. Labeled substrates (1 pmol) were incubated with purified recombinant Rad27 proteins (WT or E176A), at 37 °C for different time points (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min).

To test if the flap length has any effect on the FEN activity of WT and mutant proteins, substrates with flaps of different lengths (5, 20, and 40 nt) were tested. In the presence of a 3′-flap, the activity of the wild type protein is similar on flaps of all three lengths (5, 20, and 40 nt). The mutant protein has no significant difference in the activity as compared with the wild type protein, suggesting that E176A has almost intact FEN activity (Fig. 3). Mutant Enzyme E176A Cannot Process (CTG)20 Hairpin Structures as Efficiently as Wild Type Protein—We further tested the defect in EXO and GEN activities of Rad27-E176A with various probable TNR intermediate substrates (Fig. 4).

Here we employ the same (CTG)20 hairpin substrate labeled at 5′- and 3′-ends to compare the cleavage efficiencies of WT and mutant proteins. To test the activity on hairpin substrates in our experiments, 400 fmol of protein was used. This substrate is an intermediate for TNR expansion that, if not resolved, can integrate into the genome. On this substrate, EXO activity cleaves nucleotides from the 5′-end of the hairpin (Fig. 4A), creating a substrate for gap-dependent endonuclease activity. W"

In this study we have defined a sequence in the β2-adrenergic receptor cytoplasmic tail that confers Hrs dependence on receptor recycling. This sequence resembles acidic dileucine class motifs found in other membrane proteins but is structurally and functionally distinct from previously identified sorting sequences. Mutation of the novel sorting sequence rendered plasma membrane recycling independent of Hrs and independent of a distal PDZ ligand required for Hrs-dependent recycling.

Sorting of endocytosed receptors to lysosomes contributes to down-regulation of receptor number and prolonged attenuation of cellular signaling. In contrast, recycling of endocytosed receptors to the plasma membrane restores surface receptor number and promotes rapid functional recovery (resensitization) of cellular responsiveness to ligands (2Sorkin A. von Zastrow M.

This process of “sequence-directed” recycling differs from “default” recycling of many other integral membrane proteins, such as the transferrin receptor, which occurs in the absence of any known cytoplasmic determinant and apparently by bulk membrane flow (12Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 13Gruenberg J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Sequence-directed recycling has been studied in some detail for the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2ADR), a GPCR for which the physiological importance of this membrane pathway has been particularly well established (4Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar).An early clue to the existence of the specialized recycling mechanism was the observation that efficient recycling of the β2ADR requires a C-terminal sequence conforming to a type 1 PDZ ligand that also binds the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor. Mutation of this “recycling signal,” or disruption of cytoplasmic protein interactions with this domain, profoundly impairs recycling of the β2ADR (5Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 6Cong M. Perry S.J. Hu L.A. Hanson P.I. Claing A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).We have recently demonstrated another fundamental distinction between default and sequence-directed recycling. The endosome-associating protein hepatocyte-growth factor receptor substrate (Hrs) is essential for sequence-directed recycling of the β2ADR (16Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), in addition to the previously established role of Hrs in targeting membrane cargo to lysosomes for degradation (17Gruenberg J. Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In contrast, receptors that recycle by a default mechanism do not require Hrs, as shown for the transferrin receptor and a truncated mutant V2 vasopressin receptor, V2R 362T (16Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Gillooly D.J. Madshus I.H. Stang E. Stenmark H. Nat.

Therefore, we proposed a model where Hrs controls sequence-directed recycling of receptors through shared endocytic compartments mediating default recycling of other membrane cargo (16Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).This model raises a primary issue in understanding how entry into this specialized recycling pathway occurs. Mutation of the C-terminal PDZ ligand (5Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 6Cong M. Perry S.J. Hu L.A.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), strongly inhibits recycling of internalized receptors. Remarkably, neither of these manipulations produce default recycling of receptors, which is the trafficking phenotype expected in the absence of endocytic sorting signals (12Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). These considerations lead to the question of whether the β2ADR contains additional sorting information, which directs endocytosed receptors to traffic via the Hrs-dependent mechanism and effectively prevents receptor recycling by default.In this study we identify a novel sorting sequence, present in a conserved region of the β2ADR cytoplasmic tail, that “switches” the mode of receptor recycling from default to Hrs-dependent mechanisms. These results provide fundamental insight to the regulated membrane trafficking of a prototypic GPCR and reveal a new type of endocytic sorting sequence.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Isoproterenol and alprenolol were obtained from Sigma. [Arg8]Vasopressin was obtained from Bachem.Eukaryotic Expression Constructs and siRNA Oligonucleotides—FLAG-human β2-adrenergic receptor (β2ADR) and FLAG-human V2 vasopressin truncation mutant (V2R 362T) have been described previously (5Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 20Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The Myc-tagged Hrs in pcDNA3 was a gift from Harald Stenmark (Norwegian Radium Hospital, Norway). The HA-tagged chimera of V2R/β2ADR-(340–413) was a gift from Marc Caron (Duke University, Durham, NC) (21Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The V2R 362/β2ADR-(366–413) chimera was constructed by introducing an EcoRV site in the full-length V2R at residue 362 by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange®, Stratagene). The mutated V2R was digested with EcoRV/XbaI and ligated with a β2ADR C-tail fragment (residues 366–413) produced by digestion of full-length β2ADR with EcoRV and XbaI (β2ADR has an endogenous EcoRV site at residue 366). V2R 362/β2ADR-(410–413) and -(404–413) were created by ligation of a linker corresponding to the last 4 or 10 amino acid residues of the β2ADR (flanked by EcoRV and XhoI overhangs), with EcoRV/XhoI-digested V2R as above. Acidic dileucine sequences in full-length β2ADR and V2R 362/β2ADR chimeras were mutated to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). Addition of C-terminal alanine to V2R 362/β2ADR chimeras was carried out by site-directed mutagenesis. All constructs were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing.Control and Hrs siRNA duplex RNA oligonucleotides (Qiagen) were used as described previously and validated (16Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Bache K.G. Raiborg C. Mehlum A. Stenmark H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 22522-22531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To further confirm Hrs knockdown specificity, a distinct siRNA directed against a second target sequence in the human Hrs transcript (GCACGTCTTTCCAGAATTCAA) was also used.Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine (0.3 mg/ml), and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and cells were assayed 24 h posttransfection except for siRNA transfections, where cells were assayed 72 h post-transfection.Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Imaging—Visualization of FLAG receptors and myc-Hrs was carried out using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of HeLa cells. Surface receptors were labeled by exposing intact cells to rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000, Sigma) for 20 min at 37 °C, prior to incubation for an additional 20 min in the absence (untreated condition) or presence of the appropriate agonist (10 μm isoproterenol or AVP) to promote endocytosis of labeled receptors. Cells were then washed extensively and further incubated in media for 1 h (agonist washout condition) to allow for recycling. To visualize PDZ-dependent recycling of internalized receptors, FLAG-tagged receptors were fed with mouse anti-FLAG M1 antibody (1:1000, 20 min; Sigma) at 37 °C, prior to agonist stimulation as above. Agonist-treated cells were washed four times in PBS, 0.04% EDTA to selectively remove antibody bound to residual surface receptors, and cells were then incubated in agonist-free media for 60 min at 37 °C. For all experiments, cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde freshly dissolved in PBS, incubated in blocking solution (PBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum, pH 7.4), and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. For myc-Hrs-expressing cells, mouse anti-Myc antibody (1:500; Upstate) was added in blocking solution for 60 min. Specimens were washed in PBS and then incubated for 30 min with goat anti-mouse Texas Red and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibodies (1:1000, Molecular Probes) in blocking solution. Specimens were washed extensively in PBS, mounted on glass slides, and examined using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser microscope with an oil immersion 63x/NA1.3 objective, using instrument settings verified to produce negligible bleed through between channels and an estimated section thickness of 1 μm. Micrographs shown are representative optical sections imaged through the center of the cell.Flow Cytometry—Fluorescence flow cytometry was used to quantitate internalization and recycling of receptors by measuring levels of cell surface FLAG-tagged receptor as described previously (16Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, adherent cells were surface-labeled with anti-FLAG or anti-HA (for V2R/β2ADR-(340–413)) antibody (20 min, 37 °C) prior to incubation in the absence (untreated condition) or presence of the appropriate agonist (10 μm isoproterenol or AVP, 20 min). Cells were chilled on ice to stop subsequent receptor trafficking (agonist-treated condition) or washed and subsequently incubated at 37 °C in the absence of agonist for the indicated time period (washout condition). Cells were then lifted with 0.05% trypsin/PBS, washed with ice-cold PBS, 2% fetal calf serum, and incubated for 40 min on ice with anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to either phycoerythrin (1:50) (Sigma) or Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500) (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence intensity profiles of cell populations (10,000 cells/sample) were measured using a FACS-Calibur instrument (BD Biosciences). In each experiment, duplicate treatments were analyzed for each condition. All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate (number indicated in figure legends), and values reported were derived from the mean determination across experiments. The percentage of receptor recycling was calculated from mean surface receptor fluorescence values (F) as follows: % recycling = (Fwashout - Fagonist-treated)/(Funtreated - Fagonist-treated) × 100.Western Blotting—Immunoblotting to detect total cellular levels of Hrs was carried out as described previously (16Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Hislop J.A. Marley A. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22522-22531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in extraction buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 30 min) and then mixed with SDS sample buffer for denaturation. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed for Hrs (1:2000; Alexis Biochemicals) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:40,000; Chemicon) by immunoblotting using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:5000; Amersham Biosciences) and SuperSignal detection reagent (Pierce).Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined using paired Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSThe C-terminal PDZ Ligand Present in the β2ADR Cytoplasmic Tail Is Not Fully Sufficient to Confer Hrs-dependent Recycling on a Chimeric Mutant Vasopressin Receptor—Previous studies defined a minimal recycling signal, contained within the distal 4–10 residues of the β2ADR C-terminal tail (C-tail), which is necessary for efficient recycling of the β2ADR and sufficient to re-route a distinct GPCR from lysosomal to recycling pathways (5Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 6Cong M. Perry S.J. Hu L.A. Hanson P.I. Claing A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

We recently showed that a sequence corresponding to residues 366–413 of the β2ADR C-tail, which includes these distal residues, is sufficient to confer Hrs-dependent recycling when fused to a truncated mutant V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R 362T) that otherwise recycles by default and in an Hrs-independent manner (16Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13096-13103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus we asked whether the distal recycling signal is sufficient, by itself, to confer Hrs dependence on V2R 362T recycling. To begin to address this question, we examined the endocytic trafficking of a series of functional V2R/β2ADR chimeras and took advantage of the fact that overexpression of a Myc-tagged Hrs construct (myc-Hrs) acts as a dominant negative to selectively inhibit Hrs-dependent recycling of receptors (16Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).All chimeric receptors tested exhibited rapid agonist-induced internalization, which was evident qualitatively by confocal microscopy (not shown) and quantified by fluorescence flow cytometric analysis of decreased surface receptor fluorescence produced by 20 min of exposure to 10 μm of the agonist peptide AVP (Fig. 1A, open bars). Overexpression of myc-Hrs did not detectably affect AVP-induced internalization of any of the mutant receptors (Fig. 1A, solid bars). All of the mutant receptors also recycled efficiently after internalization, as indicated by recovery of surface receptor fluorescence measured 60 min after agonist washout (Fig. 1B, open bars). myc-Hrs overexpression (Fig. 1B, solid bars) did not affect plasma membrane recycling of the V2R 362T (Fig. 1B, compare 1st and 2nd bars) but strongly inhibited recycling of the V2R 362/β2ADR-(366–413) chimeric mutant receptor (Fig. 1B, 3rd and 4th bars), as shown previously (16Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Another chimeric receptor, which contains essentially the entire C-tail of the β2ADR (residues 340–413) and has been shown to efficiently recycle (21Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar)), also exhibited recycling that was strongly inhibited by overexpressed myc-Hrs (Fig. 1B, 5th and 6th bars). Together these results confirm the Hrs-independent nature of V2R 362T mutant receptor recycling and the ability of structural determinant(s) located within the β2ADR C-tail to confer Hrs dependence on receptor recycling (16Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Despite the ability of β2ADR-derived tail sequence to confer Hrs sensitivity on recycling of both mutant receptors, we were surprised to observe that neither the distal 4 nor 10 C-terminal residues of the β2ADR tail (residues 410–413 and 404–413) themselves conferred detectable Hrs sensitivity on mutant receptor recycling (Fig. 1B, 7th to 10th bars). This pronounced difference in Hrs sensitivity of recycling was also evident by microscopic localization of chimeric receptors, where myc-Hrs expression was verified directly in the same cells by dual-label immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1C). In the absence of myc-Hrs expression, these mutant receptors recycled to the plasma membrane following agonist-induced internalization (Fig. 1C, top panels). In cells expressing myc-Hrs, V2R 362T mutant receptors returned to a predominantly plasma membrane localization after agonist washout (Fig. 1C, left column of images), consistent with Hrs-independent recycling of this receptor shown previously (16Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). V2R 362/β2ADR-(340–413) mutant receptors remained localized in Hrs-associated endosomes, and little receptor recovery in the plasma membrane was visualized after agonist washout (Fig. 1C, middle column) as shown previously (16Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, V2R 362/β2ADR-(410–413) mutant receptors (as well as V2R 362/β2ADR-(404–413) mutant receptors, not shown) returned to a predominantly plasma membrane localization after agonist washout in cells expressing myc-Hrs (Fig. 1C, right column). These results indicate that the distal recycling signal in the β2ADR C-tail is not sufficient to direct receptor trafficking from a default to Hrs-dependent recycling mechanism. They also suggest that an additional structural determinant, which mediates receptor sorting via the Hrs-dependent mechanism, is encoded within residues 366–404 of the β2ADR C-tail.Identification of a Distinct Sequence within the β2ADR C-tail That Confers Hrs-dependent Recycling on Endocytosed Receptors—Inspection of the sequence corresponding to residues 366–404 of the β2ADR C-tail sequence revealed a dileucine flanked at -3 and -5 positions by acidic residues (EKENKLL, Fig. 2A). This sequence is similar to a family of acidic cluster-dileucine motifs implicated previously as a sorting signal in a number of membrane-trafficking processes, where both the leucines and upstream acidic residues are important for function (25Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). These key residues are conserved in the β2ADR across mammalian species, but no functional role of this conserved sequence has been identified previously. To begin to investigate a possible endocytic sorting function, the corresponding residues were mutated to alanine (AKANKAA mutation, Fig. 2A), and effects on Hrs-dependent recycling were evaluated in the context of the V2R 362/β2ADR-(366–413) chimera.FIGURE 2Mutation of an acidic dileucine sequence in V2R 362/β2ADR-(366–413) reduces the ability of myc-Hrs expression to inhibit receptor recycling.

Shown only are agonist-treated cells followed by incubation in media for 1 h to visually assess recycling. Representative images are shown from ∼20 cells per condition in each experiment and over three separate experiments. C, surface receptor immunoreactivity was determined by flow cytometry in cells treated as in Fig. 1.

The AKANKAA mutation did not detectably affect plasma membrane localization, agonist-induced internalization, or recycling in cells expressing Hrs at endogenous levels (Fig. 2, B, top panels, and C, open bars, and data not shown). However, the AKANKAA mutation substantially reduced the ability of overexpressed myc-Hrs to inhibit receptor recycling. This was evident qualitatively by the ability of V2R 362/β2ADR-(366–413)-AKANKAA mutant receptors to return to a plasma membrane localization pattern after agonist washout, in contrast to visible endosome retention of the V2R 362/β2ADR-(366–413) receptor containing the wild type (EKENKLL) sequence (Fig. 2B). The ability of the AKANKAA mutation to abrogate Hrs sensitivity of the chimeric receptor recycling was further verified quantitatively using the fluorescence flow cytometric assay (Fig. 2C, lower graph). Together, these findings suggest a possible functional role of the EKENKLL sequence in conferring Hrs dependence on GPCR recycling.The Acidic Dileucine Sequence Is Also Required for Sequence-directed Recycling and Produces Default Recycling when Mutated—Because Hrs dependence appears to be a specific property of the sequence-directed recycling mechanism (16Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the AKANKAA mutation might fully bypass this mechanism and thereby allow internalized receptors to recycle irrespective of the C-terminal PDZ ligand sequence essential for Hrs-dependent recycling of wild type receptors. To test this, we analyzed endocytic trafficking of the V2R 362/β2ADR C-tail chimeras containing a single C-terminal alanine addition, which specifically disrupts the distal PDZ ligand required for recycling of wild type receptors (5Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 7Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

We also examined the effects of mutating either the dileucine or upstream acidic residues individually, and we further evaluated specificity by mutating downstream (rather than upstream) acidic residues (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Absence or mutation of the Hrs sorting domain in the V2R 362/β2ADR tail chimera results in recycling that is independent of the distal recycling signal.

https://openalex.org/W1982144228,"Inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) is a ubiquitous key regulator of cellular non-canonical nucleotide levels. It breaks down inosine and xanthine nucleotides generated by deamination of purine bases. Its enzymatic action prevents accumulation of ITP and reduces the risk of incorporation of potentially mutagenic inosine nucleotides into nucleic acids. Here we describe the crystal structure of human ITPA in complex with its prime substrate ITP, as well as the apoenzyme at 2.8 and 1.1Å, respectively. These structures show for the first time the site of substrate and Mg2+ coordination as well as the conformational changes accompanying substrate binding in this class of enzymes. Enzyme substrate interactions induce an extensive closure of the nucleotide binding grove, resulting in tight interactions with the base that explain the high substrate specificity of ITPA for inosine and xanthine over the canonical nucleotides. One of the dimer contact sites is made up by a loop that is involved in coordinating the metal ion in the active site. We predict that the ITPA deficiency mutation P32T leads to a shift of this loop that results in a disturbed affinity for nucleotides and/or a reduced catalytic activity in both monomers of the physiological dimer.

We predict that the ITPA deficiency mutation P32T leads to a shift of this loop that results in a disturbed affinity for nucleotides and/or a reduced catalytic activity in both monomers of the physiological dimer. Inosine monophosphate (IMP) is an essential metabolite in purine biosynthesis; it is the precursor of adenosine and guanosine monophosphates (AMP and GMP) (1Berg J.M. Tymoczko J.L. Stryer L. Biochemistry.5th Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York2002: 698-701Google Scholar). IMP is generated predominantly by de novo biosynthesis and by interconversion of nucleotide monophosphates. Inosine nucleotide triphosphates are present at low levels as byproducts generated either by deamination of purine bases or by phosphorylation of IMP. They are removed by the housecleaning enzyme inosine triphosphatase (ITP pyrophosphohydrolase; ITPase; ITPA 4The abbreviations used are: ITPA, inosine triphosphatase; PDB, Protein Data Bank. ;EC 3.6.1.19) that catalyzes the conversion of inosine triphosphate (ITP) to IMP and pyrophosphate (PPi). ITPase activity prevents accumulation of ITP and dITP, which may be incorporated into RNA and DNA, posing a risk for mutagenesis. ITPA orthologs are found in organisms from all kingdoms. In human and mouse, the protein is ubiquitously expressed (2Lin S. McLennan A.G. Ying K. Wang Z. Gu S. Jin H. Wu C. Liu W. Yuan Y. Tang R. Xie Y. Mao Y. J. Biol.

ITP, dITP, and xanthine triphosphate are converted with similar kinetics, whereas the enzyme has very low affinity for other nucleotides. The pH optimum of ITPA is ∼10 (2Lin S. McLennan A.G. Ying K.

Genetic studies of individuals with detectable ITP levels in erythrocytes have linked ITPA deficiency to several single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ITPA gene. Of these, the mutation P32T abolished ITPase activity and caused accumulation of ITP in erythrocytes (6Sumi S. Marinaki A.M. Arenas M. Fairbanks L. Shobowale-Bakre M. Rees D.C. Thein S.L. Ansari A. Sanderson J. De Abreu R.A. Simmonds H.A. Duley J.A. Hum. Genet. 2002; 111: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 7Cao H. Hegele R.A. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 47: 620-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). ITPase activity was lost in individuals homozygous for the P32T mutation, and it was reduced to ∼ 25% in heterozygous subjects (8Maeda T. Sumi S. Ueta A. Ohkubo Y. Ito T. Marinaki A.M. Kurono Y. Hasegawa S. Togari H. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2005; 85: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This indicates that ITPase activity depends on the integrity of both protomers of the ITPA dimer. The ITPA P32T allele is present in all ethnic groups, being highest (11–19%) in Asian and lowest (1–2%) in Central and South American populations (7Cao H. Hegele R.A. J. Hum.

ITPA deficiency is not linked to pathology in afflicted individuals, but perturbed ITP levels may be harmful under circumstances such as cellular stress. For instance, ITPA deficiency may be responsible for adverse drug reactions in patients treated with the purine analog azathioprine (12Derijks L.J. Gilissen L.P. Hooymans P.M. Hommes D.W. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 24: 715-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), an immunosuppressive drug used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, leukemia, and autoimmune complications in connection with organ transplants. Crystal structures of several bacterial ITPA homologs have been solved in the absence of physiological ligands (13Hwang K.Y. Chung J.H. Kim S.H. Han Y.S. Cho Y. Nat. Struct.

Microbiol. 2006; 59: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The location of the substrate binding site has been postulated on the basis of weak binding of the non-physiological ATP analog, AMPPNP, to the Methanococcus enzyme (13Hwang K.Y. Chung J.H. Kim S.H. Han Y.S. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the mode of substrate binding proposed could not account for the strong binding preference for ITP, dITP, and xanthine triphosphate over other nucleotides (2Lin S. McLennan A.G. Ying K.

We have determined the crystal structure of human ITPA alone and in complex with one of its physiological substrates, ITP, and the products of hydrolysis, IMP + PPi. Our results identify the substrate and Mg2+ binding site of ITPA and show that it is different from the site previously proposed for this class of enzymes. Our structures provide an explanation for the high specificity of ITPA toward inosine and xanthine nucleotides. Comparison of the ITP-bound and unbound structures show that substrate binding induces closure of the nucleotide binding cleft and positions key side chains for catalysis. The structural implications of the P32T mutation causing ITPA deficiency are discussed. Cloning and Protein Purification—Human ITPA cDNA (Mammalian Gene Collection clone 19624) was subcloned into pET28 (Novagen). Protein expression and purification were as described before (16Kursula P. Flodin S. Ehn M. Hammarstrom M. Schuler H. Nordlund P. Stenmark P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Commun. 2006; 62: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) involving expression in Escherichia coli BL-21(DE-3) cells (Stratagene), cell lysis using a cell disruptor (Stansted Fluid Power), and purification on HisTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare). Eluted proteins were concentrated using Vivaspin cartridges (Millipore) to a volume of 1 ml and treated with 30 units of thrombin (GE Healthcare) overnight at room temperature. The protein sample was diluted 20-fold with 20 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, 20 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and applied to a MonoS column (GE Healthcare). The protein passing the MonoS column was essentially pure ITPA liberated from the His6 tag as judged by SDS-PAGE and time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. ITPA was diluted 1:5 with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, concentrated to 50 mg/ml, and stored as aliquots at -80 °C. Protein Crystallization—Crystal screens were performed using a JCSG screen (17Page R. Stevens R.C. Methods. 2004; 34: 373-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Monoclinic and trigonal crystals were obtained using the sitting drop method at 4 °C using 900 nl of protein (concentration 22 mg/ml) and 900 nl of well solution (0.2 m potassium chloride, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, pH 6.9). For the ITP complex crystals, the well solution contained 0.2 m potassium chloride, 31% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, and the protein was added from a 50 mg/ml stock solution containing 10 mm ITP and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Data Collection and Processing—Crystals were briefly soaked in a cryoprotectant (well solution containing 15–20% glycerol). Synchrotron diffraction data were collected at BESSY beamline BL14.1. The data were processed and scaled using XDS (apo structure) (18Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3242) Google Scholar,19Kursula P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 347-348Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or MOSFLM (ITP complex) (20Leslie A.G. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—Using data from trigonal crystals (space group P32), the structure was solved at 2.25 Å resolution by molecular replacement in Phaser/Phenix (21McCoy A.J.

After initial refinement the atomic resolution structure was solved using data from monoclinic crystals by molecular replacement in Molrep (23Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) using the partially refined structure as a model. After refinement in Refmac5 (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13911) Google Scholar) and manual rebuilding, automated model building was carried out using ARP/wARP (25Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). Refinement was continued using SHELX (26Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar), applying the twinning operator (-h,-k, l) and using intensities instead of amplitudes. The twinning fraction refined to 50%. In the final refinement rounds, anisotropic atomic displacement parameters were refined and hydrogen atoms were added. A total of 35 residues were built in two conformations, and the occupancies of the conformers were also refined in SHELX. The ITP complex structure was solved by molecular replacement using the apo structure as a model and refined using Refmac5 with TLS parameters (27Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Both structures were built using Coot (28Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23605) Google Scholar). The complete protein chains were traceable; in the ITP complex the 122–128 loop was not built in all chains. Figures were made using PyMOL (www.pymol.org) and Ligplot (29Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4428) Google Scholar). Superpositioning of structural models was performed using SSM (30Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3188) Google Scholar). Domain motion analysis was carried out using DynDom (31Hayward S. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1998; 30: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). We have determined the crystal structure of human apoITPA at 1.1 Å resolution, as well as the structure of its complex with the physiological substrate (2.8 Å). ITPA with or without bound substrate crystallized as a homodimer, which is the physiological form of the protein (2Lin S. McLennan A.G. Ying K. Wang Z. Gu S. Jin H. Wu C. Liu W. Yuan Y. Tang R.

NTP pyrophosphate hydrolases from bacteria have a similar architecture, such as M. jannaschii Mj0226 (PDB accession codes 1B78 and 2MJP) (13Hwang K.Y. Chung J.H. Kim S.H. Han Y.S. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and E. coli YggV (1VP2) (14Zheng J. Singh V.K. Jia Z. Structure. 2005; 13: 1511-1520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A superposition between the human apo ITPA structure (2CAR) and the Methanococcus enzyme (1B78) gives an root mean square deviation for C-α positions of 1.5 Å (184 aligned residues with 35% sequence identity). The human ITPA structure shows, for the first time, how physiological substrate binds to an enzyme of this structural family: The two lobes from a single monomer form a substrate binding cleft between them. The dimer interface is made up mainly by interactions between the upper lobe of each monomer (the dimerization lobes; Fig. 1). The interface area between the monomers of the apo structure is 1080 Å2, with 9 hydrogen bonds and 9 bridging waters across the dimer interface. Nucleotide Binding and Substrate Specificity—In the ITP complex structure (PDB accession code 2J4E), one molecule of ITP is bound in the cleft between the (upper) dimerization lobe and (lower) N-terminal lobe of the protein (Figs. 1 and 2). The purine base is wedged between the Phe-149 and Trp-151 side chains of the dimerization lobe so that their electron systems are stacked on top of each other. Phe-149 has flipped in toward the purine base compared with the apo structure. Three residues are within hydrogen bonding distance from the 6-keto oxygen of the inosine ring (Fig. 2A), Lys-172, His-177, and Arg-178. As these side chains point into the purine site from opposite directions, it is evident that the base is precisely positioned by this keto oxygen. Substrate specificity may be further enhanced by the hydrogen bonding network formed by these side chains and the Glu-22 carboxylate. An amino group in the same position would interfere with the hydrogen bonding network, explaining the selectivity of the enzyme against adenine nucleotides (Fig. 2C). Xanthine nucleotides are also ITPA substrates (2Lin S. McLennan A.G. Ying K. Wang Z. Gu S. Jin H. Wu C. Liu W. Yuan Y. Tang R. Xie Y. Mao Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18695-18701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Additional specificity in xanthine binding may be obtained by a putative hydrogen bond between the 2-keto oxygen of the xanthine base and the Asp-152 backbone amide. The 2-keto oxygen binding pocket, however, is chemically not fit to accommodate an amino group, explaining the selectivity against guanine bases (Fig. 2C). The ribose moiety is in a partly solvent-exposed pocket, and both ribose hydroxyls point into the solution without making strong contacts with the protein. This is consistent with the fact that 2-deoxyribonucleotides are also ITPA substrates (2Lin S. McLennan A.G. Ying K. Wang Z. Gu S. Jin H. Wu C. Liu W. Yuan Y. Tang R. Xie Y. Mao Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18695-18701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We also observed density consistent with a cation, presumably Mg2+ as judged by its size and interactions, in the active site. The Mg2+ ion and triphosphate tail make contacts with side chains from α-helices 2 and 3 and the central β-sheet (Fig. 2). Notably, all side chains discussed above are strictly conserved in the ITPA-like family of NTP pyrophosphatases (Fig. 3). The only exception is the eukaryotic Trp-151, which is a tyrosine in bacterial sequences; this is a conservative replacement in the sense that the tyrosine side chain can also stack with the nucleotide base. Comparison of our ITPA structures shows a closure of the cleft by 25° upon ITP binding, brought about by displacement of structural elements from the N-terminal lobes (Figs. 1 and 3B). Two movements are most prominent: 1) An upward rigid body rotation of α-helix 2 around residues 11 and 26–32 (when the two structures are superimposed, the Cα positions of residues 15–31 show a 4.8 Å root mean square difference between the apo and ITP-bound enzyme), and 2) rearrangement of β-strand 2 by bending around residues 39 and 44. This also results in a shift of α-helix 3. These changes upon substrate binding can be summarized as a movement of the N-terminal lobes toward the static dimerization lobes (Fig. 1). These rather drastic rearrangements may explain why crystals of bacterial NTPases cracked upon soaking of nucleotides (13Hwang K.Y. Chung J.H. Kim S.H. Han Y.S. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Zheng J. Singh V.K. Jia Z. Structure. 2005; 13: 1511-1520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the Mj0226 crystals (PDB accession code 2MJP), the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP was bound to one of the monomers at a site that differs from the ITP binding site seen in our human ITPA crystals (13Hwang K.Y. Chung J.H. Kim S.H. Han Y.S. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The differences are illustrated by superposition of the two structures with the respective nucleotides bound (Fig. 4). In the Mj0226 structure the adenine base of AMPPNP points away from the protein without interactions that explain specificity for the physiological substrates. In addition, the enzyme remains in the open cleft conformation similar to our apo structure, with which it also shows the best degree of superposition (described above). At the high concentration used, binding of the nonphysiological ATP analog presumably took place at a secondary or artificial site in the Methanococcus enzyme. We suggest that the substrate binding site revealed in our human ITPA structure, which has recently been predicted by Murzin and co-workers (15Galperin M.Y. Moroz O.V. Wilson K.S. Murzin A.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), is conserved across this enzyme family. Active Site and Putative Catalytic Mechanism—In our ITPA crystals resulting from co-crystallization with the substrate ITP, seven of the eight molecules within the asymmetric unit had ITP bound (Fig. 1C). The putative Mg2+ ion is in close proximity to the ITP β- and γ-phosphates and is coordinated by the Glu-44 carboxylate. ITPA requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ for full activity and has a rather high Mg2+ optimum of 10 mm or more (2Lin S. McLennan A.G. Ying K. Wang Z. Gu S. Jin H. Wu C. Liu W. Yuan Y. Tang R. Xie Y. Mao Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18695-18701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), suggesting involvement of an intermediate metal binding site. Although our ITPA protein substrate complex apparently contained endogenous metal ions through high affinity binding in the active site, additional metal ions were not added to the mother solution. Crystallization conditions were also suboptimal for catalysis with respect to pH and temperature. These factors may explain why we were able to crystallize the substrate complex. We assume that, under physiological conditions, Mg2+ would bind at the site found in our structure. In one of the protein chains (chain D) the density showed that the hydrolysis reaction had proceeded and IMP and PPi occupied the active site (Fig. 1D). The α- and β-phosphates had moved apart, and attempts to model in ITP resulted in negative density on the bridging oxygen. However, no major changes in nucleotide coordination resulted from this. The PPi phosphate group originating from the γ-phosphate of ITP remains in the same position before and after catalysis (Fig. 2B). Nevertheless, the pattern of interactions suggests possible catalytic mechanisms. In the ITP-bound structure, the triphosphate tail of ITP is in the vicinity of side chains Asn-16, Lys-19, and Asp-41, whereas the cation is coordinated by the carboxylate of Glu-44 and the phosphates (Fig. 2A). A water molecule coordinated by the conserved Asp-72 would be ideally positioned for in-line nucleophilic attack on the α-phosphate. Alternatively, the conserved Asn-16 could coordinate a water molecule for attack on the β-phosphate. A negatively charged transition state of the pyrophosphatase reaction might be stabilized by the terminal amino groups of the Lys-89 or Lys-19 side chains. In the D chain carrying IMP + PPi, the β-phosphate has moved by almost 0.5 Å toward the terminal amino group of Lys-89, supporting a role for Lys-89 as a stabilizer of the reaction intermediate. Implication of the ITPA Deficiency Mutant P32T: Cross-talk between Monomers—The observation that individuals heterozygous for the P32T mutation retained 25% ITPase activity (9Marinaki A.M. Sumi S. Arenas M. Fairbanks L. Harihara S. Shimizu K. Ueta A. Duley J.A. Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2004; 23: 1399-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) suggested that both protomers of the physiological dimer need to be intact for catalytic activity. The ITPA dimer structure presented here suggests an allosteric regulatory mechanism by cross-talk between the protomers. The extended loop structure between β-strand 2 (residues 34–38) and the long α-helix 3 (residues 48–65) is positioned to transmit structural changes upon NTP binding and hydrolysis to the sister monomer: The Gln-46 backbone amide of each monomer forms a hydrogen bond with the Glu-44 backbone carbonyl oxygen of the sister monomer. Also the Gln-46 ϵ-amide of each monomer forms a hydrogen bond with the Tyr-45 backbone carbonyl oxygen of the sister monomer. We suggest that NTP hydrolysis and/or nucleotide exchange in the two monomers are coupled across the dimer interface through these interactions. Dimer dissociation could explain the mutant effect; however, the affected loops constitute only a minor portion of the dimer interface. Rather, we think that the Asp-41 and Glu-44 carboxylates may act as triphosphate sensors, transmitting structural changes upon hydrolysis to the active site of the sister monomer, thereby regulating its activity. The structures presented here suggest a mechanism for catalytic deficiency in P32T mutant ITPA. Comparison of our two structures suggests lobe movement and rearrangement of α-helix 2 as a mechanism for nucleotide exchange, as detailed above. Located in the hinge region of the flexible α-helix 2, Pro-32 is a key residue for positioning of side chains involved in substrate binding and catalysis. The adjacent extended loop structure between β-strand 2 and α-helix 3 contains residues of predicted catalytic involvement and is stabilized by interdimer contacts. Its position would likely be significantly disturbed by the P32T mutation. Thus, a disturbed nucleotide exchange or a partial misfolding of α-helix 2 would likely transmit across the dimer interface, rendering the dimer inactive. Japanese populations feature the highest frequency (20%) of the P32T mutation. Interestingly, ITPA contains epitopes that are recognized by tumor-reactive cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in Japanese populations (32Shichijo S. Azuma K. Komatsu N. Kawamoto N. Takedatsu H. Shomura H. Sawamizu H. Maeda Y. Ito M. Itoh K. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 12: 895-902PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, these epitopes encompass the sequence that is likely to adopt a non-physiological conformation in the P32T mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2074222405,"Death-associated protein-3 (DAP3) is a GTP binding protein previously implicated in both intramitochondrial protein synthesis and apoptosis. To explore the in vivo roles of DAP3, we generated and characterized DAP3-deficient mice. Homozygous dap3-/- embryos died at approximately day 9.5 in utero. The dap3-/- embryos and placentas were markedly shrunken. Embryos had arrested development, displaying severe growth restriction and lack of axial turning. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed abnormal, shrunken mitochondria with swollen crystae in dap3-/- embryos. Levels of cytochrome c oxidase-I, a protein encoded in the mitochondrial genome, were reduced in dap3-/- embryos, consistent with a role for DAP3 in intramitochondrial protein synthesis. A requirement for DAP3 in mitochondrial respiration was also revealed by oxygen consumption measurements using cultured cells treated with DAP3-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). Studies of cultured cells from dap3-/- embryos confirmed a role in apoptosis induced by stimuli that trigger the extrinsic (TNFalpha, TRAIL, anti-Fas antibody) but not intrinsic (mitochondrial) cell death pathway. Thus, DAP3 joins a growing list of bifunctional proteins that play roles in normal mitochondrial physiology and in apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2074784484,"The material used by the old masters to make exquisite violins may have been chemically manipulated. It has been suggested that the sound quality of the violins made by the Cremona masters in the eighteenth century is enhanced by the chemicals used to preserve the wood. Owners of such treasures are reluctant to pull them apart to test the theory. But now by analysing wood shavings taken from violin, cello and viola back plates during crack repair, Nagyvary et al. have found traces of chemical treatments that were used in the Cremona instruments, but not in those made in Paris and London at the same time. With further research, the exact nature of the chemicals might be found, allowing modern makers to reproduce the 'Stradivarius' sound. Whether or not the great Italian violin-makers used wood that had been chemically processed in order to preserve it and enhance the instrument's sound quality has long been a contentious issue1,2. Here we use nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy to analyse organic matter in wood taken from antique instruments made by Stradivari and Guarneri del Gesu. Our results indicate that the wood used by the masters could indeed have been chemically treated, a technique that may inspire an approach to violin making that is more chemistry-based."

Science. 1997; 275: 218-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (4437) Google Scholar). However, the potential anticancer properties of t-RESV are strongly limited because of its low bioavailability (5Asensi M.

Thus, structural modifications of the t-RESV molecule appeared to be necessary to increase its bioavailability while preserving its biological activity. Recently, we found that trans-pterostilbene (t-PTER; trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4′-hydroxystilbene) and quercetin (QUER; 3,3′,4′,5,6-pentahydroxyflavone) have longer in vivo half-lives compared with t-RESV (6Ferrer P.

In vitro growth of highly malignant B16 melanoma F10 (B16M-F10) cells is inhibited (56%) by short-term exposure (60 min/day) to t-PTER (40 μm) and QUER (20 μm) (6Ferrer P. Asensi M. Segarra R. Ortega A. Benlloch M. Obrador E. Varea M.T. Asensio G. Jorda L. Estrela J.M. Neoplasia. 2005; 7: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Intravenous administration of t-PTER and QUER (20 mg/kg/day) to mice inhibits (73%) metastatic growth of B16M-F10 cells in the liver, a common site for metastasis development (6Ferrer P. Asensi M. Segarra R. Ortega A. Benlloch M. Obrador E. Varea M.T. Asensio G. Jorda L. Estrela J.M. Neoplasia. 2005; 7: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The antimetastatic mechanism involves (a) t-PTER-induced inhibition of vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium (HSE), which decreases B16M-F10 cell adhesion to the endothelium via very late activation antigen 4, and (b) QUER- and t-PTER-induced inhibition of bcl-2 expression in metastatic cells, which sensitizes them to vascular endothelium-induced cytotoxicity (6Ferrer P.

Analysis of the bcl-2 family of genes revealed that B16M-F10 cells (high metastatic potential), compared with B16M-F1 cells (low metastatic potential), overexpress bcl-2 preferentially (7Ortega A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 39591-39599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). t-PTER increases expression of pro-death bax (∼2.2-fold) and decreases expression of anti-death bcl-2 (∼2.0-fold) (6Ferrer P.

Neoplasia. 2005; 7: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), whereas QUER increases expression of different pro-death genes (bax, bak, bad, and bid; 1.5–2.5-fold) and decreases expression of all anti-death genes analyzed (bcl-2 (∼7.3-fold), bcl-w (∼1.5-fold), and bcl-xL (∼2-fold)) (6Ferrer P.

Neoplasia. 2005; 7: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that Bcl-2 by itself plays a critical role in regulating B16M-F10 resistance against vascular endothelium-induced damage. In agreement with this idea, we also observed that antisense bcl-2 therapy potentiates tumor necrosis factor-α-induced oxidative stress and death in B16M-F10 cells (7Ortega A. Ferrer P. Carretero J.

However, the molecular mechanisms that link polyphenol signaling with bcl-2 expression are unclear. In vitro, t-RESV-driven apoptosis of chronic leukemic B cells has been shown to correlate with activation of caspase-3, a drop in the mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduction in the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthetase (iNOS) (8Billard C.

Mohammad R.M. Kolb J.P. Billard C. Leuk. Res. 2004; 28: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). NO is a potential bioregulator of apoptosis because high concentrations of NO or peroxynitrite can induce apoptotic death in different cells types, including tumor cells (10Chung H.T. Pae H.O. Choi B.M. Billiar T.R. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), although, on the other hand, NO may also act as an anti-apoptotic signal associated with, for example, suppression of mitochondrial cytochrome c release, ceramide generation, and caspase activation (10Chung H.T. Pae H.O. Choi B.M. Billiar T.R. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Indeed, NO donors can elevate bcl-2 expression both at the mRNA and protein levels and prevent apoptotic cell death in vitro (11Genaro A.M. Hortelano S. Alvarez A. Martinez C. Bosca L. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 1884-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), whereas, paradoxically, also in vitro, NO-induced apoptosis of K-1735 melanoma cells (12Xie K. Wang Y. Huang S. Xu L. Bielenberg D. Salas T. McConkey D.J. Jiang W. Fidler I.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or human myeloid leukemia U937 cells (13Brockhaus F. Brune B. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) is associated with down-regulation of Bcl-2 and caspase activation. Therefore, NO, which may either prevent or induce apoptosis, can also increase or decrease Bcl-2 levels. These apparently controversial facts suggest that different intracellular NO levels may likely determine opposite effects. Whether natural polyphenols such as t-PTER and QUER also cause reduction in iNOS gene expression in metastatic cells (and consequently a decrease in their intracellular NO levels) and whether this is linked to changes in bcl-2 expression is unknown. On the other hand, t-RESV, as well as other polyphenols (e.g. black tea polyphenols), can increase endothelial nitric-oxide synthetase (eNOS) activity and induce accumulation of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 in cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells (14Hsieh T.C. Juan G. Darzynkiewicz Z. Wu J.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2596-2601PubMed Google Scholar, 15Anter E. Thomas S.R. Schulz E. Shapira O.M. Vita J.A. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46637-46643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that natural polyphenols may also alter NO levels in the metastatic microenvironment during interaction of cancer and endothelial cells, which is important because endothelial NO generation was found to be essential in the mechanism of tumor cytotoxicity during B16M-F10 cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium (16Carretero J.

The aim of this study was to investigate the possible relationship between NO and the effect t-PTER and/or QUER (at in vivo bioavailable concentrations) on bcl-2 expression in B16M-F10 cells. Our results show that this polyphenolic association decreases NO production in isolated B16M-F10 cells and increases NO release from the vascular endothelium during B16M-F10/endothelial cell interaction. At both steps, changes in NO levels trigger Bcl-2 down-regulation and activation of death mechanisms in metastatic B16M-F10 cells. Culture of B16M-F10 Cells—Murine B16M-F10 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), pH 7.4, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm NaHCO3, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (17Obrador E.

Cooper P.H. Baggiolini M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 63: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Nitrite and nitrate determinations were performed as described previously (16Carretero J.

Total NOx (NO−2 plus NO−3) determinations were made by monitoring NO evolution from a measured sample placed into a boiling VCl3/HCl solution (which will reduce both NO−2 and NO−3 to NO). Quantitation was accomplished using a standard curve made up of known amounts of NO−2 and NO−3. Isolation, Identification, and Culture of the HSE—Male C57BL/6J mice (10–12 weeks old) were from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Barcelona, Spain). The HSE was separated and identified as described previously (20Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Rocha M. Asumendi A. Barbera-Guillem E. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 328-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sinusoidal cells were separated in a 17.5% (w/v) metrizamide gradient. HSE cultures were established and maintained in pyrogen-free DMEM supplemented as described above for the B16M-F10 cells. Differential adhesion of endothelial cells to the collagen matrix and washing allowed complete elimination of other sinusoidal cell types (Kupffer and stellate cells and lymphocytes) from the culture flasks.

(106 cells were incubated in 1 ml of HEPES-buffered DMEM containing 50 μg of BCECF-AM and 5 μl of Me2SO for 20 min at 37 °C.) After washing, BCECF-AM-containing cells were resuspended in HEPES-buffered DMEM without phenol red at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml and added (0.2 ml/well) to endothelial cells (plated 24 h before) and also to plastic- or collagen-precoated control wells. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C, and 20 min later, the wells were washed three times with fresh medium and read for fluorescence using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL (LabSystems, Manchester, UK). The number of adherent tumor cells was quantified by arbitrary fluorescence units based on the percentage of the initial number of B16M cells added to the HSE culture (21Anasagasti M.J. Alvarez A. Martin J.J. Mendoza L. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Damage to B16M cells during their in vitro adhesion to the HSE was measured as described previously (22Anasagasti M.J. Martin J.J. Mendoza L. Obrador E. Estrela J.M. McCuskey R.S. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1249-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using tumor cells loaded with calcein acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes). Other reagents used in experiments of tumor cytotoxicity were from Sigma. Reverse Transcription-PCR and Detection of mRNA Expression—Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was obtained using a random hexamer primer and a MultiScribe reverse transcription kit (TaqMan reverse transcription reagents, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described by the manufacturer. A PCR Master Mix and AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) containing specific primers (synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies according to published sequences available from the GenBank™ Data Bank) were then added: iNOS, 5′-CGGATATCTCTTGCAAGTCCAAA (forward) and 5′-AAGTATGTGTCTGCAGATATG (reverse); eNOS, 5′-CACCAGGAAGAAGACCTTTAAGGA (forward) and 5′-CACACGCTTCGCCATCAC (reverse); bcl-2, 5′-CTCGTCGCTACCGTCGTGACTTCG (forward) and 5′-CAGATGCCGGTTCAGGTACTCAGTC (reverse); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CCTGGAGAAACCTGCCAAGTATG (forward) and 5′-GGTCCTCAGTGTAGCCCAAGATG (reverse). Real-time quantitation of the mRNA relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was performed with a SYBR Green I assay and a iCycler detection system (Bio-Rad). Target cDNA was amplified as follows: 10 min at 95 °C and then 40 cycles of amplification (denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min per cycle). The increase in fluorescence was measured in real time during the extension step. The threshold cycle (CT) was determined, and then the relative gene expression was expressed as follows: -fold change = 2–Δ(ΔCT), where ΔCT = CT target – CT glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and Δ(ΔCT) =ΔCT treated –ΔCT control. Bcl-2 Analysis—Bcl-2 protein was quantitated in the soluble cytosolic fraction by enzyme immunoassay (23Eissa S. Seada L.S. Clin. Chem. 1998; 44: 1423-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using a monoclonal antibody-based assay from Sigma (1 unit of Bcl-2 is defined as the amount of Bcl-2 in 1000 non-transfected B16M-F10 cells). eNOS-deficient Mice—Generation of eNOS-deficient mice was carried out as described previously (24Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Kim H.S. Desai K.M. Krege J.H. Laumback V.E. Sherman P.A. Sessa W.C. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13176-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). We interbred heterozygous (+/–) eNOS-deficient mice to generate eNOS+/+ and eNOS–/– mice. We used eNOS+/+ and wild-type C57BL/6J mice as controls. Genotyping of the animals was performed by Southern blotting DNA from tail biopsies. The identification of eNOS+/+ and eNOS–/– mice was as described previously (24Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Kim H.S. Desai K.M. Krege J.H. Laumback V.E. Sherman P.A. Sessa W.C. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13176-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20-μg samples were digested with BamHI, separated on 1.0% agarose gels, and transferred to nylon-supported nitrocellulose. The blots were then hybridized using a random primer-labeled 1.4-kb eNOS cDNA probe (24Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Kim H.S. Desai K.M. Krege J.H. Laumback V.E. Sherman P.A. Sessa W.C. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13176-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). A 5.3-kb fragment was diagnostic of the endogenous eNOS locus, and a 6.4-kb fragment was diagnostic of the targeted allele. Measurement of iNOS Activity in B16M-F10 Cells—Conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline was measured by a modification of a previously described methodology (25Rao C.V. Kawamori T. Hamid R. Reddy B.S. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The assay was carried out by adding 100 μg of sample protein to 150 μl of assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mg/liter pepstatin A, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3 mg/liter aprotinin, pH 7.4) containing 70 μm arginine, 250,000 dpm l-[3H]arginine, (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), 2 mm NADPH, 5 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 5 μm FAD, and 0.5 mm CaCl2 to measure total NOS activity or in the presence of 1 mm EGTA (without calcium) to determine Ca2+-independent iNOS activity. After 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 1 m trichloroacetic acid. The samples were adjusted to pH 4.6 by adding 500 μl of 20 mm HEPES and applied to Dowex AG 50W-X8 resin columns. l-[3H]Citrulline was eluted and separated by thin-layer chromatography. Radioactivity was counted with an AR-2000 scanner detector (Bioscan, Inc., Washington, D. C.). The results are expressed as pmol of l-[3H]citrulline/mg of protein/min. Western Blot Analysis—Cultured cells were harvested as indicated above and then washed twice with ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4. Whole cell extracts were made by freeze-thaw cycles in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.4. Fifty μg of protein (as determined by the Bradford assay (68Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211864) Google Scholar)) were boiled in Laemmli buffer and resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to Western blotting with anti-cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) or anti-phospho-CREB (Ser133) monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA). Blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system, Amersham Biosciences). Gene Silencing—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection experiments were performed with double-stranded RNA designed and synthesized by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). A CREB-specific siRNA sense orientation strand (5′-UACAGCUGGCUAACAAUGGdTdT-3′) was used. Cells were transfected with the siRNA delivery reagent jetSI™ (Eurogentec) at 3μl/μgof siRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency in cells plated on coverslips was determined with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled siRNA and determined by cell counting using a TCS-SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bensheim, Germany) to be 90–95% after 24 and 48 h. Guanylate Cyclase Assay—Enzyme activity (soluble and particulate) was determined as described previously (26Ignarro L.J. Wood K.S. Wolin M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. IJ. S. A. 1982; 79: 2870-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 27Waldman S.A. Sinacore M.S. Lewicki J.A. Chang L.Y. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4038-4042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 7.5 pmol of Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.75 μmol of creatine phosphate, 0.5 μmol of cGMP, 0.45 μmol of MgCl2, 1.2 μmol of theophylline, 0.6 units of creatine kinase, and 37.5 nmol of [8-3H]GTP (10–12 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total reaction volume of 150 μl. The radioactive cGMP produced was isolated as described previously (28Deguchi T. Arnano E. Nakane M. J. Neurochem. 1976; 27: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and measured using a Packard Tri-Carb 2700TR Varisette analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Assay of Sphingomyelinases—This procedure was a modification of a previously reported methodology (29Takeda Y. Tashima M. Takahashi A. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10654-10660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). B16M-F10 cells (5 × 106) were separated from the co-cultured HSE as described previously (30Ortega A.L. Carretero J. Obrador E. Gambini J. Asensi M. Rodilla V. Estrela J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13888-13897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm pepstatin, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, and 50 mg/ml leupeptin) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The homogenate was passed through a 25-gauge needle and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was used as an enzyme source. The mixture used to assay magnesium-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase) contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 nmol of [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol; GE Healthcare), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 200 μg of protein in a final volume of 0.2 ml. For magnesium-independent neutral SMase, MgCl2 was removed from the reaction mixture. For acid SMase, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, was used instead of Tris-HCl. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1.25 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1). Then, 0.25 ml of double-distilled water were added to the tubes and vortexed. The tubes were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 6 min to separate the two phases. The clear upper phase was removed, placed in a glass scintillation vial, and counted with a scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 2700TR Varisette). C16-ceramide and C16-dihydroceramide Analysis—The amounts of ceramide and dihydroceramide in B16M-F10 cells were measured as described previously (31Soeda S. Iwata K. Hosoda Y. Shimeno H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, cancer cell suspensions (5 × 106 cells in 200 μl of DMEM) were vigorously mixed with 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) for 20 min. Then, 0.8 ml of distilled water were added to the mixture, and the sample was vortexed and centrifuged. The lower layer was collected, and the chloroform was allowed to evaporate. The residue was dissolved in a solvent and subjected to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis using a Quattro micro triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with a Shimadzu LC-10ADVP pump and SCL-10AVP controller system with an SIL-10ADVP autoinjector. Samples were analyzed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a Phenomenex ODS column (35 × 2 mm) with 5-μm particle size. In all cases, 40 μl were injected onto the column. The temperature of the column was maintained at 25 °C. Mobile phases were as follows: mobile phase A, 5 mm ammonium formate/methanol/tetrahydrofuran (5:2:3, v/v); and mobile phase B, 5 mm ammonium formate/methanol/tetrahydrofuran (1:2:7, v/v) containing 0.01% formic acid. Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with 70% mobile phase A and 100% mobile phase B for 6.3 min in a linear gradient mode. Cell Death Analysis—Apoptotic and necrotic cell death were distinguished by fluorescence microscopy (32Obrador E. Carretero J. Esteve J.M. Pellicer J.A. Pascual A. Petschen I. Estrela J.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 642-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For this purpose, isolated cells were incubated with Hoechst 33342 (10 μm; which stains all nuclei) and propidium iodide (10 μm; which stains nuclei of cells with disrupted plasma membranes) for 3 min and analyzed using a Nikon Diaphot 300 fluorescence microscope with excitation at 360 nm. Nuclei of viable, necrotic, and apoptotic cells were observed as blue round nuclei, pink round nuclei, and fragmented blue or pink nuclei, respectively. About 1000 cells were counted each time. DNA strand breaks in apoptotic cells were assayed using a direct terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay (Roche Applied Science) and fluorescence microscopy following the manufacturer's methodology. Assay for in Vitro Invasion of the Hepatic Endothelial Cell Monolayer by B16M-F10 Cells—Invasion of the endothelial cell monolayer by B16M-F10 cells was assayed following the method by Ohigashi et al. (33Ohigashi H. Shinkai K. Mukai M. Ishikawa O. Imaoka S. Iwanaga T. Acedo H. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1989; 80: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with some modificatio"
https://openalex.org/W2022150604,"The CYBB and NCF2 genes encode the phagocyte oxidase proteins gp91PHOX and p67PHOX, respectively. These genes are transcribed after the promyelocyte stage of differentiation, and transcription continues until cell death. In undifferentiated myeloid cells, homologous cis-elements in the CYBB and NCF2 genes are repressed by the homeodomain transcription factor HoxA10. During cytokine-induced myelopoiesis, tyrosine phosphorylation of HoxA10 decreases binding affinity for the CYBB and NCF2 cis-elements. This abrogates HoxA10-induced transcriptional repression as differentiation proceeds. Therefore, mechanisms involved in differentiation stage-specific HoxA10 tyrosine phosphorylation are of interest because HoxA10 phosphorylation modulates myeloid-specific gene transcription. In this study, we found that HoxA10 is a substrate for SHP2 protein-tyrosine phosphatase in undifferentiated myeloid cells. In contrast, HoxA10 is a substrate for a constitutively active mutant form of SHP2 in both undifferentiated and differentiating myeloid cells. Expression of such SHP2 mutants results in persistent HoxA10 repression of CYBB and NCF2 transcription during myelopoiesis. Both HoxA10 overexpression and activating SHP2 mutations have been described in human myeloid malignancies. Therefore, our results suggest that these mutations could cooperate, leading to decreased myeloid-specific gene transcription and functional differentiation block in myeloid cells with both defects.

The murine and human HOX genes are divided into four paralog groups (A–D) on four different chromosomes. These genes encode highly conserved homeodomain transcription factors that are expressed cephlad to caudad during embryogenesis (1Eklund E.A. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2006; 13: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additionally, HOX gene transcription is differentiation stage-specific during definitive hematopoiesis (2Acampora D. D'Esposito M. Faiella A. Pannese M. Migliaccio E. Morelli F. Stornaiuolo A. Nitro V. Simeone A. Boncinelli A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10385-10400Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). For example, the HOX1–4 genes are maximally expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (3Sauvageau G. Lansdorp P.M. Eaves C.J. Hogge D.E. Dragowska W.H. Reid D.S. Largman C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12223-12227Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In contrast, HoxA5–13 (also referred to as the ABD HOXA genes) are maximally expressed in committed myeloid progenitors (3Sauvageau G. Lansdorp P.M. Eaves C.J. Hogge D.E. Dragowska W.H. Reid D.S. Largman C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12223-12227Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Differentiation stage-specific expression suggests that Hox proteins may regulate progression of myelopoiesis. Indeed, a number of studies indicate the importance of HoxA proteins for normal myeloid development (5Kasper L.H. Brindle P.K. Schnabel C.A. Pritchard C.E. Cleary M.L. Van Deursen J.M. Mol. Cell.

These studies found no profound hemato-phenotype in HoxA7, HoxA9, or HoxA10-deficient mice (10Fromental-Ramain C. Warto X. Lakkaraju S. Favier B. Haack H. Birling C. Dierich A. Doll P. Chambon P.

Nature. 1995; 374: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). This result suggests possible functional redundancy between these proteins. In contrast, overexpression of various Abd HoxA proteins results in significant abnormalities in murine bone marrow transplantation experiments. For example, mice transplanted with HoxA10-overexpressing bone marrow rapidly develop leukocytosis, characterized by circulating mature phagocytes (7Thorsteindottir U. Sauvageau G. Hough M.R.

Therefore, HoxA10 overexpression does not induce differentiation block and therefore is not adequate to induce AML. In this model, the time lag between myeloproliferation and AML is hypothesized to permit accumulation of additional genetic mutations; however, such cooperating mutations have not been identified. A study of bone marrow samples from human subjects with AML also suggests a role for HoxA10 overexpression in leukemogenesis (1Eklund E.A. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2006; 13: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Expression of the entire group of Abd HoxA proteins has been demonstrated in human AML bone marrow samples from subjects with translocations involving the MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) gene (8Kawagoe H. Humphries R.K. Blair A. Sutherland H.J. Hogge D.E. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 1999; 13: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In murine transplantation experiments, expression of such leukemia-associated MLL fusion proteins induces myeloproliferation, which progresses to blast crisis over several months (14Corral J.

Although such studies suggest that Abd HoxA proteins play important roles in normal and malignant hematopoiesis, relatively few genuine HoxA target genes have been identified. In previous studies, we found that HoxA10 represses transcription of the genes encoding two phagocyte respiratory burst oxidase proteins: gp91PHOX and p67PHOX (the CYBB and NCF2 genes, respectively) (20Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Lindsey S. Zhu C. Lu Y.F. Eklund E.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These genes are actively transcribed after the promyelocyte stage of myelopoiesis, and transcription continues until cell death (22Royer-Pokora B. Kunkle L.M. Monaco A.P. Goff S.C. Newburger P.E.

Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Science. 1990; 248: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We found that CYBB and NCF2 transcription is repressed in undifferentiated myeloid cells by interaction of HoxA10, Pbx1, and HDAC2 with homologous cis-elements in these genes (24Lu Y. Goldenberg I. Bei L. Andrejic J. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47792-47802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Pbx1 is dispensable for repression activity, which involves direct interaction of HDAC2 with a novel HoxA10 repression domain. Pbx1 is hypothesized to increase the DNA binding affinity of Hox proteins in such circumstances (25Chang C.P. Brocchieri L. Shen W.F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Additional studies suggest that HoxA10 also represses transcription of the genes encoding lactoferrin and neutrophil collagenase in undifferentiated myeloid cells (26Khanna-Gupta A. Zibello T. Kolla S. Neufeld E.J. Berliner N. Blood. 1997; 90: 2784-2795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lawson N.D. Khanna-Gupta A. Berliner N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2517-2524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, HoxA10 represses transcription of multiple genes that confer the mature myeloid phenotype. HoxA10 binding to the CYBB and NCF2 cis-elements decreases during myeloid differentiation in vitro and in vivo (20Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, HoxA10 protein abundance is relatively constant during differentiation of committed myeloid progenitor cells. In a previous study, we found that HoxA10 is tyrosine-phosphorylated during cytokine-induced myelopoiesis (28Eklund E.A. Goldenberg I. Lu Y. Andrejic J. Kakar R. J. Biol.

We also found that phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues in the HoxA10 homeodomain decreases binding affinity for the CYBB and NCF2 promoters (21Lindsey S. Zhu C. Lu Y.F. Eklund E.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Eklund E.A. Goldenberg I. Lu Y. Andrejic J. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36878-36888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, cytokine-induced post-translational modification regulates HoxA10 repression of myeloid-specific gene transcription. These results have implications for the role of HoxA10 in leukemogenesis. Specifically, HoxA10 overexpression might be expected to block transcription of genes conferring the mature myeloid phenotype, resulting in differentiation block and blast crisis. However, overexpressed HoxA10 does not repress transcription of such genes because it is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to hematopoietic cytokines (20Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Lindsey S. Zhu C. Lu Y.F. Eklund E.A. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 36878-36888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, differentiation block by overexpressed HoxA10 requires inhibition of cytokine-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. This could be due to decreased kinase activity or increased phosphatase activity. The time to acquire such genetic lesions might explain the lag between HoxA10-induced myeloproliferation and development of AML in the murine model. Although the HoxA10 kinase has not been identified, we found that Jak2 activation is sufficient for HoxA10 tyrosine phosphorylation (29Kakar R. Kautz B. Eklund E.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Additionally, we determined previously that SHP1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) is involved in maintaining HoxA10 in a non-tyrosine-phosphorylated state in immature myeloid cells (28Eklund E.A. Goldenberg I. Lu Y. Andrejic J. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36878-36888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). During cytokine-induced differentiation, SHP1 PTP activity decreases, increasing HoxA10 tyrosine phosphorylation. However, leukemia-associated activating mutants of SHP1 have not been identified. In contrast, activating mutations in the closely related SHP2 PTP have been identified in samples from human subjects with myelodysplastic syndromes, AML, or juvenile chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (30Tartaglia M.

Blood. 2004; 103: 2325-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In the resting state, the catalytic domain in SHP2 is masked. Activation occurs when phosphotyrosine residues in a substrate or another protein interact with an SH2 (Src homology 2) domain in SHP2, resulting in a conformational change. Previously described leukemia-associated mutations induce a conformational change that unmasks the catalytic domain, resulting in constitutive activation (32O'Reilly A.M. Pluskey S. Shoelson S.E. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mice transplanted with bone marrow expressing such SHP2 PTP mutants develop a myeloproliferative disorder, but not AML (33Mohi M.G. Williams I.R. Dearolf C.R. Chan G. Kutok J.L. Cohen S. Morgan K.

In this study, we investigated whether HoxA10 is a substrate for leukemia-associated activating SHP2 mutants in differentiating myeloid cells. We also investigated the impact of expressing such SHP2 mutants on repression of CYBB and NCF2 transcription by overexpressed HoxA10 as a model for disease progression in myeloid malignancy. The goal of this study was to determine whether HoxA10 overexpression and activating SHP2 PTP mutants might be cooperating genetic defects in the multistep process leading from myeloproliferation to acute myeloid leukemia. Protein Expression Vectors—The human HoxA10 cDNA was obtained from Dr. C. Largman (University of California, San Francisco) (35Lowney P. Corral J. Detmer K. Le Beau M.M. Deaven L. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3443-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This cDNA sequence represents the major transcript in mammalian hematopoietic cells, encoding a 393-amino acid 55-kDa protein. HoxA10 cDNA sequence was subcloned into the pcDNAamp vector for in vitro translation, pSRα for expression in mammalian cells (36Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisajwa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pMSCV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for expression in murine bone marrow cells. The cDNA for SHP2 PTP was obtained from Dr. Stuart Frank (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL). A leukemia-associated activating SHP2 mutant (E76K) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange protocol as described (37Huang W.Q. Saberwal G. Horvath E. Lindsey S. Eklund E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6311-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mutant clones were sequenced on both strands to verify that only the intended mutations had been introduced. Wild-type and E76K SHP2 were subcloned into the pMSCVneo vector (Stratagene) for retroviral production. These cDNAs were also subcloned into the pcDNAamp vector for in vitro protein translation. Wild-type SHP1 and SHP2 were subcloned into the pGEX1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) for expression in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Reporter Constructs—Artificial promoter-reporter constructs were generated in the minimal promoter-reporter vector pTATACAT (obtained from Dr. Andrew Kraft, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC) as described previously (38Scholer H.R. Balling R. Hazopoulos A.K. Suzuki N. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2551-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). A construct was generated with four copies of the negative cis-elements repressed by HoxA10 from the CYBB (–94 to –134 bp) or NCF2 (–600 to –637 bp) promoter subcloned into this vector in the forward direction (referred to as p-cybbTATACAT and p-ncf2TATACAT, respectively) (20Eklund E.A.

In these oligonucleotides, the HoxA10 core is in boldface, the Pbx core is in italics, and ccaat boxes are underlined. Complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed and used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) or subcloned to generate artificial promoter constructs as described (20Eklund E.A.

Immunol. 1980; 125: 6-14PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Andrew Kraft. Cells were maintained and differentiated as described (20Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol.

For differentiation experiments, U937 cells were treated for 48 h with 500 units/ml human recombinant interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (Roche Applied Science) (20Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transfections for Promoter Analysis—U937 cells were cultured and transfected as described previously (20Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Lindsey S. Zhu C. Lu Y.F. Eklund E.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells (32 × 106/sample) were transfected with vector expressing HoxA10 (pSRα/HoxA10) or empty control vector; wild-type SHP2 (pSX/SHP2), SHP2 with a leukemia-associated activating mutation (pSX/E76K SHP2), a dominant-negative form of SHP2 (pSX/C463S SHP2), or empty control vector; the minimal promoter-reporter vector pTATACAT with four copies of the CYBB –94 to –134 bp sequence (p-cybbTATACAT), four copies of the NCF2 –600 to –637 bp sequence (p-ncf2TATACAT), or the empty pTATACAT control vector; and pCMV-β-galactosidase (to control for transfection efficiency). Transfectants were harvested 48 h after transfection with and without incubation with human recombinant IFN-γ (500 units/ml). Lysates were analyzed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and β-galactosidase activities as described (20Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transfections for Stable Pools Overexpressing SHP2—U937 cells were transfected with empty expression vector or vector overexpressing wild-type or E76K SHP2 as described above. After 24 h, the medium was supplemented with G418 to 1 mg/ml, and stable transfectant pools were selected over 7–14 days as described previously (20Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Stable transfectant pools were selected instead of clones to compensate for possible integration site effects. All experiments were repeated with at least two independent transfectant pools for each construct. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were obtained from the femurs of wild-type mice. Bipotential myeloid progenitor cells were cultured (at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml) for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 ng/ml murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and 5 ng/ml murine recombinant IL-3 (R&D Systems). After retroviral transduction (see below), cells were either maintained in GM-CSF and interleukin-3 (IL-3; myeloid progenitor cells) or switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 ng/ml murine recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; R&D Systems) for 96 h (monocyte differentiation). Cells were harvested, and cell lysates were used in Western blot experiments as described below. High titer murine stem cell retroviral supernatants were produced using the pMSCVneo vector and the PT67 cell line following the instructions of Stratagene. Filtered retroviral supernatants were used immediately or stored at –80 °C. Transductions of murine bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells were performed as described previously (37Huang W.Q. Saberwal G. Horvath E. Lindsey S. Eklund E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6311-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, and 4.0 × 106 cells were plated in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 ng/ml GM-CSF, and 5 ng/ml IL-3. An equal volume of retroviral supernatant was added to each dish, and Polybrene was added to a final concentration of 6 μg/ml. Cells were incubated for 8 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 and then diluted 3-fold with medium supplemented as described above. Cells were incubated overnight, and the procedure was repeated the next day. The day after transduction, G418 was added to 250 ng/ml. Cells were selected in antibiotics for 48 h and then treated with cytokines as indicated. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Expression of transduced proteins was independently verified by Western blotting for each experiment. Nuclear extract proteins were isolated from U937 cells by the method of Dignam et al.

In some experiments, U937 cells were differentiated with 500 units/ml IFN-γ before nuclear protein isolation. Oligonucleotide probes were prepared, and EMSAs and antibody supershift assays were performed as described (20Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol.

U937 cells were cultured with or without IFN-γ for 48 h as described above. Cells for chromatin immunoprecipitation were incubated with formaldehyde prior to lysis, and lysates were sonicated to generate chromatin fragments with an average size of 2.0 kb as described (42Zhu C.

Lysates underwent immunoprecipitation with either antiserum to HoxA10 or preimmune serum as described (42Zhu C. Saberwal G. Ly Y.F. Platanias L.C. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50874-50885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Coprecipitated chromatin was analyzed by PCR for HoxA10-specific antibody coprecipitation of the CYBB and NCF2 gene promoters. For these experiments, input chromatin was used as a positive control, and chromatin precipitated by preimmune serum was used as a negative control. PCR products were analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The identity of the PCR product was verified by subcloning into a plasmid vector, followed by dideoxy sequencing. Western Blotting of Lysate Proteins from Murine Bone Marrow Cells—Murine bone marrow cells were lysed by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer. Lysate proteins (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose according to standard techniques. Western blots were serially probed with antibodies to gp91PHOX, p67PHOX, SHP2, HoxA10, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (to control for loading). Anti-phosphotyrosine Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—U937 cells were lysed, and lysates were immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions with HoxA10 antiserum or preimmune serum control. Murine bone marrow-derived myeloid cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions with antibody to phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10, Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) or irrelevant control antibody (anti-GST tag) as described previously (28Eklund E.A. Goldenberg I. Lu Y. Andrejic J. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36878-36888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose as described above. Western blots of U937 proteins were serially probed with antibodies to phosphotyrosine and HoxA10. Blots of murine myeloid cell proteins were probed with HoxA10-specific antibody. In vitro transcribed HoxA10 and E76K SHP2 mRNAs were generated from linearized template DNA using the Riboprobe system (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro translated proteins were generated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control (unprogrammed) lysates were generated in similar reactions in the absence of input RNA. For these experiments, HoxA10 (but not E76K SHP2) was radiolabeled by includin"
https://openalex.org/W2061126697,"The O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) repairs O6-alkylguanine and O4-alkylthymine adducts in single-stranded and duplex DNAs. Here we characterize the binding of AGT to single-stranded DNAs ranging in length from 5 to 78 nucleotides (nt). Binding is moderately cooperative (37.9 ± 3.0 ≤ ω ≤ 89.8 ± 8.9), resulting in an all-or-nothing association pattern on short templates. This cooperativity contrasts with the isolated binding seen in recent crystal structures of AGT-DNA complexes. The statistical binding site size S (mean = 5.2 ± 0.1) oscillates with increasing template length. The oscillation period (4.10 ± 0.02 nt/protein) is nearly identical to the binding site size obtained at the highest known binding density (S = 4 nt/protein) and is significantly smaller than the contour length (∼8 bp) occupied in crystalline complexes. A model in which AGT proteins overlap along the DNA contour is proposed to account for these features. Oscillations in intrinsic binding constant Ki and cooperativity factor ω have the same frequency but are of opposite phase to S with the result that the most stable protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions occur at the highest packing densities. We hypothesize that modest binding cooperativity and high binding densities are adaptations that allow AGT to efficiently search for lesions in the context of chromatin remodeling and DNA replication.

As a consequence of this life cycle, the number of O6-alkylguanine and O4-alkylthymine adducts that can be repaired at one time depends on the steadystate cellular concentration of the unalkylated form of AGT (2Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6119-6129PubMed Google Scholar, 3Margison G.P. Santibáñez-Koref M.F. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and on its ability to partition between DNA lesion sites and the vast amount of genomic DNA in which they are embedded. Three considerations motivate this characterization of AGT binding to single-stranded oligonucleotides. First, the enzyme binds single-stranded DNAs in vitro with affinities close to those observed with duplex DNAs (13Fried M.G. Kanugula S. Bromberg J.L. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15295-15301Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Rasimas J.J. Pegg A.E. Fried M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7973-7980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although repair rates have been found to be slower with single-stranded templates than with duplex (19Bhattacharyya D. Foote R.S. Boulden A.M. Mitra S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it remains possible that the repair of single-stranded templates might be a normal function of AGT within the cell. A better understanding of AGT interactions with single-stranded DNAs will contribute to our ability to test the novel possibility. Second, oligonucleotides containing O6-alkylguanine offer advantages over the mononucleotide inhibitors currently under clinical trial. Important among these are improved water solubility, greater reactivity with AGT, and efficacy against O6-benzylguanine-resistant AGT mutants (20Pegg A.E. Kanugula S. Edara S. Pauly G.T. Moschel R.C.

A better understanding of the interactions of the enzyme with single-stranded DNAs may guide the development of therapeutically useful oligonucleotide inhibitors. Finally, recent crystal structures of AGT-DNA complexes depict the isolated binding of enzyme molecules to duplex DNA 7The structures obtained by Daniels et al. (22Daniels D.S. Woo T.T. Luu K.X.

Two AGT molecules make separate contacts with a single DNA, and one binds the second DNA. Within this unit two AGT molecules bound to different DNA molecules form a protein-protein contact. 7The structures obtained by Daniels et al. (22Daniels D.S. Woo T.T. Luu K.X. Noll D.M. Clarke N.D.

Two AGT molecules make separate contacts with a single DNA, and one binds the second DNA. Within this unit two AGT molecules bound to different DNA molecules form a protein-protein contact.. This contrasts with the closely packed, cooperative pattern of binding observed in free solution with both single-stranded and duplex templates (Ref. 14Rasimas J.J. Pegg A.E. Fried M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7973-7980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and this work) and suggests that binding in free solution may involve a different ensemble of molecular contacts than is present in the crystal structures. A more complete characterization of cooperative AGT-DNA interactions may help us to account for this difference. Enzymes and Reagents—T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs. [γ-32P]ATP was from ICN Radiochemicals. Electrophoresis grade polyacrylamide was from Fisher. All other chemicals were reagent grade or better. Human AGT Protein—Recombinant human AGT protein (tagged with His6 at its C-terminal end) was purified to apparent homogeneity according to published protocols (22Daniels D.S. Woo T.T. Luu K.X.

The purity of the protein was verified by SDS-gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206896) Google Scholar, 24Nesterenko M.V.

Sedimentation equilibrium data were consistent with a single species with Mr = 21,860 ± 400 (result not shown). This value agrees well with previous measurements (13Fried M.G. Kanugula S. Bromberg J.L. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15295-15301Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the value (Mr = 21,614) predicted from the sequence of this variant of the protein. The preparations used were >95% active in transfer of methyl groups from O6-[3H]methylguanine-labeled calf thymus DNA to AGT and >95% active in debenzoylating O6-benzylguanine as described previously (25Kanugula S.

AGT concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient, ϵ280 = 3.93 × 104 m-1 cm-1, calculated from the data of Roy et al. (27Roy R. Shiota S. Kennel S.J.

Values of ϵ215/ϵ280 = 8.2 and ϵ260/ϵ280 = 0.63 were obtained from UV spectra of the purified protein dissolved in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, at 21 °C. DNA Substrates—Oligodeoxyribonucleotides of 5, 7, 9, 11, 16, 22, 24, 30, 41, and 78 residues (sequences shown in Table 1) were synthesized by the Macromolecular Core Facility of the Penn State College of Medicine or were purchased from Operon. These DNA sequences were used previously in studies of DNA binding and/or repair by AGT (see Refs. 13Fried M.G. Kanugula S. Bromberg J.L. Pegg A.E.

All DNAs were purified by NENsorb chromatography as directed by the manufacturer. Oligonucleotides of 5, 7, and 9 nt were equilibrated with 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0 at 20 °C), 1 mm EDTA buffer by chromatography through short Biogel P2 columns. Longer DNA molecules were dialyzed to equilibrium against the same buffer prior to use. DNA samples for electrophoretic mobility shift analysis were labeled at 5′ termini with 32P as described by Maxam and Gilbert (30Maxam A. Gilbert W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed by buffer exchange using Biogel P2 centrifuge columns pre-equilibrated with 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0 at 21 °C), 1 mm EDTA. Single-stranded DNA concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients calculated by the nearest neighbor method (31Cantor C.R. Tinoco Jr., I. J. Mol.

Open table in a new tab Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Binding reactions were carried out at 20 ± 1°C in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Protein-DNA complexes were formed by adding appropriate amounts of AGT to solutions containing 32P-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotides. Mixtures were equilibrated at 20 ± 1 °C for 30 min. Duplicate samples incubated for longer periods gave identical results, indicating that equilibrium had been attained (result not shown). Electrophoresis was carried out in 10% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide = 75) cast and run at 8 V/cm in buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.6, supplemented with NaCl to match the conductivity of the protein-DNA samples (33Fried M.G. Electrophoresis. 1989; 10: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were obtained with Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat Blue XB-1 film exposed at 4 °C. Gel segments containing individual electrophoretic species were excised using the developed film as a guide and counted in a scintillation counter by the Cerenkov method. Similar results were obtained by densitometry of appropriately exposed autoradiographic films. The serial dilution method (34Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 35Fried M.G. Daugherty M.A. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 47Zeman S.M. Crothers D.M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 340: 51-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was used to obtain self-consistent estimates of binding stoichiometry (n) and the association constant (Kn). For the cooperative binding mechanism nP + D ⇄ PnD, the association constant is Kn = [PnD]/[D][P]nfree. Here P represents AGT protein, D represents DNA, and PnD represents the AGT-DNA complex of protein-DNA ratio n. Separating variables and taking logarithms gives Equation 1. ln[PnD][D]=nln[P]free+lnKn(Eq. 1) Dilution of an AGT-DNA mixture changes [PnD]/[D]by mass action while maintaining the ratio of [P]total to [D]total. The free protein concentration at each dilution step can be estimated using [P]free = [P]input - n[PnD] starting with an initial value of n; Equation 1 is then used to calculate a new value of n from the DNA binding distribution. This value is then used to calculate a new estimate of [P]free. These calculations are repeated recursively until values of n converge. In many cases stoichiometries, association constants, and cooperativity parameters were evaluated by direct titration. Solutions of AGT protein (typically 5 × 10-7 m ≤ [AGT] ≤ 3 × 10-4 m) were added directly to [32P]DNA solutions (typically ∼5 × 10-8 m), and samples were analyzed by native gel electrophoresis. Because the total concentration of protein binding sites on DNA was always significantly less than that of the protein, the approximation [P] = [P]free was used. The dependence of binding density ν on the free protein concentration [P] was given by the McGhee-von Hippel isotherm (36McGhee J. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar) as modified by Record and co-workers (37Tsodikov O.V. Holbrook J.A. Shkel I.A. Record Jr., M.T. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1960-1969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) to account for finite lattice size (Equations 2 and 3). v[P]=K(1-sv)((2ω-1)(1-sv)+v-R2(ω-1)(1-sv))n-1(1-(s+1)v+R2(1-sv))2(N-s+1N)(Eq. 2) R=((1-(s+1)v)2+4ωv(1-sv))1/2(Eq. 3) Here ν is the binding density (protein molecules/nucleotide), K is the equilibrium association constant for binding a single site, ω is the cooperativity parameter, N is the length of the DNA in nucleotides, and s is the size of the site (in nucleotides) that a protein molecule occupies to the exclusion of others. In this context, the cooperativity parameter ω is equal to the equilibrium constant for the process of moving a protein from an isolated site to a singly contiguous one or from a singly contiguous site to a doubly contiguous one. Thus, it is a measure of the population-averaged equilibrium constant for interaction between proteins occupying adjacent sites on the DNA. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Human AGT protein and oligodeoxyribonucleotides were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl. Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed at 20 ± 0.1 °C in a Beckman XL-A centrifuge using an AN60Ti rotor. Most scans were obtained at 252 nm to minimize protein contribution to the DNA signal (38Daugherty M.A. Fried M.G. Scott D. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Techniques and Method. Royal Society of Chemistry, Oxford2005: 195-209Google Scholar), although some data sets were obtained at 260 nm. Equilibrium was held to be attained when scans taken 6 h apart were indistinguishable. Typically equilibration times of 24 h met this criterion for AGT-DNA mixtures. Five scans were averaged for each sample at each wavelength and rotor speed. For DNAs with small numbers of protein interaction sites, cooperative binding can be described by the simple mechanism nP + D ⇄ PnD in which free DNA (D) is in equilibrium with saturated complex (PnD), but intermediates with subsaturating protein stoichiometries are not present at significant concentrations. At sedimentation equilibrium, the radial distribution of absorbance for such a system is given by Equation 4. A(r)=αPexp[σP(r2-r02)]+αDexp[σD(r2-r02)]+αPnDexp[σPnD(r2-r02)]+∈(Eq. 4) Here A(r) is the absorbance at radial position r and αP, αD, and αPnD are absorbances of protein, DNA, and protein-DNA complex at the reference position r0, and ϵ is a base-line offset that accounts for radial position-independent differences in the absorbances of different cell assemblies. The reduced molecular weights of AGT protein, DNA, and protein-DNA complexes are given by σP=MP(1-v¯Pρ)ω2/(2RT), σD=MD(1-v¯Dρ)ω2/(2RT), and σPnD=(nMP+MD)(1-v¯PnDρ)ω2/(2RT). Here MP and MD are the molecular weights of protein and DNA, n is the protein:DNA ratio of the complex, r is the solvent density, ω is the rotor angular velocity, R is the gas constant, and T the temperature (kelvin). The partial specific volume of AGT (v̄P = 0.744 ml/g) was calculated by the method of Cohn and Edsall (39Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold, New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar) using partial specific volumes of amino acids tabulated by Laue et al. (40Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Harding J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). The partial specific volume of single-stranded NaDNA at 0.1 m NaCl (0.502 ml/g) was estimated by interpolation of the data of Cohen and Eisenberg (41Cohen G. Eisenberg H. Biopolymers. 1968; 6: 1077-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Partial specific volumes of each protein-DNA complex were estimated using Equation 5. v¯PnD=(nMPv¯P+MDv¯D)(nMP+MD)(Eq. 5) This relationship is based on the assumption that there is no significant change in partial specific volumes of the components upon association. This approach has been used successfully for other protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions (42Rippe K. Mucke N. Schulz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 915-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 43Dyckman D. Fried M.G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13378-13389Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), although there are notable exceptions (45Maluf N.K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 889-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Estimated with Equation 5, v̄PnD is ∼ 0.73 for the complexes described here. Accordingly a 1% error in our estimate of v̄PnD results in an error in MPnD of nearly 3%. However, a comparison of stoichiometries estimated by sedimentation equilibrium and EMSA methods (Table 2) suggests that errors in v̄PnD are unlikely to be large. Equation 4 was used in global analysis of multiple data sets obtained at different macromolecular concentrations and rotor speeds (46Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). In this method, the values of αP, αD, αPnD, and ϵ are unique to each sample, but the value of n must be common to all data sets. Terms accounting for non-ideal effects were not included because there was no evidence of non-ideality (see Table 1).TABLE 2Stoichiometries of AGT-DNA complexesDNA lengthMr (complex)aDetermined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis.

https://openalex.org/W1978845914,"We have recently identified a gene named GITR (glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor related gene). GITR is expressed in different cells and tissues such as T lymphocytes from thymus and spleen and lymph nodes, and also in the lung. GITR ligand (GITRL) is expressed in several cells including macrophages, B cells, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells. In the present study, by comparing the responses in wild-type (WT) mice (GITR+/+) and GITR-deficient mice (GITR-/-), we investigated the role played by GITR-GITRL interaction in the development of chronic lung injury caused by bleomycin instillation. When compared with bleomycin-treated GITR+/+ mice, bleomycin-treated GITR-/- mice exhibited a reduced degree of i) lung infiltration with polymorphonuclear neutrophils (MPO activity); ii) edema formation; iii) histological evidence of lung injury; iv) TNF-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta production; v) nitrotyrosine formation; and vi) NF-kappaB activation. The cotreatment of GITR+/+ mice with Fc-GITR fusion protein (6.25 microg/mouse) also significantly attenuated all of the above indicators of lung damage and inflammation. Our results clearly demonstrate that GITR-GITRL interaction plays an important role in the chronic lung injury induced by bleomycin in the mice."

https://openalex.org/W2018057094,"The transcription-intermediary-factor-2 (TIF-2) is a coactivator of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and its disruption would be expected to influence glucocorticoid-mediated control of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Here, we show that its targeted deletion in mice is associated with altered expression of several glucocorticoid-dependent components of HPA regulation (e.g., corticotropin-releasing hormone, vasopressin, ACTH, glucocorticoid receptors), suggestive of hyperactivity under basal conditions. At the same time, TIF-2(-/-) mice display significantly lower basal corticosterone levels and a sluggish and blunted initial secretory response to brief emotional and prolonged physical stress. Subsequent analysis revealed this discrepancy to result from pronounced aberrations in the structure and function of the adrenal gland, including the cytoarchitectural organization of the zona fasciculata and basal and stress-induced expression of key elements of steroid hormone synthesis, such as the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD). In addition, altered expression levels of two nuclear receptors, DAX-1 and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), in the adrenal cortex strengthen the view that TIF-2 deletion disrupts adrenocortical development and steroid biosynthesis. Thus, hyperactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary unit is ascribed to insidious adrenal insufficiency and impaired glucocorticoid feedback."
https://openalex.org/W2046940029,"Voltage-gated calcium channels are in a closed conformation at rest and open temporarily when the membrane is depolarized. To gain insight into the molecular architecture of Ca(v)1.2, we probed the closed and open conformations with the charged phenylalkylamine (-)devapamil ((-)qD888). To elucidate the access pathway of (-)D888 to its binding pocket from the intracellular side, we used mutations replacing a highly conserved Ile-781 by threonine/proline in the pore-lining segment IIS6 of Ca(v)1.2 (1). The shifted channel gating of these mutants (by 30-40 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction) enabled us to evoke currents with identical kinetics at different potentials and thus investigate the effect of the membrane potentials on the drug access per se. We show here that under these conditions the development of channel block by (-)qD888 is not affected by the transmembrane voltage. Recovery from block at rest was, however, accelerated at more hyperpolarized voltages. These findings support the conclusion that Ca(v)1.2 must be opening widely to enable free access of the charged (-)D888 molecule to its binding site, whereas drug dissociation from the closed channel conformation is restricted by bulky channel gates. The functional data indicating a location of a trapped (-)D888 molecule close to the central pore region are supported by a homology model illustrating that the closed Ca(v)1.2 is able to accommodate a large cation such as (-)D888."
https://openalex.org/W2141237670,"Ribavirin is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is used to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients. The virological response after ribavirin treatment appears to be insufficient to fully explain ribavirin-induced beneficial effects. Angiogenesis plays a pathogenic role in HCV-induced liver damage. Here, we investigated the influence of therapeutic ribavirin concentrations on angiogenesis. Ribavirin inhibited endothelial cell tube formation in vitro and vessel formation in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay in vivo. Ribavirin inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which causes depletion of cellular GTP and in turn reduction of cellular tetrahydrobiopterin levels. The availability of tetrahydrobiopterin limits NO production by endothelial NO synthase. Ribavirin reduced levels of tetrahydrobiopterin (as revealed by HPLC), NO (as revealed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy), and cGMP (as revealed by RIA) in endothelial cells. Addition of tetrahydrobiopterin or NO prevented ribavirin-induced tube formation inhibition. In conclusion, angiogenesis inhibition by ribavirin has not been described before. This inhibition may contribute to ribavirin-induced pharmacological effects including adverse events."
https://openalex.org/W2087757444,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B) has been implicated in the regulation of the insulin receptor. Dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor results in decreased insulin signaling and thus decreased glucose uptake. PTP-1B–/– mice have increased insulin sensitivity and are resistant to weight gain when fed a high fat diet, validating PTP-1B as a potential target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Many groups throughout the world have been searching for selective inhibitors for PTP-1B, and most of them target inhibitors to PTP-1B-(1–298), the N-terminal catalytic domain of the enzyme. However, the C-terminal domain is quite large and could influence the activity of the enzyme. Using two constructs of PTP-1B and a phosphopeptide as substrate, steady state assays showed that the presence of the C-terminal domain decreased both the Km and the kcat 2-fold. Pre-steady state kinetic experiments showed that the presence of the C-terminal domain improved the affinity of the enzyme for a phosphopeptide 2-fold, primarily because the off-rate was slower. This suggests that the C-terminal domain of PTP-1B may contact the phosphopeptide in some manner, allowing it to remain at the active site longer. This could be useful when screening libraries of compounds for inhibitors of PTP-1B. A compound that is able to make contacts with the C-terminal domain of PTP-1B would not only have a modest improvement in affinity but may also provide for specificity over other phosphatases.

Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2004; 13: 199-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).PTP-1B is a member of the intracellular PTP family that comprises monomeric enzymes containing a single catalytic domain and various additional domains believed to be essential for cellular localization or enzymatic regulation (21Li L.

The full-length PTP-1B enzyme is made up of 435 amino acids, including an N-terminal 298-amino acid catalytic phosphatase domain and a C-terminal domain (amino acids 299–435) involved in protein-protein interactions and cellular localization (24Charbonneau H.

However, no systematic study has verified that the enzymatic activity of this fragment is the same as the full-length enzyme. A recent study showed that an allosteric inhibitor of PTP-1B was 2-fold more potent on a more full-length construct relative to the catalytic domain alone (32Montalibet J. Skorey K. McKay D. Scapin G. Asante-Appiah E. Kennedy B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5258-5266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The current study investigated whether the C-terminal domain of PTP-1B contributes to the catalytic function of the enzyme. PTP-1B-(1–411) was used to mimic the full-length enzyme, and PTP-1B-(1–298) contained only the catalytic domain. Steady state phosphatase assays and pre-steady state substrate binding assays revealed a difference between these two enzymes in their affinity for a phosphorylated peptide substrate. Specifically, the phosphorylated peptide was retained longer by PTP-1B-(1–411) compared with PTP-1B-(1–298), suggesting that the C-terminal domain of PTP-1B helps to stabilize the enzyme-substrate complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzymes—Human PTP-1B (amino acids 1–411 or 1–298) was cloned by PCR from a human hippocampal cDNA library (Clontech) and inserted into a pET 19-b vector (Novagen) at the NcoI restriction site. The sequence of the forward primer used to clone both PTP-1B-(1–411) and PTP-1B-(1–298) was GCC CGC CAT GGA GAT GGA AAA GGA G. The sequence of the reverse primer for PTP-1B-(1–411) was GCA AGC CAC CCA TGG CTA GAC CAG AA and for PTP-1B-(1–298) was CTC GGG TGG CCA TGG CTA GTC CTC GTG GGA. Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with this clone and stored in 20% glycerol at –80 °C. For enzyme production, a stock culture was grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). Expression of PTP-1B was initiated by induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside after the culture had reached an A600 of 0.6. After 4 h, the bacterial pellet was collected by centrifugation and the cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml DNase I, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml lysozyme, 1 tablet/50 ml complete protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics), pH 7.6). The cells were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was collected, the buffer was exchanged with a cation exchange buffer (50 mm MES, 75 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.5), loaded onto a POROS 20SP column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc.), and the protein was eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (0–500 mm). The fractions containing PTP-1B were pooled, and the buffer was exchanged with an anion exchange buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0). The PTP-1B protein was purified on a Source 30 Q column (Amersham Biosciences) using a linear NaCl gradient (0–300 mm). PTP-1B was pooled and frozen at –80 °C. As judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the preparations were >95% pure. The protein concentration was determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm in 8 m urea (extinction coefficient is 60,000 M–1cm–1 for PTP-1B-(1–411) and 45,900 M–1cm–1 for PTP-1B-(1–298)).Phosphopeptide—The sequence of the phosphopeptide used in the experiments mimicked a sequence of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) that is a substrate of PTP-1B (GNGDpYMPMSPKS) (33Goldstein B.J. Bittner-Kowalczyk A. White M.F. Harbeck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4283-4289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The peptide was synthesized using a RINK resin (Midwest Bio-Tech, Fishers, IN) using standard FMOC (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase peptide chemistry and purified using reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Amino acid analysis was performed (Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc.) for accurate determination of the peptide concentration.pNPP Phosphatase Assay—The para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) phosphatase assays were carried out at room temperature in a microtiter plate using a Molecular Devices Spectra-MAX Plus spectrophotometer. PTP-1B-(1–411) or PTP-1B-(1–298) (50 nm) was mixed with pNPP (Sigma) (0–60 mm) in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol). The absorbance of the product, para-nitrophenol (pNP), was measured every 12 s for 300 s at 405 nm and was converted into molar product using an extinction coefficient of 12,852 M–1cm–1. The molar pNP was plotted as a function of time, and the slope of the plot provided the reaction rate. The experiment was repeated at multiple concentrations of pNPP, and the rate of each reaction was plotted as a function of the pNPP concentration. The data were fit to a hyperbola to obtain the Km and kcat values (Sigma Plot 2000; SPSS Inc.).Phosphorylated Peptide Phosphatase Assay—The phosphorylated peptide phosphatase assays were carried out at room temperature in a cuvette (650 μl) using a LS50B PerkinElmer fluorometer. PTP-1B-(1–411) or PTP-1B-(1–298) (4 nm) was mixed with the phosphorylated peptide (0–150 μm) in Buffer A. After excitation at 280 nm, the fluorescence of the phosphorylated tyrosine was measured at 305 nm every 10 s for 300 s (34Zhang Z.Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Roeske R.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The data were plotted and analyzed as described above. To ensure that less than 10% of the substrate was converted to product, several reactions were allowed to proceed to saturation. This allowed for conversion from fluorescence units to micromolar product. Experiments using the same peptide, but phosphorylated with 33P, showed that PTP-1B converted 100% of the substrate to product (data not shown).Stopped Flow Peptide Binding—The pre-steady state peptide binding studies were done at 22 °C using a stopped flow instrument (KinTek Corp., State College, PA). PTP-1B-(1–411) or PTP-1B-(1–298) (1 μm final concentration) in Buffer A was rapidly mixed with phosphorylated peptide (0–40 μm final concentration) in Buffer A. Fluorescence was monitored using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and measuring the fluorescence changes that occurred between 330–354 nm. For each experiment, at least five traces were averaged. No fluorescence changes were observed in the control experiments, including experiments done in the absence of PTP-1B or the phosphorylated peptide.To accurately measure the observed rate at which peptide bound to PTP-1B, 500 data points were collected over six half-lives of the first phase of increasing fluorescence. After the first phase of changing fluorescence was saturated, there were additional phases of changing fluorescence. However, the rates for these additional phases were slower than the steady state rate of PTP-1B activity, indicating that they were not occurring during the first turnover. Therefore, only the first phase of changing fluorescence was monitored. At each concentration of peptide tested, the first phase of changing fluorescence was fit to an equation describing a single exponential to obtain the observed rate for peptide binding, F = a*e(–kobs*t) + C, where F is the fluorescence as a function of time (t), a is the amplitude of the fluorescence change, and kobs is the observed rate constant of the fluorescence change. C is a constant.The observed rate constant for peptide binding was then plotted as a function of the peptide concentration, and the data were fit to a straight line to obtain estimates for the intrinsic on and off rates for peptide binding to PTP-1B, kobs = kon*(peptide) + koff.RESULTSTwo PTP-1B enzymes were characterized, PTP-1B-(1–298) and PTP-1B-(1–411), to investigate whether the C terminus of PTP-1B affects the enzymatic activity of the N-terminal domain. PTP-1B-(1–411) lacked the C-terminal 24 residues that localize the enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1A) and was used to mimic the full-length enzyme, because it was possible to obtain large quantities by overexpression in bacteria. PTP1B-(1–298) consisted of the catalytic domain alone. The enzymes were routinely purified to >95% purity, as indicated in Fig. 1.Steady State Hydrolysis of pNPP—pNPP is commonly used as a substrate of tyrosine phosphatases. It changes its absorbance when it is converted to product (pNP) and therefore can be monitored relatively easily. Steady state hydrolysis of pNPP by PTP-1B-(1–411) and PTP-1B-(1–298) was monitored over time by measuring the absorbance of pNP at 405 nm. As the concentration of pNPP was increased, the rate of the reaction increased in a hyperbolic manner. The rate of the reaction was plotted versus the concentration of substrate and was fit to a hyperbola to obtain Michaelis-Menten constants. The kcat and the Km for pNPP were similar for both forms of the enzyme, ∼3 s–1 and 2.2 mm, respectively (Fig. 2A and Table 1).FIGURE 2Phosphatase reactions were carried out at room temperature as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The experiments were repeated in triplicate on three different days, and the data shown are the mean of one experiment. A, PTP-1B-(1–411) (50 nm; white circles) or PTP-1B-(1–298) (50 nm; black circles) was added to pNPP (0–60 mm), and the reactions were monitored by measuring absorbance at 405 nm. The rate of formation of pNP was plotted versus the concentration of pNPP. Both sets of data were fit to a hyperbola providing kcat and Km values. The PTP-1B-(1–411) data provided a kcat of 2.8 s–1 and a Km of 1.8 mm, and the PTP-1B-(1–298) data provided a kcat of 2.7 s–1 and a Km of 2.8 mm. B, PTP-1B-(1–411) (4 nm; white circles) or PTP-1B-(1–298) (4 nm; black circles) was added to peptide (0–150 μm), and the reactions were monitored by measuring the changes in tyrosine fluorescence upon dephosphorylation of the peptide (excitation wavelength 280 nm, emission wavelength 305 nm). The rate of dephosphorylation of the peptide was plotted versus the concentration of peptide, and the data were fit to a hyperbola as described above. In the experiment shown, the kcat and Km were 9.2 s–1 and 9.7 μm, respectively, for PTP-1B-(1–411) and 19.7 s–1 and 19.8 μm, respectively, for PTP-1B-(1–298).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Steady state kinetic parameters for PTP-1B-(1–411) versus PTP-1B-(1–298)PNPPPeptideKmkcatKmkcatmms-1μms-1PTP-1B-(1-411)1.7 ± 0.22.9 ± 0.19.6 ± 0.67.7 ± 0.8PTP-1B-(1-298)2.7 ± 0.33.1 ± 0.219.1 ± 0.418.4 ± 0.9 Open table in a new tab Steady State Hydrolysis of a Phosphopeptide—The Km of a peptide containing a phosphotyrosine residue is smaller than the Km of pNPP or phosphotyrosine alone, indicating that there are additional residues besides those found directly in the active site of PTP-1B that contribute to recognition of the peptide substrate (28Salmeen A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23642-23647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Additional steady state phosphatase assays were done using a phosphorylated peptide (GNGDpYMPMSPKS) as substrate, measuring the fluorescence change of the tyrosine residue upon dephosphorylation (excitation wavelength 280 nm, emission wavelength 305 nm) (34Zhang Z.Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Roeske R.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast to what was observed using pNPP as a substrate, PTP-1B-(1–411) and PTP-1B-(1–298) showed differences for both the kcat and the Km (Fig. 2B and Table 1). Although PTP-1B-(1–298) hydrolyzed the phosphorylated peptide with a kcat that was 2-fold faster when compared with PTP-1B-(1–411), the Km for PTP-1B-(1–298) was 2-fold lower.Pre-steady State Peptide Binding—Pre-steady state stopped flow experiments were designed as shown in Fig. 3A. Briefly, PTP-1B was rapidly mixed in a stopped flow instrument with phosphorylated peptide, and a fluorescence change was measured in real time during peptide binding. It was not clear whether the fluorescence signal was a result of changes within PTP-1B or the phosphorylated peptide. However, the fluorescence signal increased upon peptide binding. The experiment was repeated at multiple peptide concentrations to elucidate the intrinsic rate constants (Fig. 3B). At each peptide concentration tested, the data were fit to an equation describing a single exponential function to obtain the observed rate for peptide binding. Fig. 3B shows data collected with PTP-1B-(1–411), but the same type of fluorescence changes were observed with PTP-1B-(1–298). The observed rate constants for peptide binding to PTP-1B increased linearly with peptide concentration (Fig. 4, A and B), indicating that the fluorescence changes were due to a bimolecular interaction between PTP-1B and the peptide. The data were fit to a straight line, and the slope and y-intercept provided the kon and koff, respectively (Table 2). The on-rate of the peptide to either form of the enzyme was the same. However, the off-rate of the peptide from PTP-1B-(1–411) was 2-fold slower than from PTP-1B-(1–298), 59 versus 120 s–1, respectively.FIGURE 3A, the schematic shows the design of the stopped flow experiments. A motor drive rapidly pushes the contents of two syringes through a flow cell into a third syringe, which stops the flow and mixes both solutions in the flow cell. The reaction occurring in the flow cell can be observed by fluorescence measurements (excitation wavelength 280 nm, emission between 330–354 nm). B, PTP-1B-(1–411) (1 μm final concentration) was loaded into one syringe and peptide (0–40 μm) was loaded into the other syringe.

The data shown are a representative data set because the experiment was repeated three times. A, the observed rates of PTP-1B-(1–411) binding to peptide increased linearly with peptide concentration. The slope of the line provided the kon (1.7 μm–1s–1) and the y intercept provided the koff (50.8 s–1).

https://openalex.org/W2055662650,"RasGRF1 is a neuron-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPases Ras and Rac. It is implicated in the regulation of memory formation and in the development of tolerance to drug abuse, although the mechanisms have been elucidated only in part.

This interaction requires the region spanning the Dblhomology domain of RasGRF1, endowed with catalytic activity on Rac. In search for a possible function we found by biochemical means that SCLIP influences the signaling properties of RasGRF1, greatly reducing its ability to activate the Rac/p38 MAPK pathway, while the Ras/Erk one remains unaffected. Moreover, a potential role is suggested by transfection studies in neuronal PC12 cells in which RasGRF1 induces neurite outgrowth, and coexpression of SCLIP counteracts this effect, causing a dramatic decrease in the percentage of cells bearing neurites, which also appear significantly shortened. This study unveils a physical and functional interaction between RasGRF1 and SCLIP.

Its expression is restricted to postnatal neurons of the central nervous system, enriched in postsynaptic densities (1Sturani E. Abbondio A. Branduardi P. Ferrari C. Zippel R. Martegani E. Vanoni M.

Indeed, RasGRF1 knock-out mice display defects in memory consolidation associated to different areas of the brain, fail to develop behavioral tolerance to chronic treatment with cannabinoids, and show abnormal synaptic properties to repeated exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (3Brambilla R.

The involvement of RasGRF1 and its closely related, widely distributed homologue RasGRF2 in intracellular signaling is developmentally regulated, because recent findings demonstrated that the components of signaling cascades from both types of ionotropic glutamate receptors, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor, to mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (Erks) switch during development and that RasGRFs play a major role in these signaling events only in mature neurons (8Tian X.

Chem. 2006; 281: 7578-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, regarding the signaling from NMDA receptor, recent experiments on single and double knock-out mice revealed that RasGRF1 and -2 respond to diverse subclasses of NMDA receptors and contribute to different forms of synaptic plasticity, because RasGRF1 mediates mainly long term depression by regulating Rac and its effector p38 MAPK, whereas RasGRF2 predominantly signals to Ras/Erk cascade and mediates long term potentiation (10Li S. Tian X. Hartley D.M. Feig L.A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1721-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). RasGRF1 is a 140-kDa modular protein containing multiple domains involved in interactions with specific binding partners and second messenger systems. In addition to its C-terminally located CDC25 homology domain (with exchange activity on Ras), it contains, in N- to C-terminal order, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain followed by a coiled-coil region and an ilimaquinone motif, collectively endowed with multiple functions, including the responsiveness to calcium, and a tandem Dbl (DH) and PH domain arrangement typical for Rho-family GEFs, with catalytic activity toward Rac. Some relevant protein interactions have been documented, and particularly attractive are results for those mediated by a specific region immediately upstream to the CDC25 homology domain with the NR2B subunity of NMDA receptor, and by the N-terminal region with the HIKE domain of the nerve growth factor (NGF)-receptor TrkA and with IB2/JIP2, a scaffold protein for the p38 MAPK cascade (11Krapivinsky G.

Remarkably, RasGRF1 was also found to form a precipitable complex with the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptor upon stimulation with AMPA (9Tian X. Feig L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7578-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To identify novel connections and give more insight into the physiological function of RasGRF1, in this work we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with the DH PH tandem as bait and isolated SCLIP (SCG10-like protein) as a new RasGRF1 binding partner. SCLIP was originally identified by a screening of expressed sequence tag databases and is a member of the stathmin family of phospho-proteins (15Ozon S. Byk T. Sobel A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2386-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Matsuo N. Kawamoto S. Matsubara K. Okubo K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 215: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Its expression was originally found to be restricted to brain structures in rodents (both neonatal and adult brain), and later a much more widespread expression profile was described in human tissues (15Ozon S.

Genomics. 2003; 81: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The stathmin family also includes the founding member stathmin (18Sobel A. Boutterin M.C. Beretta L. Chneiweiss H. Doye V.

J Biochem. 1997; 248: 794-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These proteins regulate microtubule dynamics, and this property mostly resides in their ability to sequester free tubulin dimers through their conserved stathmin-like domains (SLDs), thus interfering with microtubule assembly, although other mechanisms have also been proposed (21Jourdain L. Curmi P. Sobel A. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10817-10821Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Charbaut E. Curmi P.A. Ozon S. Lachkar S. Redeker V. Sobel A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All stathmin-related proteins except stathmin itself, which is diffusely distributed in the cytosol, possess additional N-terminal palmitoylated regions that anchor them to the Golgi apparatus (24Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25Charbaut E.

Res. 2002; 68: 535-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast to the ubiquitous expression of stathmin, all the other proteins are mainly restricted to the nervous system. Moreover, all of them are developmentally regulated in neuronal tissues, because expression of stathmin and SCG10 progressively increases during embryogenesis until birth and then decreases during postnatal development, whereas SCLIP and RB3, expressed embryonically, persist during postnatal development and into adulthood (15Ozon S. Byk T. Sobel A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2386-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Matsuo N. Kawamoto S. Matsubara K. Okubo K.

This suggests that, despite their similarity, they might have distinct functional roles. Stathmin and SCG10 are the family members that have been mainly characterized, and growing evidence suggests their involvement in neurite formation both during development and regeneration after injury and, at least for stathmin, in the regulation of neuronal cell motility (28Di Paolo G.

Here we report a novel interaction between RasGRF1 and SCLIP. In addition, we show a functional effect, because co-expression of SCLIP considerably reduced the ability of RasGRF1 to activate the Rac/p38 MAPK pathway and to promote neurite outgrowth in a neuronal model system. The cross-talk between RasGRF1 and SCLIP provides new insights into the properties of these molecules and opens possibilities for future studies in neurons. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen and Constructs—The yeast two-hybrid screen of an adult mouse brain cDNA library (BALB/c males, ages 9–12 weeks) constructed in the GAL4 activation domain plasmid pACT2 was carried out using the DH PH region of mouse RasGRF1 (aa 249–592) as bait. All vectors, yeast strains, and the library were purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA, MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DH PH tandem was PCR-amplified and subcloned into EcoRI/BamHI sites of pGBKT7 in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Primers were designed to introduce an EcoRI and a BamHI site, respectively, at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the DNA fragment. AH109 yeast strain was sequentially co-transformed with both the bait and the library plasmids, and cells were plated on highly selective SD-Ade-His-Trp-Leu medium (2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) supplemented with essential amino acids in the presence of 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (X-α-Gal) (Clontech). Library plasmids from positive clones grown within 5 days after plating were used to transform Escherichia coli cells for DNA isolation. After re-testing the phenotype by pairwise matings between yeast cells of AH109 and Y187 strains, single transformed with the bait or the isolated library plasmid, inserts were amplified by PCR, sequenced, and identified by Blast alignments. Deletion analysis was performed according to the experimental procedure described above. Full-length SCLIP and the indicated deletion constructs were subcloned in EcoRI/BamHI sites of pGADT7 in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain by PCR upon introduction of the proper restriction sites. Similarly, the fragments corresponding to the PHCCIQ region (aa 1–235) and the isolated DH (aa 240–440) and PH2 (aa 453–592) domains of RasGRF1 were subcloned into EcoRI/BamHI sites of pGBKT7 in-frame with GAL4 DNA binding domain. All the primers used in this study were synthesized by MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany), and their sequences are available upon request. All the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing, and the correct expression of the proteins was tested by Western blotting with antibodies to tags. Mammalian and Bacterial Expression Plasmids—Constructs encoding SCLIP, full-length or SLD, were generated by amplifying fragments by standard PCR techniques with primers designed to introduce proper restriction sites and then by subcloning them in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) in-frame with a sequence encoding for a FLAG epitope, previously introduced into the HindIII/EcoRI sites, in pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) to express GFP-SCLIP or in pEBG-mBad (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), to express GST-SCLIP. Plasmids encoding GFP and myc-tagged versions of SCG10 and RB3 (respectively, in pEGFP-N3 and pCDNA3myc) were kindly provided by A. Sobel (INSERM, Paris, France) and described in previous studies (25Charbaut E. Chauvin S. Enslen H. Zamaroczy S. Sobel A. J.

For expression of the myc-tagged DH PH tandem of RasGRF1 in mammalian cells the DNA fragment corresponding to aa 238–595 of mouse sequence was amplified by PCR with primers designed to introduce proper restriction sites and then subcloned into pcDNA3 downstream to a previously introduced myc epitope. Bacterial expression plasmids encoding the DH domain (aa 239–480) or the DH PH tandem (aa 239–591) of RasGRF1 fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) were a generous gift by E. Jacquet (Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau Cedex, France) and have been previously described (37Baouz S. Jacquet E. Accorsi K. Hountondji C. Balestrini M. Zippel R. Sturani E. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol.

MBP-DH PH fusions of mouse RasGRF2 (aa 235–599) and human SOS1 (aa 191–556) were generated by subcloning PCR-amplified fragments into pMAL-cRI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Cell Culture and Transfections—Cultures of hippocampal neurons were obtained from E17 Sprague-Dawley rat embryos (Harlan, Italy). Hippocampi were dissected, incubated with a solution of 0.05% trypsin/0.53 mm EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C, and mechanically dissociated through a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Cells were plated in culture dishes previously coated with 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. HEK293 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (EuroClone, Pero, Italy). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PC12 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (EuroClone) and 5% fetal bovine serum supplemented with antibiotics as above. All media were from Invitrogen. For studies on the effects of the expression of different proteins on differentiation, PC12 cells were plated in culture dishes at a density of 6 × 104 cells per cm2 and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with a 1:3 DNA to Lipofectamine ratio, using 1 μg of DNA per 35-mm dish (0.5 μg for each indicated plasmid in double transfections). When necessary empty vector (pcDNA3) was included in the transformation to ensure that each dish received the same amount of DNA. Approximately 20–22 h post-transfection, cells were reseeded at a cell density of 1.5 × 104 cells per cm2 on glass coverslips previously coated with 0.1 g/liter poly-l-lysine (Sigma) in low serum medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated horse serum) with or without the addition of 50 ng/ml human β-NGF (PeproTeck, London, UK) for 48 h before being fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. In Vitro Pull-down and in Vivo Coimmunoprecipitation Assays—MBP fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and bacterial lysates prepared as described (37Baouz S. Jacquet E. Accorsi K. Hountondji C. Balestrini M. Zippel R. Sturani E. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1742-1749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were solubilized in lysis buffer (12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants (500 μg of whole cell extract) were incubated with amylose-covered beads (New England Biolabs) precoupled to the specific MBP fusion proteins (10–30 μg for each protein), overnight at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by addition of Laemmli sample buffer, boiled 5 min, and detected by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. For GST-based pull-down assays, pEBG or pEBG-SCLIP plasmids (encoding, respectively, GST and GST-SCLIP) were transfected in HEK293 cells. 24 h post-transfection lysates were prepared (as described above except that 1 mm dithiothreitol was added and Nonidet P-40 was replaced by 2% Triton X-100), and 1 mg of cell lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After rocking for 2 h at 4°C, the beads were washed with lysis buffer and incubated with 1 mg of total protein extract for each sample from HEK293 cells transfected with RasGRF1 full-length or myc-DH PH, overnight at 4 °C, and then processed as above. For immunoprecipitations, lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated plasmids (1 mg for each sample) were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies (5 μg, Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Cultures of hippocampal neurons were solubilized in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants (800 μg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 2 μg of anti-RasGRF1 antibody (sc-224, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), 10 μl of anti-SCLIP antibody (a generous gift by A. Sobel, INSERM, Paris, France) or 2 μg of nonimmune rabbit IgGs, overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected with protein G-agarose or protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. Ras and Rac Activation Assays—Ras-GTP and Rac-GTP levels were detected by performing previously described pull-down assays. Bacterially expressed GST-RBD (Ras-binding domain) of cRaf or GST-PBD (p21 Cdc42/Rac1 binding domain) of PAK3 were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and used to precipitate, respectively, active myc-tagged Ras or HA-tagged Rac from transfected HEK293 cells. Cells were transfected with RasGRF1 and FLAG-SCLIP (400 ng each per 35-mm dish), alone or in combination, in the presence of myc-Ras (200 ng) or Rac-HA (100 ng). PHC21 was used in place of full-length RasGRF1 in Rac activation assays, and, in this case, the amount of plasmid to be transfected was optimized to 50 ng. Cells were serum starved for 18 h, and lysates were prepared as previously described (38Baldassa S. Zippel R. Sturani E. Brain Res. Mol Brain Res. 2003; 119: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (except that sodium deoxycholate was omitted to precipitate Rac-GTP). Equal amounts of proteins (150 μg) were subjected to affinity precipitation. After washing precipitates with lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and detected by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Aliquots of whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting to normalize for the total amount of transfected Ras and Rac. Western Blotting—Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose Protran membranes (Schleicher & Shuell GmbH, Dassel, Germany). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline for 30 min at 42 °C and probed with different primary antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline-5% BSA-Tween 20 (0.1–0.2%): 1:5000 anti-FLAG M2 and anti-Erk2, 1:1000 anti-GST and anti-RasGRF1 (sc-224, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 1:2000 anti-myc (9E10), 1:1000 anti-HA (BAbCO, Richmond, CA); 1:4000 anti-GFP (Roche Diagnostics); 1:5000 anti-α-tubulin (Sigma); 1:1000 anti-Δ2 tubulin (AbCys, Paris, France); 1:2000 anti-SCLIP; 1:2000 anti-phospho Erk1/2, 1:1000 anti-phospho p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling technology, Beverly, MA), 1:2000 anti-N-terminal region of RasGRF1 (PH) (3Brambilla R. Gnesutta N. Minichiello L. White G. Roylance A.J. Herron C.E. Ramsey M. Wolfer D.P. Cestari V. Rossi-Arnaud C. Grant S.G. Chapman P.F. Lipp H.P. Sturani E. Klein R. Nature. 1997; 390: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with the proper peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and chemiluminescent signals were detected using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Band intensities were quantitated by densitometry with the Scion Image program (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD), and signals specific for phosphorylated or GTP-bound forms were equalized to the total amount of the corresponding proteins. The increase in phosphorylation or GTP loading was normalized to the basal level of the control treatments and expressed as -fold increase. Immunofluorescence—Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with a PBS solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 60 mm saccharose for 15 min, permeabilized for 4 min with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies (anti-α-tubulin or anti-RasGRF1) diluted 1:500 in a solution of 1% BSA in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100. After several washes, cells were incubated with the proper Alexa Fluor-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies diluted in PBS-1% BSA (1:1000 Alexa Fluor 594, 1:500 Alexa 488, and 1:200 Alexa 350, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Where indicated coverslips were further incubated with 1 μg/ml phalloidin-TRITC (Sigma) for 30 min before being mounted with gel mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Microscopy analysis was carried out with an Olympus BX-60 fluorescence microscope or a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany), equipped with an argon and HeNe laser and a PLAPO 40×/1.25-0.75 oil immersion objective. The figures were assembled using Adobe Photoshop 5.5 or higher. Analysis of Neurite Outgrowth in PC12 Cells—Differentiation was evaluated by two parameters: the percentage of transfected cells bearing neurites and the length of the longest protrusion per cell. Cell edges were outlined by fluorescence of GFP, Alexa-Fluor-conjugated antibodies for uniformly distributed molecules or, when necessary, phalloidin staining. Neurites were defined as protrusions with lengths that were at least 2-fold longer than cell bodies. Transfected cells bearing neurites were counted, and data were plotted using Microsoft Excel. Three independent experiments with at least 400 cells per condition were evaluated. Transfected cells were randomly selected using a 40× objective, and the length of the longest projection per cell was quantified using the National Institutes of Health Image analysis program Image J by comparison with measurements from a graduated reference. At least 50 cells per treatment were scored in each experiment, and the experiments were performed in triplicate. Student's t test was applied for statistical analysis between two treatments.

https://openalex.org/W2060653869,"Maintenance of normal blood pressure is critical for preserving the integrity of the cardiovascular system. Angiotensin 1-converting enzyme (ACE) regulates normal blood pressure and fluid homeostasis through its action in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the renal tubuloglomerular feedback response. Although the two structurally related isozymic forms of ACE both generate the vasoactive octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) with equal efficiency, both are expressed in a nonoverlapping tissue-restricted fashion. To discriminate the precise physiological role of each ACE in its requisite tissue in vivo, we expressed one ACE isoform exclusively in a single cell type of an Ace null mouse. Previously, we demonstrated that vascular endothelial cell-specific expression of transgenic somatic ACE (sACE) could restore normal blood pressure of Ace-null mice. In this current study, we expressed germinal ACE (gACE) in the vascular endothelial cells of the Ace null mouse. These mice exhibited correct renal structure, renal function, and normal growth rates. Although the mice had elevated levels of gACE bound to vascular endothelial cells and high levels of gACE and Ang II in the circulating serum, blood pressure was restored only partially. This study demonstrated that gACE, even when expressed in the vasculature, could not functionally substitute for sACE."
