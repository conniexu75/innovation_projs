This simple picture may serve as the basis for models in diverse interfacial systems in polymer science, such as polymeric surfactants, stabilized suspensions of colloidal particles, and structures formed by block copolymers. The structure and dynamics of polymer brushes have been the subject of considerable theoretical and experimental activity in recent years. An account is given of recent advances in theoretical understanding of stretched polymers at interfaces, and the diverse experimental probes of systems modeled by brushes are briefly reviewed."
https://openalex.org/W2021158547,"Different polymers can be combined into a single material in many ways, which can lead to a wide range of phase behaviors that directly influence the associated physical properties and ultimate applications. Four factors control polymer-polymer phase behavior: choice of monomers, molecular architecture, composition, and molecular size. Current theories and experiments that deal with the equilibrium thermodynamics and non-equilibrium dynamics of polymer mixtures are described in terms of these experimentally accessible parameters. Two representative molecular architectures, binary linear homopolymer mixtures and diblock copolymers, exhibiting macrophase separation and microphase segregation, respectively, are examined in some detail. Although these model systems are fairly well understood, a myriad of mixing scenarios, with both existing and unrealized materials applications, remain unexplored at a fundamental level."
https://openalex.org/W2070159662,"The rate constant of the electron-transfer reaction between a gold electrode and an electroactive ferrocene group has been measured at a structurally well-defined metal-electrolyte interface at temperatures from 1 degrees to 47 degrees C and reaction free energies from -1.0 to +0.8 electron volts (eV). The ferrocene group was positioned a fixed distance from the gold surface by the self-assembly of a mixed thiol monolayer of (eta(5)C(5)H(5))Fe(eta(5)C(5)H(4))CO(2)(CH(2))(16)SH and CH(3)(CH(2))(15)SH. Rate constants from 1 per second (s(-1)) to 2 x 10(4) s(-1) in 1 molar HClO(4) are reasonably fit with a reorganization energy of 0.85 eV and a prefactor for electron tunneling of 7 x 10(4) s(-1) eV(-1). Such self-assembled monolayers can be used to systematically probe the dependence of electron-transfer rates on distance, medium, and spacer structure, and to provide an empirical basis for the construction of interfacial devices such as sensors and transducers that utilize macroscopically directional electron-transfer reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2005962452,"Living polymerization techniques can be used to achieve a high degree of control over polymer chain architecture. Examples of the type of polymers that can be synthesized include block copolymers, comb-shaped polymers, multiarmed polymers, ladder polymers, and cyclic polymers. This control of structure, in turn, results in polymers with widely diverse physical properties, even though they are made from readily available low-cost monomers."

A precise budgetary accounting of N(2)O sources has remained elusive, and there is an apparent lack of source identification. One source of N(2)O is as a by-product in the manufacture of nylon, specifically in the preparation of adipic acid. Characterization of the reaction N(2)O stoichiometry and its isotopic composition with a simulated industrial adipic acid synthesis indicates that because of high rates of global adipic acid production, this N(2)O may account for approximately 10 percent of the increase observed for atmospheric N(2)O."

https://openalex.org/W2103681325,"Neptune receives only 1/900th of the earth's solar energy, but has wind speeds of nearly 600 meters per second. How the near-supersonic winds can be maintained has been a puzzle. A plausible mechanism, based on principles of angular momentum and energy conservation in conjunction with deep convection, leads to a regime of uniform angular momentum at low latitudes. In this model, the rapid retrograde winds observed are a manifestation of deep convection, and the high efficiency of the planet's heat engine is intrinsic from the room allowed at low latitudes for reversible processes, the high temperatures at which heat is added to the atmosphere, and the low temperatures at which heat is extracted."

https://openalex.org/W2007631684,"To summarize, I have tried to suggest that knowledge, valuable as it is, is not considered the most important qualification for industrial research. Character, aptitude and attitudes are more important. Should they not be rated so in the college educational program? Aptitude, though it can not be trained, can and should be screened by the college more than is done to-day, to avoid the lifelong disappointments of misplacement. Character and attitudes actually are molded by college influences, for better or worse, and therefore are products of college life and are the responsibilities of the college, just as much as scholarship. The fact that the molding influence is the student body, more than the faculty, makes the problem different from that of scholarship, and a different method must be found for dealing with it. Could a method be found if sought with sufficient effort? Today we give it low priority, devoting only a small fraction of college effort to it. Why?"
