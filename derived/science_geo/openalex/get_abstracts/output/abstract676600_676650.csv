https://openalex.org/W3171375949,"In this study we profiled vaccine-induced polyclonal antibodies as well as plasmablast-derived mAbs from individuals who received SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccine. Polyclonal antibody responses in vaccinees were robust and comparable to or exceeded those seen after natural infection. However, the ratio of binding to neutralizing antibodies after vaccination was greater than that after natural infection and, at the monoclonal level, we found that the majority of vaccine-induced antibodies did not have neutralizing activity. We also found a co-dominance of mAbs targeting the NTD and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike and an original antigenic-sin like backboost to spikes of seasonal human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1. Neutralizing activity of NTD mAbs but not RBD mAbs against a clinical viral isolate carrying E484K as well as extensive changes in the NTD was abolished, suggesting that a proportion of vaccine-induced RBD binding antibodies may provide substantial protection against viral variants carrying single E484K RBD mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3176205589,"Social interactions among animals mediate essential behaviours, including mating, nurturing, and defence1,2. The gut microbiota contribute to social activity in mice3,4, but the gut-brain connections that regulate this complex behaviour and its underlying neural basis are unclear5,6. Here we show that the microbiome modulates neuronal activity in specific brain regions of male mice to regulate canonical stress responses and social behaviours. Social deviation in germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice is associated with elevated levels of the stress hormone corticosterone, which is primarily produced by activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Adrenalectomy, antagonism of glucocorticoid receptors, or pharmacological inhibition of corticosterone synthesis effectively corrects social deficits following microbiome depletion. Genetic ablation of glucocorticoid receptors in specific brain regions or chemogenetic inactivation of neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus that produce corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) reverse social impairments in antibiotic-treated mice. Conversely, specific activation of CRH-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus induces social deficits in mice with a normal microbiome. Via microbiome profiling and in vivo selection, we identify a bacterial species, Enterococcus faecalis, that promotes social activity and reduces corticosterone levels in mice following social stress. These studies suggest that specific gut bacteria can restrain the activation of the HPA axis, and show that the microbiome can affect social behaviours through discrete neuronal circuits that mediate stress responses in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3176596141,"After the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in spring 2020, Europe experienced a resurgence of the virus starting in late summer 2020 that was deadlier and more difficult to contain1. Relaxed intervention measures and summer travel have been implicated as drivers of the second wave2. Here we build a phylogeographical model to evaluate how newly introduced lineages, as opposed to the rekindling of persistent lineages, contributed to the resurgence of COVID-19 in Europe. We inform this model using genomic, mobility and epidemiological data from 10 European countries and estimate that in many countries more than half of the lineages circulating in late summer resulted from new introductions since 15 June 2020. The success in onward transmission of newly introduced lineages was negatively associated with the local incidence of COVID-19 during this period. The pervasive spread of variants in summer 2020 highlights the threat of viral dissemination when restrictions are lifted, and this needs to be carefully considered in strategies to control the current spread of variants that are more transmissible and/or evade immunity. Our findings indicate that more effective and coordinated measures are required to contain the spread through cross-border travel even as vaccination is reducing disease burden. In many European countries, more than half of the SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in late summer 2020 resulted from new introductions, highlighting the threat of viral dissemination when restrictions are lifted."

https://openalex.org/W4205864557,"The natural world provides many examples of multiphase transport and reaction processes that have been optimized by evolution. These phenomena take place at multiple length and time scales and typically include gas-liquid-solid interfaces and capillary phenomena in porous media1,2. Many biological and living systems have evolved to optimize fluidic transport. However, living things are exceptionally complex and very difficult to replicate3-5, and human-made microfluidic devices (which are typically planar and enclosed) are highly limited for multiphase process engineering6-8. Here we introduce the concept of cellular fluidics: a platform of unit-cell-based, three-dimensional structures-enabled by emerging 3D printing methods9,10-for the deterministic control of multiphase flow, transport and reaction processes. We show that flow in these structures can be 'programmed' through architected design of cell type, size and relative density. We demonstrate gas-liquid transport processes such as transpiration and absorption, using evaporative cooling and CO2 capture as examples. We design and demonstrate preferential liquid and gas transport pathways in three-dimensional cellular fluidic devices with capillary-driven and actively pumped liquid flow, and present examples of selective metallization of pre-programmed patterns. Our results show that the design and fabrication of architected cellular materials, coupled with analytical and numerical predictions of steady-state and dynamic behaviour of multiphase interfaces, provide deterministic control of fluidic transport in three dimensions. Cellular fluidics may transform the design space for spatial and temporal control of multiphase transport and reaction processes."
https://openalex.org/W3166530036,"When the Coulomb repulsion between electrons dominates over their kinetic energy, electrons in two-dimensional systems are predicted to spontaneously break continuous-translation symmetry and form a quantum crystal1. Efforts to observe2-12 this elusive state of matter, termed a Wigner crystal, in two-dimensional extended systems have primarily focused on conductivity measurements on electrons confined to a single Landau level at high magnetic fields. Here we use optical spectroscopy to demonstrate that electrons in a monolayer semiconductor with density lower than 3 × 1011 per centimetre squared form a Wigner crystal. The combination of a high electron effective mass and reduced dielectric screening enables us to observe electronic charge order even in the absence of a moiré potential or an external magnetic field. The interactions between a resonantly injected exciton and electrons arranged in a periodic lattice modify the exciton bandstructure so that an umklapp resonance arises in the optical reflection spectrum, heralding the presence of charge order13. Our findings demonstrate that charge-tunable transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers14 enable the investigation of previously uncharted territory for many-body physics where interaction energy dominates over kinetic energy."
https://openalex.org/W3174386259,"One of the first theoretically predicted manifestations of strong interactions in many-electron systems was the Wigner crystal1-3, in which electrons crystallize into a regular lattice. The crystal can melt via either thermal or quantum fluctuations4. Quantum melting of the Wigner crystal is predicted to produce exotic intermediate phases5,6 and quantum magnetism7,8 because of the intricate interplay of Coulomb interactions and kinetic energy. However, studying two-dimensional Wigner crystals in the quantum regime has often required a strong magnetic field9-11 or a moiré superlattice potential12-15, thus limiting access to the full phase diagram of the interacting electron liquid. Here we report the observation of bilayer Wigner crystals without magnetic fields or moiré potentials in an atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructure, which consists of two MoSe2 monolayers separated by hexagonal boron nitride. We observe optical signatures of robust correlated insulating states at symmetric (1:1) and asymmetric (3:1, 4:1 and 7:1) electron doping of the two MoSe2 layers at cryogenic temperatures. We attribute these features to bilayer Wigner crystals composed of two interlocked commensurate triangular electron lattices, stabilized by inter-layer interaction16. The Wigner crystal phases are remarkably stable, and undergo quantum and thermal melting transitions at electron densities of up to 6 × 1012 per square centimetre and at temperatures of up to about 40 kelvin. Our results demonstrate that an atomically thin heterostructure is a highly tunable platform for realizing many-body electronic states and probing their liquid-solid and magnetic quantum phase transitions4-8,17."
https://openalex.org/W3176996497,"Family C G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) operate as obligate dimers with extracellular domains that recognize small ligands, leading to G-protein activation on the transmembrane (TM) domains of these receptors by an unknown mechanism1. Here we show structures of homodimers of the family C metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGlu2) in distinct functional states and in complex with heterotrimeric Gi. Upon activation of the extracellular domain, the two transmembrane domains undergo extensive rearrangement in relative orientation to establish an asymmetric TM6–TM6 interface that promotes conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain of one protomer. Nucleotide-bound Gi can be observed pre-coupled to inactive mGlu2, but its transition to the nucleotide-free form seems to depend on establishing the active-state TM6–TM6 interface. In contrast to family A and B GPCRs, G-protein coupling does not involve the cytoplasmic opening of TM6 but is facilitated through the coordination of intracellular loops 2 and 3, as well as a critical contribution from the C terminus of the receptor. The findings highlight the synergy of global and local conformational transitions to facilitate a new mode of G-protein activation. Cryo-electron microscopy structures show that metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 forms a dimer to which only one G protein is coupled, revealing the basis for asymmetric signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W3175859364,"Social and cultural forces shape almost every aspect of infectious disease transmission in human populations, as well as our ability to measure, understand, and respond to epidemics. For directly transmitted infections, pathogen transmission relies on human-to-human contact, with kinship, household, and societal structures shaping contact patterns that in turn determine epidemic dynamics. Social, economic, and cultural forces also shape patterns of exposure, health-seeking behaviour, infection outcomes, the likelihood of diagnosis and reporting of cases, and the uptake of interventions. Although these social aspects of epidemiology are hard to quantify and have limited the generalizability of modelling frameworks in a policy context, new sources of data on relevant aspects of human behaviour are increasingly available. Researchers have begun to embrace data from mobile devices and other technologies as useful proxies for behavioural drivers of disease transmission, but there is much work to be done to measure and validate these approaches, particularly for policy-making. Here we discuss how integrating local knowledge in the design of model frameworks and the interpretation of new data streams offers the possibility of policy-relevant models for public health decision-making as well as the development of robust, generalizable theories about human behaviour in relation to infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3174081869,"The global decline in malaria has stalled1, emphasizing the need for vaccines that induce durable sterilizing immunity. Here we optimized regimens for chemoprophylaxis vaccination (CVac), for which aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, infectious Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) were inoculated under prophylactic cover with pyrimethamine (PYR) (Sanaria PfSPZ-CVac(PYR)) or chloroquine (CQ) (PfSPZ-CVac(CQ))-which kill liver-stage and blood-stage parasites, respectively-and we assessed vaccine efficacy against homologous (that is, the same strain as the vaccine) and heterologous (a different strain) controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) three months after immunization ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ , NCT02511054 and NCT03083847). We report that a fourfold increase in the dose of PfSPZ-CVac(PYR) from 5.12 × 104 to 2 × 105 PfSPZs transformed a minimal vaccine efficacy (low dose, two out of nine (22.2%) participants protected against homologous CHMI), to a high-level vaccine efficacy with seven out of eight (87.5%) individuals protected against homologous and seven out of nine (77.8%) protected against heterologous CHMI. Increased protection was associated with Vδ2 γδ T cell and antibody responses. At the higher dose, PfSPZ-CVac(CQ) protected six out of six (100%) participants against heterologous CHMI three months after immunization. All homologous (four out of four) and heterologous (eight out of eight) infectivity control participants showed parasitaemia. PfSPZ-CVac(CQ) and PfSPZ-CVac(PYR) induced a durable, sterile vaccine efficacy against a heterologous South American strain of P. falciparum, which has a genome and predicted CD8 T cell immunome that differs more strongly from the African vaccine strain than other analysed African P. falciparum strains."

https://openalex.org/W3174442964,"White dwarfs represent the last stage of evolution of stars with mass less than about eight times that of the Sun and, like other stars, are often found in binaries. If the orbital period of the binary is short enough, energy losses from gravitational-wave radiation can shrink the orbit until the two white dwarfs come into contact and merge. Depending on the component masses, the merger can lead to a supernova of type Ia or result in a massive white dwarf. In the latter case, the white dwarf remnant is expected to be highly magnetised because of the strong magnetic dynamo that should arise during the merger, and be rapidly spinning from the conservation of the orbital angular momentum. Here we report observations of a white dwarf, ZTF J190132.9+145808.7, that exhibits these properties, but to an extreme: a rotation period of 6.94 minutes, a magnetic field ranging between 600 megagauss and 900 megagauss over its surface, and a stellar radius of about 2,100 km, slightly larger than the radius of the Moon. Such a small radius implies that the star's mass is close to the maximum white-dwarf mass, or Chandrasekhar mass. ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 is likely to be cooling through the Urca processes (neutrino emission from electron capture on sodium) because of the high densities reached in its core."
https://openalex.org/W3176155318,"The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a cell-surface sensor for Ca2+, is the master regulator of calcium homeostasis in humans and is the target of calcimimetic drugs for the treatment of parathyroid disorders1. CaSR is a family C G-protein-coupled receptor2 that functions as an obligate homodimer, with each protomer composed of a Ca2+-binding extracellular domain and a seven-transmembrane-helix domain (7TM) that activates heterotrimeric G proteins. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of near-full-length human CaSR in inactive or active states bound to Ca2+ and various calcilytic or calcimimetic drug molecules. We show that, upon activation, the CaSR homodimer adopts an asymmetric 7TM configuration that primes one protomer for G-protein coupling. This asymmetry is stabilized by 7TM-targeting calcimimetic drugs adopting distinctly different poses in the two protomers, whereas the binding of a calcilytic drug locks CaSR 7TMs in an inactive symmetric configuration. These results provide a detailed structural framework for CaSR activation and the rational design of therapeutics targeting this receptor. Cryo-EM structures of human calcium-sensing receptor reveal intrinsic asymmetry in the receptor homodimer upon activation that is stabilized by calcimimetic drugs adopting distinct poses in the two protomers, priming one protomer for G-protein coupling."
https://openalex.org/W3176717740,"Atomic clocks, which lock the frequency of an oscillator to the extremely stable quantized energy levels of atoms, are essential for navigation applications such as deep space exploration1 and global navigation satellite systems2, and are useful tools with which to address questions in fundamental physics3–6. Such satellite systems use precise measurement of signal propagation times determined by atomic clocks, together with propagation speed, to calculate position. Although space atomic clocks with low instability are an enabling technology for global navigation, they have not yet been applied to deep space navigation and have seen only limited application to space-based fundamental physics, owing to performance constraints imposed by the rigours of space operation7. Methods of electromagnetically trapping and cooling ions have revolutionized atomic clock performance8–13. Terrestrial trapped-ion clocks operating in the optical domain have achieved orders-of-magnitude improvements in performance over their predecessors and have become a key component in national metrology laboratory research programmes13, but transporting this new technology into space has remained challenging. Here we show the results from a trapped-ion atomic clock operating in space. On the ground, NASA’s Deep Space Atomic Clock demonstrated a short-term fractional frequency stability of 1.5 × 10−13/τ1/2 (where τ is the averaging time)14. Launched in 2019, the clock has operated for more than 12 months in space and demonstrated there a long-term stability of 3 × 10−15 at 23 days (no drift removal), and an estimated drift of 3.0(0.7) × 10−16 per day. Each of these exceeds current space clock performance by up to an order of magnitude15–17. The Deep Space Atomic Clock is particularly amenable to the space environment because of its low sensitivity to variations in radiation, temperature and magnetic fields. This level of space clock performance will enable one-way navigation in which signal delay times are measured in situ, making near-real-time navigation of deep space probes possible18. Operating in space, NASA’s Deep Space Atomic Clock, a trapped-ion clock, is shown to have long-term stability and drift that are an order of magnitude better than current space clocks."
https://openalex.org/W3174618770,"The Laacher See eruption (LSE) in Germany ranks among Europe’s largest volcanic events of the Upper Pleistocene1,2. Although tephra deposits of the LSE represent an important isochron for the synchronization of proxy archives at the Late Glacial to Early Holocene transition3, uncertainty in the age of the eruption has prevailed4. Here we present dendrochronological and radiocarbon measurements of subfossil trees that were buried by pyroclastic deposits that firmly date the LSE to 13,006 ± 9 calibrated years before present (bp; taken as ad 1950), which is more than a century earlier than previously accepted. The revised age of the LSE necessarily shifts the chronology of European varved lakes5,6 relative to the Greenland ice core record, thereby dating the onset of the Younger Dryas to 12,807 ± 12 calibrated years bp, which is around 130 years earlier than thought. Our results synchronize the onset of the Younger Dryas across the North Atlantic–European sector, preclude a direct link between the LSE and Greenland Stadial-1 cooling7, and suggest a large-scale common mechanism of a weakened Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation under warming conditions8–10. A revised date for the Laacher See eruption using measurements of subfossil trees shifts the chronology of European varved lakes relative to the Greenland ice core record, synchronizing the onset of the Younger Dryas across the North Atlantic–European sector."
https://openalex.org/W3175609803,"Caregivers play an indispensable role in society. In 2017, 41 million family caregivers in the United States provided approximately 34 billion hours of care to their aging parents, spouses, partners and friends. The estimated economic value of their unpaid contributions amounted to $470 billion. Despite their invaluable contributions, caregivers often operate in a reality of inadequate social support. Little is known about the factors linked to the societal perceptions of caregivers, and our study seeks to contribute by filling this gap. Importantly, whether society honors or stigmatizes caregivers is critical as it could impact caregiving decisions and either exacerbate or ameliorate caregiver burden. We leveraged an online media database of 10 billion words collated from over 28 million articles, across 20 countries, to analyze societal perceptions of caregivers. Of the 20 countries, 18 evidenced neutral to positive perceptions of caregivers. Bangladesh and Ghana had the most positive perceptions, while Sri Lanka and Tanzania had the most negative perceptions. Aging demographics and culture (individualism, masculinity and uncertainty avoidance) were significantly associated with perceptions of caregivers. Findings suggest that positive perceptions of caregivers can be better cultivated when caring is lauded as a virtuous act that aids in reducing the care deficit. This study is among the first to analyze the societal perceptions of caregivers globally, and lays the groundwork to design culturally sensitive interventions that increase society's appreciation for caregivers."
https://openalex.org/W3176348367,"The ability to ‘sense’ the social environment and thereby to understand the thoughts and actions of others allows humans to fit into their social worlds, communicate and cooperate, and learn from others’ experiences. Here we argue that, through the lens of computational social science, this ability can be used to advance research into human sociality. When strategically selected to represent a specific population of interest, human social sensors can help to describe and predict societal trends. In addition, their reports of how they experience their social worlds can help to build models of social dynamics that are constrained by the empirical reality of human social systems. The ability of people to understand the thoughts and actions of others—known as social sensing—can be combined with computational social science to advance research into human sociality."
https://openalex.org/W3137582618,"Neuronal activity generates DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at specific loci in vitro and this facilitates the rapid transcriptional induction of early response genes (ERGs). Physiological neuronal activity, including exposure of mice to learning behaviors, also cause the formation of DSBs, yet the distribution of these breaks and their relation to brain function remains unclear. Here, following contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in mice, we profiled the locations of DSBs genome-wide in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus using γH2AX ChIP-Seq. Remarkably, we found that DSB formation is widespread in the brain compared to cultured primary neurons and they are predominately involved in synaptic processes. We observed increased DNA breaks at genes induced by CFC in neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei. Activity-regulated and proteostasis-related transcription factors appear to govern some of these gene expression changes across cell types. Finally, we find that glia but not neurons have a robust transcriptional response to glucocorticoids, and many of these genes are sites of DSBs. Our results indicate that learning behaviors cause widespread DSB formation in the brain that are associated with experience-driven transcriptional changes across both neuronal and glial cells."

The developed coupled PDEs (partial differential equations) are numerically solved using the innovative computational technique of control volume finite element method (CVFEM). The impact of increasing strength of medium porousness and Lorentz forces on the hybrid nanofluid flow are presented through contour plots. The variation of the average Nusselt number (Nu ave ) with the growing medium porosity, buoyancy forces, radiation parameter, and the magnetic field strength is presented through 3-D plots. It is concluded that the enhancing medium porosity, buoyancy forces and radiation parameter augmented the free convective thermal energy flow. The rising magnetic field rises the temperature of the inner wall more drastically at a smaller Darcy number. An analytical expression for Nusselt number (Nu ave ) is obtained which shows its functional dependence on the pertinent physical parameters. The augmenting Lorentz forces due to the higher estimations of Hartmann retard the hybrid nanoliquid flow and hence enhance the conduction."

https://openalex.org/W3175018851,"The size of the transcriptional program of long non-coding RNAs in the mammalian genome has engendered discussions about their biological roles1, particularly the promoter antisense (PAS) transcripts2,3. Here we report the development of an assay-referred to as chromatin isolation by RNA-Cas13a complex-to quantitatively detect the distribution of RNA in the genome. The assay revealed that PAS RNAs serve as a key gatekeeper of a broad transcriptional pause release program, based on decommissioning the 7SK small nuclear RNA-dependent inhibitory P-TEFb complex. Induction of PAS RNAs by liganded ERα led to a significant loss of H3K9me3 and the release of basally recruited HP1α and KAP1 on activated target gene promoters. This release was due to PAS RNA-dependent recruitment of H3K9me3 demethylases, which required interactions with a compact stem-loop structure in the PAS RNAs, an apparent feature of similarly regulated PAS RNAs. Activation of the ERα-bound MegaTrans enhancer, which is essential for robust pause release, required the recruitment of phosphorylated KAP1, with its transfer to the cognate promoters permitting 17β-oestradiol-induced pause release and activation of the target gene. This study reveals a mechanism, based on RNA structure, that mediates the function of PAS RNAs in gene regulation."

https://openalex.org/W3175934715,"Recently, there has been much attention in the use of machine learning methods, particularly deep learning for stock price prediction. A major limitation of conventional deep learning is uncertainty quantification in predictions which affect investor confidence. Bayesian neural networks feature Bayesian inference for providing inference (training) of model parameters that provides a rigorous methodology for uncertainty quantification in predictions. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods have been prominent in implementing inference of Bayesian neural networks; however certain limitations existed due to a large number of parameters and the need for better computational resources. Recently, there has been much progress in the area of Bayesian neural networks given the use of Langevin gradients with parallel tempering MCMC that can be implemented in a parallel computing environment. The COVID-19 pandemic had a drastic impact in the world economy and stock markets given different levels of lockdowns due to rise and fall of daily infections. It is important to investigate the performance of related forecasting models during the COVID-19 pandemic given the volatility in stock markets. In this paper, we use novel Bayesian neural networks for multi-step-ahead stock price forecasting before and during COVID-19. We also investigate if the pre-COVID-19 datasets are useful of modelling stock price forecasting during COVID-19. Our results indicate due to high volatility in the stock-price during COVID-19, it is more challenging to provide forecasting. However, we found that Bayesian neural networks could provide reasonable predictions with uncertainty quantification despite high market volatility during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3176601751,"Glioma is the most common and lethal form of brain cancer. It is highly malignant and is often characterized by chemoresistance and radioresistance, which are thought to mainly result from hypoxic microenvironments. Various tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in gliomas; however, it is still largely unknown how miRNAs are modified by hypoxia and subsequently affect glioma. In this study, we examined the expression of miR-210-3p, a well-characterized miRNA that responds to hypoxia in glioma cell lines.The expressions of miR-9 and miR-210-3p were analysed by using qPCR. Cell viability was measured by performing CCK-8 after eechinomycin treatment or introduction of miR-210 for 24 or 48 h. The correlation of HIF-1α expression with TGF-β were analysed using the REMBRANDT database. The biomarkers of EMT, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin, were detected by western blot. Apoptotic cell death was measured by performing Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining followed by flow cytometry.We found that miR-210-3p was induced by a mechanism dependent on the hypoxia-induced transcriptional activity of HIF-1α. Then we established a positive association between the HIF-1α and TGF-β expression levels, and miR-210-3p upregulation induced TGF-β expression, indicating that hypoxia-induced HIF-1α activity upregulated TGF-β via miR-210-3p upregulation. Hypoxia-induced miR-210-3p activity was found to promote EMT by upregulating TGF-β, which subsequently enhanced the invasive ability in U87-MG cells. We further confirmed that miR-210-3p induced chemoresistance to TMZ in U87-MG cells via TGF-β upregulation under hypoxic conditions.These results help to reveal the potential regulatory mechanisms of hypoxia-induced miR-210-3p expression that affect malignant behaviors and chemoresistance via TGF-β upregulation in glioma cells."
https://openalex.org/W3173579119,"Electrical activity in the brain and heart depends on rhythmic generation of action potentials by pacemaker ion channels (HCN) whose activity is regulated by cAMP binding1. Previous work has uncovered evidence for both positive and negative cooperativity in cAMP binding2,3, but such bulk measurements suffer from limited parameter resolution. Efforts to eliminate this ambiguity using single-molecule techniques have been hampered by the inability to directly monitor binding of individual ligand molecules to membrane receptors at physiological concentrations. Here we overcome these challenges using nanophotonic zero-mode waveguides4 to directly resolve binding dynamics of individual ligands to multimeric HCN1 and HCN2 ion channels. We show that cAMP binds independently to all four subunits when the pore is closed, despite a subsequent conformational isomerization to a flip state at each site. The different dynamics in binding and isomerization are likely to underlie physiologically distinct responses of each isoform to cAMP5 and provide direct validation of the ligand-induced flip-state model6-9. This approach for observing stepwise binding in multimeric proteins at physiologically relevant concentrations can directly probe binding allostery at single-molecule resolution in other intact membrane proteins and receptors."

This study has sampled the A-share listed companies in China, from 2009 to 2018, and adopted the difference-in-difference (DID) method to investigate the effect of the carbon emission trading on corporate financial performance from the microlevel. Evidence showed that the implementation of carbon emission trading effectively improved the total asset-liability ratio of enterprises, though it reduced the value of the current capital market. Moreover, in the regions under strict legal environment, the enhancement effect of the total asset-liability ratio was more obvious, whereas in the regions under loose legal environment, the reduction effect of the value of the capital market was more obvious. Further analysis showed that the implementation of carbon emission trading could not promote Chinese enterprises to increase R&D investment. Hence the implementation of carbon emission trading has improved the level of non-business income of enterprises incorporated into the trading system, but its impact on the investment income of enterprises was not significant."

In round 1, exercise and dosage variables were obtained from expert opinion and clinical trial data, then analysed thematically (two independent researchers) to develop themes and statements. In rounds 2 and 3, participants rated their agreement with statements (1-5 Likert scale). Statement consensus was evaluated using progressively increased a priori criteria using descriptive statistics.Thirty-seven experts participated (10 countries). Twenty-nine responded to round 1 (79%), 26 round 2 (70%) and 24 round 3 (65%). Round 1 generated 79 statements outlining the interacting components of exercise prescription. Following rounds 2 and 3, consensus was achieved for 46 important components of exercise and dosage prescription across 5 themes (clinical reasoning, dosage variables, exercise variables, evaluation criteria and progression) and 2 subthemes (progression criteria and progression variables). Excellent agreement and qualitative data supports exercise prescription complexity and the need for individualised, acceptable, and feasible exercise. Only 37% of important exercise components were generated from clinical trial data. Agreement was highest (88%-96%) for 3 dosage variables: intensity of effort, frequency, and repetitions.Multiple exercise and dosage variables are important, resulting in complex and individualised exercise prescription not found in clinical trials. Future research should use these important variables to prescribe an evidence-informed approach to exercise."
https://openalex.org/W3174224459,"The sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) expresses at the basolateral plasma membrane of the thyroid follicular cell and mediates iodide accumulation required for normal thyroid hormonogenesis. Loss-of-function NIS variants cause congenital hypothyroidism due to impaired iodide accumulation in thyroid follicular cells underscoring the significance of NIS for thyroid physiology. Here we report novel findings derived from the thorough characterization of the nonsense NIS mutant p.R636* NIS-leading to a truncated protein missing the last eight amino acids-identified in twins with congenital hypothyroidism. R636* NIS is severely mislocalized into intracellular vesicular compartments due to the lack of a conserved carboxy-terminal type 1 PDZ-binding motif. As a result, R636* NIS is barely targeted to the plasma membrane and therefore iodide transport is reduced. Deletion of the PDZ-binding motif causes NIS accumulation into late endosomes and lysosomes. Using PDZ domain arrays, we revealed that the PDZ-domain containing protein SCRIB binds to the carboxy-terminus of NIS by a PDZ-PDZ interaction. Furthermore, in CRISPR/Cas9-based SCRIB deficient cells, NIS expression at the basolateral plasma membrane is compromised, leading to NIS localization into intracellular vesicular compartments. We conclude that the PDZ-binding motif is a plasma membrane retention signal that participates in the polarized expression of NIS by selectively interacting with the PDZ-domain containing protein SCRIB, thus retaining the transporter at the basolateral plasma membrane. Our data provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate NIS expression at the plasma membrane, a topic of great interest in the thyroid cancer field considering the relevance of NIS-mediated radioactive iodide therapy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W3175825601,"Among livestock species, poultry and small ruminants are of particular importance to rural women in low- and middle-income countries, as means to generate income, provide nutritious food for the family, accumulate wealth, and confer social status. Newcastle disease (ND) and Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) are widespread livestock diseases of poultry and small ruminants, respectively. While both diseases are vaccine preventable, numerous constraints limit the availability of and access to livestock vaccines, especially among the most vulnerable populations in developing countries. The literature on equity and effectiveness of livestock vaccine distribution systems has emphasized many of these constraints, however a gendered analysis and deeper understanding of the vaccine system remain insufficient. This paper applies a gendered and intersectional transformational approach, or GITA, to highlight how gender and other social factors affect the provision and utilization of vaccines for ND and PPR diseases in the region of Kaffrine, Senegal. We first articulate and describe the vaccine value chains (VVCs) for these diseases in Kaffrine, and then analyze the gendered and intersectional dynamics at different nodes of the VVCs, including actors at the national level, through the regional and district levels, down to providers of animal health at community level and the livestock keepers themselves. Our findings indicate that actors' various experiences are shaped and defined mainly by rigid gender norms, location and remoteness, and to a lesser degree by other social stratifications of age, ethnicity, and livelihood. Given the significant role that gender norms play in the livestock vaccine value chains, differences according to the livestock species, regulation of vaccine administration, and vaccine distribution systems emerge as highly relevant for understanding barriers that women specifically face within the livestock vaccination system."
https://openalex.org/W3175283263,"Wolbachia are endosymbionts of numerous arthropod and some nematode species, are important for their development and if present can cause distinct phenotypes of their hosts. Prophage DNA has been frequently detected in Wolbachia , but particles of Wolbachia bacteriophages (phage WO) have been only occasionally isolated. Here, we report the characterization and isolation of a phage WO of the southern ground cricket, Allonemobius socius , and provided the first whole-genome sequence of phage WO from this arthropod family outside of Asia. We screened A . socius abdomen DNA extracts from a cricket population in eastern Missouri by quantitative PCR for Wolbachia surface protein and phage WO capsid protein and found a prevalence of 55% and 50%, respectively, with many crickets positive for both. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against Wolbachia surface protein showed many Wolbachia clusters in the reproductive system of female crickets. Whole-genome sequencing using Oxford Nanopore MinION and Illumina technology allowed for the assembly of a high-quality, 55 kb phage genome containing 63 open reading frames (ORF) encoding for phage WO structural proteins and host lysis and transcriptional manipulation. Taxonomically important regions of the assembled phage genome were validated by Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons. Analysis of the nucleotides sequences of the ORFs encoding the large terminase subunit (ORF2) and minor capsid (ORF7) frequently used for phage WO phylogenetics showed highest homology to phage WOAu of Drosophila simulans (94.46% identity) and WOCin2USA1 of the cherry fruit fly, Rhagoletis cingulata (99.33% identity), respectively. Transmission electron microscopy examination of cricket ovaries showed a high density of phage particles within Wolbachia cells. Isolation of phage WO revealed particles characterized by 40–62 nm diameter heads and up to 190 nm long tails. This study provides the first detailed description and genomic characterization of phage WO from North America that is easily accessible in a widely distributed cricket species."
https://openalex.org/W3173942379,"Chromosomal translocations constitute driver mutations in solid tumors and leukemias. The mechanisms of how related or even identical gene fusions drive the pathogenesis of various tumor types remain elusive. One remarkable example is the presence of EWSR1 fusions with CREB1 and ATF1, members of the CREB family of transcription factors, in a variety of sarcomas, carcinomas and mesotheliomas. To address this, we have developed in vitro models of oncogenic fusions, in particular, EWSR1-CREB1 and EWSR1-ATF1, in human embryonic stem (hES) cells, which are capable of multipotent differentiation, using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and HDR together with conditional fusion gene expression that allows investigation into the early steps of cellular transformation. We show that expression of EWSR1-CREB1/ATF1 fusion in hES cells recapitulates the core gene signatures, respectively, of angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) and gastrointestinal clear cell sarcoma (GI-CCS), although both fusions lead to cell lethality. Conversely, expression of the fusions in hES cells differentiated to mesenchymal progenitors is compatible with prolonged viability while maintaining the core gene signatures. Moreover, in the context of a mesenchymal lineage, the proliferation of cells expressing the EWSR1-CREB1 fusion is further extended by deletion of the tumor suppressor TP53. We expect the generation of isogenic lines carrying oncogenic fusions in various cell lineages to expand our general understanding of how those single genetic events drive tumorigenesis while providing valuable resources for drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W3176078883,"ADP-ribosylation is a key post-translational modification that regulates a wide variety of cellular stress responses. The ADP-ribosylation cycle is maintained by writers and erasers. For example, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation cycles consist of two predominant enzymes, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). However, historically, mechanisms of erasers of ADP-ribosylations have been understudied, primarily due to the lack of quantitative tools to selectively monitor specific activities of different ADP-ribosylation reversal enzymes. Here, we developed a new NUDT5-coupled AMP-Glo (NCAG) assay to specifically monitor the protein-free ADP-ribose released by ADP-ribosylation reversal enzymes. We found that NUDT5 selectively cleaves protein-free ADP-ribose, but not protein-bound poly- and mono-ADP-ribosylations, protein-free poly(ADP-ribose) chains, or NAD + . As a proof-of-concept , we successfully measured the kinetic parameters for the exo-glycohydrolase activity of PARG, which releases monomeric ADP-ribose, and monitored activities of site-specific mono-ADP-ribosyl-acceptor hydrolases, such as ARH3 and TARG1. This NCAG assay can be used as a general platform to study the mechanisms of diverse ADP-ribosylation reversal enzymes that release protein-free ADP-ribose as a product. Furthermore, this assay provides a useful tool to identify small-molecule probes targeting ADP-ribosylation metabolism and to quantify ADP-ribose concentrations in cells."
https://openalex.org/W3177161204,"The effects of cement dosage, compaction coefficient, molding method (vertical vibration method and static pressure method), and dry-wet and freeze-thaw cycles on the mechanical strength of cement-improved loess (CIL) were studied to reveal its strength degradation law under dry-wet and freeze-thaw cycles. Results show that when using the vertical vibration molding method, the strength degradation effect of CIL can be improved by increasing the cement dosage and compaction coefficient; however, it is not obvious. Under the action of dry-wet cycle, damages, such as voids and cracks of CIL, develop continuously. Further, the strength deteriorates continuously and does not decrease after more than 15 dry-wet cycles. Therefore, the dry-wet cycle degradation system is selected by considering the most unfavorable conditions. In the process of freeze-thaw alternation, the pores and fissures of CIL develop and evolve continuously and the strength deteriorates continuously under the joint influence of water and low temperature. The strength tends to become stable after more than 12 freeze-thaw cycles. According to the safety principle, the deterioration coefficient of the freeze-thaw cycles is 0.3."

In order to assess potential disparities in our client population, we compared demographics, service needs, service utilization, and HIV care continuum outcomes between transgender women, cisgender women, and cisgender men receiving New York City (NYC) Ryan White Part A (RWPA) services.The analysis included HIV-positive clients with an intake assessment between January 2016 and December 2017 in an NYC RWPA services program. We examined four service need areas: food and nutrition, harm reduction, mental health, and housing. Among clients with the documented need, we ascertained whether they received RWPA services targeting that need. To compare HIV outcomes between groups, we applied five metrics: engagement in care, consistent engagement in care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, point-in-time viral suppression, and durable viral suppression.All four service needs were more prevalent among transgender women (N = 455) than among cisgender clients. Except in the area of food and nutrition services, timely (12-month) receipt of RWPA services to meet a specific assessed need was not significantly more or less common in any one of the three client groups examined. Compared to cisgender women and cisgender men, a lower proportion of transgender women were durably virally suppressed (39% versus 52% or 50%, respectively, p-value < 0.001).Compared with cisgender women and cisgender men, transgender women more often presented with basic (food/housing) and behavioral-health service needs. In all three groups (with no consistent between-group differences), assessed needs were not typically met with the directly corresponding RWPA service category. Targeting those needs with RWPA outreach and services may support the National HIV/AIDS Strategy 2020 goal of reducing health disparities, and specifically the objective of increasing (to ≥90%) the percentage of transgender women in HIV medical care who are virally suppressed."
https://openalex.org/W3176243336,"Early in the pandemic, slowing the spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions. All U.S. states adopted social-distancing restrictions in March and April of 2020, though policies varied both in timing and scope. Compared to states with Democratic governors, those with Republican governors often adopted measures for shorter durations and with greater resistance from their residents. In Kentucky, an extremely close gubernatorial election immediately prior to the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 replaced a Republican incumbent with a Democrat, despite Republicans easily winning all other statewide races. This chance election result offers a unique opportunity to examine the impact of early social distancing policies in a relatively conservative, rural, white-working-class state. Our study begins by estimating an event-study model to link adoption of several common social distancing measures–public school closures, bans on large gatherings, closures of entertainment-related businesses such as restaurants, and shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs)–to the growth rate of cases across counties in the Midwest and South in the early stages of the pandemic. These policies combined to slow the daily growth rate of COVID-19 cases by 9 percentage points after 16 days, with SIPOs and entertainment establishment closures accounting for the entire effect. In order to obtain results with more direct applicability to Kentucky, we then estimate a model that interacts the policy variables with a “white working class” index characterized by political conservatism, rurality, and high percentages of white, evangelical Christian residents without college degrees. We find that the effectiveness of early social distancing measures decreased with higher values of this index. The results imply that the restrictions combined to slow the spread of COVID-19 by 12 percentage points per day in Kentucky’s two largest urban counties but had no statistically detectable effect across the rest of the state."
https://openalex.org/W3173213139,"Increasing evidence shows that astrocytes, by releasing and uptaking neuroactive molecules, regulate synaptic plasticity, considered the neurophysiological basis of memory. This study investigated the impact of l-α-aminoadipate (l-AA) on astrocytes which sense and respond to stimuli at the synaptic level and modulate hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. l-AA selectivity toward astrocytes was proposed in the early 70's and further tested in different systems. Although it has been used for impairing the astrocytic function, its effects appear to be variable in different brain regions. To test the effects of l-AA in the hippocampus of male C57Bl/6 mice we performed two different treatments (ex vivo and in vivo) and took advantage of other compounds that were reported to affect astrocytes. l-AA superfusion did not affect the basal synaptic transmission but decreased LTP magnitude. Likewise, trifluoroacetate and dihydrokainate decreased LTP magnitude and occluded the effect of l-AA on synaptic plasticity, confirming l-AA selectivity. l-AA superfusion altered astrocyte morphology, increasing the length and complexity of their processes. In vivo, l-AA intracerebroventricular injection not only reduced the astrocytic markers but also LTP magnitude and impaired hippocampal-dependent memory in mice. Interestingly, d-serine administration recovered hippocampal LTP reduction triggered by l-AA (2 h exposure in hippocampal slices), whereas in mice injected with l-AA, the superfusion of d-serine did not fully rescue LTP magnitude. Overall, these data show that both l-AA treatments affect astrocytes differently, astrocytic activation or loss, with similar negative outcomes on hippocampal LTP, implying that opposite astrocytic adaptive alterations are equally detrimental for synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W3173377774,"The effects of stress exposure are likely to vary depending on life-stage and stressor. While it has been postulated that mild stress exposure may have beneficial effects, the duration of such effects and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. While the long-term effects of early-life stress are relatively well studied, we know much less about the effects of exposure in adulthood since the early- and adult-life environments are often similar. We previously reported that repeated experimental exposure to a relatively mild stressor in female zebra finches, first experienced in young adulthood, initially had no effect on mortality risk, reduced mortality in middle age, but the apparently beneficial effects disappeared in old age. We show here that this is underpinned by differences between the control and stress-exposed group in the pattern of telomere change, with stress-exposed birds showing reduced telomere loss in middle adulthood. We thereby provide novel experimental evidence that telomere dynamics play a key role linking stress resilience and aging."
https://openalex.org/W3174046991,"Lowering the activity of the Insulin/IGF-1 Signaling (IIS) cascade results in elevated stress resistance, enhanced protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and extended lifespan of worms, flies and mice. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), the longevity phenotype that stems from IIS reduction is entirely dependent upon the activities of a subset of transcription factors including the Forkhead factor DAF-16/FOXO (DAF-16), Heat Shock Factor-1 (HSF-1), SKiNhead/Nrf (SKN-1) and ParaQuat Methylviologen responsive (PQM-1). While DAF-16 determines lifespan exclusively during early adulthood and governs proteostasis in early adulthood and midlife, HSF-1 executes these functions foremost during development. Despite the central roles of SKN-1 as a regulator of lifespan and proteostasis, the temporal requirements of this transcription factor were unknown. Here we employed conditional knockdown techniques and discovered that in C. elegans, SKN-1 is primarily important for longevity and proteostasis during late larval development through early adulthood. Our findings indicate that events that occur during late larval developmental through early adulthood affect lifespan and proteostasis and suggest that subsequent to HSF-1, SKN-1 sets the conditions, partially overlapping temporally with DAF-16, that enable IIS reduction to promote longevity and proteostasis. Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that HSF-1, SKN-1 and DAF-16 function in a coordinated and sequential manner to promote healthy aging."
https://openalex.org/W3175126447,"Commercial shipping is the primary pathway of introduction for aquatic nonindigenous species (NIS), mainly through the mechanisms of ballast water and biofouling. In response to this threat, regulatory programs have been established across the globe to regulate and monitor commercial merchant and passenger vessels to assess compliance with local requirements to reduce the likelihood of NIS introductions. Resource limitations often determine the inspection efforts applied by these regulatory agencies to reduce NIS introductions. We present a simple and adaptable model that prioritizes vessel arrivals for inspection using proxies for potential propagule pressure (PPP), namely a ships’ wetted surface area as a proxy for the likelihood of biofouling-mediated PPP and ballast water discharge volume as a proxy for ballast water-mediated PPP. We used a California-specific dataset of vessels that arrived at California ports between 2015 and 2018 to test the proposed model and demonstrate how a finite set of inspection resources can be applied to target vessels with the greatest PPP. The proposed tool is adaptable by jurisdiction, scalable to different segments of the vessel population, adjustable based on the vector of interest, and versatile because it allows combined or separate analyses of the PPP components. The approach can be adopted in any jurisdiction across the globe, especially jurisdictions without access to, or authority to collect, risk profiling data or direct measurements for all incoming vessel arrivals."

Individual values are not the point of interest of empirical analyses. The aim of the research described in the paper was to seek possible relationships between work ethic and motivation to work. A hypothesis was put forward that work ethic, in the classical Weberian approach, is connected with motivation to work, from the point of view of Ryan's and Deci's self-determination theory. The study on a sample of 405 Polish employees was conducted with use of the Polish version of Multidimensional Work Ethic Profile MWEP-PL and Work Extrinsic and Intrinsic Motivation Scale, in the Polish adaptation WEIMS-PL. The Canonical Correlation Analysis was used to assess the simultaneous interrelationships between two sets of the variables measured. The results show that selected dimensions of work ethic, such as centrality of work, valuing hard work, perceiving work as an obligation, anti-leisure sentiment and delay of gratification are positively related to autonomous dimensions of motivation: intrinsic motivation, integration and identification, and non-autonomous introjection. Attributing a high value to hard work, including the conviction that it leads to success, aversion to wasting time and self-reliance correlate positively with taking up work for extrinsic rewards and with the desire to acquire a positive opinion about oneself as well as gain approval and recognition from others. Work ethic is connected on the one hand with autonomous motivation, including in particular intrinsic motivation, and on the other hand with extrinsic motivation, with the striving for success, which is the result of work. After empirical verification the findings could become a base for training programs and shape the way of influencing people's motivation, morale, attitude towards work and job satisfaction. They can result in the way employees are managed and selected for different tasks."
https://openalex.org/W3174794790,"Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) is revealed to be inversely associated with thyroid cysts among euthyroid population. TPO-Ab causes autoimmune thyroiditis by bolstering thyroid inflammation. Therefore, at least partly, absence of thyroid cysts could indicate latent thyroid damage. Since participants with subclinical hypothyroidism are reported to have higher HbA1c than normal healthy controls, HbA1c could be inversely associated with thyroid cysts through a mechanism reflecting latent thyroid damage. To investigate the association between HbA1c and thyroid cysts among a euthyroid population, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 1,724 Japanese individuals who were within the normal range of thyroid function [i.e., normal range of free triiodothyronine (T3) and free thyroxine (T4)] and aged 40–74 years. Among this study population, 564 were diagnosed with thyroid cysts. Independently of thyroid related hormones [thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free T3, and free T4] and known cardiovascular risk factors, HbA1c was found to be significantly inversely associated with the presence of thyroid cysts. This association remained significant even after this analysis was limited to participants within a normal range of TSH. The fully adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of thyroid cysts for 1 standard deviation (SD) increment of HbA1c were 0.84 (0.74, 0.95) for total participants and 0.80 (0.70, 0.92) for participants within a normal range of TSH. Among participants with normal thyroid function, HbA1c was inversely associated with the presence of thyroid cysts. The absence of thyroid cysts and higher levels of HbA1c could indicate the latent functional damage of the thyroid."
https://openalex.org/W3176731027,"Recent studies have discovered several unique tumor response subgroups outside of response classification by Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST), such as mixed response and oligometastasis. These subtypes have a distinctive property, lesion heterogeneity defined as diversity of tumor growth profiles in RECIST target lesions. Furthermore, many cancer clinical trials have been activated to evaluate various treatment options for heterogeneity-related subgroups (e.g., 29 trials so far listed in clinicaltrials.gov for cancer patients with oligometastasis). Some of the trials have shown survival benefit by tailored treatment strategies. This evidence presents the unmet need to incorporate lesion heterogeneity to improve RECIST response classification.An approach for Lesion Heterogeneity Classification (LeHeC) was developed using a contemporary statistical approach to assess target lesion variation, characterize patient treatment response, and translate informative evidence to improving treatment strategy. A mixed effect linear model was used to determine lesion heterogeneity. Further analysis was conducted to classify various types of lesion variation and incorporate with RECIST to enhance response classification. A study cohort of 110 target lesions from 36 lung cancer patients was used for evaluation.Due to small sample size issue, the result was exploratory in nature. By analyzing RECIST target lesion data, the LeHeC approach detected a high prevalence (n = 21; 58%) of lesion heterogeneity. Subgroup classification revealed several informative distinct subsets in a descending order of lesion heterogeneity: mix of progression and regression (n = 7), mix of progression and stability (n = 9), mix of regression and stability (n = 5), and non-heterogeneity (n = 15). Evaluation for association of lesion heterogeneity and RECIST best response classification showed lesion heterogeneity commonly occurred in each response group (stable disease: 16/27; 59%; partial response: 3/5; 60%; progression disease: 2/4; 50%). Survival analysis showed a differential trend of overall survival between heterogeneity and non-heterogeneity in RECIST response groups.This is the first study to evaluate lesion heterogeneity, an underappreciated metric, for RECIST application in oncology clinical trials. Results indicated lesion heterogeneity is not an uncommon event. The LeHeC approach could enhance RECIST response classification by utilizing granular lesion level discovery of heterogeneity."

Therefore, this study aimed to identify factors associated with the unhygienic disposal of children's stools among children under the age of five in Cambodia.An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS) 2014. A multivariable binary logistic regression was conducted using Stata to analyze factors associated with the unhygienic disposal of children's stools.Overall, the prevalence of practicing unhygienic disposal of children's stools was 29.27% (95%CI: 27.51%- 31.09%). Factors statistically associated with this practice were: living in the Central Plain, Plateau and Mountains, Coastal and Sea regions (AOR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.33-2.04), (AOR = 2.53; 95% CI: 1.98-3.24) and (AOR = 4.16; 95% CI: 3.15-5.48) respectively, poor household wealth (AOR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.31-1.91), the mother having no education (AOR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.14-1.85), a high number of children aged under five (AOR = 1.11; 95% CI: 1.03-1.20), being in the ""other"" religious category (AOR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.25-2.51), living in a household with unimproved toilet facilities (AOR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.11-1.34), living in a household with inadequate hygiene (AOR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.12-1.59), and the household not being visited by a family planning worker in the last year (AOR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.19-1.77). However, an increase in the child's age by even a month had significant negative associations with unhygienic practice (AOR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.60-0.70), even when controlling for other covariates.Almost one third of the mothers do not practice hygienic disposal of children's stools in Cambodia. Unhygienic practices were more prevalent in certain regions, and were also associated with low wealth, lack of education, an increase in the number of children under five in the household, religion, lack of sanitation and access to healthcare professionals. Conversely, the child's age was found to be positively associated with the hygienic disposal of children's stools."

However, the ergogenic mechanisms supporting this ingestion strategy are strongly contested. It is therefore plausible that NaHCO3 may be ergogenic by causing beneficial shifts in the strong ion difference (SID), though the time course of this blood acid base balance variable is yet to be investigated. Twelve highly trained, adolescent swimmers (age: 15.9 ± 1.0 years, body mass: 65.3 ± 9.6 kg) consumed their typical pre-competition nutrition 1-3 hours before ingesting 0.3 g∙kg BM-1 NaHCO3 in gelatine capsules.

No significant differences were found in the time to peak of each blood measure (HCO3-: 130 ± 35 min, pH: 120 ± 38 min, SID: 98 ± 37 min; p = 0.08); however, a large effect size was calculated between time to peak HCO3- and the SID (g = 0.88). Considering that a difference between time to peak blood HCO3- and the SID was identified in adolescents, future research should compare the ergogenic effects of these two individualized NaHCO3 ingestion strategies compared to a traditional, standardized approach."

Melanoma scale (MS) and Melanoma surgery scale (MSS) did not fit the original one-dimensional structure. The MS was observed to have 4 domains: ‘pain’, ‘skin problems’, ‘abdominal metastases’ and ‘other problems’. The MSS was observed to have 2 domains: ‘having symptoms’ and ‘no symptoms’.

https://openalex.org/W3174702020,"The β2-adrenergic receptor has been shown to be involved in neuroendocrine differentiation and to contribute to the development of aggressive prostate cancer. In this study we have investigated whether miR-196a plays a role in the regulation of the β2-adrenergic receptor in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. Our results show that the expression of miR-196a is elevated in LNCaP prostate cancer cells with reduced levels of β2-adrenergic receptor after stably transfection with three different shRNAs. Furthermore, treatment with β-blockers showed that this upregulation is strictly related to the low levels of β2-adrenergic receptor and not to the inhibition of the receptor signaling activity. Finally, we found that the reduced ability of LNCaP cells with low levels of β2-adrenergic receptor to initiate neuroendocrine differentiation under androgen depletion conditions is mediated by miR-196a. In conclusion, this study provides the rational for a role of miR-196a in the β2-adrenergic receptor mediated neuroendocrine differentiation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W3176752011,"Introduction In locally advanced rectal cancer, longer delay to surgery after neoadjuvant radiotherapy increases the likelihood of histopathological tumour response. Chronomodulated radiotherapy in rectal cancer has recently been reported as a factor increasing tumour response to neoadjuvant treatment in patients having earlier surgery, with patients receiving a larger proportion of afternoon treatments showing improved response. This paper aims to replicate this work by exploring the impact of these two temporal factors, independently and in combination, on histopathological tumour response in rectal cancer patients. Methods A retrospective review of all patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who received long course (≥24 fractions) neoadjuvant radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy at a tertiary referral centre was conducted. Delay to surgery and radiotherapy treatment time were correlated to clinicopathologic characteristics with a particular focus on tumour regression grade. A review of the literature and meta-analysis were also conducted to ascertain the impact of time to surgery from preoperative radiotherapy on tumour regression. Results From a cohort of 367 patients, 197 patients met the inclusion criteria. Complete pathologic response (AJCC regression grade 0) was seen in 46 (23%) patients with a further 44 patients (22%) having at most small groups of residual cells (AJCC regression grade 1). Median time to surgery was 63 days, and no statistically significant difference was seen in tumour regression between patients having early or late surgery. There was a non-significant trend towards a larger proportion of morning treatments in patients with grade 0 or 1 regression (p = 0.077). There was no difference in tumour regression when composite groups of the two temporal variables were analysed. Visualisation of data from 39 reviewed papers (describing 27379 patients) demonstrated a plateau of response to neoadjuvant radiotherapy after approximately 60 days, and a meta-analysis found improved complete pathologic response in patients having later surgery. Conclusions There was no observed benefit of chronomodulated radiotherapy in our cohort of rectal cancer patients. Review of the literature and meta-analysis confirms the benefit of delayed surgery, with a plateau in complete response rates at approximately 60-days between completion of radiotherapy and surgery. In our cohort, time to surgery for the majority of our patients lay along this plateau and this may be a more dominant factor in determining response to neoadjuvant therapy, obscuring any effects of chronomodulation on tumour response. We would recommend surgery be performed between 8 and 11 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer."
