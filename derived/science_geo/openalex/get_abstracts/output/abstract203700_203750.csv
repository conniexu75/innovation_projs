Studies by Zachau et al. (lo), Hecht et al. (ll), and ourselves (3) have established that each amino acid is linked to a specific polynucleotide chain through an ester linkage with either the 2’or 3’-hydrosyl group of the terminal nucleotide residue. In each instance where it has been investigated, the terminal nucleotide has been identified as adenylic acid (3, 10-12). In the amino acid-acceptor ribonucleic acid from mammalian liver it was reported that the adenylic acid unit is linked to a dinucleotide sequence of two cytidylic acid residues (11). In an attempt to define the nucleotide sequence required for amino acid acceptor activity, we have investigated methods for partially degrading the RNA chains and the requirements for reconverting such degraded preparations to their native state. Removal of one or a few nucleotides from the 3’-hydroxyl end of the polynucleotide chains with purified venom phosphodiesterase destroys the amino acid acceptor activity (3). Such a partially degraded RNA preparation, but not the native material, is an excellent primer for the incorporation of (Flabeled adenosine phosphate and Ci4-labeled cytidine phosphate from their respective triphosphates by an enzyme obtained from Escherichia coli. Depending upon the extent of degradation of the RNA, the purified enzyme forms part or all of the terminal trinucleotide sequence . . . pCpCpAl resulting in the restoration of amino acid acceptor activity. The incorporation of each nucleotide unit is accompanied by the liberation of one equivalent of inorganic pyrophosphate. As might be predicted from this finding, the enzyme catalyzes a net pyrophosphorolysis of the intact amino acid-acceptor RNA yielding adenosine triphosphate and cytidine triphosphate from the terminal trinucleotide. The studies reported here are in agreement with the findings of Hecht et al. (14). These workers reported that after inactivation of mammalian amino acid-acceptor RNA by preincubation with a “pH 5 fraction” from liver or ascites cell extracts,"

Thus, hexokinase and alkaline phosphatase which show an ab- solute dependence upon the presence of Mg++, and the ferri- porphyrin proteins, peroxidase and cytochrome oxidase, are com- pletely unaffected by urea even at 2 M concentration. Uricase, a copper-protein (45), carboxypeptidase, a zinc protein (46), catalase, a hemoprotein, and inorganic pyrophosphatase which is dependent upon Mg++ in the medium are inhibited only at very high concentrations of urea. Much evidence suggests that the metal of many metal-requiring or metal-containing enzymes serves as a bridge between enzyme and substrate in the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex (47). It is extremely unlikely that urea can prevent chelation or coordination of the enzyme or substrate by a metal. Similarly, it is unlikely that urea could competitively inhibit the action of enzymes on inorganic sub- strates such as pyrophosphate, sulfite or peroxide since, in these instances, electrostatic forces rather than hydrogen-bonding or van der Waals’ forces must be involved in formation of the en- zyme-substrate complex. Xanthine oxidase has been found to be competitively inhibited by low levels of urea. Analysis of urea inhibition of a series of diverse enzymes indicates that urea is, in general, a competitive inhibitor of enzymes which act upon organic substrates. Guani- dine is much more effective than urea as a competitive inhibitor of the same group of enzymes. Relatively higher concentrations of urea are required to effect inhibition of enzymes which act upon inorganic substrates and such inhibitions are either “non- competitive” or “uncompetitive.” In general, enzymes which require metal ions as cofactors or which contain a metal as an integral part of the enzyme molecule were found to be resistant to inhibition by urea."

The presence of treponemata in the hemolymph of adult females of these species is completely correlated with the production of unisexual progenies and like this condition is dependent on the genotype of the host and of the infectious agent."

The first effect is the result of removal of radicals that are toxic when combined with oxygen; the second, the removcal of radicals that become toxic in the absence of oxygen. With these results we construct an explanation of the action of sulfhydryl compounds in protection against radiation damage."

In the mature lamprey this new component is of major quantitative importance. With paper electrophoretic mobility as the sole criterion, the new component is considered to be an alpha globulin rather than albumin."

https://openalex.org/W2008706859,"THE presence of several protein components in human serum albumin was recently demonstrated1–3by two-dimensional zone electrophoresis (filter paper followed by starch gel)4. Their identity with albumin was determined by two-dimensional zone electrophoresis3. The proteins are not related to those described by Knedel4 or by Gitlin et al. 5. During our work on normal human sera, several new proteins were observed which had the same mobility as albumin by filter paper electrophoresis (at pH 8.6), but which when subjected to electrophoresis in starch gel in a discontinuous system of buffers7 migrated more slowly than albumin. These proteins can be divided into two main groups: the members of the first group are immunologically related to albumin and one of them is present in sera in about 50 per cent of all normal adults and children. These proteins will be referred to as ‘albumin-like proteins’."

Differences in latency and configuration of generalized responses and patterns of relayed corticospinal neuron discharges indicate that a variety of extra-thalamic projections are involved in activation of Betz cells.
