https://openalex.org/W2162808103,"Plants have evolved a tremendous ability to respond to environmental changes by adapting their growth and development. The interaction between hormonal and developmental signals is a critical mechanism in the generation of this enormous plasticity. A good example is the response to the hormone ethylene that depends on tissue type, developmental stage, and environmental conditions. By characterizing the Arabidopsis wei8 mutant, we have found that a small family of genes mediates tissue-specific responses to ethylene. Biochemical studies revealed that WEI8 encodes a long-anticipated tryptophan aminotransferase, TAA1, in the essential, yet genetically uncharacterized, indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) branch of the auxin biosynthetic pathway. Analysis of TAA1 and its paralogues revealed a link between local auxin production, tissue-specific ethylene effects, and organ development. Thus, the IPA route of auxin production is key to generating robust auxin gradients in response to environmental and developmental cues."
https://openalex.org/W2086654822,"Plants grown at high densities perceive a decrease in the red to far-red (R:FR) ratio of incoming light, resulting from absorption of red light by canopy leaves and reflection of far-red light from neighboring plants. These changes in light quality trigger a series of responses known collectively as the shade avoidance syndrome. During shade avoidance, stems elongate at the expense of leaf and storage organ expansion, branching is inhibited, and flowering is accelerated. We identified several loci in Arabidopsis, mutations in which lead to plants defective in multiple shade avoidance responses. Here we describe TAA1, an aminotransferase, and show that TAA1 catalyzes the formation of indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) from L-tryptophan (L-Trp), the first step in a previously proposed, but uncharacterized, auxin biosynthetic pathway. This pathway is rapidly deployed to synthesize auxin at the high levels required to initiate the multiple changes in body plan associated with shade avoidance."
https://openalex.org/W2119584041,"Cells released from primary tumors seed metastases to specific organs by a nonrandom process, implying the involvement of biologically selective mechanisms. Based on clinical, functional, and molecular evidence, we show that the cytokine TGFbeta in the breast tumor microenvironment primes cancer cells for metastasis to the lungs. Central to this process is the induction of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) by TGFbeta via the Smad signaling pathway. TGFbeta induction of Angptl4 in cancer cells that are about to enter the circulation enhances their subsequent retention in the lungs, but not in the bone. Tumor cell-derived Angptl4 disrupts vascular endothelial cell-cell junctions, increases the permeability of lung capillaries, and facilitates the trans-endothelial passage of tumor cells. These results suggest a mechanism for metastasis whereby a cytokine in the primary tumor microenvironment induces the expression of another cytokine in departing tumor cells, empowering these cells to disrupt lung capillary walls and seed pulmonary metastases."

https://openalex.org/W1998957301,"Adult height is a model polygenic trait, but there has been limited success in identifying the genes underlying its normal variation. To identify genetic variants influencing adult human height, we used genome-wide association data from 13,665 individuals and genotyped 39 variants in an additional 16,482 samples. We identified 20 variants associated with adult height (P < 5 x 10(-7), with 10 reaching P < 1 x 10(-10)). Combined, the 20 SNPs explain approximately 3% of height variation, with a approximately 5 cm difference between the 6.2% of people with 17 or fewer 'tall' alleles compared to the 5.5% with 27 or more 'tall' alleles. The loci we identified implicate genes in Hedgehog signaling (IHH, HHIP, PTCH1), extracellular matrix (EFEMP1, ADAMTSL3, ACAN) and cancer (CDK6, HMGA2, DLEU7) pathways, and provide new insights into human growth and developmental processes. Finally, our results provide insights into the genetic architecture of a classic quantitative trait."

https://openalex.org/W2032580087,"Self-renewal is a hallmark of stem cells and cancer, but existence of a shared stemness program remains controversial. Here, we construct a gene module map to systematically relate transcriptional programs in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), adult tissue stem cells, and human cancers. This map reveals two predominant gene modules that distinguish ESCs and adult tissue stem cells. The ESC-like transcriptional program is activated in diverse human epithelial cancers and strongly predicts metastasis and death. c-Myc, but not other oncogenes, is sufficient to reactivate the ESC-like program in normal and cancer cells. In primary human keratinocytes transformed by Ras and I kappa B alpha, c-Myc increases the fraction of tumor-initiating cells by 150-fold, enabling tumor formation and serial propagation with as few as 500 cells. c-Myc-enhanced tumor initiation is cell-autonomous and independent of genomic instability. Thus, activation of an ESC-like transcriptional program in differentiated adult cells may induce pathologic self-renewal characteristic of cancer stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2052029809,Postmortem analysis of five subjects with Parkinson's disease 9-14 years after transplantation of fetal midbrain cell suspensions revealed surviving grafts that included dopamine and serotonin neurons without pathology. These findings are important for the understanding of the etiopathogenesis of midbrain dopamine neuron degeneration and future use of cell replacement therapies.
https://openalex.org/W2093248108,"Although recent reports have described multipotent, self-renewing, neural crest-derived stem cells (NCSCs), the NCSCs in various adult rodent tissues have not been well characterized or compared. Here we identified NCSCs in the bone marrow (BM), dorsal root ganglia, and whisker pad and prospectively isolated them from adult transgenic mice encoding neural crest-specific P0-Cre/Floxed-EGFP and Wnt1-Cre/Floxed-EGFP. Cultured EGFP-positive cells formed neurosphere-like structures that expressed NCSC genes and could differentiate into neurons, glial cells, and myofibroblasts, but the frequency of the cell types was tissue source dependent. Interestingly, we observed NCSCs in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region, circulating blood, and liver at the embryonic stage, suggesting that NCSCs migrate through the bloodstream to the BM and providing an explanation for how neural cells are generated from the BM. The identification of NCSCs in accessible adult tissue provides a new potential source for autologous cell therapy after nerve injury or disease."
https://openalex.org/W2017415739,"Mice with a malignant hyperthermia mutation (Y522S) in the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) display muscle contractures, rhabdomyolysis, and death in response to elevated environmental temperatures. We demonstrate that this mutation in RyR1 causes Ca(2+) leak, which drives increased generation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Subsequent S-nitrosylation of the mutant RyR1 increases its temperature sensitivity for activation, producing muscle contractures upon exposure to elevated temperatures. The Y522S mutation in humans is associated with central core disease. Many mitochondria in the muscle of heterozygous Y522S mice are swollen and misshapen. The mutant muscle displays decreased force production and increased mitochondrial lipid peroxidation with aging. Chronic treatment with N-acetylcysteine protects against mitochondrial oxidative damage and the decline in force generation. We propose a feed-forward cyclic mechanism that increases the temperature sensitivity of RyR1 activation and underlies heat stroke and sudden death. The cycle eventually produces a myopathy with damaged mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1998662278,"Gain-of-function experiments have demonstrated the potential of Notch signals to expand primitive hematopoietic progenitors, but whether Notch physiologically regulates hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis in vivo is unclear. To answer this question, we evaluated the effect of global deficiencies of canonical Notch signaling in rigorous HSC assays. Hematopoietic progenitors expressing dominant-negative Mastermind-like1 (DNMAML), a potent inhibitor of Notch-mediated transcriptional activation, achieved stable long-term reconstitution of irradiated hosts and showed a normal frequency of progenitor fractions enriched for long-term HSCs. Similar results were observed with cells lacking CSL/RBPJ, a DNA-binding factor that is required for canonical Notch signaling. Notch-deprived progenitors provided normal long-term reconstitution after secondary competitive transplantation. Furthermore, Notch target genes were expressed at low levels in primitive hematopoietic progenitors. Taken together, these results rule out an essential physiological role for cell-autonomous canonical Notch signals in HSC maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2032206743,"Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are a common cause of familial and apparently sporadic Parkinson disease. LRRK2 is a multidomain protein kinase with autophosphorylation activity. It has previously been shown that the kinase activity of LRRK2 is required for neuronal toxicity, suggesting that understanding the mechanism of kinase activation and regulation may be important for the development of specific kinase inhibitors for Parkinson disease treatment. Here, we show that LRRK2 predominantly exists as a dimer under native conditions, a state that appears to be stabilized by multiple domain-domain interactions. Furthermore, an intact C terminus, but not N terminus, is required for autophosphorylation activity. We identify two residues in the activation loop that contribute to the regulation of LRRK2 autophosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrate that LRRK2 undergoes intramolecular autophosphorylation. Together, these results provide insight into the mechanism and regulation of LRRK2 kinase activity.

The LRRK2 protein is large and complex, containing two enzymatic domains as well as several potential protein-protein interaction motifs. The various mutations are scattered throughout the protein with some evidence of clustering in the two enzymatic domains, which have kinase and GTPase activity, respectively (9Gloeckner C.J. Kinkl N.

For example, the most common mutation (G2019S) is in the kinase domain, and there is a mutation at the adjacent residue, I2020T, that is the cause of PD in the family originally shown to segregate with the locus on chromosome 12 (8Funayama M. Hasegawa K. Kowa H. Saito M. Tsuji S. Obata F. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 51: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 15Funayama M. Hasegawa K. Ohta E. Kawashima N. Komiyama M. Kowa H. Tsuji S.

There are several mutations in the GTPase domain, including three at residue Arg-1441 (R1441C/R1441G/R1441H) and other mutations in the intervening sequences between GTPase and kinase domains. We, and others, have shown that LRRK2 kinase activity is required for toxicity, at least in cell culture models (10Greggio E. Jain S. Kingsbury A. Bandopadhyay R. Lewis P.

The common G2019S mutation has consistently been shown to increase kinase activity by 2-3-fold (10Greggio E. Jain S. Kingsbury A. Bandopadhyay R. Lewis P. Kaganovich A. van der Brug M.P. Beilina A.

Genet. 2007; 16: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Glycine 2019 is located at the Mg2+-binding motif at the N-terminal end of the activation loop, a region of the kinase that is critical in the control of kinase activity. The effects of I2020T have been less clear, with both increases and decreases in kinase activity reported in different studies (9Gloeckner C.J. Kinkl N. Schumacher A. Braun R.J. O'Neill E. Meitinger T. Kolch W. Prokisch H. Ueffing M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 17Jaleel M. Nichols R.J. Deak M. Campbell D.G. Gillardon F. Knebel A.

LRRK2 and the related kinase LRRK1 can both bind GTP, and non-hydrolyzable GTP analogues increase kinase activity (11Guo L. Gandhi P.N. Wang W. Petersen R.B. Wilson-Delfosse A.L. Chen S.G. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3658-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 20Ito G. Okai T. Fujino G. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Katada T. Iwatsubo T.

Signal. 2006; 18: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mutations such as R1441C or R1441G decrease GTPase activity (11Guo L. Gandhi P.N. Wang W. Petersen R.B. Wilson-Delfosse A.L. Chen S.G. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3658-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 12Lewis P.A. Greggio E. Beilina A. Jain S. Baker A. Cookson M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Neurochem. 2007; 103: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), thus potentially increasing the length of time that the molecule has increased kinase activity following GTP binding. Part of the difficulty with assessing how mutations affect kinase activity is that our knowledge of how these large complex kinases work is, at best, nascent. A previous study using fragments of LRRK2 expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli has shown that LRRK2 can phosphorylate itself efficiently and that there are key residues within the activation loop of the kinase that control activity (18Luzon-Toro B. de la Torre E.R. Delgado A. Perez-Tur J. Hilfiker S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the autophosphorylation activity of the intact, full-length LRRK2 protein expressed in mammalian cells. We show that autophosphorylation is affected by Ser/Thr mutations in the activation loop of LRRK2. However, and in contrast to fragments expressed in E. coli, our data support the idea that full-length LRRK2 undergoes cis rather than trans autophosphorylation. We suggest that these differences are due to the complex topology of LRRK2, which results in the formation of dimeric species in vivo. Constructs and Cell Culture—Full-length LRRK2 was cloned to generate N-terminal 2x-Myc or GFP and C-terminal V5-His tagged proteins as described previously (10Greggio E. Jain S. Kingsbury A. Bandopadhyay R. Lewis P. Kaganovich A. van der Brug M.P. Beilina A. Blackinton J. Thomas K.J. Ahmad R. Miller D.W. Kesavapany S. Singleton A. Lees A. Harvey R.J. Harvey K. Cookson M.R. Neurobiol.

Mutagenesis to generate artificial activation loop mutations was performed using the QuikChange II site-direct mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Truncated forms of LRRK2 were amplified from full-length cDNA using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), cloned into pCR8GW/TOPO (Invitrogen), and subcloned into 2x-Myc destination vectors (21Greggio E.

Roc and WD40 domains were amplified and cloned in fusion with GFP in the pEGFP-C1 plasmid via the BglII and KpnI sites of the multiple cloning site. GFP was excised from these constructs via NheI and BspEI digestion and replaced by a short adaptor containing the 3x-FLAG tag (for Roc and WD40) or the 3x-Myc tag (for Roc). All plasmids were fully sequenced. Constructs were transfected in HEK293FT or COS7 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Lymphoblastoid cell lines were used for endogenous LRRK2 as these cells have been shown previously to express high levels of the protein (23Melrose H.L. Kent C.B. Taylor J.P. Dachsel J.C. Hinkle K.M.

Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid strain AH109 harboring the HIS3, ADE2, and lacZ reporters were transformed with a portion of LRRK2 (amino acids 1270-1435) fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. This construct was determined to be negative in self-activation of all selection markers by co-transformation with empty vectors. Yeast harboring the LRRK2-DNA-binding domain construct were mated with yeast containing a human brain cDNA library fused to the activation domain (premade Matchmaker pretransformed cDNA libraries, Clontech). Mated yeast were grown on Trp-/Leu-/His-/Ade- plates for 4 weeks to assay for interaction. Positive clones were grown, and the prey inserts were isolated and sequenced. GST Pulldowns—HEK293FT cells were transfected with GFP-tagged full-length LRRK2 or Myc-tagged truncated LRRK2 and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Glutathione-Sepharose beads with purified recombinant proteins were incubated with total cell lysates for 2 h at 4 °C. After four washes (phosphate-buffered saline, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors), copurified proteins were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-GFP or anti-Myc antibody (Roche Applied Science). Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK293FT cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged and V5-tagged full-length LRRK2 or 3x-Myc-tagged Roc-LRRK2 and 3x-FLAG-tagged Roc or WD40. After 48 h, cells were lysed and incubated with anti-GFP antibody or anti-Myc-agarose beads at 4 °C (Invitrogen). After four washes, immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-V5 antibodies (Invitrogen), anti-GFP antibodies (Roche Applied Science), anti-Myc antibodies (9e10, Roche Applied Science), or anti-FLAG antibodies (M2, Sigma). Size Exclusion Chromatography and Native PAGE—Size exclusion chromatography was carried out at 4 °C using the Amersham Biosciences Akta-FPLC system. Transiently transfected COS7 cells were lysed on ice for 30 min (0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with protease inhibitors), and cleared lysate (0.25 ml) was injected for FPLC. Gel filtration was a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with lysis buffer at 0.4 ml/min. Column void volume was 7.8 ml, and elution volumes of standards (Amersham Biosciences and Sigma) were 10.80 ml for ferritin (440 kDa), 12.3 ml for catalase (232 kDa), 12.8 ml for aldolase (158 kDa), 13.8 ml for transferrin (80 kDa), and 14.8 ml for ovalbumin (43 kDa). Fractions (0.25 ml) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Roche Applied Science) or a polyclonal anti-peptide antibody raised against residues 2079-2100 of human LRRK2 (Sigma). For native PAGE, 30 μg of total cell lysates transfected with Myc-LRRK2 were loaded into 3-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Gels were transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and membranes were probed with anti-Myc antibody (9e10, Roche Applied Science) or rabbit anti-LRRK2. In Vitro Kinase Assays—Myc-tagged LRRK2 proteins immunoprecipitated from HEK293FT were incubated on the agarose beads with 40 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2) containing 3 μCi of [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per reaction for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding Laemmli buffer, loaded onto precast Tris-HCl gel 4-20% or 5% (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Incorporated [32P]ATP was detected by autoradiography, and the same membranes were probed with anti-Myc antibody for total protein loading. Structural Modeling—The structural model of the kinase domain of LRRK2 was constructed using kinase TβR-I (PDB entry 1B6C) as a template. Because more than one template was available in the Protein Data Bank, structure-based profile-energy score (24Zhou H. Zhou Y. Proteins. 2005; 61: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was used to guide template selection. PDB entry 1B6C has the best structure-based profile-energy score among the other serine/threonine kinase structures, so it was chosen as the model template. Sequence alignment between LRRK2 kinase domain and TβR-I kinase was performed using CLUST-ALX (25Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35497) Google Scholar), and all alignments were manually adjusted to keep the overall secondary structures. The Jackal package (26Xiang Z. Soto C.S. Honig B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7432-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) was applied in model building, loop prediction, and refinement. The final model underwent several rounds of energy minimization to solve the clashes between residues. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was assessed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. LRRK2 Self-interacts—Dimerization is a common mechanism to regulate the activity of protein kinases (27Shi Z. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen for possible protein interactors of the central portion of LRRK2 encompassing mainly the ROC (Ras of complex proteins) domain and part of the leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) domain (amino acids 1270-1435) and identified several clones encoding three distinct portions of LRRK2. These were part of (i) the non-annotated N-terminal region (18-186), (ii) the LRRs and a region just before the ROC domain (1123-1200), and (iii) the C-terminal WD40 domain (2084-2217; Fig. 1A). These results suggested that LRRK2 exhibits self-interaction through different domains. To confirm the initial yeast two-hybrid results, we used GST pulldowns and co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1, B-D) to precipitate Myc- or FLAG-tagged LRRK2 fragments from transfected cells. Using the GST-ROC domain, we could pull down the central portion of the LRRK2 molecule (ROC-COR-kinase domains; Fig. 1B, lane 9), consistent with predictions from the above screen. This interaction was strengthened by inclusion of the WD40 domain (Fig. 1B, lane 6), suggesting that this region also contributes to self-interaction. We also observed interaction between the ROC domain and the two adjacent regions COR and LRRs (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8). The ability of ROC to pull down LRRs confirms the yeast two-hybrid findings, whereas the interaction with COR domain, which we have previously shown (28Deng J. Lewis P.A. Greggio E. Sluch E. Beilina A. Cookson M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), likely suggests that these two contiguous domains physically interact. The kinase domain showed only a very weak interaction with ROC (Fig. 1B, lane 10). However, the N-terminal region of LRRK2 was not stable when expressed in mammalian cells or as recombinant fusion proteins (data not shown). Therefore, although our yeast two-hybrid data also support a self-association of LRRK2 that is mediated through the central ROC domain and the N terminus, we have not been able to formally assess whether this part of the protein is sufficient for interaction. GST alone did not pull down LRRK2 under the same conditions (Fig. 1B), even when an excess amount was added relative to the GST-ROC domain (Fig. 1C). Although we observed that the presence of WD40 domain strengthens the interaction with ROC in GST pulldowns (Fig. 1B), we confirmed this result by showing a direct interaction between Myc-tagged ROC and FLAG-tagged WD40 by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1D, lane 4). We also successfully co-immunoprecipitated the ROC domain with itself (Fig. 1D, lane 3), supporting the yeast two-hybrid results and the crystal structure of dimeric ROC (PDB entry 2ZEJ (Ref. 28Deng J. Lewis P.A. Greggio E. Sluch E. Beilina A. Cookson M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar)). To extend this, we pulled down full-length LRRK2 with a GST fusion protein that included the ROC, COR, and kinase domains (Fig. 1E). As above, GST alone gave no signal, and no signal was seen in non-transfected cells. We showed that two full-length LRRK2 molecules are also able to interact by co-immunoprecipitating N-terminal GFP-tagged and C-terminal V5-tagged proteins (Fig. 1F). We next asked whether these interactions might contribute to the kinase activity of the full-length protein expressed in mammalian cells. Different truncation constructs containing a Myc tag (Fig. 2A) were expressed and immunoprecipitated from 293FT cells and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. Full-length LRRK2 and a deletion construct lacking the N terminus region and the LRRs (amino acids 1328-2527) displayed autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, proteins lacking the N terminus incorporated approximately three times more 32P when compared with full-length proteins (Fig. 2C). We also detected autophosphorylation using a construct that included the LRRs (amino acids 796-2527), but this fragment was unstable, and only a small amount of protein could be expressed and immunoprecipitated (data not shown). In contrast, the ROC-COR-kinase domain and the kinase domain alone expressed at high levels in 293FT, suggesting that they are intrinsically stable but had very low activity in autophosphorylation assays (Fig. 2, B and C). Together, these observations indicate that the C terminus WD40 domain is not only crucial for LRRK2 self-interaction but also crucial for autophosphorylation activity. LRRK2 Is Predominantly a Dimer—Collectively, the previous results show that LRRK2 self-interacts and are consistent with a previous report using tandem affinity purification (9Gloeckner C.J. Kinkl N. Schumacher A. Braun R.J. O'Neill E. Meitinger T. Kolch W. Prokisch H. Ueffing M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) but do not define the nature of the species formed (i.e. dimer, trimer, etc.). We therefore used two techniques that address the size of the native complex formed by LRRK2, namely blue native PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. In these experiments, we used two artificial mutant versions of LRRK2 that have decreased kinase activity relative to wild-type protein. The triple kinase dead (K1906A/D1994A/D2017A (10Greggio E. Jain S. Kingsbury A. Bandopadhyay R. Lewis P. Kaganovich A. van der Brug M.P. Beilina A. Blackinton J. Thomas K.J. Ahmad R. Miller D.W. Kesavapany S. Singleton A. Lees A. Harvey R.J. Harvey K. Cookson M.R. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 23: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar)) has a small residual activity when compared with wild type, whereas the GTP binding-deficient variant, K1347A (12Lewis P.A. Greggio E. Beilina A. Jain S. Baker A. Cookson M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 357: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), retains about 50% of the activity of wild-type when all three versions are assayed at the same time (Fig. 3A). Blue native PAGE revealed that LRRK2 is mainly present in a complex with an estimated molecular weight consistent with a dimer (estimated size 550 kDa) (Fig. 3B). A smeared signal from the dimer up to 1.2 MDa was also seen, suggesting that LRRK2 is additionally present in larger complexes. Using gel filtration, we observed that the majority of transfected wild-type Myc-LRRK2 elutes as a complex of ∼600 kDa, slightly larger than the size of a putative LRRK2 dimer (Fig. 3, C and D). Very little protein was found in the fraction around 250-300 kDa that would correspond to a monomeric form of LRRK2. At higher molecular masses, a smaller peak (∼35% of the dimer peak) was observed at around 1.3 MDa in FPLC (Fig. 3C). All these experiments were performed in transfected COS7 cells, but we found similar results using HEK293FT cells (data not shown). Interestingly, the triple mutant kinase dead or K1347A versions tended not to be present in the dimer peaks but in the larger complexes using both techniques (Fig. 3, B-D), suggesting a slightly different propensity to form dimers for these two variants (see discussion). Although the above results suggest that transfected protein is capable of forming both dimers and higher molecular weight species, it is possible that this is an artifact of high expression levels achieved in heterologous cell lines. To address this, we surveyed a number of human cell lines for endogenous levels of LRRK2 and found that lymphoblastoid cell lines expressed the most readily detectable signal (data not shown), which has also been reported by Melrose et al. (23Melrose H.L. Kent C.B. Taylor J.P. Dachsel J.C. Hinkle K.M. Lincoln S.J. Mok S.S. Culvenor J.G. Masters C.L. Tyndall G.M. Bass D.I. Ahmed Z. Andorfer C.A. Ross O.A. Wszolek Z.K. Delldonne A. Dickson D.W. Farrer M.J. Neuroscience. 2007; 147: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Using these cells, we performed FPLC and saw a ∼600-kDa peak and a broad higher molecular weight complex for the endogenous protein, similar to Myc-tagged wild-type LRRK2 (Fig. 3, C and D). Mutations at Ser-2032 and Thr-2035 Decrease LRRK2 Autophosphorylation Activity—For many protein kinases, dimerization is mediated by autophosphorylation of key residues in the activation loop, which includes the region between the conserved DFG/DYG and APE motifs (29Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Often, phosphorylation of one or more residues in the activation loop allows the loop to change conformation, usually resulting in an increased affinity for substrate binding. We constructed a structural model of the kinase domain of LRRK2 using the serine/threonine kinase domain of TβR-I (PDB entry 1B6C) as a template (Fig. 4A). Since LRRK2 has been shown to be a serine-threonine kinase (19West A.B. Moore D.J. Choi C. Andrabi S.A. Li X. Dikeman D. Biskup S. Zhang Z. Lim K.L. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), we identified three residues that might be candidate sites for modification in the activation loop, Thr-2031, Ser-2032, and Thr-2035. We made alanine mutants at all three sites and glutamate mutants at Ser-2032 and Thr-2035 (see below). Using native PAGE, we observed that, in contrast with kinase inactive LRRK2, all Myc-LRRK2 activation loop variants showed the same electrophoretic pattern with the main signal around the dimeric complex (Fig. 4B), showing that these variants do not affect dimer formation. Furthermore, these variants were expressed at similar levels to the wild-type protein (Fig. 4, C and D) in contrast to the triple kinase dead or K1347A artificial mutations that were less stable (compare with Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 4, C-F, mutation of Thr-2031 to alanine did not change the autophosphorylation levels of LRRK2 when compared with the wild-type proteins. However, S2032A exhibited lower autophosphorylation levels when compared with wild type, and T2035A had activity similar to kinase-dead LRRK2 (Fig. 4E). We also mutated Ser-2032 and Thr-2035 to glutamate to examine whether the activity could be rescued by mimicking the phosphate negative charge. We observed a partial rescue of autophosphorylation only in the case of S2032E (Fig. 4, C and E) but the same level of 32P incorporation by T2035E when compared with the alanine variant (Fig. 4C, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4E). In terms of myelin basic protein (MBP) phosphorylation, we observed a significant reduction in 32P incorporation only for LRRK2-"
https://openalex.org/W1995146769,"RanBP2 is a nucleoporin with SUMO E3 ligase activity that functions in both nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitosis. However, the biological relevance of RanBP2 and the in vivo targets of its E3 ligase activity are unknown. Here we show that animals with low amounts of RanBP2 develop severe aneuploidy in the absence of overt transport defects. The main chromosome segregation defect in cells from these mice is anaphase-bridge formation. Topoisomerase IIalpha (Topo IIalpha), which decatenates sister centromeres prior to anaphase onset to prevent bridges, fails to accumulate at inner centromeres when RanBP2 levels are low. We find that RanBP2 sumoylates Topo IIalpha in mitosis and that this modification is required for its proper localization to inner centromeres. Furthermore, mice with low amounts of RanBP2 are highly sensitive to tumor formation. Together, these data identify RanBP2 as a chromosomal instability gene that regulates Topo IIalpha by sumoylation and suppresses tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1965115435,"EGR1 is a member of the immediate early response transcription factor family and functions in cell growth, development, and stress responses in many tissues. Here we report an additional role for EGR1 in regulating homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs normally express Egr1 at high levels, but dramatically downregulate its expression when induced to divide and migrate. Consistent with this finding, mice lacking Egr1 exhibit significant increases in steady-state levels of dividing HSCs in the bone marrow (BM), and a striking spontaneous mobilization of HSCs into the peripheral blood. These data identify EGR1 as a transcriptional regulator of stem cell migration that normally functions to promote HSC quiescence and retention in the niche. The ability of this single factor to regulate both proliferation and mobilization of HSCs suggests that EGR1 commands a genetic program that coordinates stem cell division and migration to maintain appropriate HSC number and function."
https://openalex.org/W2135364630,"A prevalent view of DNA replication has been that it is carried out in fixed ""replication factories."" By tracking the progression of sister replication forks with respect to genetic loci in live Escherichia coli, we show that at initiation replisomes assemble at replication origins irrespective of where the origins are positioned within the cell. Sister replisomes separate and move to opposite cell halves shortly after initiation, migrating outwards as replication proceeds and both returning to midcell as replication termination approaches. DNA polymerase is maintained at stalled replication forks, and over short intervals of time replisomes are more dynamic than genetic loci. The data are inconsistent with models in which replisomes associated with sister forks act within a fixed replication factory. We conclude that independent replication forks follow the path of the compacted chromosomal DNA, with no structure other than DNA anchoring the replisome to any particular cellular region."
https://openalex.org/W2012819402,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is an important serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a role in many biological processes. Reversible carboxyl methylation of the PP2A catalytic subunit is an essential regulatory mechanism for its function. Demethylation and negative regulation of PP2A is mediated by a PP2A-specific methylesterase PME-1, which is conserved from yeast to humans. However, the underlying mechanism of PME-1 function remains enigmatic. Here we report the crystal structures of PME-1 by itself and in complex with a PP2A heterodimeric core enzyme. The structures reveal that PME-1 directly binds to the active site of PP2A and that this interaction results in the activation of PME-1 by rearranging the catalytic triad into an active conformation. Strikingly, these interactions also lead to inactivation of PP2A by evicting the manganese ions that are required for the phosphatase activity of PP2A. These observations identify a dual role of PME-1 that regulates PP2A activation, methylation, and holoenzyme assembly in cells."

A subset of cytosolic proteins in bacteria strictly depend on the GroEL-GroES chaperonin system for folding (Kerner et al., 2005Kerner M.J. Naylor D.J. Ishihama Y. Maier T. Chang H.C. Stines A.P.

The basic mechanism of GroEL and its cofactor GroES involves encapsulation of a single molecule of nonnative protein in a cage-like structure, thereby allowing folding to occur unimpaired by aggregation (Mayhew et al., 1996Mayhew M.

Additionally, the environment of this nanocage appears to modulate the energy landscape and the trajectories along which folding proceeds, resulting in accelerated folding for some proteins (Brinker et al., 2001Brinker A.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying this process of in vivo folding requires information about the conformations populated by protein substrates along the chaperone pathway. The bacterial chaperonin system has been the subject of extensive structural and functional analysis (summarized in Saibil and Ranson, 2002Saibil H.R. Ranson N.A.

GroEL is an ∼800 kDa cylindrical complex with ATPase activity consisting of two heptameric rings of 57 kDa subunits. Each ring encloses a central cavity exposing hydrophobic surfaces for the binding of nonnative protein. GroES, a heptameric ring of ∼10 kDa subunits, caps the ends of the GroEL cylinder. This step is dependent on ATP binding to the interacting GroEL ring (the cis ring) and results in the displacement of bound protein into an enclosed cage, large enough for proteins up to ∼60 kDa. Upon binding of ATP and GroES, GroEL undergoes allosterically regulated rigid-body movements that result in the transition of the cavity environment from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, allowing folding of the enclosed protein. Substrate proteins remain encapsulated for ∼10 s, the time needed for hydrolysis of the 7 ATP in the cis GroEL ring. Following hydrolysis, ATP binding to the trans GroEL ring causes the dissociation of GroES and release of the protein substrate. Incompletely folded protein is rapidly recaptured by an open GroEL ring for another folding attempt. How the conformation of bound substrate is affected by rigid-body movements of GroEL and whether such effects contribute to productive folding is not yet understood. Based on ensemble measurements, GroEL-bound proteins are largely disordered and devoid of stable tertiary interactions (Chen et al., 2001Chen J.W. Walter S. Horwich A.L. Smith D.L.

A slow-folding double mutant form of maltose binding protein (DM-MBP) expressed in the cytosol was chosen for these experiments, because this protein was previously shown to experience an ∼10-fold rate acceleration of folding by GroEL/GroES (Tang et al., 2006Tang Y.C. Chang H.C. Roeben A. Wischnewski D. Wischnewski N. Kerner M.J. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Structural features of the GroEL-GroES nano-cage required for rapid folding of encapsulated protein.Cell. 2006; 125: 903-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Moreover, like authentic GroEL substrates, folding of DM-MBP is largely inhibited by the Hsp70-system (DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE), and rapid folding occurs only upon protein transfer to GroEL/GroES. Our single-molecule analysis reveals that GroEL unfolds DM-MBP from collapsed Hsp70-bound states and stabilizes the protein in a dynamic ensemble of locally expanded conformations. ATP-induced domain movements in GroEL cause transient further unfolding and rapid mobilization of protein segments with moderate hydrophobicity. The more hydrophobic regions are released only upon subsequent protein encapsulation by GroES, completing compaction and folding to the native state. Segmental chain release and compaction may be important for some proteins in avoiding the formation of kinetically trapped intermediates during folding in vivo. DM-MBP (41 kDa) is a double mutant of the maltose-binding protein containing mutations V8G and Y283D in the N-terminal domain. Spontaneous folding of this protein is slow (t1/2 of ∼20 min) but is accelerated by chaperonin (Tang et al., 2006Tang Y.C. Chang H.C. Roeben A. Wischnewski D. Wischnewski N. Kerner M.J. Hartl F.U.

To obtain insight into the conformational states populated during chaperonin-assisted folding, single-pair cysteine mutants of DM-MBP (52-298, 175-298, and 30-312) were labeled with Atto532 as the donor and Atto647N as the acceptor dye for single-molecule and ensemble FRET experiments (Figure 1A). This dye pair is appropriate for distance estimates in the range of 30–80 Å (R0 ∼46 Å). Position 298 was labeled specifically with acceptor, taking advantage of its differential solvent accessibility in the presence and absence of maltose (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Dye modification did not affect the folding rates of the cysteine mutants or the ability of the refolded proteins to bind maltose and folding was typically accelerated ∼6-fold by GroEL/GroES (Table S1). Single-molecule distributions of FRET efficiencies (fE) were determined by confocal fluorescence spectroscopy in solution. Single-pair (sp)FRET measurements combined with pulsed interleaved excitation (PIE) (Kapanidis et al., 2004Kapanidis A.N. Lee N.K. Laurence T.A. Doose S. Margeat E. Weiss S.

Only molecules that have both an active donor and acceptor are included in the FRET analysis. Hence, there is no peak in the fE histogram due to a donor-only species, and quantitative measurements can be performed even at low FRET efficiencies. The fE distributions obtained after spontaneous and GroEL/GroES-assisted refolding were very similar in peak values and widths (Figures 1B and 1C; Table S2) and were generally in good agreement with the intramolecular distances calculated from the MBP crystal structure (Spurlino et al., 1991Spurlino J.C. Lu G.Y. Quiocho F.A. The 2.3-A resolution structure of the maltose- or maltodextrin-binding protein, a primary receptor of bacterial active transport and chemotaxis.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 1A; Table S3). Thus, the native states produced in both reactions are indistinguishable for the constructs measured here. Chemically denatured DM-MBP exhibited low fE values for all cysteine pairs measured with calculated donor-acceptor distances 1.5- to 2-fold expanded relative to the native state (Figure 1D; Table S3). In contrast, bimodal fE distributions were observed for the protein bound to GroEL upon dilution from denaturant (Figure 1E). For the distance between residues 52 and 298 (Figure 1E [1]), a broad distribution of molecules (∼60% of the total population) centered around a high fE of ∼0.65, considerably more compact than the denatured state (Figures 1B and 1C), whereas another population of molecules (∼40%) exhibited a narrow distribution with an fE of 0.06, roughly similar to the dimensions of the denatured protein in solution (Figure 1D; Table S3). The fE values cannot be directly compared as the conformation of the denatured polypeptide chain in solution changes dynamically, yielding a different average fE as when the conformation of the unfolded protein is static (Schuler et al., 2005Schuler B. Lipman E.A. Steinbach P.J. Kumke M. Eaton W.A. Polyproline and the. “spectroscopic ruler” revisited with single-molecule fluorescence.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 2754-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Qualitatively similar results were obtained for the distance vector from residue 30–312 (Figure 1E [3]), except that in this case a greater fraction of GroEL-bound molecules (∼65% of the total population) exists in the expanded conformation. DM-MBP (175-298) (Figure 1E [2]), on the other hand, exhibited a very broad fE distribution when bound to GroEL, with only a small fraction of molecules being in the expanded state. Based on these results, the GroEL-bound protein populates a broad distribution of nonnative states including locally highly expanded and more compact conformations. The observation of two distinct peaks in the fE histograms indicates that an exchange between these two distributions has to be slower than the diffusion of the molecules through the probe volume (∼10 ms). A peak width analysis of the spFRET histograms (Coban et al., 2006Coban O. Lamb D.C. Zaychikov E. Heumann H. Nienhaus G.U.

Characterizing the unfolded states of proteins using single-molecule FRET spectroscopy and molecular simulations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) indicates that both fE peaks are generally wider than expected due to shot-noise broadening (Table S2). The large heterogeneous width of the high fE state suggests that this population consists of a broad distribution of conformations. Interestingly, the proportion of molecules in the highly expanded conformation was reduced when DM-MBP was bound to the single-ring mutant of GroEL, SR-EL (Figure S1), which has a lower affinity for unfolded DM-MBP than wild-type GroEL (Figure S2A). Thus, the expanded conformation may result from higher-affinity multivalent binding to GroEL apical domains. Several control experiments confirmed that the bimodal fE distribution of the GroEL-bound protein represented conformational heterogeneity: Based on the diffusion rates of DM-MBP:chaperonin complexes and their equilibrium dissociation constants, only chaperonin-bound protein was analyzed in single-molecule measurements (Figures S2A and S2B; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). PIE in conjunction with fluorescence crosscorrelation spectroscopy (FCCS) (Muller et al., 2005Muller B.K. Zaychikov E. Brauchle C. Lamb D.C. Pulsed interleaved excitation.Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3508-3522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) excluded the presence of GroEL complexes with two substrate molecules bound (Figure S2C). Time-resolved anisotropy decay measurements revealed considerable flexibility of the dye molecules in GroEL-bound DM-MBP (Table S4), suggesting that the observed distributions are not due to biased fluorophore orientation. To further exclude photophysical artifacts due to the environment of GroEL, a 10-residue polyproline ruler was C-terminally attached to DM-MBP, containing donor and acceptor fluorophores at the beginning and at the end of the polyproline sequence. The fE values measured with this construct were in agreement with the expected distance (Schuler et al., 2005Schuler B. Lipman E.A. Steinbach P.J. Kumke M. Eaton W.A. Polyproline and the. “spectroscopic ruler” revisited with single-molecule fluorescence.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 2754-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and were largely unaffected by GroEL binding or enclosure of the protein inside chaperonin (Figure S3). Stopped-flow ensemble FRET measurements with three distance vectors demonstrated that upon dilution from denaturant the protein collapses from an expanded state (fE of 0.1–0.15) to a highly compact state (fE of ∼0.71) within milliseconds, i.e., within the dead time of the instrument (Figure 2A). In the presence of GroEL, a rapid expansion of this collapsed state occurred with kinetics similar to GroEL binding (t1/2 of ∼100 ms), as shown with DM-MBP(52-298) (Figure 2A). Single-molecule FRET analysis confirmed that the protein assumes a uniformly compact conformation within the first 200 s of spontaneous refolding with a peak fE of 0.84 and an averaged fE value of 0.73 (Figure 2B). GroEL addition caused a reversion to a bimodal conformational distribution (Figure 2B [2]) similar to that observed upon initial binding (Figure 1E [1]). Thus, upon GroEL binding the slow-folding compact intermediates of DM-MBP unfold and adopt a heterogeneous conformational distribution with a fraction of molecules populating locally expanded states. Note that for technical reasons the precise fE values from ensemble measurements may differ from the averaged values of single molecule fE distributions (see Experimental Procedures). However, the changes in average fE values calculated from the histograms follow those observed in ensemble measurements. To evaluate the possible biological relevance of substrate unfolding upon GroEL binding, we analyzed the conformational properties of DM-MBP when bound to the Hsp70 chaperone system (DnaK/DnaJ) that acts upstream of GroEL. Denatured DM-MBP bound efficiently to DnaK/DnaJ in the presence of ATP, resulting in inhibition of folding (Figure S4) (Tang et al., 2006Tang Y.C. Chang H.C. Roeben A. Wischnewski D. Wischnewski N. Kerner M.J. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Structural features of the GroEL-GroES nano-cage required for rapid folding of encapsulated protein.Cell. 2006; 125: 903-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ensemble FRET measurements with DM-MBP (52-298) and DM-MBP (175-298) showed that the DnaK/DnaJ-bound protein was similar in compactness to the spontaneously collapsed intermediate (fE of ∼0.7) (Figure 2C). Single-molecule analysis revealed a unimodal distribution broader than that of the spontaneously collapsed state (data not shown). Addition of the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE, which catalyzes substrate cycling on DnaK, failed to accelerate folding (Figure S4), suggesting that the nonnative states stabilized by DnaK/DnaJ are kinetically trapped. Notably, GrpE-mediated transfer to GroEL(D87K) (ATP-binding-deficient mutant; Farr et al., 1997Farr G.W. Scharl E.C. Schumacher R.J. Sondeck S. Horwich A.L. Chaperonin-mediated folding in the eykaryotic cytosol proceeds through rounds of release of native and nonnative forms.Cell. 1997; 89: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) resulted in a conformational expansion of DM-MBP as observed upon initial binding to GroEL from denaturant (Figure 2C). This unfolding step may be important in preparing the protein for subsequent accelerated folding (Figure S4). ATP binding precedes the binding of GroES in the GroEL reaction cycle and causes an anticlockwise twist of the apical GroEL domains, lowering the affinity for unfolded substrate (Saibil and Ranson, 2002Saibil H.R. Ranson N.A. The chaperonin folding machine.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 627-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, steady-state single-molecule analysis showed that addition of ATP caused the disappearance of molecules that were highly expanded along the distance between residues 52-298 and 175-298 (Figure 3A [1]; data not shown), reflecting a conformational compaction of DM-MBP. ATP addition resulted in a decrease in the affinity of GroEL for DM-MBP from ∼50 nM to ∼150 nM. Note, however, that DM-MBP remains GroEL bound in the presence of the large excess of GroEL used in single-molecule experiments (Figure S2A). Mutant forms of GroEL defective in ATP binding (GroEL (D87K) or hydrolysis (GroEL (D398A)) (Rye et al., 1997Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Distinct actions of cis and trans ATP within the double ring of the chaperonin GroEL.Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the shift in conformational distribution of DM-MBP was caused by nucleotide binding, not hydrolysis (Figure S5). Remarkably, the conformational change was completely reversible upon removal of bound nucleotide by addition of the Mg-chelator EDTA (Figure 3A [2]), demonstrating that expanded and more compact nonnative states are interconvertible dependent on the affinity state of GroEL. To obtain insight into how GroEL binding affects local protein mobility, we performed steady-state anisotropy measurements with the dye Atto532 attached to single-cysteine residues positioned throughout the DM-MBP sequence. Since the lifetime of Atto532 is 4 ns or less, the steady-state anisotropy of Atto532-labeled DM-MBP correlates with the restriction of segmental mobility resulting from binding to GroEL, which has a rotational correlation time orders of magnitude greater than the lifetime of the dye (Lin and Rye, 2004Lin Z. Rye H.S. Expansion and compression of a protein folding intermediate by GroEL.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 23-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, segmental mobility differed substantially for different regions of the GroEL-bound protein (Figure 3B). A flexible N-terminal segment (approximately residues 1–40) is followed by a highly immobile region (approximately residues 75–200), comprising parts of the discontiguous N and C domains. Notably, this segment contains the most hydrophobic regions of DM-MBP, presumably mediating strong GroEL binding. In contrast, residues 260–310, again belonging to the N domain, are more mobile, followed by a mobility-restricted C-domain segment. Addition of ATP had only little effect on the mobility of the stably bound hydrophobic regions (residues 75–200), but markedly increased the mobility of the region between residues 250 and 370, containing the less hydrophobic segments of the bound protein (Figure 3B). Stopped-flow mixing experiments with DM-MBP labeled at positions 345 or 362 showed that this segmental release occurred rapidly within 50 ms upon ATP addition and was not accelerated by GroES (Figure 3C; data not shown). In contrast, positions 141 or 202 of the highly immobile hydrophobic segment were only mobilized upon addition of ATP and GroES (Figure 3D; data not shown). Significantly, this release was slower than the mobilization of the C-domain segment (Figures 3C and 3D) and occurred with similar kinetics as GroES binding, which was monitored by FRET between GroES and GroEL (Rye et al., 1999Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. GroEL-GroES cycling: ATP and nonnative polypeptide direct alternation of folding-active rings.Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) (Figure 3E). Thus, protein collapse upon ATP binding and encapsulation by GroES follows a sequential mechanism, in which less hydrophobic regions are mobilized prior to more hydrophobic ones. In contrast, the observed compaction of DM-MBP at a millisecond timescale upon dilution from denaturant is consistent with an indiscriminate global collapse (Figure 2A; data not shown). Sequential compaction may therefore contribute to avoiding the formation of kinetically trapped intermediates during chaperonin-assisted folding. Following the ATP-induced anticlockwise twist, the apical GroEL domains swing upwards by 60° and undergo a 120° clockwise rotation upon GroES binding (Saibil and Ranson, 2002Saibil H.R. Ranson N.A. The chaperonin folding machine.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 627-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These dramatic rigid-body movements have been suggested to exert a stretching force on GroEL-bound substrate, possibly resulting in unfolding of kinetically trapped states (Shtilerman et al., 1999Shtilerman M. Lorimer G.H. Englander S.W. Chaperonin function: Folding by forced unfolding.Science. 1999; 284: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To achieve the time resolution necessary to address this issue, we performed ensemble FRET measurements upon stopped-flow mixing of SR-EL:DM-MBP complexes with ATP or ATP/GroES. SR-EL was chosen for these experiments to avoid the complication that GroES may bind to the GroEL ring opposite to bound substrate. Interestingly, addition of ATP alone, but not ADP, resulted in a very rapid expansion of the SR-EL-bound protein (t1/2 of ∼15 ms) as observed with DM-MBP (52-298) and DM-MBP (30-312) (Figure 4A; data not shown). This effect was transient and was therefore not detected in the steady-state, single-molecule measurements. The rapid expansion was followed by a slow compaction (t1/2 of ∼10 s), returning the protein to the original fE value of ∼0.71 (data not shown; Figure 4B). This end state corresponds to the broadened conformational distribution of GroEL-bound DM-MBP upon ATP addition observed in the steady-state, single-molecule measurements (Figure 3A). ATP-dependent stretching was also observed with GroEL, albeit with a lower amplitude (data not shown). This suggests that the more compact substrate conformation is mainly affected by the"

The microbial communities were dominated by the uncultured polyphosphate-accumulating organism ""Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis"". When EBPR failed, the sludge was dominated by tetrad-forming alpha-Proteobacteria. Representative and reproducible 2D gel protein separations were obtained for all sludge samples. 638 protein spots were matched across gels generated from the phosphate removing sludges. 111 of these were excised and 46 proteins were identified using recently available sludge metagenomic sequences. Many of these closely match proteins from ""Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis"" and could be directly linked to the EBPR process. They included enzymes involved in energy generation, polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glycogen synthesis, glyoxylate/TCA cycle, fatty acid beta oxidation, fatty acid synthesis and phosphate transport. Several proteins involved in cellular stress response were detected.Importantly, this study provides direct evidence linking the metabolic activities of ""Accumulibacter"" to the chemical transformations observed in EBPR. Finally, the results are discussed in relation to current EBPR metabolic models."

It is well accepted that stem cell niches play critical roles in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) behavior (Schofield, 1978Schofield R.

The stem cell niches in bone.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). In the osteoblastic niche, HSCs associate with a subset of osteoblasts lining the endosteal surface that express N-cadherin (Cdh2, a calcium-dependent adhesion molecule) (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T.

Accumulated evidence suggests that cadherins are not only required for stem cell anchoring to the niche (Song and Xie, 2002Song X. Xie T. DE-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion is essential for maintaining somatic stem cells in the Drosophila ovary.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 14813-14818Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) but also influence the cycling state of HSCs (Wilson et al., 2004Wilson A. Murphy M.J. Oskarsson T. Kaloulis K. Bettess M.D. Oser G.M. Pasche A.C. Knabenhans C. Macdonald H.R. Trumpp A. c-Myc controls the balance between hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2747-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The cycling state of HSCs is linked to their potential, as measured by reconstitution assay. Notably, quiescent subpopulations of HSCs are enriched with long-term (LT) HSCs capable of sustaining hematopoiesis for many months, whereas cycling HSC subpopulations are enriched with short-term (ST) HSCs unable to sustain reconstitution beyond a few weeks (Fleming et al., 1993Fleming W.H. Alpern E.J. Uchida N. Ikuta K. Spangrude G.J. Weissman I.L. Functional heterogeneity is associated with the cell cycle status of murine hematopoietic stem cells.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It is believed the most primitive quiescent HSCs anchored in the niches have the most efficient reconstitution (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K.

We hypothesized that N-cadherin, present at the interface between HSCs and the osteoblastic niche in both mice and humans (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K.

We found, however, that BM cells with the highest levels of N-cadherin expression were not HSCs. Instead, expression of N-cadherin at intermediate (N-cadherinint) or low (N-cadherinlo) levels divided HSCs into two populations with numerous molecular and functional distinctions. Our data suggest N-cadherinlo HSCs fulfill ongoing hematopoiesis, whereas N-cadherinint HSCs are held in reserve to support LT maintenance of the hematopoietic system. N-cadherin may mediate niche interaction, so we tested whether N-cadherin+ HSCs could reconstitute the hematopoietic system. Using a polyclonal anti-N-cadherin antibody, we previously found that 10% of Lin−Sca1+cKit+ (LSK) stem and progenitor cells express N-cadherin (Zhang et al., 2003Zhang J. Niu C. Ye L. Huang H. He X. Tong W.G. Ross J. Haug J. Johnson T. Feng J.Q. et al.Identification of the haematopoietic stem cell niche and control of the niche size.Nature. 2003; 425: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). In this study, we instead used a rat-anti-mouse N-cadherin monoclonal antibody (mAb) that exhibited superior specificity for mouse N-cadherin (see Figure S1 available online). In fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), this mAb detected a distinct population representing 0.78% ± 0.6% (n = 12) of the total BM (Figure 1A). Transplanting 5000 cells, we found that N-cadherin-expressing BM failed to reconstitute hematopoietic lineages in recipient mice, yet BM with only limited N-cadherin expression reconstituted in one of five cases (Table S1). Surprised by this result, we explored N-cadherin expression further, separating BM into mature (lineage-positive, Lin+) hematopoietic cells (Christensen and Weissman, 2001Christensen J.L. Weissman I.L. Flk-2 is a marker in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation: a simple method to isolate long-term stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 14541-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) and a Lin− population known to be enriched with stem and progenitor cells. In multiparameter FACS, it can be challenging to distinguish dim fluorescent cells from the truly negative. To address this, we employed fluorescence minus one (FMO) staining controls, combinatorial panels that omit each fluorescent reagent or replace it with an isotype control (Roederer, 2001Roederer M. Spectral compensation for flow cytometry: visualization artifacts, limitations, and caveats.Cytometry. 2001; 45: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and we combined FACS with RT-PCR. Within the Lin− cell population, four different subpopulations were observed based on the expression level of N-cadherin: negative (N-cadherin−), N-cadherinlo, N-cadherinint, and N-cadherinhi (Figure 1B). The N-cadherinhi population was predominantly Lin+ (Figure 1B), explaining its failure to reconstitute. Real-time RT-PCR confirmed N-cadherin mRNA was present in Lin−N-cadherin+ cells, including Lin−N-cadherinlo and Lin−N-cadherinint cells, but not in the Lin−N-cadherin− cells (Figures 1C and 1D). Amplicon specificity was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (Figure 1E). These four subpopulations of Lin− cells exhibited distinct Sca-1/cKit expression profiles (Figures 1F–1I), with N-cadherinint cells being most enriched with LSK stem and progenitors (23%). For these and all subsequent figures, red italic type indicates gating strategies of the displayed cells, and horizontal and vertical region markers are set using FMO controls. Next, we analyzed the LSK cells by using N-cadherin and Flk2, which has been shown to separate LT (Flk2−) and ST (Flk2+) HSCs (Christensen and Weissman, 2001Christensen J.L. Weissman I.L. Flk-2 is a marker in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation: a simple method to isolate long-term stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 14541-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) (Figures 1J and 1K). We found the LSKs were mainly composed of N-cadherinlo and N-cadherinint cells. LT-HSCs (Flk2−LSKs) were almost exclusively N-cadherinint or N-cadherinlo; N-cadherin− cells were mainly Flk2+, while N-cadherinhi cells were rarely detected (Figures 1K and 1L). Real-time RT-PCR confirmed the expression of N-cadherin mRNA in both N-cadherinlo and N-cadherinintFlk2−LSK cells compared to Lin−N-cadherin− cells (Figure 1M; Figure S2). Since our focus was LT-HSCs, FACS gating hereafter was designed to separate N-cadherinint from N-cadherinlo. To locate N-cadherin+ HSCs on BM sections, we used a mouse line (N-cadherin-LacZ) with a LacZ reporter gene trapped in at the N-cadherin locus (Luo et al., 2005Luo Y. Kostetskii I. Radice G.L. N-cadherin is not essential for limb mesenchymal chondrogenesis.Dev. Dyn. 2005; 232: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and CD201, a marker shown to explicitly identify HSCs (Balazs et al., 2006Balazs A.B. Fabian A.J. Esmon C.T. Mulligan R.C. Endothelial protein C receptor (CD201) explicitly identifies hematopoietic stem cells in murine bone marrow.Blood. 2006; 107: 2317-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The majority of the BM cells were LacZ negative. Morphologically, the N-cadherin-LacZhi BM cells appeared to be mature cells with irregular nuclei and a high cytoplasm to nucleus ratio (red arrows in Figures S3A and S3B). This further explained why N-cadherinhi BM lacked reconstitution activity. Consistent with previous findings that HSCs attach to spindle-shaped N-cadherin+ osteoblasts (Zhang et al., 2003Zhang J. Niu C. Ye L. Huang H. He X. Tong W.G. Ross J. Haug J. Johnson T. Feng J.Q. et al.Identification of the haematopoietic stem cell niche and control of the niche size.Nature. 2003; 425: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar), we detected moderate N-cadherin-LacZ expression in CD201+ cells adjacent to osteoblasts that were strongly positive for LacZ (Figures S3C–S3E). We performed competitive repopulation assays to determine if N-cadherin+LSK cells contain functional HSCs. Consistent with a previous report (Christensen and Weissman, 2001Christensen J.L. Weissman I.L. Flk-2 is a marker in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation: a simple method to isolate long-term stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 14541-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), the Flk2+LSK cells rarely reconstituted the hematopoietic lineages long-term (data not shown). We transplanted 25 N-cadherinlo or 25 N-cadherinint Flk2−LSK cells (CD45.2+) into lethally irradiated recipient mice (CD45.1+). N-cadherinlo donor cells gave higher engraftment of multiple hematopoietic lineages (four of five mice exhibited engraftment; average 53%) than N-cadherinint (two of five engrafting; average 1.4%), a result typical of several replicate experiments (Figure 2A, Table S1). As Slamf1+ (CD150) HSCs are reported to be enriched with LT-HSCs (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J. SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar), we also assayed CD150+ Flk2−LSKs. CD150+ LSKs were enriched in Flk2−LSK and represented 12.5%–25% of the Flk2−LSK population (Figure 2B). Average engraftment of CD150+Flk2−LSKs (3.2%) was low compared to N-cadherinloFlk2−LSKs (53%) but better than N-cadherinintFlk2−LSKs (1.4%) (Figure 2C) and contrasts with the strongly reconstituting SLAM code HSCs previously isolated as CD150+ CD48−CD41− (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J. SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). This difference likely stems from use of the negative markers CD48 and CD41. Specifically, CD150+CD48−CD41− cells (Figure 2D) were predominately (67.5%) N-cadherinloFlk2− cells (Figure 2E), whereas just 14% of CD150+Flk2−LSK were N-cadherinlo (Figure 2F). We next asked whether N-cadherinint and N-cadherinlo Flk2−LSK retained their distinct N-cadherin expression and reconstitution ability upon overnight culture in serum-free STIF media (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang C.C. Kaba M. Ge G. Xie K. Tong W. Hug C. Lodish H.F. Angiopoietin-like proteins stimulate ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells.Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). N-cadherin expression levels prior to culture were compared to those observed in the same cells restained with the mAb postculture. To control for differences in HSC staining/handling, we restained cells held at 4°C in STIF but not cultured. Culturing the N-cadherinlo population generated a sizable population of non-LSK cells (Figures 2G–2I). In contrast, culturing shifted a majority of N-cadherinint cells to N-cadherinlo (Figures 2J and 2L) while retaining a large portion of the cells as LSK (Figure 2K). N-cadherinint cells held at 4°C resembled the input population. To assess the functional impact of culture, we transplanted 25 or 100 freshly isolated cells or overnight cultured cells derived from the same number of input cells (we used 100 N-cadherinint Flk2−LSKs, since 25 fresh cells had given minimal reconstitution). The culture step increased the engraftment rate of 100 N-cadherinint Flk2−LSK to an average of 14.2% (Figure 2M), whereas it reduced the average engraftment of 25 N-cadherinlo Flk2−LSKs (compare Figures 2C and 2M). Cultured N-cadherinint Flk2−LSKs provided effective reconstitution of all lineages examined (T, B, and myeloid) (Figure 2N). They also gave rise to LSKs whose profile of Flk2 and N-cadherin expression resembled that of normal nontransplanted mice (compare Figures 2O and 1K). Six months after the initial transplant, we performed secondary transplants from well-engrafted primary recipients. We found that, whether originating from cultured N-cadherinint or cultured N-cadherinlo Flk2−LSKs, 100 donor-derived LSKs provided effective reconstitution for secondary recipients 3 months after transplantation (Figure 2P) and contributed to T, B, and myeloid lineages (data not shown). Thus, N-cadherinintFlk2−LSKs do have the capacity to provide LT multilineage reconstitution if transplanted postculture rather than as freshly isolated cells. To build gene-expression profiles of stem and progenitor cells with different N-cadherin levels, we sorted LSKs into four populations according to surface Flk2 and N-cadherin expression (Figure 3A), resorted to increase purity, and performed triplicate microarray studies. Sorting directly into Trizol for RNA preparation precluded determination of final purities, but the first FACS step gave purities around 80%, and equivalent double-sorted populations were around 95% pure. Most genes varied little among these populations. Analysis of probes with the most differential signals (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures) revealed that the Flk2+ populations (F+Nlo and F+Nint) commonly gave similar signal levels but were distinct from the two Flk2− populations (F−Nlo and F−Nint), which in turn frequently differed from each other (Figure 3B). Thus, N-cadherin levels separated Flk2− LT-HSCs into distinct populations but had limited impact on the expression profile of Flk2+ ST-HSCs and progenitors. Principal component analysis (PCA) (Figure 3C), which identifies and orders sources of variation within large data sets (Raychaudhuri et al., 2000Raychaudhuri S. Stuart J.M. Altman R.B. Principal components analysis to summarize microarray experiments: application to sporulation time series.Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 2000; : 455-466PubMed Google Scholar) (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures), demonstrated that Flk2 status was the most significant determinant of variation among the four populations. Whether PCA was performed on all samples (Figure 3C) or on population means (Figure 3D), the first principal component (PC1, responsible for the greatest variation in the data set) separated populations F+Nlo and F+Nint from populations F−Nlo and F−Nint. Moreover, Flk2 mRNA expression was very strongly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient r = −0.97931) with the population mean PC1 axis. PC2, the next largest source of variation in the data set, separated populations F−Nlo and F−Nint, but not F+Nlo and F+Nint. F−Nlo and F−Nint were defined on the basis of surface N-cadherin protein, yet N-cadherin mRNA levels only weakly correlated with the population mean PC2 (r = −0.60), perhaps implying additional posttranscriptional control. Real-time RT-PCR similarly showed that N-cadherinlo and N-cadherinint populations differ only modestly in N-cadherin mRNA levels. Gene ontology analysis for genes highly correlated with PC2 (|r| > 0.95) indicated that the cell populations separated by this axis likely differed in metabolic status, signaling, and cell-cycle control (Table S2). Genes positively correlated with PC2 (more highly expressed in F−Nlo than in F−Nint) were involved in protein biosynthesis and nucleotide metabolism, suggesting that N-cadherinlo HSCs may be more active than their N-cadherinint counterparts. Conversely, the negatively correlated gene set (expressed more highly in F−Nint) was overrepresented in genes encoding insulin signaling pathway components, regulators of signal transduction, and cell-cycle proteins. To help identify the basis of their distinct reconstitution abilities, we identified genes with a >1.75-fold difference in expression between populations F−Nint and F−Nlo, focusing on those in which F−Nint or F−Nlo expression was the highest or lowest of the four populations examined (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This generated 48 genes in four sets (F−Nint lowest, F−Nint highest, F−Nlo lowest, and F−Nlo highest) (Figure 3E; Table S3). Genes with highest expression in F−Nlo, the population with the greatest reconstitution ability, included chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (Ccr2), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (Ccl5), and neurotrophin 5(Ntf5), all of which are involved in locomotor activity or chemotaxis (Moser et al., 2004Moser B.

Barde Y.-A. Neurotrophins are required for nerve growth during development.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In contrast to the high Ccr2 mRNA expression observed in F−Nlo, we found that the poorly reconstituting F−Nint population showed particularly low levels of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (Csf1r) and insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (Igf2r) mRNAs, suggesting differential responsiveness to signaling molecules. Igf2r may be regulated by different mechanisms in F−Nlo and F−Nint, since F−Nlo had high levels of Air, the Igf2r antisense transcript (Sleutels et al., 2002Sleutels F. Zwart R. Barlow D.P. The non-coding Air RNA is required for silencing autosomal imprinted genes.Nature. 2002; 415: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Scl22a3, a gene in the F−Nint highest group, is also regulated by Air. Differential adhesion/matrix interaction between the two cell populations was suggested in that population F−Nint expressed high levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (Timp2), as well as the adhesion molecule integrin alpha 2b (Itga2b) and development and differentiation enhancing factor 2 (Ddef2), which acts in integrin signaling. However, this population also had the lowest mRNA level of CEA-related cell adhesion molecule 1. Differentially expressed genes known to act in hematopoietic cell lineage include Csf1r (lowest in F−Nint) and Itga2b (highest in F−Nint). F−Nlo expressed the highest levels of nephroblastoma overexpressed (Nov), a marker for the undifferentiated state necessary for effective reconstitution by human HSCs in xenograft assays (Gupta et al., 2007Gupta R. Hong D. Iborra F. Sarno S. Enver T. NOV (CCN3) functions as a regulator of human hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells.Science. 2007; 316: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our four gene sets were relatively enriched (4.08-fold, p = 0.0162) in the GO term “regulators of cell proliferation.” B cell leukemia/lymphoma 11B (Bcl11b) and the Wnt effector Tcf7 were both high in group F−Nlo, whereas E2F transcription factor 7 (E2F7) was low in population F−Nlo and Timp2 was high in population F−Nint. Of our 48 differential genes, 13 have been reported to be differentially expressed in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (Akashi et al., 2003Akashi K. He X. Chen J. Iwasaki H. Niu C.

Immunol. 2007; 179: 421-438PubMed Google Scholar), confirming that they dynamically alter early in the hematopoietic lineage. For all four genes expressed highest or lowest in F−Nint HSCs (Cnn3, Dach1, Timp2, and Csrl1), the known profile is consistent with equivalence of these HSCs and the previously studied LT-HSC/HSC population (i.e., if lowest [or highest] in F−Nint HSCs, they are correspondingly expressed at lower [or higher] levels in LT-HSCs/HSCs than in various progenitors). Just two of the nine genes highest or lowest in F−Nlo (Neo1 and Socs2) fit reported expression profiles. Six with highest expression in F−Nlo (Bclllb, Car1, Lgals, Mpo, Prtn3, and Tcf7) are either more highly expressed in ST-HSCs, multipotent progenitors (MPPs) or pro-T cells than in LT-HSCs, or more highly expressed in MPP, granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, or common myeloid progenitors than in HSCs. Likewise, Eya1 (lowest in F−Nlo) is expressed at higher levels in HSCs than in a variety of progenitors. Thus, F−Nlo, while functioning as LT-HSCs, may possess certain molecular properties previously ascribed to ST-HSCs or progenitors. To assess whether F−Nint and F−Nlo populations differed in cell-cycle regulation, we performed prolonged labeling of cycling cells with BrdU and examined label incorporation rates, a strategy recently used to calculate the cell-cycle entry rate for CD150+CD48−CD41− HSCs at around 6% per day (Kiel et al., 2007aKiel M.J. He S. Ashkenazi R. Gentry S.N. Teta M. Kushner J.A. Jackson T.L. Morrison S.J. Haematopoietic stem cells do not asymmetrically segregate chromosomes or retain BrdU.Nature. 2007; 449: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). With 1, 4, or 8 days of labeling, the percentage of BrdU+ cells was consistently higher in F−Nlo than in the F−Nint population. After 8 days of labeling, 42% of F−Nlo cells, but only 22% of F−Nint cells, were BrdU+ (Figures 4A and 4B). Cell-cycle entry rates, calculated by regression on the log of the proportion of unlabeled cells (Kiel et al., 2007aKiel M.J. He S. Ashkenazi R. Gentry S.N. Teta M. Kushner J.A. Jackson T.L.

Haematopoietic stem cells do not asymmetrically segregate chromosomes or retain BrdU.Nature. 2007; 449: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) (Figure 4C), revealed that ∼6.7% of F−Nlo HSCs entered the cell cycle each day, compared with only 3.2% per day for F−Nint HSCs. Most (67%) CD150+CD48−CD41− HSCs are N-cadherinlo (Figure 2E), so we examined how N-cadherin and CD150 expression related to different states of HSCs using a population undergoing relatively synchronous activation and expansion (increase in number). A single high-dose treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5FU) purges progenitors and cycling HSCs and spares primitive HSCs (Lerner and Harrison, 1990Lerner C. Harrison D.E. 5-Fluorouracil spares hemopoietic stem cells responsible for long-term repopulation.Exp. Hematol. 1990; 18: 114-118PubMed Google Scholar, Venezia et al., 2004Venezia T.A. Merchant A.A.

On day 3 post-5FU treatment, the LSK population was dramatically reduced (from 0.25% to 0.003%) (Figure 5B). By day 5 post-5FU, LSK numbers started to recover, indicative of HSC expansion (Figures 5B and 5C). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR on Flk2−LSKs indicated mRNA levels of cyclinD1, a factor required for progression through G1, steadily increased from day 1 through 5 post-5FU (Figure 5D). N-cadherin exhibited a strong peak in mRNA expression as the LSK number reached a minimum but declined again at day 5 when expansion was underway (Figure 5E). In contrast, CD150 mRNA was low at day 3 but upregulated again in the expansion phase (Figure 5F). To examine the coexpression pattern of N-cadherin and CD150 in individual cells, we performed single-cell RT-PCR for N-cadherin, Bmi1, CD150, and HPRT on Flk2−LSKs on day 3 post-5FU. All cells analyzed were HSCs, as they expressed the self-renewal gene Bmi1 (Park et al., 2003Park I.K. Qian D"
https://openalex.org/W2071409339,"Chromosomal translocation is the best-characterized genetic mechanism for oncogene activation. However, there are documented examples of activation by alternate mechanisms, for example gene dosage increase, though its prevalence is unclear. Here, we answered the fundamental question of the contribution of DNA amplification as a molecular mechanism driving oncogenesis. Comparing 104 cancer lines representing diverse tissue origins identified genes residing in amplification 'hotspots' and discovered an unexpected frequency of genes activated by this mechanism. The 3431 amplicons identified represent approximately 10 per hematological and approximately 36 per epithelial cancer genome. Many recurrently amplified oncogenes were previously known to be activated only by disease-specific translocations. The 135 hotspots identified contain 538 unique genes and are enriched for proliferation, apoptosis and linage-dependency genes, reflecting functions advantageous to tumor growth. Integrating gene dosage with expression data validated the downstream impact of the novel amplification events in both cell lines and clinical samples. For example, multiple downstream components of the EGFR-family-signaling pathway, including CDK5, AKT1 and SHC1, are overexpressed as a direct result of gene amplification in lung cancer. Our findings suggest that amplification is far more common a mechanism of oncogene activation than previously believed and that specific regions of the genome are hotspots of amplification."

Yamashita T. Yasuda K. Ikeda K. Kizu H. Kameda Y. Kato A. Nash R.J. Lee H.S. Ryu K.S. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 4208-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Although α-glucosidases are found in many types of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, it has been generally assumed that β-fructofuranosidases do not exist in animals (9Krasikov V.V. Karelov D.V. Firsov L.M. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2001; 66: 267-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, several reports have suggested that β-fructofuranosidases are present anomalously in certain species of insects (10Santos C.D. Terra W.R.

In the silkworm, sucrases in larval midgut tissue showed a kinetic property that is characteristic of β-fructofuranosidase (11Sumida M. Yuan X.L. Matsubara F. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol.

Biol. 1994; 108: 255-264Google Scholar), and more importantly, silkworm sucrases were shown to be less affected by sugar mimic alkaloids than those of other organisms (7Asano N. Yamashita T. Yasuda K. Ikeda K. Kizu H. Kameda Y. Kato A. Nash R.J. Lee H.S. Ryu K.S. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 4208-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 8Hirayama C. Konno K. Wasano N.

Biol. 2007; 37: 1348-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Although there has been no direct experimental evidence that the β-fructofuranosidase gene is encoded in the genome of animals, these observations lead us to hypothesize that the β-fructofuranosidase gene is encoded in the silkworm genome and could play an important role in the silkwormŉs ability to feed on mulberry leaves. By using β-fructofuranosidases as digestive enzymes, the silkworm could possibly avoid the toxic effects of d-AB1 and DNJ that are present in extremely high concentrations in the mulberry latex. As the first step toward understanding the mechanism by which the silkworm circumvents the mulberryŉs defense system, we have cloned and functionally characterized the β-fructofuranosidase genes from the silkworm, B. mori.We successfully isolated two β-fructofuranosidase genes from the silkworm. This is the first report of isolation of β-fructofuranosidase genes from an animal species. One of them (BmSuc1) appears to encode a functional enzyme, whereas the expression of the other (BmSuc2) was not detected. We then expressed the recombinant BmSUC1 protein and investigated its enzymatic properties. We further examined the expression and localization of BmSUC1 protein. Our data clearly indicated that the functional β-fructofuranosidase gene is actually encoded in the silkworm genome, and the product serves as a digestive enzyme in the silkworm.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESInsects and Cell Line—The B. mori strains p50T and N4 were reared on an artificial diet in a conditioned insect rearing room (25 °C, 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod) (14Daimon T.

The Spodoptera frugiperda cell line (Sf9) was maintained in TC-100 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (15Daimon T. Katsuma S. Iwanaga M. Kang W. Shimada T.

By sequencing and assembling them, we obtained two nonredundant genes (BmSuc1 and BmSuc2) that putatively encode for full-length β-fructofuranosidases.Genomic DNA Blot and RNA Blot Analysis—Genomic DNA blot and RNA blot experiments were performed as described previously (14Daimon T. Hamada K. Mita K. Okano K. Suzuki M.G. Kobayashi M. Shimada T. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of genomic DNA fully digested with restriction enzymes or total RNA was electrophoresed and transferred onto a nylon membrane. Labeling, hybridization, and signal detection were performed using the digoxigenin (DIG) labeling and detection system (Roche Applied Science) following the supplierŉs instructions. DNA probes were amplified by PCR using the EST clone mg-0575 (for BmSuc1) (16Mita K. Morimyo M. Okano K. Koike Y. Nohata J. Kawasaki H. Kadono-Okuda K. Yamamoto K. Suzuki M.G. Shimada T.

The amino acid sequences were aligned with the ClustalX program (19Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35195) Google Scholar), and phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighbor-joining methods using the MEGA3 program (20Kumar S. Tamura K. Nei M. Brief Bioinform. 2004; 5: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10630) Google Scholar) as previously described (15Daimon T. Katsuma S. Iwanaga M. Kang W. Shimada T. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 1112-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Expression and Purification of BmSUC1—The recombinant Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) was constructed using a Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). The coding region of BmSuc1 with a His tag sequence at the C terminus was PCR-amplified with primers pBacSUC1-F and pBacSUC1-R (Table 1), using the EST clone mg-0757 as a template. The PCR product was cloned into the cloning site (StuI) of the pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen). Virus propagation and infection were performed as described previously (15Daimon T. Katsuma S. Iwanaga M. Kang W. Shimada T. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 1112-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Monolayers of Sf9 cells cultured in a 150-mm dish were infected with the virus at a multiplicity of infection of 5. After 72 h, the culture medium was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected. Protein purification was performed using nickel chromatography. The medium was then concentrated from 300 to 20 ml using Centriprep YM-30 (Amicon), dialyzed against a binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole) overnight at 4 °C, and loaded onto a HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences). After washing with 5 ml of a wash buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 40 mm imidazole), elution was performed using an elution buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole). The eluate was dialyzed against a 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and stored at 4 °C or -80 °C until use.Enzyme Assay—Enzyme activity was assayed by two methods using glucose as a standard substrate. Glucose released in the reaction was detected by the glucose oxidase-peroxidase method, and the reducing sugars were determined by the Somogyi-Nelson method. A 100-μl reaction containing 1 μg of purified protein, 100 mm substrate, and 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), was incubated for 1–20 min at 30 °C. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min. To measure the glucose liberated, a glucose test kit (Wako) was used as indicated by the supplierŉs protocol. The reducing sugars that were liberated during the reaction were estimated by the Somogyi-Nelson method. To establish the effect of pH on the sucrose hydrolytic activity, a 100-μl reaction containing 1 μg of purified protein, 100 mm sucrose, and 20 mm Britton-Robinsonŉs wide range buffer (pH 4.0–11.0) was incubated for 1–20 min at 30 °C. The glucose liberated was measured using a glucose test kit (Wako). To see the effect of DNJ, an inhibitor of α-glucosidase, the sucrose hydrolytic activity was determined by a procedure identical to that described above except for the addition of DNJ (Sigma) to the reaction. For comparison, α-glucosidase from a bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus (Sigma) was also assayed.RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from the tissues was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). cDNAs were obtained using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), following the manufacturerŉs instructions. PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s; 55 °C for 30 s; and 72 °C for 1 min. Primers used for PCR are listed in Table 1. PCR products were analyzed on a 1.0% agarose gel.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—SDS-PAGE and immunoblot were performed as described previously (15Daimon T. Katsuma S. Iwanaga M. Kang W. Shimada T. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 1112-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An antiserum against recombinant BmSUC1 was raised in rabbits (Operon Biotechnology). Protein samples were extracted from B. mori tissues as follows. Frozen tissues were homogenized in a 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing the Complete protein inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) using liquid nitrogen and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. The primary antibody was the penta-His antibody (Qiagen) at a dilution of 1:2,000 or the anti-BmSUC1 antiserum at a dilution of 1:4,000. Signals were detected with the Immobilon Western Kit (Millipore) using the LAS1000 Plus imaging system (Fuji Film).Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was carried out as described previously (15Daimon T. Katsuma S. Iwanaga M. Kang W. Shimada T. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 1112-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Sections of the middle part of the midgut were obtained from 3-day-old fifth instar of strain p50T. Sections of silk glands were obtained from the same developmental stage of strain N4, since this strain expresses carotenoid-binding protein (CBP) (21Tsuchida K. Jouni Z.E. Gardetto J. Kobayashi Y. Tabunoki H. Azuma M. Sugiyama H. Takada N. Maekawa H. Banno Y. Fujii H. Iwano H. Wells M.A. J. Insect Physiol. 2004; 50: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which was used for control experiments. The primary antibody was anti-BmSUC1 at a dilution of 1:200, and the secondary antibody was an AlexaFluor488- or AlexaFluor546-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab)2 fragment (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:200. The slides were counterstained with a 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride solution (DAPI; Wako) or AlexaFluor594-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The fluorescence was observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51) and photographed. For control experiments, antisera against soluble and membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase of B. mori (sALP and mALP) (22Azuma M. Eguchi M. J. Exp. Zool. 1989; 251: 108-112Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and CBP (21Tsuchida K. Jouni Z.E. Gardetto J. Kobayashi Y. Tabunoki H. Azuma M. Sugiyama H. Takada N. Maekawa H. Banno Y. Fujii H. Iwano H. Wells M.A. J. Insect Physiol. 2004; 50: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were also used at a dilution of 1:200, following the procedure described above.RESULTSCloning of β-Fructofuranosidase Genes from B. mori—We performed homology searches against the whole genome data of B. mori and found two genes that show significant homology to bacterial β-fructofuranosidase (BmSuc1 and BmSuc2) (Fig. 1). BmSuc1 was found also in the silkworm EST data base (e.g. clone mg-0575) (16Mita K. Morimyo M. Okano K. Koike Y. Nohata J. Kawasaki H. Kadono-Okuda K. Yamamoto K. Suzuki M.G. Shimada T. Goldsmith M.R. Maeda S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14121-14126Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), whereas BmSuc2 was not.The BmSuc1 gene contained an open reading frame of 1464 bp encoding 488 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 55.9 kDa. The BmSuc2 gene contained an open reading frame of 1518 bp encoding 506 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 58.0 kDa. There was no intron in the coding region of either of the genes.These genes were predicted to encode proteins that exhibited high homology to bacterial β-fructofuranosidases (Fig. 1). BmSUC1 and BmSUC2 showed 45 and 39% identity (in amino acids) to Bacillus licheniformis β-fructofuranosidase (GenBank™ accession number AAU25612), respectively. The active site of invertase (Asp-23 in yeast invertase) (23Reddy A. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13953-13957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was conserved in BmSUC1 (Asp-63) but not in BmSUC2 (His-54) (Fig. 1), suggesting that BmSUC2 might not possess β-fructofuranosidase activity. The N-terminal sequence of both predicted polypeptides consisted of a putative signal peptide that contained hydrophobic residues. Signal P prediction (24Emanuelsson O. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 953-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar) positioned the putative cleavage site between residues 21 and 22 for BmSUC1 and between residues 18 and 19 for BmSUC2 (Fig. 1).Genomic DNA Blot and Phylogenetic Analysis—To eliminate the possibility that β-fructofuranosidase genes were obtained because of the contamination of the microbial DNA or RNA, genomic DNA blot analysis was performed (data not shown). Genomic DNA of the B. mori p50T strain was digested with selected restriction enzymes, blotted onto a nylon membrane, and then probed with DIG-labeled PCR products of either BmSuc1 or BmSuc2. A single band was detected in each case, and the molecular size of the signal was different between them, suggesting that both BmSuc1 and BmSuc2 are single copy genes located on the silkworm genome (data not shown).To investigate the evolutionary relationship between the BmSuc1, BmSuc2, and other β-fructofuranosidase genes, phylogenetic analysis was performed (Fig. 2). We searched proteins that show homology to BmSUC1 and BmSUC2 from public data bases with the BLAST program. The BLAST search retrieved many bacterial, fungal, and plant sucrases with high sequence homology. Their amino acid sequences were aligned with the ClustalX program (19Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35195) Google Scholar), and a phylogenetic tree was constructed with the neighbor-joining method (Fig. 2). BmSUC1 and BmSUC2 were shown to form a monophyletic clade, suggesting that they may have been derived from a gene duplication event in an ancestral insect. Interestingly, these two genes were shown to belong to bacterial lineages. This may suggest a horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to an ancestral insect, although the phylogeny showed a deep division between bacterial and silkworm β-fructofuranosidases.FIGURE 2Phylogenetic analysis of β-fructofuranosidases. Amino acid sequences of β-fructofuranosidases were aligned by the ClustalX program, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method using the MEGA3 program package (20Kumar S. Tamura K. Nei M. Brief Bioinform. 2004; 5: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10630) Google Scholar). Bootstrap values after 1,000 replications are shown.

Since the expression of BmSuc2 was not detected in our RT-PCR analysis, only BmSuc1 was analyzed further.FIGURE 3Expression and purification of the His-tagged BmSUC1 protein. Recombinant BmSUC1 protein with the His tag at the C terminus was expressed using a baculovirus expression system. BmSUC1 was purified from the medium of virus-infected cells by nickel chromatography. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with CBB (a), and the same samples were analyzed by immunoblot with the anti-His antibody (b). The molecular masses of the protein standards are shown on the left, and the estimated molecular mass of BmSUC1 is shown on the right. The following are the protein samples used. Mock, the medium from mock-infected cells; WT, the medium from parental AcMNPV-infected cells; BmSUC1-His, the medium from cells infected with the recombinant AcMNPV that expressed BmSUC1 protein; purified, the purified BmSUC1 protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The BmSUC1 protein of ∼56 kDa, which was consistent with the predicted molecular mass, was purified by nickel-chelating chromatography from the culture medium of virus-infected cells (Fig. 3a). The presence of the His tag sequence at the C terminus was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3b). The purified protein was used for further examination of the enzymatic properties.Enzyme Assay of BmSUC1—The substrate specificity of BmSUC1 was assayed using several sugar substrates (sucrose, isomaltose, maltose, raffinose, or stachyose) (Fig. 4). BmSUC1 was active on sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose, which possess the nonreducing β-d-fructofuranoside residues (Fig. 4b). However, BmSUC1 was not active on isomaltose or maltose, which lacks the β-fructofuranoside residue (Fig. 4a). This result clearly indicates that the BmSuc1 gene encodes a β-fructofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.26) that hydrolyzed the β-fructosyl residue of the substrate. The pH profile of BmSUC1 was determined using sucrose as the substrate (Fig. 4c). The assay was performed in a pH range of 4.0–11.0, and the condition of pH 7.0 was shown to be optimal.FIGURE 4Enzymatic properties of recombinant BmSUC1 protein. BmSUC1 protein was incubated with selected substrates (sucrose, isomaltose, maltose, raffinose, or stachose), and the substrate specificity of BmSUC1 was measured. a, the liberated glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method; b, the reducing sugars released were estimated by the Somogyi-Nelson method.

(n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we analyzed the inhibitory activities of DNJ on BmSUC1 activity (Fig. 4d). For comparison, α-glucosidase from bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus was also used in the assay. As expected, DNJ strongly inhibited the α-glucosidase with an IC50 value of 10 μm. In contrast, BmSUC1 activity was not inhibited by DNJ (Fig. 4d), even at a final concentration of 1200 μm (IC50 > 1200 μm; data not shown).Expression Profiles of BmSuc1 and BmSuc2 Genes—The expression profile of BmSuc1 mRNA was examined by RT-PCR (Fig. 5a). On the 3rd day of the fifth instar larvae, BmSuc1 mRNA was expressed in midgut and, interestingly, also in the silk gland. Signals were detected throughout the midgut (i.e. anterior, middle, and posterior parts of the midgut) but were not detected in the foregut and hindgut of B. mori. In the silk glands, signals were detected in the anterior silk gland and anterior and middle part of the middle silk gland (MSG) but were not detected in the posterior part of MSG and in the posterior silk gland. Signals were not detected in other tissues, such as testis, fat bodies, epidermis, trachea, or malphigian tubules.FIGURE 5Expression profiles of BmSuc1 mRNA.a, RT-PCR analysis of BmSuc1 expression.

https://openalex.org/W2033458389,"An increasing body of evidence suggests that soluble assemblies of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) play an important role in the initiation of Alzheimer disease (AD). In vitro studies have found that synthetic Aβ can form soluble aggregates through self-assembly, but this process requires Aβ concentrations 100- to 1000-fold greater than physiological levels. Tissue transglutaminase (TGase) has been implicated in neurodegeneration and can cross-link Aβ. Here we show that TGase induces rapid aggregation of Aβ within 0.5-30 min, which was not observed with chemical cross-linkers. Both Aβ40 and Aβ42 are good substrates for TGase but show different aggregation patterns. Guinea pig and human TGase induced similar Aβ aggregation patterns, and oligomerization was observed with Aβ40 concentrations as low as 50 nm. The formed Aβ40 species range from 5 to 6 nm spheres to curvilinear structures of the same width, but up to 100 nm in length, that resemble the previously described self-assembled Aβ protofibrils. TGase-induced Aβ40 assemblies are resistant to a 1-h incubation with either neprilysin or insulin degrading enzyme, whereas the monomer is rapidly degraded by both proteases. In support of these species being pathological, TGase-induced Aβ40 assemblies (100 nm) inhibited long term potentiation recorded in the CA1 region of mouse hippocampus slices. Our data suggest that TGase can contribute to AD by initiating Aβ oligomerization and aggregation at physiological levels, by reducing the clearance of Aβ due to the generation of protease-resistant Aβ species, and by forming Aβ assemblies that inhibit processes involved in memory and learning. Our data suggest that TGase might constitute a specific therapeutic target for slowing or blocking the progression of AD.

In support of the involvement of Aβ in AD, early studies investigating the neurotoxicity of Aβ found that longer forms of Aβ (e.g. Aβ42) aggregated faster than shorter ones (1Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P.

Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For self-aggregation to occur in vitro, micromolar Aβ concentrations are required (3Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). These Aβ concentrations far exceed the physiological levels, even in the AD brain, which are in the low nanomolar range (4Fagan A.M. Mintun M.A. Mach R.H. Lee S.Y. Dence C.S. Shah A.R. LaRossa G.N. Spinner M.L. Klunk W.E. Mathis C.A. DeKosky S.T. Morris J.C. Holtzman D.M. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 59: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 5Nitsch R.M. Rebeck G.W. Deng M. Richardson U.I.

Peskind E.R. Younki S.G. Greenberg D.A. Schnur E. Santoro J. Davis K.L. Neurology. 1999; 52: 547-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy suggested that a pure self-assembly mechanism may not account for oligomerization and aggregation in vivo. Tissue transglutaminase (TGase) is a complex protein with multiple functions, including serine kinase activity, G protein signaling, and the catalytic capability to cross-link proteins between lysine and glutamine residues, forming a covalent isodipeptide bond (7Griffin M. Casadio R. Bergamini C.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). TGase occurs abundantly in the brain and has been implicated in neurodegeneration (8Lesort M. Tucholski J. Miller M.L. Johnson G.V. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 9Citron B.A. Zoloty J.E. Suo Z. Festoff B.W. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 135: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Aβ contains the necessary lysine and glutamine residues for TGase-catalyzed cross-linking and has previously been shown to be a substrate for TGase (10Ikura K. Takahata K. Sasaki R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Dudek S.M. Johnson G.V.W. Brain Res. 1994; 651: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Wakshlag J.J. Antonyak M.A. Boehm J.E. Boehm K. Cerione R.A. Protein J. 2006; 25: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, TGase may be a likely candidate to play a role in the pathophysiology of AD. Here we found that TGase induces monomeric Aβ to rapidly form oligomers and aggregates in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Most importantly, we show that TGase lowers the concentration for Aβ oligomerization so it can occur at physiological Aβ levels and that it induces Aβ species that are resistant to degradation by metalloproteases. Additionally, EM analysis showed that the TGase-induced Aβ assemblies have the same morphologies as the previously described protofibrils that result from self-aggregation (13Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25945-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 14Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Maggio J.E. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). The importance of these findings is supported by the ability of the TGase-induced Aβ assemblies to attenuate long term potentiation (LTP), a process thought to be affected in the early stages of AD. Thus, the TGase-induced oligomerization and aggregation of Aβ provides a mechanism that could explain both the formation and the persistence of pathologically active Aβ species in vivo. Chemicals—Unless noted otherwise, chemicals were purchased from Sigma and Invitrogen. Insulin-degrading enzyme was a gift from Dr. Malcolm Leissring. Human neprilysin was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), 6E10 antibody from Signet Laboratories (Dedham, MA), and anti-TGase antibody ab2386 from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Aβ Peptide Preparation—Lyophilized Aβ peptides were obtained from multiple sources as a trifluoroacetic salt (Biopolymer Facility, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Anaspec, San Jose, CA, California Peptide, Napa, CA). Aβ was prepared for TGase-mediated cross-linking reactions by initially dissolving the peptide in 100% DMSO and then diluting the solution with water and HEPES buffer (final concentration, 232 μm Aβ in 5% DMSO and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Monomeric Aβ was purified, and Aβ assemblies were characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using either a Superdex 75 or Superose 6 column (10 × 300 mm). The Superdex 75 column was initially used to separate low molecular weight Aβ from protofibrils as previously described (14Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Maggio J.E. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). The Superose 6 column was used to separate a larger range of Aβ aggregates. For a subset of experiments, Aβ40 (1 mg/ml) was denatured in 6 m guanidine HCl prior to SEC purification. Samples were run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and protein was monitored at wavelengths of 210 and 280 nm. Both columns were run isocratically using a buffer containing 70 mm NaCl and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Protein Assay—The Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) was modified by adding a 10-min incubation of the samples in 4 m urea at room temperature, before dye addition. Thioflavin T Binding—Thioflavin T dye (10 μm) in 100 mm glycine buffer, pH 8.5, was mixed with an equal amount of sample (50 μl of each for 96-well assays), incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the dark, and read out at 446ex and 490em (15Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Cross-linking Reactions—Tissue transglutaminase (TGase, or TGase 2, EC 2.3.2.13) reactions in 70 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol were initiated by adding Aβ40. The reactions were incubated for the times and at the temperatures specified for the various experiments. Reactions were stopped either by the addition of EDTA (50 mm final concentration) or the addition of a TGase inhibitor (LDDN-80042, courtesy of Laboratory of Neurodegeneration and Drug Discovery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston) at 10-20 μm. In some experiments the Aβ peptide was concentrated using a 3-kDa cutoff spin filter in the presence of 50 mm EDTA and 0.11 mm SDS. Because Aβ42 has a higher propensity to self-aggregate, the experiments described above were performed with Aβ40 to keep self-aggregation at a minimum, because it might confound the kinetics of TGase-induced aggregation (i.e. cross-linking of monomer versus cross-linking of pre-formed oligomers or aggregates). Guinea pig TGase purified from liver was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Recombinant human TGase expressed in Escherichia coli (16Case A. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9466-9481Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Piper J.L. Gray G.M. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Ross Stein. To allow direct comparison of the ability of human and guinea pig TGase to induce oligomerization of Aβ40, the concentrations of active sites (micromolar) of both enzyme preparations were determined by the Case and Stein (16Case A. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9466-9481Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) method and were found to be 13.5 and 40 μm, respectively. Unless noted otherwise, all experiments were carried out with guinea pig TGase. The cross-linking reagent dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) was used as described by Davies and Stark (18Davies G.E. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Solutions containing glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (3 mg/ml), aldolase (5 mg/ml), or Aβ40 (0.43 μg/ml) were incubated with DMS (2 mg/ml) at 30 °C overnight in 0.2 m triethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 8.5). Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Samples were boiled (unless noted otherwise) and separated on Bis-Tris 4-12% NuPAGE gels in MES-SDS running buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred onto an Optitran BA-S 83 0.2-μm supported nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). Membranes were not boiled before blocking. Membranes were blocked in 5% powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST)) for 30 min, probed with the 6E10 (1:5000, Signet) antibody, and developed with a donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:8000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Chemiluminescence substrate (ECL+, GE Healthcare) was used to visualize Aβ bands. Gels not being transferred for Western blotting were stained with SYPRO Red reagent in 10% acetic acid for 1 h to visualize proteins (per manufacturer's instructions, Invitrogen). Electron Microscopy—Aβ was purified by SEC using the guanidine HCl and Superose 6 column method (see above). A common stock of fresh Aβ was prepared, and aliquots were sampled at various time points for EM analysis. The samples were prepared by conventional negative staining with 0.75% uranyl formate as described previously (19Ohi M. Li Y. Cheng Y. Walz T. Biol. Proced. Online. 2004; 6: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Reactions were considered to be terminated at the time when excess peptide was washed from the grid, which was ∼25 s into the EM grid preparation procedure. Grids were examined with a FEI Tecnai 12 electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. Images were recorded at a magnification of 52,000× and a defocus of ∼-1.5 μm using a Gatan 2k × 2k charge-coupled device camera. Protease Degradation—Aggregated Aβ was prepared by mixing Aβ with TGase (see above) and stopped with the TGase inhibitor LDDN-80042 (10 μm). Degradation was evaluated with 50-100 nm protease for different time periods at 37 °C and halted with 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting using the 6E10 anti-Aβ antibody. Electrophysiological Recordings—Mouse transverse hippocampal slices were prepared and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) were recorded in the CA1 region of the hippocampus as described previously (20Li S. Tian X. Hartley D.M. Feig L.A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1721-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To induce LTP, two consecutive trains (1 s) of stimuli at 100 Hz separated by 20 s were applied to the Schaffer collaterals. Traces were analyzed using the LTP Program (21Anderson W.W. Collingridge G.L. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2001; 108: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The fEPSP magnitude was measured using the initial fEPSP slope, and three consecutive responses (1 min) were averaged and normalized to the mean value recorded 20-30 min into the baseline recording, but before tetanus application. Data were pooled across animals of the same age and are presented as mean ± S.E. LTP was evaluated by measuring fEPSPs 60 min after the tetanus application. The following statistical analysis was carried out: the same time window samples of the control and drug administrations were compared using paired, two-tailed Student's t test. In the case of multiple comparisons, samples were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Student-Newman-Keuls post-hoc tests were used to examine the significance of multiple pairwise comparisons. Amyloid-β protein (Aβ) undergoes self-aggregation in vitro above a critical concentration, which has been reported as 5-100 μm depending on whether Aβ40 or Aβ42 was used (22Lomakin A. Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Kirschner D.A. Teplow D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 23Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). This process requires hours to days to occur, although aggregation can be accelerated with higher concentrations of Aβ. Physiological concentrations of Aβ are significantly lower, in the picoto nanomolar range, posing the conundrum as to what in vivo factors allow Aβ to oligomerize or aggregate at lower concentrations. Our experiments show that TGase causes rapid, time-dependent oligomerization of Aβ40. TGase (6.25 × 10-3 units/ml) was added to an Aβ40 solution (25 μm) at room temperature, aliquots were taken at 0, 1, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min, and the reaction was stopped with EDTA. The aliquots were resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel, illustrating the rapid kinetics of the TGase-induced oligomerization of Aβ (Fig. 1A). This rapid assembly appears as a laddering of Aβ that represents the incremental addition of Aβ monomers into oligomers that develop into larger assemblies and eventually grow too large to enter the gel. This time-course experiment shows that TGase induces rapid oligomerization of Aβ under these specific conditions, reaching ∼50% activity in 5 min (Fig. 1B). TGase activity was inhibited in the presence of the calcium chelator EDTA (5 mm) (Fig. 1, A and B). It is important to point out that self-assembled Aβ are SDS-labile, particularly at elevated temperatures. Boiling the reaction products of self-assembled Aβ briefly prior to electrophoresis dissociates most of the self-aggregated Aβ species (data not shown). By contrast, Aβ species formed in the presence of TGase remain intact upon boiling. The oligomerization of Aβ by TGase can be observed by SEC as the substrate-to-product ratio. At time 0 most of Aβ40 is in a low molecular weight form (predominantly monomeric Aβ40) and elutes at 31 min, but after a 30-min incubation with TGase, Aβ40 is converted into larger assemblies as observed by an increase in the void peak that elutes at 17 min (Fig. 1C, dotted line). In contrast, Aβ40 incubated for 30 min without TGase shows little conversion of the low molecular weight Aβ40 peak into larger assemblies (Fig. 1C, solid line). In support of TGase being responsible for the fast Aβ oligomerization kinetics, addition of the recently developed TGase inhibitor LDDN-80042 (24Duval E. Case A. Stein R.L. Cuny G.D. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 1885-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 2.5 μm resulted in almost complete inhibition of Aβ oligomerization (Fig. 1, D and E). Additional support for TGase driving this process is the lack of aggregation observed with a mutant Aβ40 peptide. Wild-type Aβ40 showed rapid assembly formation in the presence (Fig. 1F, lane 1) but not in the absence of TGase (Fig. 1F, lane 2). To show the specificity of this reaction, the two lysine residues in Aβ40 were mutated to alanine, because TGase requires a lysine for the formation of an ϵ-(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bond (7Griffin M. Casadio R. Bergamini C.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Little to no oligomerization was observed with the mutant Aβ40 irrespective of the presence (Fig. 1F, lane 3) or absence of TGase (Fig. 1F, lane 4). Interestingly, the single remaining cross-link site, a glutamine residue in the mutant peptide, is available to react with TGase, as suggested by a weak 6E10 band near the molecular weight of TGase (76.6 kDa) (Fig. 1F, lane 3, asterisk). The presence of TGase in this band was confirmed by reprobing the same blot with anti-TGase antibodies (data not shown). These results suggest that TGase can specifically catalyze the oligomerization of Aβ40 and supports the previous finding that Aβ is a substrate for the enzyme (10Ikura K. Takahata K. Sasaki R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Dudek S.M. Johnson G.V.W. Brain Res. 1994; 651: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Wakshlag J.J. Antonyak M.A. Boehm J.E. Boehm K. Cerione R.A. Protein J. 2006; 25: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To investigate the specificity of TGase-mediated cross-linking, we compared enzymatic with chemical cross-linking of Aβ. In Fig. 2A, cross-linking of three different substrates, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD), aldolase, and Aβ, were compared. All proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE and visualized using SYPRO Red dye. G3PD and aldolase have previously been shown to multimerize in the presence of DMS and were used as positive controls (18Davies G.E. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The addition of DMS to either protein induced higher molecular weight assemblies (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, little to no oligomerization was observed with Aβ incubated with DMS (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Similar results were observed with all three proteins using the chemical cross-linker dimethyl adipimidate (data not shown). The finding that TGase induces robust oligomerization of Aβ (Fig. 2A, lane 12) but fails to cross-link G3PD or aldolase (Fig. 2A, lanes 7-10) suggests that cross-linking of Aβ by TGase is a specific reaction. Similar results were obtained when Aβ cross-linking was analyzed by SEC. Aβ treated with DMS and separated in 2 m guanidine HCl (to disassemble non-cross-linked Aβ) showed predominately monomeric Aβ (Fig. 2B). However, Aβ treated with TGase showed numerous peaks between 15 and 24 min (Fig. 2C), that presumably represent the dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric Aβ assemblies observed on the Western blots. These data thus support the notion that TGase interacts with Aβ in a specific manner to promote oligomerization. Because AD is specific to humans, a comparison was conducted between guinea pig and human TGase to validate the possibility of a role for this enzyme in the disease. Analysis of mouse and human TGase with calculated molecular weights of 76,699 and 77,253, respectively, showed an 84% homology at the protein level (25Gentile V. Saydak M. Chiocca E.A. Akande O. Birckbichler P.J. Lee K.N. Stein J.P. Davies P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 478-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the active catalytic site is highly conserved in TGases from invertebrates to humans (26Chen J.S. Mehta K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a series of reactions conducted using guinea pig and human TGase showed similar oligomerization patterns by Western blotting (data not shown). The molarity of the active sites was determined for the human and the guinea pig preparations according to Case and Stein (16Case A. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9466-9481Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and was found to be 13.5 μm and 40 μm, respectively. The amount of oligomerization observed by Western blotting (data not shown) was plotted against the amount of catalytic activity for both guinea pig (circles) and human (triangles) TGase (Fig. 3). The results show that Aβ is an equally good substrate for both the human and guinea pig transglutaminase. This conclusion is further supported by the almost identical enzymatic activity previously observed for these two enzymes (16Case A. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9466-9481Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Case A. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1106-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To further study the potential role of TGase in AD, experiments were conducted to determine if another important, disease-related Aβ species, Aβ42, is also a substrate for TGase. The possibility of Aβ42 being more pertinent to the pathophysiology of AD has been discussed, both because of its greater production relative to Aβ40 associated with familial AD mutations and because of its greater propensity to aggregate (28Lansbury P.T. Lashuel H.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The monomer is the predominant form of Aβ peptides observed without TGase (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 3), with Aβ42 showing a slight tendency for self-assembly (Fig. 4, lane 3). In contrast, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting showed oligomeric laddering for both Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the presence of TGase (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 4). Even though TGase induced both peptides to rapidly oligomerize, there is a qualitative difference in the banding patterns representing the smaller oligomeric species (Fig. 4, lane 2 versus 4), whereas the high molecular weight bands appeared identical. This difference may relate to Aβ40 and Aβ42 being assembled through different pathways (29Bitan G. Kirkitadze M.D. Lomakin A. Vollers S.S. Benedek G.B. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, these results demonstrate that TGase recognizes both Aβ42 and Aβ40 as substrates. To assess whether TGase catalyzes Aβ oligomerization at physiological Aβ concentrations, experiments were conducted with Aβ40 concentrations from the low nanomolar to the low micromolar range (Fig. 5). It was possible to detect TGase-induced oligomers of Aβ by our standard Western blotting procedure at Aβ concentrations of 500 and 1000 nm (Fig. 5A, lane 3 and 4, respectively), ∼10- to 20-fold lower than the concentrations needed for Aβ self-assembly to normally occur (Fig. 5A, lane 1, no TGase). Lane 2 contains only TGase, showing that the bands in lanes 1, 3, and 4 were specific to Aβ and not due to the presence of TGase. TGase-induced oligomerization of Aβ may occur at even lower concentrations, but at Aβ concentrations below 500 nm protein bands were difficult to detect by Western blotting. To determine whether TGase-induced oligomerization of Aβ could occur near physiological conditions, the Aβ40 concentration was lowered to 50 nm, but the reaction volume was increased to accommodate subsequent concentration of the sample to a level that was detectable by Western blotting. Aβ40 was incubated for 24 h with and without TGase (1.1 × 10-3 units/ml). The reactions were stopped with a final concentration of 50 mm EDTA and 0.11 mm SDS. SDS was critical for recovering low concentrations of Aβ by reducing Aβ loss due to binding to surfaces. The samples were then concentrated 1000-fold by spin filtration using a 3-kDa cutoff filter, limiting the loss of monomeric Aβ. After concentrating, samples were boiled to dissociate non-cross-linked oligomers formed by self-aggregation during the concentration process. Western blotting revealed that Aβ assemblies occurred only in the presence (Fig. 5B, lane 2) but not in the absence of TGase (Fig. 5B, lane 1). Bands could be detected in the sample containing TGase (see arrows in Fig. 2B, ∼8 and 12 kDa) that were not present in the sample without TGase (i.e. 12-kDa band) or only in lower amounts (i.e. 8-kDa band) (Fig. 2B, lane 1). An additional large smear centered near 76 kDa (asterisk) was present in the concentrated sample containing TGase (Fig. 5B, lane 2), which was identified as TGase by anti-TGase antibodies in samples containing TGase and Aβ (Fig. 5C, lane 2) or TGase alone (Fig. 5C, lane 3). In these reactions TGase was not lowered proportionally to the decrease in Aβ, producing a higher molar ratio of TGase to Aβ than in standard reactions, thus explaining the prominent TGase bands on the Western blot after concentrating the samples. These high molecular weight bands also appeared in lanes containing Aβ and TGase developed with the anti-Aβ antibody (Fig. 5B, lane 2), but not in lanes containing only Aβ or only TGase (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 3, respectively), indicating that Aβ was bound to TGase. The formation of the 8-kDa, 12-kDa, and high molecular weight bands was compared in samples containing only Aβ and Aβ treated with TGase and quantified in Fig. 5D. These experiments indicate that TGase can induce Aβ oligomerization at physiologically relevant Aβ concentrations. We used EM to visualize the TGase-induced Aβ assemblies, allowing for a comparison with previous EM studies of self-aggregating synthetic Aβ (14Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Maggio J.E.

Aβ40 was denatured and purified by SEC prior to the addition of TGase. No structures were observed with fresh, SEC purified Aβ (data not shown). In Fig. 6, SEC purified Aβ (17 μm) was incubated with TGase (4 × 10-3 units/ml) at 30 °C for the times specified in the panels (2.5 min to 68 h). Very few structures were observed before 10-20 min, except for an occasional spherical particle of ∼12 nm in diameter that was also seen in the sample containing"
https://openalex.org/W2066018349,"Previous studies have shown that the acute stimulation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA transcription by laminar shear stress is dependent on nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) subunits p50 and p65 binding to a shear stress response element (SSRE) in the human eNOS promoter and that mutation of the SSRE abrogates the shear-stimulated increase in eNOS promoter activity. In the present study, we found that although shear markedly increased eNOS mRNA, the increase in nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 caused by shear was only 2-fold, suggesting that shear has additional effects on NFkappaB cofactor activity beyond nuclear translocation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that virtually no p50 or p65 was bound to the eNOS promoter at base line but that shear increased the binding of these subunits to the human eNOS SSRE by 10- to 20-fold. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated during the first 30 min of shear p300 bound to p65. Shear also increased p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity by 2.5-fold and increased acetylation of p65. The increase in eNOS mRNA caused by shear was completely blocked by pharmacological inhibition of p300/HAT activity with curcumin or by p300 small interfering RNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays also showed that shear stimulated acetylation of histones 3 and 4 at the region of the eNOS promoter SSRE and extended 3' toward the eNOS coding region. This was associated with opening of chromatin at the SSRE. In conclusion, these studies reveal a previously unknown role of p300/HAT activation as a very early response to shear that is essential for increasing eNOS mRNA levels."

https://openalex.org/W2047496509,"Androgen-withdrawal-induced apoptosis (AWIA) is deregulated in androgen refractory prostate cancer. Androgens have been shown to positively regulate expression of the antiapoptotic FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (FLICE)-like inhibitory protein (FLIP), and reduced FLIP expression precedes apoptosis after androgen withdrawal. Here, we show that FLIP protein expression is downregulated in castrated rats, while in LNCaP cells, androgens regulate FLIP in a manner that is dependent on phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt signaling. Specifically, treatment of LNCaP cells with LY294002, or expression of either PTEN or a non-phosphorylatable form of FOXO3a (FOXO3aTM), downregulates FLIP protein and mRNA. Conversely, treatment with androgens in the absence of PI3/Akt signaling, or following expression of FOXO3aTM, leads to increased FLIP expression. A FOXO3a binding site was identified in the FLIP promoter and shown necessary for the combined effects of androgens and FOXO3a on FLIP transcription. FOXO3a binds the androgen receptor, suggesting that the transcriptional synergy depends on an interaction between these proteins. Finally, LNCaP cells are sensitized to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by PTEN or LY294002, and rescued by androgens. FOXO3aTM also sensitizes cells to androgen-inhibited TRAIL apoptosis. Androgen rescue was diminished when either FOXO3a or FLIP was reduced by siRNA. These data support a role for FOXO3a in AWIA."

Inhibiting either ATF2 or Cul3 expression by small interfering RNA stabilizes the TIP60 protein. ATF2 association with TIP60 on chromatin is decreased following exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), resulting in enhanced TIP60 stability and activity. We also identified a panel of melanoma and prostate cancer cell lines whose ATF2 expression is inversely correlated with TIP60 levels and ATM activation after IR.

Intriguingly, inhibiting ATF2 expression attenuates ATM activation following IR, suggesting a reciprocal relationship between the two proteins (8Bhoumik A. Takahashi S. Breitweiser W. Shiloh Y.

Cells—HeLa and HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with calf serum (10%) and antibiotics. WM115, WM793, FEMX, HHMSX, WIDR, A549, PC3, LNcaP, ALav31, and M12 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Plasmids and Transfection—Plasmids expressing both wild type and mutant forms of HA-ATF2 were described previously (8Bhoumik A. Takahashi S. Breitweiser W. Shiloh Y. Jones N. Ronai Z. Mol.

TIP60 deletion mutants were generated by PCR and subcloned into PEF-FLAG vector. Plasmid integrity was confirmed by sequencing. pcDNA3 Myc-tagged Cullin3 and pcDNA3 HA-ROC1 were kindly provided by Z. Q. Pan. Plasmids were transfected into 293T cells using the calcium phosphate method and into HeLa, WM793, and M12 cells using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Reagents and Antibodies—Antibodies were purchased as follows: anti-TIP60, anti-phospho-SMC1, anti-SMC1, anti-H2AX, anti-γH2AX, anti-Ac H4 K16 antibodies, anti-Ac H4 K5 from Upstate Biotechnology; anti-ATF2 from Santa Cruz; anti-Ser(P)1981 ATM from Rockland Immunochemicals; anti-TIP49b from BD Biosciences; anti-HA Ab 12CA5 from Covance; and anti-FLAG and anti-β-Actin antibodies from Sigma. A mouse monoclonal antibody against ATM (MAT3) was a kind gift from Y. Shiloh. For immunoprecipitation, TIP60 polyclonal antibody was generated using full-length, bacterially produced TIP60 (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). MG132 was purchased from Boston Biochemicals and sodium butyrate was purchased from Sigma. RNA Interference—For RNAi targeting of ATF2 and TIP60, the pSuper vector system that directs synthesis of siRNAs in mammalian cells was used (28Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). The target was 523GTTGGCGAGTCCATTTGAG541 of the human ATF2 gene (accession number NM_001880). The TIP60 target sequence for RNAi was 543ACGGAAGGTGGAGGTGGTT561 of human TIP60 (accession number NM_182710). Oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into BglII and HindIII sites of pSuper vector to construct pS-ATF2 and pS-TIP60. To target CULLIN3, corresponding SMARTpool siRNA reagents were used. As a control, the corresponding siRNA control oligo was used (Dharmacon). Transfection of siRNA duplexes was carried out using oligofectamine and the pSuper vector with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). ATF2 and TIP60 expression levels were measured 48 h after transfection. RT-PCR Analyses—Cells treated with or without IR were harvested and total RNA extracted using an RNA extraction kit (Sigma). Complementary DNA was synthesized from 2.5 μg of total RNA using an oligo(dT) (19Tamburini B.A. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4903-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) primer. Primers used for PCR were TIP60 forward: 5′-ATGAGCGGCTGGACCTAAAGAAGA-3′ and reverse 5′-AGTCCTCATCAGTGCCCAAACAAT-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and reverse 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. Amplification of TIP60 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase required 20 and 18 cycles, respectively. Products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels. Chromatin-bound Fractionation and Immunoblotting—Irradiated or mock-treated cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell fractionation was carried out by three consecutive extractions. In brief, 3 × 108 cells were first resuspended 5 min on ice in 500 μl of fractionation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) to isolate the cytoplasmic fraction. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected (fraction I), and pellets containing nuclei were washed twice with the same buffer. Nuclei were further extracted for 40 min on ice with 350 μl of fractionation buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After rotating at 4 °C for 30 min, samples were centrifuged at 13,200 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was saved as the nuclear extract (fraction II). The nuclear pellet was lysed using fractionation buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and DNase I (0.1 mg/ml) followed by sonication. The supernatant was treated with 0.1 mg/ml EtBr for 10 min and extracts centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected as the chromatin-enriched fraction (fraction III). HAT Activity Assay—FLAG-tagged TIP60 bound to chromatin was isolated as described above. Radioactive HAT filter binding assays were performed as described (29Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min in 30 μl of assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 90 pmol of [3H]acetyl-CoA (3.3 Ci mmol-1; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 2 pmol of TIP60 complex, and 1 μg of bacterially produced recombinant human histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnologies). After incubation, the reaction mixture was spotted onto Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose filter paper and washed for 30 min with 0.2 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.2, at room temperature with 2-3 buffer changes. Dried filters were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. For a non-radioactive HAT assay, immunoprecipitates were incubated in 60 μl of HAT assay buffer containing acetyl-CoA (100 μm), 1 pmol of TIP60 complex, and biotinylated histone H4 peptide (0.5 μg) for 30 min at 30 °C. An aliquot of the reaction was immobilized onto streptavidin plates and acetylation was detected by a HAT ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoblotting and Quantitation—Proteins were separated on 4-20% gradient gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Alexa Fluor 680 anti-rabbit and anti-mouse and IRdye800 anti-mouse secondary antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen and Rockland Immunochemicals, respectively. The use of infrared fluorescent dyes on the secondary antibodies allows direct quantitation of secondary antibodies using the Odyssey system (Licor). Membranes were scanned and quantified using this system and associated software. Immunostaining—Cells were plated on coverslips and irradiated, fixed at the indicated time points, and processed as described (8Bhoumik A. Takahashi S. Breitweiser W. Shiloh Y. Jones N. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Pulse-Chase—Cells were washed and incubated with methionine/cysteine-free media (45 min at 37 °C). Medium was then replaced with methionine/cysteine-free medium supplemented with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine per ml. After 45 min incubation with radioactive medium (pulse), cells were washed and incubated with methionine/cysteine-containing medium for the indicated time points (chase). Cell extracts were subject to IP as detailed above. ATF2 Associates with TIP60—Ectopically expressed ATF2 and TIP60 were shown to associate following immunoprecipitation of ATF2 (Fig. 1, a and b). Other components of this complex included endogenous TIP49b. Importantly, analysis of the chromatin-bound fraction revealed association of endogenous TIP60 with endogenous ATF2 prior to IR (Fig. 1c). The amount of ATF2 bound to TIP60 significantly decreased following IR (Fig. 1c), although TIP60 levels remained unchanged (Fig. 1d). These findings suggest that ATF2 is part of the TIP60 complex and that association of the two proteins is reduced following IR-induced DNA damage. To map TIP60 domains required for association with ATF2, we generated three TIP60 fragments (Fig. 2a) predicted to retain their original conformation based on the crystal structure of the yeast TIP60 homologue ESA1 (30Yan Y. Barlev N.A. Haley R.H. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1195-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although ATF2 did not interact with the TIP60 N terminus (residues 1-258 amino acids), it efficiently bound to the C terminus (residues 258-531 amino acids), which includes the catalytic MYST domain and the zinc finger region. A significantly weaker association was seen with the fragment containing only the zinc finger region (Fig. 2, b and c), suggesting that association with ATF2 requires TIP60 residues 368-513. Consistent with these findings, an intact TIP60 acetyltransferase domain has also been shown to be required for interaction with the Ets family transcription factor ETV6 (31Putnik J. Zhang C.D. Archangelo L.F. Tizazu B. Bartels S. Kickstein M. Greif P.A. Bohlander S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772: 1211-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that TIP60 associates with ATF2 via the MYST domain. ATF2 Association with TIP60 Decreases TIP60 Steady State Levels Prior to DNA Damage—To assess the role of the ATF2-TIP60 association, we monitored changes in levels of endogenous TIP60 in cells depleted of ATF2 by transfection with corresponding siRNA. ATF2 depletion caused a marked increase in TIP60 protein levels in these cells. Following IR, TIP60 levels increased and the siRNA-mediated inhibition of ATF2 had less affect on TIP60 protein levels (Fig. 3a). Conversely, ectopic expression of ATF2 markedly decreased TIP60 protein levels, an effect blocked by treatment of cells with the 26 S proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 3b, compare lanes 2-4). Overexpression of the RING finger E3 ligase RNF5 as a control did not alter TIP60 levels (Fig. 3c, lane 3), indicating that the effect of ATF2 on TIP60 steady state levels is specific. These data suggest that ATF2 facilitates proteasome-dependent degradation of TIP60. We next examined the effect of ATF2 on TIP60 steady state levels before and after IR by expressing either wild type or a phosphomutant form of ATF2 (490/8 mutant) that cannot be phosphorylated by ATM (8Bhoumik A. Takahashi S. Breitweiser W. Shiloh Y. Jones N. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Whereas wild type ATF2 efficiently decreased TIP60 protein levels before IR (Fig. 3d, lane 2), this effect was reduced following IR (lane 3), which diminished the TIP60-ATF2 interaction (Fig. 1b). The reduction in TIP60 levels caused by ATF2 was blocked following treatment of cells with the 26 S proteasome inhibitor MG132 (lane 6). Conversely, expression of the ATF2 490/8 mutant did not mediate such a decrease prior to IR (Fig. 3d, compare lanes 1, 2, and 4), likely due to reduced association of the mutant form with TIP60 (supplemental Fig. S4, compare lanes 1 and 3). These data imply that even without IR ATF2 may be modified on ATM phosphoacceptor sites, albeit to a low level due to spontaneous damage and/or replication stress, and that such a modification may affect its ability to regulate TIP60 stability. Earlier studies pointed to the role of MDM2 in the regulation of TIP60 stability (23Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Indeed, TIP60 levels were reduced upon re-expression of MDM2 in mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from Mdm2-/-/P53-/- double knock-out mice. Expression of ATF2 also reduced TIP60 protein levels in the absence of Mdm2 (Fig. 3e). These data suggest that MDM2 is not required for the ATF2 effect on TIP60 stability. Cul3 Is Required for ATF2-dependent Effect on TIP60 Stability—To search for candidate ligases that cooperate with ATF2 to reduce TIP60 stability, we employed the WebQTL data base, which consists of multiscale integration networks of genes, transcripts, and traits. This analysis ranked the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin3 (Cul3) (32van den Heuvel S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R59-R61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with high probability of being functionally linked with ATF2. To test for an association between TIP60 and Cul3, cells were transfected with FLAG-TIP60 and Myc Cul3. Immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibodies followed by immunoblotting with Myc antibodies revealed association between exogenous TIP60 and Cul3 (Fig. 4a). Ectopic expression of FLAG-ATF2 and Myc-Cul3 identified an association between ATF2 and Cul3 (Fig. 4b). Because Cul3 is a scaffold protein of the E3 ligase complex that forms a catalytic core complex with ROC1/Rbx1/Hrt1 (32van den Heuvel S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R59-R61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we assessed the effect of Cul3 combined with ROC1 and/or ATF2 on TIP60 stability. Whereas Cul3 expression caused a moderate decrease in TIP60 levels, co-expression with ROC1 caused a marked decrease in TIP60 steady state expression levels (Fig. 4c, compare lanes 2 and 3). ATF2 expression caused a marked decrease in TIP60 protein levels (Fig. 4c, lane 4). However, addition of ATF2 to the Cul3/ROC1 complex did not promote a further decrease in TIP60 levels over that seen with Cul3/ROC1 alone, possibly due to high expression of endogenous ATF2 in these cells. These data suggest that Cul3, in concert with ROC1, contributes to TIP60 degradation. We next asked whether Cul3 is required for an ATF2-dependent decrease in TIP60 stability. Inhibiting Cul3 expression by Cul3 siRNA increased endogenous TIP60 levels (Fig. 4d, compare lanes 1 and 2). TIP60 levels increased after IR (Fig. 4d, lane 3) and inhibiting Cul3 expression no longer had any effect on endogenous TIP60 levels (Fig. 4d, compare lanes 3 and 4). These data suggest that Cul3 controls the levels of TIP60, but following IR, when interactions between ATF2 and TIP60 are reduced, Cul3 has little effect on TIP60 levels. Whereas Cul3 siRNA treatment was not sufficient to antagonize higher levels of overexpressed TIP60 (Fig. 4e), inhibiting Cul3 expression did attenuate the effect of ATF2 on TIP60 levels (Fig. 4e, compare lanes 7 and 8). These findings suggest that Cul3 is required for ATF2 to promote TIP60 degradation. To directly address whether ATF2 is required for the effect of Cul3 on endogenous TIP60, we monitored changes in Cul3/ROC1-mediated TIP60 degradation in cells by decreasing endogenous ATF2 levels with siRNA. Although Cul3 and ROC1 expression markedly decreased TIP60 protein levels (Fig. 4f, compare lanes 1 and 2), this effect was blocked by ATF2 depletion, which further increased TIP60 protein levels (Fig. 4f, compare lanes 2 and 3). This finding suggests that the Cul3/ROC1 effect on TIP60 stability is indeed ATF2-dependent. Cul3-mediated Degradation of TIP60 Is Attenuated after IR—Because ATF2 and TIP60 association was reduced after IR, and given the role of ATF2 in the DNA damage response, we next compared the effect of ATF2 on TIP60 stability with and without IR. Given the role of Cul3 in mediating ATF2 effects and the fact that the maximal effects were seen upon expression of ROC1/Cul3/ATF2, this comparison was carried out following co-expression of these proteins. TIP60 half-life was markedly decreased by ATF2/Cul3/ROC1 expression in unirradiated cells (t½ approximately 75 min) but not in irradiated cells (half-life >3 h; Fig. 5, a and b). Although ATF2 expression increased following IR (Fig. 5a) it no longer affected TIP60 stability, likely a result of post-translational modifications induced by IR (Fig. 3d). To determine whether increases in endogenous TIP60 protein levels in the absence of ATF2 or Cul3 are attributable to increased TIP60 stability within the chromatin-bound fraction, we monitored TIP60 protein half-life in chromatin fractions. Immunoprecipitation of TIP60 from 35S-labeled cells transfected with control siRNA, ATF2 siRNA, or Cul3 siRNA was performed at the indicated time points following pulse labeling. Chromatin-bound TIP60 exhibited a longer half-life in cells inhibited for ATF2 or Cul3 expression, compared with the control siRNA (Fig. 5, c-f). Moreover, TIP60 half-life increased following irradiation but was no longer affected following inhibition of ATF2 or Cul3 expression. Change in the migration of TIP60 seen at later time points may represent an ATF2-dependent modification (Fig. 5f). These results suggest that the half-life of chromatin-bound TIP60 is regulated by ATF2 and Cul3 prior to but not after irradiation. Analysis of endogenous TIP60 levels confirmed an increase in their expression following IR or upon inhibition of ATF2 expression by siRNA. Following IR, ATF2 association with TIP60 was reduced and its ability to affect TIP60 stability attenuated. The latter observation explains why overexpression of Cul3 and ROC1 (in presence of endogenous ATF2) no longer reduces TIP60 levels after IR (Fig. 5g, compare lanes 5 and 6). The effect of ATF2 on TIP60 was also observed in cytological assays. Because we could not detect endogenous TIP60 using available antibodies, analysis was carried out using exogenously expressed proteins. TIP60 staining was seen in punctuate nuclear foci, which increased upon exposure to IR (Fig. 6a, compare panels a and c). TIP60 protein levels were reduced upon co-expression of ATF2 before IR but not in irradiated cells (Fig. 6a, compare panels a and b). Interestingly, TIP60 levels after IR were higher in the presence of ATF2 (Fig. 6a, compare panels b and d). TIP60 protein levels were detected in 10% of cells analyzed following ectopic expression of ATF2 versus 40% seen in control vector-expressing cells under non-stressed conditions. These data confirm that the effect of ATF2 on TIP60 stability is seen prior to IR and imply that ATF2 may elicit other changes on TIP60 following IR. ATF2 Affects TIP60 HAT Activity—Because association between ATF2 and TIP60 required the catalytic MYST domain of TIP60, we next determined the effect of ATF2 on TIP60 HAT activity. Analysis was carried out on chromatin-bound fractions prepared from cells before and after IR exposure. Co-expression of ATF2 and TIP60 in 293T cells resulted in ∼50% inhibition of HAT activity in immunopurified TIP60 prior to IR and increased HAT activity by ∼20% after IR (Fig. 6b). These data suggest that elevated ATF2 levels affect TIP60 HAT activity before and after IR. Because the TIP60 levels were equal in each of these assays, the effect of ATF2 on TIP60 activity is likely to be independent of its contribution to TIP60 stability.

Despite intensive experimental studies, no three-dimensional model of BTZ binding is available. Here we have built KvAP- and KcsA-based models of the Cav1.2 pore domain in the open and closed states and used multiple Monte Carlo minimizations to dock representative ligands. In our open channel model, key functional groups of BTZs interact with BTZ-sensing residues, which were identified in previous mutational experiments.

In the closed channel model, contacts with several ligand-sensing residues in the inner helices are lost, which weakens ligand-channel interactions. An important feature of the ligand-binding mode in both open and closed channels is an interaction between the BTZ carbonyl group and a Ca2+ ion chelated by the selectivity filter glutamates in domains III and IV. In the absence of Ca2+, the tricyclic BTZ moiety remains in the domain interface, while the ammonium group directly interacts with a glutamate residue in the selectivity filter. Our model suggests that the Ca2+ potentiation involves a direct electrostatic interaction between aCa2+ ion and the ligand rather than an allosteric mechanism.

Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 361-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lacinova L. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 2005; 1: 1-78Google Scholar). Tonic (resting) block of Ca2+ channels is usually measured by applying infrequent depolarization stimuli. Frequency-dependent block is measured during more rapid trains of depolarization stimuli. Increasing the stimulation frequency generally leads to more effective inhibition by BTZs (3Lee K.S. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1983; 302: 790-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 4Uehara A. Hume J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 85: 621-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Herzig S. Lullmann H. Sieg H. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 71: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Voltage and activation dependence of the block are consistent with the idea that different functional states of the channel have different affinities for the drug in the order inactivated > open > closed state. These observations are consistent with the “modulated receptor” hypothesis (6Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 69: 497-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar), which was initially proposed to explain the action of local anesthetics on Na+ channels. The effect of BTZs also depends on the ionic environment. Raising concentrations of Ca2+ or Ba2+ antagonize diltiazem block (3Lee K.S. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1983; 302: 790-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). However, the block is more pronounced when Ca2+ rather than Ba2+ is used as a charge carrier (3Lee K.S. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1983; 302: 790-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 7Dilmac N. Hillard N. Hockerman J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and thus the block is considered potentiated by Ca2+ (7Dilmac N. Hillard N. Hockerman J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The conductance with Ba2+ is higher than with Ca2+, because Ca2+ binds more tightly to the outer-pore glutamates (8Almers W. McCleskey E.W. J. Physiol. 1984; 353: 585-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). These experiments suggest that the high affinity binding of BTZs requires a cation binding in the channel. Extracellular applications of both the tertiary and quaternary BTZ analogs effectively block Ca2+ channels. In contrast, intracellular application of the same compounds does not result in significant block, leading to the conclusion that BTZs block the channels via an extracellular pathway (9Seydl K. Kimball D. Schindler H. Romanin C. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 424: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Kurokawa J. Adachi-Akahane S. Nagao T. Mol.

Mutational studies have largely delimited BTZ-sensing residues to the inner helices and P-loops of domains III and IV (see Table 1). However, applying experimental data for mapping the BTZ receptor is complicated because of unequal effects of mutations on different drugs and different characteristics of the block. For example, residue I4i8 in position 8 of the inner helix of domain IV (see footnote 3We use a residue-labeling scheme, which is universal for P-loop channels. A residue label includes the domain (repeat) number (1Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Mutations F3i22A and V3i23A reduce diltiazem block, which was considered to slow inactivation kinetics and accelerate the recovery of the V3i23A mutant from drug blockade (13Kraus L.R. Hering S.

The selectivity filter mutations do not alter diltiazem block of closed channels in Ba2+ but disrupt frequency-dependent block and potentiation by Ca2+ (7Dilmac N. Hillard N. Hockerman J.H. Mol.

The structure-activity relationships (SARs) of BTZs have been rigorously analyzed in many previous studies (e.g. Refs. 14Floyd D.M. Kimball S.D. Krapcho J. Das J. Turk C.F. J. Med.

Malley M.F. Laud W.F. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1993; 1: 285-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Blocking potency is affected by the configurations of the chiral centers and any modification of the substituents of the BTZ rings. These SAR data provide a pharmacophore model but do not provide detailed information on how specific BTZ modifications affect the electrophysiological characteristics of block. Despite numerous studies, the atomic level mechanism of action of BTZs remains unclear. A particularly intriguing question is why BTZs do not block the channel from the cytoplasm despite mutations of many pore-facing residues affect the channel blockade. Molecular determinants of the state dependence of drug action also remain unresolved. The effect of Ca2+ potentiation of the block is another puzzle: divalent cations antagonize BTZ binding (19Galizzi J.P. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but the presence of Ca2+ in the selectivity filter is required for maximal drug effectiveness. Current knowledge about the BTZ action in Ca2+ channels suffers from the lack of structural models that can integrate results of mutational analysis, SAR data, and other experimental observations. There are several reasons for this situation. First, the structure of the L-type Ca2+ channel at the atomic resolution is still unavailable. Second, BTZs are complex molecules with many different functional groups. Third, the BTZ action is also complex: it involves tonic and state-dependent block and potentiation by Ca2+. Combination of these factors precluded elaborating a reliable model of BTZ receptor so far. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to obtain insights into the BTZ mechanism of action from the viewpoint of structural analysis. The L-type Ca2+ channel model for analysis in this study consists of transmembrane segments S5 and S6 and P-loops contributed by each of four repeats (I, II, III, and IV) of Cav1.2 (Table 1). Among available x-ray structures of the open K+ channels (MthK, KvAP, and Kv1.2), we have chosen KvAP (20Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar) as a template. Like Ca2+ channels, KvAP is a voltage-gated channel whose inner helices lack the PVP motif, which affects the open pore geometry. The closed channel was modeled using the KcsA structure (21Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar) as a template. When viewed from the extracellular side, domains I-IV are arranged clockwise around the pore axis (22Dudley Jr., S.C. Chang N. Hall J. Lipkind G. Fozzard H.A. French R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Extracellular linkers are far from the BTZ binding site and, thus, were not included in our model. The sequences of P-loops and inner helices were aligned as in Refs. 23Zhorov B.S. Tikhonov D.B. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 782-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar and 24Zhorov B.S. Folkman E.V. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 22-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar. The sequences of the outer helices were aligned as proposed by Huber et al. (25Huber I. Wappl E. Herzog A. Mitterdorfer J. Glossmann H. Langer T. Striessnig J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The conformational energy expression included van der Waals, electrostatic, H-bonding, hydration, and torsion components, as well as the energy of deformation of the ligands' bond angles. Hydration energy was calculated by the implicit-solvent method (26Lazaridis T. Karplus M. Proteins. 1999; 35: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Nonbonded interactions were calculated using the AMBER force field version (27Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Chio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4895) Google Scholar, 28Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Nguen D.T. Case D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3604) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the implicit-solvent approach. More recent versions of the AMBER force field were parameterized for explicit-waters environment. A large number of degrees of freedom associated with explicit waters would reduce efficiency of the Monte Carlo minimization (MCM) method, which we use in this study (see below). To take into account that atomic charges may be screened by water molecules, electrostatic interactions were calculated with a distance- and solvation-dependent dielectric function, ϵ = d·(4-3s), where d is the distance between interacting atoms and s is a screening factor calculated using a modified algorithm of Lazaridis and Karplus (26Lazaridis T. Karplus M. Proteins. 1999; 35: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). The screening factor value varies from 0 for a pair of water-exposed atoms to 1 for a pair of protein-buried atoms. All ionizable residues were modeled in their neutral forms except for the selectivity filter glutamates in position p50 of the P-loops. Nonbonded interactions were truncated at distances >8 Å. This cutoff distance speeds up calculations without noticeable decrease in the precision of energy calculations (29Bruhova I. Zhorov B.S. BMC Struct. Biol. 2007; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cutoff was not applied to electrostatic interactions involving Ca2+ ions and ionized groups; these interactions were computed at all distances. The energy was minimized in the space of generalized coordinates, which include all torsion angles, bond angles of the ligand, positions of ions, and positions and orientations of root atoms of free molecules (30Zhorov B.S. J. Struct. Chem. 1981; 22: 4-8Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Energy minimizations were terminated when the energy gradient became <1 kcal mol-1 rad-1. The channel models were optimized by the MCM method (31Li Z. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6611-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Complexes of the channel with ions and ligands were searched using a multi-MCM method described in our recent report (32Tikhonov D.B. Zhorov B.S. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1557-1570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Calculations were performed using the ZMM program. Model Building—The starting backbone geometry of the open and closed channel models was taken from the KvAP and KcsA K+ channels, respectively. The all-trans conformations were used as starting approximations for side chains of residues that mismatched between the K+ channel templates and Cav1.2. Previous mutations in the selectivity filter DEKA locus rendered Na+ channel Ca2+ selectivity (33Heinemann S.H. Terlau H. Stuhmer W. Imoto K. Numa S. Nature. 1992; 356: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). These results indicate that there is likely a similar folding of the selectivity filter region of Cav1.2, channel, which has a ring of four glutamates (EEEE) in place of DEKA in Na+ channels. Given the similarity, we modeled the backbones of the ascending limbs in P-loops of Cav1.2 using our previously reported tetrodotoxin receptor model of Na+ channel (34Tikhonov D.B. Zhorov B.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 184-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This choice of the starting point was not critical for the present study, because BTZs do not bind in the outer pore. The coordination pattern of Ca2+ ions in the EEEE ring is unknown. Asymmetric split (24Zhorov B.S. Folkman E.V. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 22-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and symmetric single-file (35Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6786-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) models were considered. Recent calculations predict that both models are energetically possible (36Cheng R.C. Zhorov B.S. Biophys. J. 2008; 94 (3147-Pos)PubMed Google Scholar). However, because substitutions of individual selectivity filter glutamates have unequal effects on BTZ binding (7Dilmac N. Hillard N. Hockerman J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we used the split model in this study with the following coordination pattern: E1p50:Ca2+:E2p50 and E3p50:Ca2+:E4p50. The channel models in the open and closed states were optimized by MCM trajectories, which were terminated when 10,000 consecutive energy minimizations did not improve the energy of the apparent global minimum. Random Docking—For the ligand-docking computational experiments we have chosen one of the most potent BTZ derivatives, SQ32910 (14Floyd D.M. Kimball S.D. Krapcho J. Das J. Turk C.F. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 756-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Kimball S.D. Hunt J.T. Barrish J.C. Das J. Floyd D.M. Lago M.W. Lee V.G. Spergel S.H. Moreland S. Hedberg S.A. Gougoutas J.Z. Malley M.F. Laud W.F. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1993; 1: 285-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Random docking of the ligand in the open channel was performed using the multi-MCM method as described previously (29Bruhova I. Zhorov B.S. BMC Struct. Biol. 2007; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Tikhonov D.B. Zhorov B.S. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1557-1570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The resulting low energy structures fall into two categories in which the BTZ rings occur either in the inner pore (Fig. 1, A and B) or in the III/IV domain interface (Fig. 1, C and D). The ligand-channel interaction energy is most favorable when the BTZ rings are in the III/IV domain interface. However, the energy difference between the binding modes is not significant enough to favor the domain-interface model based on the energetics alone. More importantly, ligand binding in the III/IV domain interface correlates better with available data on BTZ-sensing residues and with the proposed access pathway of the drug to the binding site as discussed below. The models with the BTZ rings in the inner pore cannot easily explain why the BTZ binding site is accessible form the outside but not the inside the cell. It should be noted that, in these models, the ligand interacts with all four S6 segments, but some BTZ-sensing residues in the domain interface do not contact the drug molecule (Fig. 1, A and B) (Structure 1).STRUCTURE 1SQ32910View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Energy Profile—The experimental data on the sidedness of BTZ action and on BTZ-sensing residues evidence that BTZs access their binding site through the III/IV domain interface. The inner pore of K+ channels has four radial niches between neighboring S6 segments and P-helices. Mutations in these niches affect binding of some K+ channel blockers (37Dreker T. Grissmer S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 966-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 38Madeja M. Leicher T. Friederich P. Punke M.A. Haverkamp W. Musshoff U. Breithardt G. Speckmann E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In homology models of Na+ and Ca2+ channels several residues, which control access of drugs to the inner pore, line a hypothetical access pathway (34Tikhonov D.B. Zhorov B.S. Biophys.

Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that overlaps with the niche between domains III and IV. The pathway is wide enough to allow drug access to the inner pore (40Tikhonov D.B. Bruhova I. Zhorov B.S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We calculated the energy profile for SQ32910 pulled with steps of 1 Å along the proposed pathway parallel to the IIIP helical axis from a starting position outside the channel toward the inner pore (Fig. 2). The energy was Monte Carlo-minimized at each position of the profile. During energy minimizations the ligand retained all internal degrees of freedom and five of the six rigid-body degrees of freedom. The pulled atom Nsp2 was constrained to a plane normal to the IIIP helical axis. To prevent flip-flop of the ligand, the flat-bottomed energy constraints were imposed at each position of the profile to keep atom Nsp3 closer to the pore axis than atom Nsp2 and the angle between line Nsp2-Nsp3, and the IIIP helical axis was retained within 0 ± 90°. In the final point of the profile (at 30 Å), atom Nsp2 is positioned at the pore axis. van der Waals interaction energy is negative all along the pathway (Fig. 2A) indicating the absence of steric hindrances. The lowest van der Waals energy was observed in the narrowest part of the pathway whose cross-sectional dimensions are similar to the drug width. The electrostatic component of the interaction energy is slightly negative at the beginning of the pathway, and a small electrostatic barrier is present between positions 12 and 20. This barrier is due to repulsion between the ligand ammonium group and the Ca2+ ion chelated by E3p50 and E4p50. To reach the inner pore, the ammonium group passes as close as 7 Å from the Ca2+ ion. Just after the barrier, the electrostatic interactions have a minimum of -13.2 kcal/mol. Two types of interactions are responsible for the minimum. First, the ligand carbonyl oxygen approaches the Ca2+ ion and binds to it. Second, the ammonium group is located at the focus of P-helices with nucleophilic C-ends. This region in P-loop channels accommodates inorganic (21Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

A sharp maximum at positions 22 and 23 corresponds to the location where the drug replaces water molecules of the Ca2+ inner hydration shell. The dehydration energy cost is partially compensated by the electrostatic attraction between the drug and the Ca2+ ion. Beyond position 23, all interactions weaken because the drug enters the wider inner pore and looses tight contacts with the III/IV domain interface. Notably, the energetically optimal position 22, which is marked on the plot by the vertical line, corresponds to the interface-binding mode obtained by the random docking protocol. Characteristics of BTZ Binding in the Domain Interface—Intensive multi-MCM docking of the ligand in the III/IV domain interface provided an ensemble of 42 low energy complexes (Fig. 3). The scheme of ligand-channel interactions (Fig. 4A) shows the most conservative features of the ensemble: (i) interaction of the carbonyl oxygen with the Ca2+ ion chelated by E3p50 and E4p50, (ii) location of the ammonium group in the inner pore, at the focus of P-helices, and (iii) location of the BTZ rings in the III/IV domain interface that contains BTZ-sensing residues. Importantly, in our model the Ca2+ ion is the only electrophile that can interact with the carbonyl oxygen of BTZ. Furthermore, in the presence of Ca2+ in the selectivity filter, the only attractive site for the ligand ammonium group is the focus of P-helices. In the majority of structures, the ammonium group is not exactly in the focus but lies close in the vicinity.FIGURE 4Specific ligand-channel interactions of the interface binding mode. A, structure of SQ32910 and scheme of specific interactions; B, intracellular view showing that F3p49 forms cation-pi contact with the ligand ammonium group, whereas F3i22 and ring B of the ligand stack face-to-face. C, side view with domain II and transmembrane helices of domain III removed for clarity. The carbonyl oxygen of the ligand binds to the Ca2+ ion chelated by E3p50 and E4p50, whereas methoxy oxygen forms an H-bond with the side chain of Y4i11.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Despite individual low energy structures belong to the same ensemble, they differ by details of particular interactions. The methoxyphenyl group interacts with Y4i11 (Fig. 4B). Two types of interaction have been found: (i) face-to-face attraction of the aromatic rings and (ii) an H-bond between the methoxy oxygen and the side-chain hydroxyl of Y4i11 with the aromatic rings approaching each other in the edge-to-face manner. The methyl group in position 3 of the seven-membered ring faces residues A4i15 and I4i18 in the majority of structures. Thus, all three residues of the YAI motif, forming what is known as a fingerprint of the BTZ recognition site (1Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 361-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), significantly interact with the ligand. Ring B of the ligand interacts mainly with F3i22 in the face-to-face (Fig. 4A) or edge-to-face (not shown) manner. The CF3 group, which has lipophilic properties (43Yale H.L. J. Med. Pharm. Chem. 1959; 1: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), faces the III/IV domain interface. Interaction of F3p49 at the P-loop turn with the drug varies significantly between low energy structures, because in our model the alpha carbon of F3p49 was not constrained to the template. The aromatic side chain of F3p49 can participate in pi-cation interactions with a hydrated Ca2+ ion or with the ammonium group of the ligand (Fig. 4B). In some structures, F3p49 interacts with ring B of the drug in a face-to-face manner. Residues providing strong contributions to the ligand-receptor energy are underlined in Table 1. In the proposed binding mode, the drug does not interact directly with residues I3i8, I3i11, I3i14, and I4i8, which were experimentally demonstrated to affect the action of BTZ. However, residues I3i14 and I4i8 contribute significantly to the drug-channel energy along the access pathway (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, among experimentally defined BTZ-sensing residues, only I3i8 and I3i11 do not contribute directly to the BTZ binding site or the access pathway. These particular residues could affect BTZ binding allosterically. In our model, SQ32910 significantly interacts with residues F3p44 and T3p48 in the domain interface. Mutational studies suggest that F3p44 interacts with dihydropyridines (39Yamaguchi S. Zhorov B.S. Yoshioka K. Nagao T. Ichijo H. Adachi-Akahane S. Mol.

The mechanisms governing lineage choices of hES cells are largely unknown. Here, we report that we established two independent hES cell clones lacking a group of cell surface molecules, glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). The GPI-AP deficiency in these two hES clones is due to the deficiency in the gene expression of PIG-A (phosphatidyl-inositol-glycan class A), which is required for the first step of GPI synthesis. GPI-AP-deficient hES cells were capable of forming embryoid bodies and initiating cell differentiation into the three embryonic germ layers. However, GPI-AP-deficient hES cells failed to form trophoblasts after differentiation induction by embryoid body formation or by adding exogenous BMP4. The defect in trophoblast formation was due to the lack of GPI-anchored BMP coreceptors, resulting in the impairment of full BMP4 signaling activation in the GPI-AP-deficient hES cells. These data reveal that GPI-AP-enhanced full activation of BMP signaling is required for human trophoblast formation."

https://openalex.org/W2055896653,"Background Normal cell division is coordinated by a bipolar mitotic spindle, ensuring symmetrical segregation of chromosomes. Cancer cells, however, occasionally divide into three or more directions. Such multipolar mitoses have been proposed to generate genetic diversity and thereby contribute to clonal evolution. However, this notion has been little validated experimentally. Principal Findings Chromosome segregation and DNA content in daughter cells from multipolar mitoses were assessed by multiphoton cross sectioning and fluorescence in situ hybridization in cancer cells and non-neoplastic transformed cells. The DNA distribution resulting from multipolar cell division was found to be highly variable, with frequent nullisomies in the daughter cells. Time-lapse imaging of H2B/GFP-labelled multipolar mitoses revealed that the time from the initiation of metaphase to the beginning of anaphase was prolonged and that the metaphase plates often switched polarity several times before metaphase-anaphase transition. The multipolar metaphase-anaphase transition was accompanied by a normal reduction of cellular cyclin B levels, but typically occurred before completion of the normal separase activity cycle. Centromeric AURKB and MAD2 foci were observed frequently to remain on the centromeres of multipolar ana-telophase chromosomes, indicating that multipolar mitoses were able to circumvent the spindle assembly checkpoint with some sister chromatids remaining unseparated after anaphase. Accordingly, scoring the distribution of individual chromosomes in multipolar daughter nuclei revealed a high frequency of nondisjunction events, resulting in a near-binomial allotment of sister chromatids to the daughter cells. Conclusion The capability of multipolar mitoses to circumvent the spindle assembly checkpoint system typically results in a near-random distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells. Spindle multipolarity could thus be a highly efficient generator of genetically diverse minority clones in transformed cell populations."

However, macroscopic TRESK current still could not be reliably separated from the current of other 2PK+ channels in the absence of specific inhibitors.We have recently demonstrated that TRESK is regulated in a unique manner. The channel, expressed heterologously in Xenopus oocytes, is reversibly activated by calcium via the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin. Serine 276 was identified as the likely target of calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation in the channel (15Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol.

The other six 14-3-3 isoforms were amplified with Pfu polymerase (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) from mouse brain RNA after reverse transcription, applying the m14-3-3x-s/m14-3-3x-a primer pairs (where x stands for β, γ, ∈, ζ, σ and τ, respectively). The PCR protocol was 2 min initial denaturation at 98 °C, 34 cycles of 30-s denaturation at 98 °C, 1 min annealing, 80–90-s extension at 72 °C, and 5 min final extension at 72 °C; the annealing temperature was 64, 61, 59, and 56 °C in the first 3, second 3, third 3, and final 25 cycles, respectively. The products were digested at the respective restriction enzyme sites (see supplemental Table 1) and ligated to EcoRI/XhoI double-digested pXEN. The dominant negative versions of these isoforms (R58A,R62A β; R57A,R61A γ; R57A,R61A ∈; R56A,R60A ζ; R56A,R60A σ, and RA56,R60A τ) were produced with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (see the sequences of the sense primers in supplemental Table 1). The resulting clones were verified by automatic sequencing.The construction of the GST-TRESKloop-TAPtag fusion protein was described previously (19Czirják G. Enyedi P. J. Biol.

The GST-h14-3-3η constructs were obtained by subcloning the EcoRI/XhoI inserts of wild type and dominant negative h14-3-3η (see above) to pGEX-6P-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The thioredoxin-hexahistidine-h14-3-3η (Trx-His6-h14-3-3η) plasmids were produced by ligating the above inserts to the EcoRI/XhoI double-digested pET32-ΔKpn vector (pET32-ΔKpn derived from pET32a+ (Novagen, Madison, WI) by digesting the plasmid with KpnI, polishing its sticky ends with Klenow polymerase, and religating). To produce the TRESKloop-H8 construct, the DNA coding for amino acids 185–292 of mouse TRESK was amplified by two consecutive rounds of PCR with the mTRloop-s/mTRloop-H8-a1 and mTRloop-s/mTRloop-H8-a2 primer combinations. The PCR product (coding also the C-terminal eight histidines) was double-digested with NcoI/XhoI and ligated to pET15b (Novagen). The 10 serines and 1 threonine of TRESKloop-H8 were sequentially mutated to alanine in different combinations by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to obtain the proteins containing only 1, 2, or 3 serines in the desired patterns (see the sense primers used for the mutations in supplemental Table 1).Animals, Tissue Preparation, Xenopus Oocyte Microinjection, and Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Measurements—The tissues for RNA preparation derived from NMRI mouse strain (Toxicop).

The experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of Semmelweis University.Production and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The GST fusion constructs were expressed in the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli. Bacteria were sonicated in G-lysis solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm benzamidine. The lysate was centrifuged, and the GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified from the supernatant with glutathione-agarose (Sigma). In the GST pulldown experiments, these immobilized proteins were used. For other experiments, the proteins were eluted from the resin with G-lysis supplemented with 20 mm glutathione and dialyzed against a solution containing 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.4 with NaOH).The bacteria expressing the thioredoxin-His-tag fusion proteins were lysed in N-lysis solution containing 30 mm phosphate, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, 0.2 mm benzamidine, 5 mm imidazole, 5.6 mm β-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.8 with NaOH). The proteins were affinity-purified with Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The resin was washed 6 times for 5 min with 12 ml of N-lysis solution (in the second and third pairs of washing steps, the imidazole concentration of N-lysis solution was increased to 20 and 50 mm, respectively). The proteins were eluted with N-lysis containing 256 mm imidazole and dialyzed against a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol.TRESKloop-H8 proteins (wild type and multiple mutants) accumulated in inclusion bodies; therefore, these proteins were purified under denaturing conditions. The inclusion bodies were dissolved at room temperature in IB-lysis solution containing 30 mm phosphate, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole, 7000 mm urea (pH 7.8 with NaOH). TRESKloop-H8 proteins were purified with Ni-NTA-agarose from this solution. The resin was washed (at room temperature) 3 times with IB-lysis solution of increased (50 mm) imidazole concentration, once with IB-lysis, twice with IB-lysis of pH 5.5, and once again with IB-lysis. TRESKloop-H8 proteins immobilized on Ni-NTA resin were stored as a 50% suspension in IB-lysis solution at 4 °C.In Vitro Radioactive Phosphorylation—For the preparation of Xenopus oocyte cytosol, ≈1 g of ovarian lobes was homogenized in 1 ml of a solution containing 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm para-nitrophenylphosphate, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm PMSF, 0.2 mm benzamidine, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole supplemented with cyclosporine A (5 μm), FK506 (1 μm), leupeptin (0.5 mg/ml), aprotinin (0.5 mg/ml), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml, Sigma, type IIS), pH adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH. The lysate was centrifuged 3 times at 16,000 × g for 10 min and always the middle phase (supernatant above the insoluble pellet and below the lipid layer at the surface) was taken to the next centrifugation. The cleared supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose (200 μl) to deplete the proteins binding nonspecifically to this resin.TRESKloop-H8 proteins immobilized on 12–25 μl of Ni-NTA resin were washed 3 times with EQ solution containing 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.2 with NaOH) 20 min before the phosphorylation reaction. The immobilized proteins were phosphorylated at room temperature for 40 min in the presence of 100 μl of Xenopus oocyte cytosol and 1 MBq [γ-32P]ATP with continuous shaking. The proteins were run on 15% SDS-PAGE gels, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and their radioactivity was detected with phosphorimaging (GS-525, Bio-Rad). The phosphorylation with protein kinase A holoenzyme (protein kinase A (PKA), 1 μg/reaction, Sigma P5511, 0.7 units/μg) was performed at 37 °C for 30 min in a solution containing 20 mm HEPES, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm cAMP (pH 7.5 with NaOH) supplemented with 50 μm Na2ATP and 50 kBq [γ-32P]ATP.GST and His-tag Pulldown Assays—The immobilized GST fusion proteins were phosphorylated overnight with PKA at 37 °C in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1.3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm cAMP, and 5 mm Na2ATP supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. The resins were washed twice with 0.2 ml G-binding solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. In the GST pulldown assay (with the Trx-His6-h14-3-3η proteins) the 1-h binding reaction was performed at 4 °C by rotating the beads in G binding solution containing 1% Triton X-100. The unbound proteins were removed by two washing steps (each 1 min) with 1 ml of G binding solution (+1% Triton X-100 in the first step).For His-tag pulldown assays, the different immobilized TRESKloop-H8 proteins were washed 3 times with H-phos solution containing 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.5 with NaOH). The proteins were phosphorylated overnight with PKA at 37 °C in H-phos solution supplemented with 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm Na2ATP, 1 mm cAMP, and 200 μm sodium orthovanadate (pH 7.5 with NaOH). The His-tag pulldown assays (of the GST-h14-3-3η proteins) were performed in H-binding solution containing 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 30 mm imidazole (pH 7.4 with NaOH).RESULTS14-3-3 Proteins Determine the Recovery of TRESK Current from the Calcium-dependent Activation—The intracellular loop of mouse TRESK contains two putative 14-3-3 binding sites (KWRSLP194 and RSNSCP266, identified with Motif Scan). Assuming that 14-3-3 is really anchored to either of these sites in TRESK, it is reasonable to expect that 14-3-3 is also involved in a function related to the background K+ channel. Therefore, we examined whether the experimental manipulation of the cellular level of 14-3-3 proteins modified the functional properties of TRESK. Because the coexpression of 14-3-3η with mouse or human TRESK did not influence the resting TRESK current (data not shown), we tested whether 14-3-3 modulated the calcium-dependent regulation of the channel.We have previously reported (15Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, induced a large (5–15-fold) activation of TRESK current expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The calcium-dependent activation was reversible after the cessation of the calcium signal, but the return of the background K+ current to its resting state (decrease in the current, hereafter called “recovery,” Fig. 1A) varied widely among the different oocyte preparations (e.g. the recovery was 20 ± 3% (n = 6) after 5 min in one oocyte preparation, whereas it was 73 ± 6% (n = 8) in another). These highly different kinetics of recovery may have reflected different concentrations of endogenous 14-3-3. To detect the effect of 14-3-3 irrespective of the endogenous expression, we experimentally manipulated the functional 14-3-3 levels in both direction for each oocyte preparation. In one of the compared groups of oocytes, the concentration of 14-3-3 was increased by the coexpression of the human 14-3-3η with TRESK. In the other group, the functional 14-3-3 level was reduced by the coexpression of the dominant negative R57A,R61A mutant form of human 14-3-3η with the K+ channel (the literature frequently refers to the dominant negative mutant as R56A,R60A 14-3-3η, although this numbering does not apply to the η isoform). To illustrate the effect of endogenous 14-3-3, we also show the results from oocytes expressing only TRESK (gray curves in Fig. 1).In addition to the conventional normalization of the data to the resting current (“normalized current,” see the legend to Fig. 1A), the same recordings were also presented in another form; they were normalized to the value measured at the end of ionomycin stimulation (normalized recovery, also defined in the legend to Fig. 1A). The latter normalization shows to what degree the activated current returned to the resting level in a given time after the withdrawal of ionomycin.The coexpression of the wild type or the dominant negative 14-3-3 with mouse TRESK had significantly different effects on the activation of the K+ current in one oocyte preparation. The activation was 9.4 ± 0.7-fold (n = 5) at the end of the application of ionomycin in the cells coexpressing the wild type 14-3-3, whereas it was 19.1 ± 2.8-fold (n = 5) in the cells coexpressing the dominant negative 14-3-3 with mouse TRESK (p < 0.02 at 276s(t test), Fig. 1B), indicating that 14-3-3 inhibited the activation of mouse TRESK. However, in another oocyte preparation no significant change in mouse TRESK activation was observed (Fig. 1D). As was also verified by the microinjection of 14-3-3 protein or the immobilization of 14-3-3 to the channel (see below), the activation of mouse TRESK was undoubtedly suppressed by high concentration of 14-3-3. Perhaps this inhibitory effect was not apparent in every coexpression experiment, because it also depended on the level of overexpression of 14-3-3. The activation of human TRESK was not modified by the coexpression of the wild type or the dominant negative 14-3-3η with the channel (Fig. 1F).The recovery of mouse TRESK (see the end of the recordings in Fig. 1, C and E) was reduced to 5 ± 6 and 15 ± 6% in the first and second oocyte preparation (n = 5 and 6), respectively, by the coexpression of wild type 14-3-3η with the channel. In the cells coexpressing the dominant negative 14-3-3 with mouse TRESK, the recovery was 46 ± 1 and 45 ± 4% (n = 5, p < 10–4 and n = 6, p < 0.003) in the two preparations, respectively (Fig. 1, C and E). In general, care must be taken when evaluating the recovery if the activation is also different in the compared groups (as in the first oocyte preparation, see Fig. 1, B and C). However, in this case the rate of recovery in the cells coexpressing the dominant negative 14-3-3 was substantially higher than that in the cells coexpressing the wild type 14-3-3. At the end of the measurement, neither the currents (11.6 ± 1.9 μAinthe wild type and 10.0 ± 1.6 μA in the dominant negative group) nor the normalized currents (9.3 ± 0.8- and 11.0 ± 1.8-fold, respectively, at 591 s in Fig. 1B) were significantly different. Despite this, the rate of recovery (estimated by the slope of the normalized currents at the end of the measurement in Fig. 1B) was about 5-fold higher in the dominant negative than in the wild type group (3.9 ± 1.1 versus 0.8 ± 0.2% of the resting current per second, p < 0.03). Because TRESK expression was nearly equal in the different oocytes in this experiment, the rates calculated even from the original current recordings were significantly different at the end of the measurement (26.3 ± 9.0 and 5.7 ± 3.1 nA/s, p < 0.05, respectively). This clearly indicates that 14-3-3 inhibits the recovery of mouse TRESK in addition to its effect on the activation of the channel. This result was also confirmed by the data obtained in the second oocyte preparation, where the activation was not significantly influenced (Fig. 1D), but the recovery was robustly inhibited by 14-3-3 (Fig. 1E).Although the degree of activation of human TRESK was not affected by 14-3-3, its recovery was inhibited. The recovery was 12 ± 4% in the cells coexpressing the wild type (n = 7), whereas it was 52 ± 6% in the group coexpressing the dominant negative 14-3-3η with the channel (n = 7, p < 0.002 at 483 s, Fig. 1G).In summary, 14-3-3η suppressed the calcium-dependent activation of mouse TRESK (this effect was not significant in all of the examined oocyte preparations). However, the major effect of 14-3-3 was statistically significant in all of our experiments; 14-3-3η inhibited the recovery of both human and mouse TRESK currents.The Effect of 14-3-3η Is Acute and Spatially Restricted to TRESK in the Cell—14-3-3 proteins are known to affect a plethora of cellular functions including the regulation of the cell cycle and gene expression. In the above experiments, a high amount of coexpressed 14-3-3η was present in the oocytes for days (see supplemental Fig. S1). To exclude that gene expression changes or other long term alterations were responsible for the effects of 14-3-3η on TRESK regulation, we examined whether the microinjection of a recombinant 14-3-3 protein also inhibited TRESK recovery similarly to the coexpression of 14-3-3.In this experiment R57A,R61A 14-3-3η was coexpressed with TRESK to reduce the effect of endogenous 14-3-3 proteins. Before the ionomycin application, the cells were microinjected either with wild type GST-14-3-3η or (as a control) with R57A,R61A mutant GST-14-3-3η protein. The activation of mouse TRESK was smaller in the wild type (10.1 ± 1.3-fold, n = 6) than in the R57A,R61A group (19.5 ± 1.2-fold activation (n = 5), p < 0.001 at 213 s, Fig. 2A). The microinjection of GST-14-3-3η also inhibited the return of TRESK current to the resting state (1 ± 10% recovery in the GST-14-3-3η-injected and 41 ± 2% in the GST-14-3-3η-R57A,R61A-injected cells, p < 0.01 at 429s, Fig. 2B). The rate of recovery was also significantly different at the end of the measurement in the two groups (2.8 ± 0.3 and 5.1 ± 0.4% of the resting current per second, respectively, p < 0.01, Fig. 2A; at this time the currents and the normalized currents were not different in the two groups (data not shown)). The same microinjection experiment was also performed with oocytes expressing only mouse TRESK, and the activation and the recovery were also significantly attenuated by the microinjection of wild type GST-14-3-3η in these cells (results not shown).FIGURE 2The microinjection of recombinant GST-h14-3-3η protein inhibits the activation of mouse TRESK and delays the recovery from activation of both human and mouse TRESK channels. A, normalized currents of two groups of oocytes microinjected with 50 nl of GST-h14-3-3η (wild type, wt., black curve) or R57A,R61A mutant GST-h14-3-3η fusion protein (gray curve). The cells were coexpressing mouse TRESK with R57A,R61A 14-3-3η (in both groups). Extracellular [K+] was increased from 2 to 80 mm, and the oocytes were challenged with ionomycin (Iono., 0.5 μm, as indicated by the horizontal black bar) 108–248 min after the microinjection of the proteins. B, normalized recovery was calculated from the same recordings as represented in panel A. C and D, a similar microinjection experiment as in A and B was performed with human TRESK in another oocyte preparation. The proteins were microinjected 188–236 min before the application of ionomycin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res i"

Inhibins regulate these reproductive events by forming high affinity complexes with betaglycan and activin or bone morphogenetic protein type II receptors. In this study, the binding site of inhibin A for betaglycan was characterized using inhibin A mutant proteins. An epitope for high affinity betaglycan binding was detected spanning the outer convex surface of the inhibin α-subunit. Homology modeling indicates that key α-subunit residues (Tyr50, Val108, Thr111, Ser112, Phe118, Lys119, and Tyr120) form a contiguous epitope in this region of the molecule. Disruption of betaglycan binding by the simultaneous substitution of Thr111, Ser112, and Tyr120 to alanine yielded an inhibin A variant that was unable to suppress activin-induced follicle-stimulating hormone release by rat pituitary cells in culture. Together these results indicate that a high affinity interaction between betaglycan and residues Val108–Tyr120 of the inhibin α-subunit mediate inhibin A biological activity.

Their expression is critical for the regulation of fertility based on their dual inhibitory actions on follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion by the pituitary (1Robertson D.M.

Reprod. 1993; 48: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 4Magoffin D.A. Jakimiuk A.J. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 12: 1714-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is recognized that inhibins regulate these reproductive events by inhibiting the stimulatory actions of the structurally related proteins, activins (5Gregory S.J. Kaiser U.B. Semin. Reprod. Med. 2004; 22: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Ramaswamy S. Plant T.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 180: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Inhibins are heterodimers of an 18-kDa α-subunit disulfide-linked to one of two 13-kDa β-subunits (βA and βB), resulting in inhibin A or inhibin B, respectively. Each activin is composed of two β-subunits; βA-βA (activin A), βA-βB (activin AB), and βB-βB (activin B). Although the inhibin A and inhibin B crystal structures have not been determined, based upon sequence identity it is expected that the β-subunits would retain a similar conformation to that observed in the activin A dimer (7Harrington A.E. Morris-Triggs S.A. Ruotolo B.T. Robinson C.V. Ohnuma S. Hyvonen M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, within either β-subunit, two pairs of anti-parallel β-strands, forming a short and a long “finger,” stretch outward from the cysteine knot core of the monomer. At the base of the fingers, each β-subunit forms an α-helix, which together with the prehelix loop, generates the “wrist” region of the molecule (8Greenwald J. Groppe J. Gray P. Wiater E. Kwiatkowski W. Vale W. Choe S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). An interchain disulfide bond between Cys80 of the βA-subunit (Cys79 of the βB-subunit) and Cys95 of the α-subunit covalently connects the two chains of the inhibin dimers. In humans, unlike other species, two molecular mass isoforms of mature inhibin A and B (31 and 34 kDa) have been identified (9Makanji Y. Harrison C.A. Stanton P.G. Krishna R. Robertson D.M. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2309-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This molecular mass heterogeneity is due to the presence of two N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn36 and Asn70 of the α-subunit. Asn36 is always glycosylated (producing 31-kDa inhibin A or B), whereas glycosylation of Asn70 is differentially regulated (producing 34-kDa inhibin A or B) (10Mason A.J. Farnworth P.G. Sullivan J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The presence of a second carbohydrate moiety significantly reduces the biological activity of inhibin A (9Makanji Y. Harrison C.A. Stanton P.G. Krishna R. Robertson D.M. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2309-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that human inhibins may be under more stringent control than inhibins from other species. Inhibins exert their biological effects by antagonizing the actions of TGFβ ligands that utilize activin (ActRII/IIB) or BMP (BMPRII) type II receptors as part of their signaling complex (11Wiater E. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7934-7941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The inhibin residues involved in binding to the type II receptors can be inferred from the crystal structure of activin A bound to ActRIIB (12Thompson T.B. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this structure, the receptor makes contact with the outer convex surface of the finger regions of activin. The activin:ActRIIB interface involves hydrophobic (Ile30, Ala31, Pro32, Pro88, Leu92, Tyr94, and Ile100) and ionic/polar (Arg87, Ser90, Lys102, and Glu111) residues on the βA-subunit. The affinities of the inhibin isoforms for ActRII/IIB are too low to facilitate functional antagonism of activin signaling, suggesting the requirement for a co-receptor to potentiate inhibin actions. Indeed, recent studies have shown that the biological effects of inhibin A are dependent upon interactions with betaglycan, a cell surface proteoglycan that also acts as a TGFβ2 co-receptor (13Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Betaglycan binds inhibin A directly and promotes the formation of a stable high affinity complex involving activin or BMP type II receptors. Sequestration of type II receptors in this way prevents their interactions with signaling ligands such as activins or BMPs. Mutagenesis studies have identified the inhibin-binding site on betaglycan (amino acids 608–620) (14Wiater E. Harrison C.A. Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Vale W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17011-17022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); however, little is known about the regions of inhibin involved in this interaction. Activins do not bind betaglycan, suggesting that binding is mediated by the α-subunit of inhibin. The human inhibin α-subunit is synthesized as a precursor consisting of a 43-amino acid Pro region, a 171-amino acid αN region, and a 134-amino acid αC region (15Mayo K.E. Cerelli G.M. Spiess J. Rivier J. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5849-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2A). In this study, we have identified residues within the mature (αC) region of the inhibin α-subunit essential for binding betaglycan. Mutation of these residues generated inhibin A variants with dramatically reduced biological activity. In addition, we have shown that the binding epitope on inhibin A for betaglycan is conserved across the TGFβ isoforms, providing important information regarding TGFβ receptor assembly. Production of Inhibin A Mutants—An overlapping PCR strategy was utilized to incorporate mutations in the mature region of the full-length human inhibin α-subunit cDNA. Gel-purified PCR products were digested with HindIII and EcoRI and then subcloned into HindIII/EcoRI-digested pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). For each construct, the mutated N-terminal mature region was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Production of mutant inhibins was achieved using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) to transiently transfect CHO cells. Briefly, CHO cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well plate. Wild type or mutant α-subunit DNA (1.6 μg) was combined with 3.3 μg of βA-subunit DNA, and Lipofectamine was added according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 20 min of incubation, DNA-Lipofectamine complexes were added directly to the plates, which were incubated in serum-free Opti-MEM medium for a further 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Inhibin A ELISA—The inhibin A ELISA (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX) was used as described (16Robertson D.M. Stephenson T. Pruysers E. McCloud P. Tsigos A. Groome N. Mamers P. Burger H.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) employing kit reagents provided by Oxford Bio-innovation Ltd. (Upper Heyford, UK). The ELISA utilized the βA-subunit antibody (E4) as capture antibody and α-subunit antibody (R1) as label. Inhibin A immunoreactive preparation (91/624) was used as a reference preparation. The sensitivity of the assay was 2 pg/ml. The between assay variation was 13.1% (n = 4). The mean index of precision (λ) was -0.048. Stable Cell Lines—Inhibin A bicistronic expression vectors encoding the human cDNA for the α- and βA-subunits were constructed using the pIRES plasmid (Clontech, CA). The pIRES plasmid ensures enhanced transcription and translation of the inhibin α-subunit cDNA cloned into the first multiple cloning site over the production of the βA-subunit in the second cloning site, allowing for the preferential production of inhibin A rather than activin A (17Antenos M. Stemler M. Boime I. Woodruff T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1670-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Wild type or selected mutant inhibin α-subunit cDNAs, amplified from pcDNA3.1 inhibin vectors, were inserted into the first multiple cloning site at the NheI/EcoRI sites of pIRES. The cDNA for the full-length inhibin βA-subunit was amplified from pcDNA3.1-βA vector and inserted into the XbaI/NotI sites of the second multiple cloning site of pIRES. CHO cells were transfected with the pIRES-Inhibin A vectors, and cells stably expressing wild type or mutant inhibin A were selected with 500 μg/ml G418. Five or more clones for the expression of each construct were isolated. To produce wild type and mutant inhibin A, stable CHO cell lines were grown to confluence, and then the medium was changed to serum-free Opti-MEM. After 72 h, the conditioned medium was collected and concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Concentrated protein was applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare), and the proteins were eluted in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.4. The inhibin A ELISA, in combination with Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against human inhibin α-subunit (R1), identified fractions containing 31-kDa inhibin A. These fractions were pooled and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with R1 antibody immobilized to an Affi-Gel-Hz support (Bio-Rad). Bound protein was eluted with guanadinium HCl, and 31-kDa inhibin A was further purified on a reverse phase HPLC-solid phase extraction (Vydac) column in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% acetonitrile. Betaglycan Binding Assay—To screen the large number of inhibin A mutants, a high throughput betaglycan binding assay was developed (9Makanji Y. Harrison C.A. Stanton P.G. Krishna R. Robertson D.M. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2309-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS7 cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates. The following day, the cells were transfected with 15 ng of vector (pcDNA3.1) control or betaglycan cDNA using the Lipofectamine transfection reagent and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. To ensure uniform expression of betaglycan, a cell surface ELISA was performed, as previously described (14Wiater E. Harrison C.A. Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Vale W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17011-17022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The cells were washed in binding buffer (DMEM + 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Binding buffer (200 μl) or increasing concentrations of wild type or mutant inhibin A conditioned medium (1–200 pm) were added to the wells, together with 125I-inhibin B (25 μl, 40,000 cpm/well). The differential affinity of the inhibin forms for betaglycan (9Makanji Y. Harrison C.A. Stanton P.G. Krishna R. Robertson D.M. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2309-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) ensured that very low amounts of inhibin A (IC50 1.2 pm) were required to displace 125I-inhibin B. The plates were incubated for 3 h at room temperature, and the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in 1% Triton X-100. Radioactivity was measured using a gamma counter. The binding data were analyzed using the Prism program (version 2.0 from GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). ActRII Binding Assay—To ensure that point mutations that disrupted inhibin A binding to betaglycan did not affect overall protein structure, we utilized an activin type II receptor binding assay. Selected inhibin A mutants were assessed for their ability to displace 125I-inhibin A from 293T cells expressing ActRIIB, as previously described (18Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Fischer W.H. Donaldson C. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28036-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Inhibin A in Vitro Bioassays—Wild type and mutant inhibins were assessed for their ability to suppress the release of FSH by rat pituitary cells in culture or a mouse pituitary gonadotrope cell line (LβT2). The rat pituitary cultures were performed as previously described (19Scott R.S. Burger H.G. Quigg H. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) except FSH release rather than FSH content was used as assay end point. LβT2 cells were plated in 48-well plates at a density of 250,000 cells/well. The cells were allowed to recover for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were then washed with DMEM + 0.2% fetal calf serum and treated with increasing doses of inhibin variants for 24 h in the same medium. FSH levels were determined by a specific rat FSH immunofluorometric assay as previously described (20van Casteren J.I. Schoonen W.G. Kloosterboer H.J. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 886-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) employing reagents kindly provided by A. Grootenhuis and J. Verhagen of (N.V. Organon). The sensitivity of the assay was 12.5 pg/well (human inhibin A immunoreactive preparation). The between assay variation based on the repeated measurement of a purified inhibin preparation was 18.7% (n = 8). The mean index of precision (λ) was -0.078. Homology Modeling of Inhibin A—The inhibin dimer was homology modeled using coordinates from the Protein Data Bank. The inhibin α-subunit was modeled from Protein Data Bank code 2QCQ (21Allendorph G.P. Isaacs M.J. Kawakami Y. Belmonte J.C. Choe S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12238-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas for the inhibin βA-subunit the coordinates from Protein Data Bank code 2ARV (7Harrington A.E. Morris-Triggs S.A. Ruotolo B.T. Robinson C.V. Ohnuma S. Hyvonen M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were utilized. In each case, Swiss model was used to perform the modeling. The dimer was made by superposing the coordinates of the inhibin α- and βA-subunits onto the dimer of Protein Data Bank code 1KTZ using secondary structure matching (22Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar) as implemented in COOT (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar). The figures were produced using PYMOL (24DeLano W.L. Drug Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Selection of Inhibin A Residues for Mutation—In humans, two molecular mass isoforms of mature inhibin A (31 and 34 kDa) have been identified (10Mason A.J. Farnworth P.G. Sullivan J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This molecular mass heterogeneity is due to differential glycosylation of Asn70 of the α-subunit. We initially mutated the inhibin α-subunit (N70Q) to ensure that only 31-kDa inhibin A was produced. This reduced the complexity of the samples to be analyzed, and all subsequent mutations were made in the context of this construct. Two regions of the inhibin α-subunit were identified as potential betaglycan-binding sites: (i) the wrist (Gly64–Pro85) (Fig. 1), based on the fact that glycosylation of Asn70 reduces affinity for betaglycan 20-fold (9Makanji Y. Harrison C.A. Stanton P.G. Krishna R. Robertson D.M. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2309-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); and (ii) finger 2 (Gly101–Leu127) (Fig. 1), because polyclonal antibody 1989 (directed against amino acids 109–122) immunoneutralized inhibin A bioactivity (25Robertson D.M. Stephenson T. Cahir N. Tsigos A. Pruysers E. Stanton P.G. Groome N. Thirunavukarasu P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 180: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Residues through these regions, together with selected amino acids in finger 1 (Phe39–Ser53) of the inhibin α-subunit, were substituted with alanine using in vitro mutagenesis. In all, a set of 41 variants mutated at 50 different positions were generated (Fig. 1). Synthesis and Secretion of Mutant Polypeptides—The mutant proteins were expressed in CHO cells and a set of 36 variants substituted at 45 different positions could be detected in the inhibin A ELISA at levels (3.6–17.1 ng/ml) sufficient for subsequent examination of betaglycan binding (Table 1). The remaining nine variants failed to produce dimeric forms of inhibin A. Western blot analysis indicated that conditioned media from CHO cells transfected with wild type α- and βA-subunits contained both mature (31 kDa) and high molecular mass (65 and 95 kDa) inhibin precursor forms (Fig. 2B, lane 2). In addition, substantial amounts of free α-subunit (50 kDa) were also present. Mutation of residues in the N terminus and wrist regions of the α-subunit did not affect the amount or the composition of the inhibin forms produced by CHO cells (Table 1). In contrast, mutation of residues through the fingers of the α-subunit typically reduced inhibin levels by 50–75%, although the ratio of mature to high molecular forms of dimeric inhibin was maintained (Table 1 and Fig. 2B, lanes 6, 8, and 9). Interestingly, five point mutations in the fingers of the α-subunit (F39A, I48A, P51A, L106A, and V108A) completely abrogated inhibin A expression (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 5, and 7, and data not shown), suggesting that these hydrophobic residues are required for correct folding and dimerization with the β-subunit.TABLE 1List of mutations introduced into the inhibin α-subunit and effects on affinity for betaglycanα-Subunit mutantsInhibin levelsIC50Relative activityng/mlpm% wild typeWild type inhibin A15.31.2 ± 0.3100N terminus A25T13.61.44 ± 0.1484 ± 8dThe percentage of wild type affinity for betaglycan was determined for each inhibin A variant in at least three separate experiments; the values represent the means ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab Betaglycan Binding of Inhibin A Mutants—Based on the structural location of the mutated α-subunit residues, the inhibin A variants generated in this study were separated into three groups and assessed for their ability to displace 125I-inhibin B from betaglycan in a radioligand binding assay. The differential affinity of the inhibin forms for betaglycan (9Makanji Y. Harrison C.A. Stanton P.G. Krishna R. Robertson D.M. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2309-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) ensured that very low amounts of inhibin A (IC50 = 1.2 pm) were required to displace 125I-inhibin B from transfected COS7 cells. Nontransfected COS7 cells, which do not bind inhibin A or B (9Makanji Y. Harrison C.A. Stanton P.G. Krishna R. Robertson D.M. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2309-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), were used as controls in the binding assays. Group A residues were those at the N terminus and in finger 1, and, in general, mutation of these residues had little effect on betaglycan binding (Fig. 3A and Table 1). An exception was the Y50A α-subunit mutant, which displayed a 4-fold reduction in affinity for betaglycan (IC50 4.8 pm) compared with wild type inhibin A (IC50 1.2 pm). It is worth noting that mutants F39A, I48A, and P51A were not expressed, and so the contribution of these residues to betaglycan binding could not be determined. Group B residues were those in close proximity to the second glycosylation site in the inhibin α-subunit (Asn70). Because the attachment of a carbohydrate moiety at this site significantly reduces the affinity of inhibin A for betaglycan (9Makanji Y. Harrison C.A. Stanton P.G. Krishna R. Robertson D.M. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2309-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), it was anticipated that juxtaposed residues would have an important role in betaglycan binding. However, despite all of these mutants (G64A/L65A, H66A/I67A, P68A/P69A, L71A/S72A, L73A/V75A, A78G/P82A, and Y86A/P90A) having multiple residues substituted to alanine, there was only a limited effect on the affinity of inhibin A for betaglycan (Fig. 3B and Table 1). This suggests that the wrist region of the inhibin α-subunit is not part of the high affinity binding epitope for betaglycan and indicates that the presence of a carbohydrate group at Asn70 must affect betaglycan binding to a more distant portion of the α-subunit. Group C mutants targeted residues in finger 2 of the α-subunit. Mutation of these residues had profound effects on betaglycan binding (Fig. 3C and Table 1). In particular, simultaneous substitution of Lys119 and Tyr120 reduced inhibin affinity for betaglycan 25-fold (IC50 30.8 pm). Other double mutations through this region, including R109A/T110A, T111A/S112A, and S117A/F118A, were also disruptive for betaglycan binding. Interestingly, Val108, which is essential for the dimerization of inhibin A (Fig. 2), also appears to be part of the epitope for high affinity betaglycan binding. Conservative substitutions at this site, as opposed to the introduction of alanine, were not disruptive for inhibin A dimer formation. Mutant V108L was expressed at levels comparable with other finger 2 variants but had a 6-fold lower affinity for betaglycan (IC50 7 pm) than wild type inhibin A. Together these results indicate that betaglycan primarily contacts inhibin A residues in the finger regions of the α-subunit. Synergistic Effect of Combined Amino Acid Substitutions in Inhibin A Mutants—The inhibin A double mutant, K119A/Y120A, had a significantly reduced (25-fold) affinity for betaglycan compared with the wild type protein. A comparison of the single point mutations indicated that Tyr120 was the major determinant for betaglycan binding; mutation of Lys119 has only a marginal effect on inhibin A affinity (Fig. 3D and Table 1). The fact that simultaneous mutation of the two residues exacerbates the reduction in receptor binding suggested that together they formed part of the high affinity betaglycan-binding site on inhibin A. To further reduce inhibin binding to betaglycan, the Y120A variant was combined with other disruptive finger 2 mutations. Given the importance of finger 2 residues in the correct folding and secretion of the inhibin A dimer (Fig. 2), it was not surprising that a majority of the combined mutants were expressed poorly or not at all (Table 1). However, several mutants were generated that had additive (V108L/K119A/Y120A) or synergistic (T111A/S112A/Y120A) effects. The T111A/S112A/Y120A variant was of particular interest because it was very limited in its ability to displace 125I-inhibin B from binding to betaglycan (Fig. 3D and Table 1). Purification and Receptor Binding of Inhibin A Mutants— Unfractionated conditioned medium was used in the initial assessment of betaglycan binding of the inhibin A mutants. Based on this binding assay, two inhibin A variants (K119A/ Y120A and T111A/S112A/Y120A) were selected for further analysis. Stable CHO cell lines expressing wild type or mutant inhibin A were generated. The secreted 31-kDa dimer was purified from 500 ml of conditioned medium using a combination of gel filtration, immunoaffinity chromatography, and reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 4). This procedure yielded 31-kDa inhibin A free of contaminating activin, as determined by Western blot and an activin A ELISA (data not shown). Quantitation of the inhibin A variants was determined using a specific inhibin A ELISA (Table 1). To confirm the data obtained with conditioned medium, the betaglycan binding activities of the purified inhibin A variants were studied. Wild type inhibin A readily displaced 125I-inhibin B (IC50 = 3.7 pm) from COS7 cells expressing betaglycan (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the K119A/Y120A (IC50 = 100 pm) and T111A/S112A/Y120A (IC50 = 720 pm) mutants had significantly reduced affinity for betaglycan. Subsequently, we assessed the ability of purified inhibin variants to bind to the activin type II receptor, ActRIIB (Fig. 5B). Wild type and mutant isoforms of inhibin A displayed similar affinities for ActRIIB, indicating that the mutations introduced into finger 2 of the α-subunit did not affect the overall structure of the inhibin A dimer.FIGURE 5Betaglycan and ActRIIB binding of purified inhibin A mutants.A, the ability of purified inhibin A (closed circles) and the KY (open circles) and TSY (closed squares) inhibin A variants to displace 125I-inhibin B from COS7 cells transfected with betaglycan is shown.

https://openalex.org/W1991782312,"Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in human papillomavirus type 16-immortalized human keratinocytes (HKc) is caused by the viral oncoprotein E6, which targets p53 for degradation. We have previously observed that expression of p53 RNAi in normal HKc is associated with an increase in EGFR mRNA and protein. We now report that p53 RNAi induces EGFR promoter activity up to approximately 10-fold in normal HKc, and this effect does not require intact p53 binding sites on the EGFR promoter. Exogenous wild-type p53 inhibits the EGFR promoter at low levels, and activates it at higher concentrations. Yin Yang 1 (YY1), which negatively regulates p53, induces EGFR promoter activity, and this effect is augmented by p53 RNAi. Intact p53 binding sites on the EGFR promoter are not required for activation by YY1. In addition, Sp1 and YY1 synergistically induce the EGFR promoter in normal HKc, indicating that Sp1 may recruit YY1 as a co-activator. Wild-type p53 suppressed Sp1- and YY1-mediated induction of the EGFR promoter. We conclude that acute loss of p53 in normal HKc induces EGFR expression by a mechanism that involves YY1 and Sp1 and does not require p53 binding to the EGFR promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2007474198,"The molecular mechanisms underlying differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into megakaryocytes are poorly understood. Tumor suppressor protein p53 can act as a transcription factor affecting both cell cycle control and apoptosis, and we have previously shown that p53 is activated during terminal megakaryocytic (Mk) differentiation of the CHRF-288-11 (CHRF) cell line. Here, we use RNA interference to reduce p53 expression in CHRF cells and show that reduced p53 activity leads to a greater fraction of polyploid cells, higher mean and maximum ploidy, accelerated DNA synthesis, and delayed apoptosis and cell death upon phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced Mk differentiation. In contrast, reduced p53 expression did not affect the ploidy or DNA synthesis of CHRF cells in the absence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation. Furthermore, primary Mk cells from cultures initiated with p53-null mouse bone marrow mononuclear cells displayed higher ploidy compared with wild-type controls. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis of p53-knockdown CHRF cells, compared with the ""scrambled"" control CHRF cells, revealed that six known transcriptional targets of p53 (BBC3, BAX, TP53I3, TP53INP1, MDM2, and P21) were down-regulated, whereas BCL2 expression, which is known to be negatively affected by p53, was up-regulated. These studies show that the functional role of the intrinsic activation of p53 during Mk differentiation is to control polyploidization and the transition to endomitosis by impeding cell cycling and promoting apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2040038307,"The cell division control protein 6 (Cdc6) is essential for formation of pre-replication complexes at origins of DNA replication. Phosphorylation of Cdc6 by cyclin-dependent kinases inhibits ubiquitination of Cdc6 by APC/C(cdh1) and degradation by the proteasome. Experiments described here show that the PR70 member of the PPP2R3 family of regulatory subunits targets protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to Cdc6. Interaction with Cdc6 is mediated by residues within the C terminus of PR70, whereas interaction with PP2A requires N-terminal sequences conserved within the PPP2R3 family. Two functional EF-hand calcium-binding motifs mediate a calcium-enhanced interaction of PR70 with PP2A. Calcium has no effect on the interaction of PR70 with Cdc6 but enhances the association of PP2A with Cdc6 through its effects on PR70. Knockdown of PR70 by RNA interference results in an accumulation of endogenous and expressed Cdc6 protein that is dependent on the cyclin-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites on Cdc6. Knockdown of PR70 also causes G(1) arrest, suggesting that PR70 function is critical for progression into S phase. These observations indicate that PP2A can be targeted in a calcium-regulated manner to Cdc6 via the PR70 subunit, where it plays a role in regulating protein phosphorylation and stability."

https://openalex.org/W2011855824,"Latency Associated Peptide (LAP) binds TGF-β1, forming a latent complex. Currently, LAP is presumed to function only as a sequestering agent for active TGF-β1. Previous work shows that LAP can induce epithelial cell migration, but effects on leukocytes have not been reported. Because of the multiplicity of immunologic processes in which TGF-β1 plays a role, we hypothesized that LAP could function independently to modulate immune responses. In separate experiments we found that LAP promoted chemotaxis of human monocytes and blocked inflammation in vivo in a murine model of the delayed-type hypersensitivity response (DTHR). These effects did not involve TGF-β1 activity. Further studies revealed that disruption of specific LAP-thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) interactions prevented LAP-induced responses. The effect of LAP on DTH inhibition depended on IL-10. These data support a novel role for LAP in regulating monocyte trafficking and immune modulation."
https://openalex.org/W2050802289,"Promoter methylation of the RAS-association domain family 1, isoform A gene (RASSF1A) is one of the most frequent events found in human tumours. In this study we set out to test the hypothesis that loss of Rassf1a can cooperate with inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) gene to accelerate intestinal tumourigenesis using the Apc-Min (Apc(Min/+)) mouse model, as mutational or deletional inactivation of APC is a frequent early event in the genesis of intestinal cancer. Further, loss of RASSF1A has also been reported to occur in premalignant adenomas of the bowel. RASSF1A has been implicated in an array of pivotal cellular processes, including regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, microtubule stability and most recently in the beta-catenin signalling pathway. By interbreeding isoform specific Rassf1a knockout mice with Apc(+/Min) mice, we showed that loss of Rassf1a results in a significant increase in adenomas of the small intestine and accelerated intestinal tumourigenesis leading to the earlier death of adenocarcinoma-bearing mice and decreased overall survival. Comparative genomic hybridization of adenomas from Rassf1a(-/-); Apc(+/Min) mice revealed no evidence of aneuploidy or gross chromosomal instability (no difference to adenomas from Rassf1a(+/+); Apc(+/Min) mice). Immunohistochemical analysis of adenomas revealed increased nuclear beta-catenin accumulation in adenomas from Rassf1a(-/-); Apc(+/Min) mice, compared to those from Rassf1a(+/+); Apc(+/Min) mice, but no differences in proliferation marker (Ki67) staining patterns. Collectively these data demonstrate cooperation between inactivation of Rassf1a and Apc resulting in accelerated intestinal tumourigenesis, with adenomas showing increased nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, supporting a mechanistic link via loss of the known interaction of Rassf1 with beta-TrCP that usually mediates degradation of beta-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W2016757605,"Somatic nuclear transfer is a cloning technique that shows great promise in the application to regenerative medicine. Although cloned animals are genetically identical to their donor counterparts, abnormalities in phenotype and gene expression are frequently observed. One hypothesis is that the cause of these abnormalities is due to epigenetic aberration. In this report, we focused our analysis on the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine9 (H3K9Ac). Through the use of whole genome tiling arrays and quantitative PCR, we examined this epigenetic event and directly compared and assessed the differences between a cloned mouse (C1) and its parental nuclear donor (D1) counterpart. We identified 4720 regions of chromosomal DNA that showed notable differences in H3K9Ac and report here many genes identified in these hyper- and hypo-acetylated regions. Analysis of a second clone (C2) and its parental donor counterpart (D2) for H3K9Ac showed a high degree of similarity to the C1/D1 pair. This conservation of aberrant acetylation is suggestive of a reproducible epigenetic phenomenon that may lead to the frequent abnormalities observed in cloned mice, such as obesity. Furthermore, we demonstrated Crp which was identified as a hyper-acetylated gene in this study is related to the body mass, suggesting that Crp is a possible candidate of a cause for the abnormal obesity in cloned mice. In this, one of the first reports describing genome-wide epigenetic abberation between parental and nuclear transfer-cloned mammals, we propose that aberrant acetylation of histones (H3K9Ac) flanking promoter regions highly correlates with gene-expression and may itself be an epigenetic change that accounts for variable expression patterns observed in cloned animals."

https://openalex.org/W2139803438,"The option to choose between several courses of action is often associated with the feeling of being in control. Yet, in certain situations, one may prefer to decline such agency and instead leave the choice to others. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we provide evidence that the neural processes involved in decision-making are modulated not only by who controls our choice options (agency), but also by whether we have a say in who is in control (context). The fMRI results are noteworthy in that they reveal specific contributions of the anterior frontomedian cortex (viz. BA 10) and the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ) in decision-making processes. The RCZ is engaged when conditions clearly present us with the most choice options. BA 10 is engaged in particular when the choice is completely ours, as well as when it is completely up to others to choose for us which in turn gives rise to an attribution of control to oneself or someone else, respectively. After all, it does not only matter whether we have any options to choose from, but also who decides on that."
https://openalex.org/W2044925689,"ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) are highly conserved small GTPases and are critical components of vesicle trafficking. Yeast Arf3p, despite its similarity to mammalian Arf6, is not required for endocytosis but is involved in polarity development. In this study, we identified an Arf3p interacting protein 1 (Afi1p), which, through its N-terminal conserved region, specifically interacts with GTP-bound Arf3p. Afi1p is distributed asymmetrically at the plasma membrane and is required for polarized distribution of Arf3p but not of an Arf3p guanine nucleotide-exchange factor, Yel1p. However, Afi1p is not required for targeting of Arf3p or Yel1p to the plasma membrane. Like <i>arf3</i> mutant yeast, <i>afi1</i> mutant yeast exhibited an abnormal budding pattern and partially delayed actin patch polarization. An Afi1p, <sup>38</sup>KLGP4A-Afi1p, mutated at the Arf3p-binding region, loses its ability to interact with Arf3p and maintain the polarized distribution of Arf3p. Although <sup>38</sup>KLGP4A-Afi1p still possessed a proper polarized distribution, it lost its ability to rescue actin patch polarization in <i>afi1</i> mutant cells. Our findings demonstrate that Afi1p functions as an Arf3p polarization-specific adapter and participates in development of polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2002752678,"Heparanase is an endoglycosidase that cleaves heparan sulfate (HS) side chains from heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) present in extracellular matrix and cell membranes. Although HSPGs have many functions during development, little is known of the role of the enzyme that degrades HS, heparanase. We cloned and characterized the expression of two heparanase splicing variants from <i>Xenopus laevis</i> and studied their function in early embryonic development. The heparanase gene (termed <i>xHpa</i>) spans over 15 kb and consists of at least 12 exons. The long heparanase (XHpaL) cDNA encodes a 531-amino acid protein, whereas the short splicing variant (XHpaS) results in a protein with the same open reading frame but missing 58 amino acids as a consequence of a skipped exon 4. Comparative studies of both isoforms using heterologous expression systems showed: 1) XHpaL is enzymatically active, whereas XHpaS is not; 2) XHpaL and XHpaS interact with heparin and HS; 3) both proteins traffic through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, but XHpaL is secreted into the medium, whereas XHpaS remains associated with the membrane as a consequence of the loss of three glycosylation sites; 4) overexpression of XHpaS but not XHpaL increases cell adhesion of glioma cells to HS-coated surfaces; 5) XHpaL and XHpaS mRNA and protein levels vary as development progresses; 6) specific antisense knock-down of both XHpaL and XHpaS, but not XHpaL alone, results in failure of embryogenesis to proceed. Interestingly, rescue experiments suggest that the two heparanases regulate the same developmental processes, but via different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2042717146,"Integrases (INs) of retroviruses and long terminal repeat retrotransposons possess a C-terminal domain with DNA binding activity. Other than this binding activity, little is known about how the C-terminal domain contributes to integration. A stretch of conserved amino acids called the GP(Y/F) domain has been identified within the C-terminal IN domains of two distantly related families, the γ-retroviruses and the metavirus retrotransposons. To enhance understanding of the C-terminal domain, we examined the function of the GP(Y/F) domain in the IN of Tf1, a long terminal repeat retrotransposon of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The activities of recombinant IN were measured with an assay that modeled the reverse of integration called disintegration. Although deletion of the entire C-terminal domain disrupted disintegration activity, an alanine substitution (P365A) in a conserved amino acid of the GP(Y/F) domain did not significantly reduce disintegration. When assayed for the ability to join two molecules of DNA in a reaction that modeled forward integration, the P365A substitution disrupted activity. UV cross-linking experiments detected DNA binding activity in the C-terminal domain and found that this activity was not reduced by substitutions in two conserved amino acids of the GP(Y/F) domain, G364A and P365A. Gel filtration and cross-linking of a 71-amino acid fragment containing the GP(Y/F) domain revealed a surprising ability to form dimers, trimers, and tetramers that was disrupted by the G364A and P365A substitutions. These results suggest that the GP(Y/F) residues may play roles in promoting multimerization and intermolecular strand joining.

Retroviruses and long terminal repeat (LTR) 3The abbreviations used are: LTR, long terminal repeat; IN, integrase; M-MuLV, Moloney murine leukemina virus; CHD, chromodomain; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; aa, amino acid(s); HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1. 3The abbreviations used are: LTR, long terminal repeat; IN, integrase; M-MuLV, Moloney murine leukemina virus; CHD, chromodomain; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; aa, amino acid(s); HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1. retrotransposons are closely related elements that depend on integrase (IN) to insert their cDNA into the genome of host cells. IN proteins are composed of three structurally distinct domains (1Craigie, R. (2002) in Mobile DNA II (Craig, N. L., Craigie, R., Gellert, M., and Lambowitz, A. M., eds) pp. 613-630, American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, DCGoogle Scholar). The N-terminal domains contain an HHCC motif, and the catalytic core domains in the center of INs possess the DDE residues that mediate catalysis. The C-terminal domains of INs have little sequence conservation but possess nonspecific DNA binding activity.INs expressed as recombinant proteins possess a variety of catalytic activities. Oligonucleotides that model the termini of LTRs are trimmed by IN in a processing reaction that removes terminal nucleotides 3′ of the conserved CA. Once the processing reaction is complete, strand transfer occurs. In this reaction, the 3′-hydroxyls of the terminal A serve as nucleophiles in transesterification reactions that cleave phosphodiester bonds in the target DNA and make covalent bonds between the 3′-ends of the viral DNA and the 5′-ends of the target DNA (2Fujiwara T. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1988; 54: 497-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 3Engelman A. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Cell. 1991; 67: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Under highly specific conditions, IN can catalyze concerted integration, the simultaneous insertion of two ends of donor DNA into the same site of target DNA (4Sinha S. Pursley M.H. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3105-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 5Chiu R. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6482-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Sinha S. Grandgenett D.P.

In addition, INs also catalyze disintegration, the reverse of integration that uses model substrates that mimic one end of an LTR inserted into target DNA (8Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3896-3907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Science. 1992; 255: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This assay is a particularly sensitive method for measuring catalytic activity of INs, perhaps because it detects strand breaking and joining within a single substrate molecule, an intramolecular reaction.Currently, no molecular structures exist of an IN that possesses all three domains. The structures that do exist are of individual domains and do not include bound DNA. As a result, the function of the C-terminal domain in integration is not clear. An additional difficulty in determining the function of the C-terminal domains stems from their low levels of sequence conservation. However, close examination of C termini did identify two separate sequence modules that exist either alone or in combination in a wide variety of INs (10Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5186-5190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One module termed the GP(Y/F) domain is present in the INs of a diverse set of LTR retrotransposons of the Metaviridae family (formally called the Ty3/gypsy family) (10Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5186-5190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jern P. Sperber G.O. Blomberg J. Retrovirology. 2005; 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, the GP(Y/F) domain is also present in the distantly related genius of γ-retroviruses that includes the Moloney murine leukemina virus (M-MuLV). The function of the GP(Y/F) domain has not been studied. The chromodomain (CHD) is another module discovered in the C termini of INs and is present in the metavirus genus of LTR retrotransposons. The CHD is similar to the domains in HP1 proteins that mediate the formation of heterochromatin by binding histone H3 when methylated at Lys-9. Recent results indicate that CHDs in some INs do have interactions with histone H3 methylated at Lys-9 (12Gao X. Hou Y. Ebina H. Levin H.L. Voytas D.F. Genome Res. 2008; 18: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).Tf1 is an LTR retrotransposon of Schizosaccharomyces pombe that integrates specifically upstream of polymerase II-transcribed genes (13Behrens R. Hayles J. Nurse P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4709-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Bowen N.J. Jordan I. Epstein J. Wood V. Levin H.L. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1984-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15Singleton T.L. Levin H.L. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The IN of Tf1 possesses the HHCC motif near the N terminus and the DDE motif in the central region. Interestingly, the C-terminal portion of the Tf1 IN possesses both the GP(Y/F) domain and the CHD (10Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5186-5190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent experiments revealed that Tf1 IN purified as a recombinant protein possesses significant activity in assays that measure 3′ processing, strand transfer, and disintegration (16Hizi A. Levin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Assays of Tf1 IN without the CHD revealed the surprising result that the CHD restricts catalytic activity by as much as 8-fold (16Hizi A. Levin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).The experiments reported here use the IN of Tf1 as a model in order to study the function of the GP(Y/F) domain. A series of deletions in recombinant IN revealed that the C-terminal domain was required for disintegration activity. However, a single amino acid substitution in a conserved amino acid of the GP(Y/F) domain (P365A) did not significantly reduce disintegration. Assays for strand transfer activity revealed the P365A substitution significantly reduced activity. The results of gel filtration and chemical cross-linking indicated that a 71-aa fragment containing the GP(Y/F) domain formed dimers, trimers, and tetramers. Single amino acid substitutions in conserved residues of the GP(Y/F) domain, G364A and P365A, abrogated this multimerization. These data suggest that the GP(Y/F) residues may promote multimerization and strand transfer activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—To generate versions of Tf1 with substitutions in the GP(Y/F) domain, fusion-PCR fragments with mutations were inserted into the NarI and BsrGI sites of pHL414-2 (Wt Tf1-neo). The primers are described in Table S1. Transposition assays were performed as previously described (17Lin J.H. Levin H.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 270-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).The construction of pHL2468, the plasmid for the expression of the full-length Tf1 IN and the plasmid expressing IN lacking the CHD (CH-), pHL2469, have been described previously (16Hizi A. Levin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The plasmids expressing the fragments of IN were generated by similar methods. The DNA fragments coding for each protein were amplified by PCR with the Pfu Ultra Hotstart 2× Master Mix (Stratagene) and primer pairs as indicated in the supplemental data (Table S1). The DNA generated was cleaved with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the vector pET15b cut with NdeI and BamHI. Each insert was sequenced. All plasmids are listed in Table S2.The Purification of His-tagged Recombinant Proteins—BL21 cells containing the expression plasmids were grown at 32 °C until they reached an A600 of ∼0.6. Inductions were performed at 16 °C with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 24 h. The cells were harvested, and pellets were stored at -80 °C.The methods of protein purification were based on our previous report but contained the following modifications (16Hizi A. Levin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The volumes of the cultures were 250 ml, and the sonication was performed in 30 ml of buffer. The bed volumes of Sepharose-Co2+ (BD Talon, BD Biosciences) for the columns were 2.0 ml. All column treatments were by gravity flow. The column washes were 50 ml with no imidazole followed by 100 ml with 25 mm imidazole. The proteins were eluted with a sequence of 4-ml steps that contained 35, 50, 75, 100, and 150 mm imidazole.The fractions eluted from the column were dialyzed into a storage buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 m NaCl) and frozen at -80 °C.Purification of IN Lacking the His Tag and Partial Trypsin Digestion—This purification was based on the previous report with modifications that differed from the purification of the His tag-containing IN described above (16Hizi A. Levin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Harvested cells with pHL2468 were incubated for 15 min on ice in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, buffer, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, and 1× Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cells were sonicated, CHAPS was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 0.05%, and the sample was inverted six times. The sample was then spun in an SW28 at 25,000 rpm for 1.5 h. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml HIS Trap FF column (Amersham Biosciences). At 1 ml/min, the column was washed with the lysis buffer plus the CHAPS and 0.5 m NaCl and 20 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted into 2-ml fractions with an imidazole gradient of 40–400 mm.IN-containing fractions were dialyzed into 75 mm NaCl with 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgSO4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% CHAPS and loaded onto a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with 0.5 m NaCl. IN-containing fractions were combined and dialyzed into thrombin (Sigma)-containing buffer to remove the His tag. Thrombin was removed with a benzamidine column (Amersham Biosciences). The IN was stored in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, buffer, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% CHAPS at a final concentration of 0.73 μg/μl.Either 50 or 500 ng of trypsin (Roche Applied Science) was added to 18 μg of Tf1 IN in the above storage buffer and incubated at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped and collected at 0.5, 2, 4, 8.5, and 21.5 h by the addition of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A mock reaction, containing no trypsin, was incubated for 21.5 h at 30 °C. Reactions were divided and loaded on both 20% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) for band visualization and 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gels (Invitrogen) for N terminus analysis. Tris-glycine gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. The protein from the NuPAGE gels was electrotransferred to the Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was Coomassie-stained, and bands were cut out and sent for N terminus sequencing at the Food and Drug Administration Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research by Dr. Nga Nguyen.Disintegration and Strand Transfer Assays—The disintegration and strand transfer assays were conducted as described (16Hizi A. Levin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, in this work, the reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of loading buffer (50% glycerol, 250 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 0.05 mg/ml xylene cyanole) and heating at 95 °C for 3 min. The samples were loaded on an 8 m urea, 14% (w/v) polyacrylamide sequencing gel and electrophoresed in Tris-borate EDTA buffer.HL1127 and HL1034 were the DNA oligonucleotide that were 5′-end-labeled for use in the disintegration and strand transfer assays, respectively (Table S1) (16Hizi A. Levin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Aliquots containing 0.4 μg of each oligonucleotide were 32P-end-labeled using 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a volume of 20 μl of the buffer from the supplier. After an incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, 1 μl of 0.25 m EDTA was added to each sample, and the mixtures were treated for 5 min at 95 °C to inactivate the enzyme. After adding NaCl to a final concentration of 0.1 m and increasing the volume to 40 μl, the labeled DNA was annealed to 3 times the molar ratio of the appropriate nonlabeled DNA. After 5 min at 95 °C, the mixtures were allowed to cool to room temperature for about 2 h. The duplexes generated were then stored at -20 °C and were used after freezing and thawing for up to 1 month. One pmol of substrate was added to each reaction.Pull-down Experiment—Binding of His-tagged INs to full-length IN lacking a His tag was assayed in a binding buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. Six micrograms of recombinant His-tagged IN was incubated with 6 μg of full-length IN lacking the tag in 500 μl of binding buffer. Following a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the reactions were supplemented with 40 μl of prewashed Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and stirred for an additional 60 min at 4 °C. The agarose beads were recovered by centrifugation for 1 min at 960 × g at 4 °C and washed with 500 μl of binding buffer two times and then washed three times with 500 μl of binding buffer supplemented with 25 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted in 40 μl of binding buffer supplemented with 400 mm imidazole and analyzed on a 10–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins in the gel were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The membrane was probed with anti-IN rabbit antibody (1:10,000) (41Levin H. Weaver D.C. Boeke J.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4885-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig, whole antibody (1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences). ECL Plus was used to detect the protein signals (Amersham Biosciences).Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column or Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column on an AKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare). A flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a mobile phase of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol was used for the Superdex 75HR 10/300 GL column. A flow rate of 0.25 ml/min was used for the Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column. Typically, 100 μg of purified IN polypeptides at a concentration of 1 μg/μl were injected. The concentrations of the proteins and fragments were as follows: IN, 17.4 μm; core, 32.7 μm; ΔC-(1–334), 24.3 μm; GP(Y/F) fragment, 94.3 μm; CHD, 105.3 μm. Samples were subjected to centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g prior to injection on the column. Absorbance of the column eluate was monitored at 280 nm. Samples from peak fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE for the presence of the expected protein species. The column was calibrated using five different globular proteins as molecular weight standards (Gel Filtration Calibration Kits, High Molecular Weight and Low Molecular Weight; Amersham Biosciences), and the apparent molecular weight of each sample peak was determined using linear regression of the log of known molecular weight versus the elution behavior (Kav or elution time).Chemical Cross-linking—Cross-linking of the GP(Y/F) fragment was conducted using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce) at concentrations of 0.2, 1.0, and 2.0 mm in reactions (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl) that were incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The GP(Y/F) fragment was at a concentration of 25 μm. The reactions were quenched by adding Tris-HCl to a final concentration of 60 mm and incubating at room temperature for 15 min. One-half volume of 2× sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol (125 mm Tris-HCl, 5% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue) was added to the reactions, and the samples were heated at 95 °C for 10 min. Covalently linked multimers were detected by separation in 10–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and silver staining.DNA Binding Assay—Reaction mixtures for UV cross-linking contained the same buffer components as the disintegration reactions, except the concentration of glycerol was 1% (w/v). Unless otherwise stated, 1 μg of protein was combined with 1 pmol of DNA per reaction. The following were the molar quantities of protein added to 1 pmol of DNA: IN, 17.4 pmol; CH-, 20.2 pmol; N-terminal domain (NTD), 66.2 pmol; core, 30.6 pmol; GP(Y/F), 94.3 pmol; CHD, 105.3 pmol. The mixtures were incubated over ice for 40 min. They were then spotted onto parafilm placed over ice and exposed to UV light for 1.5 min using a UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene) set on time mode. Seven microliters of 4× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) were added to 20 μl of each reaction, and the samples were boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed in 4–12% BisTris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen). Gels were subjected to autoradiography. For the quantitative UV cross-linking assays, 1.2, 6, and 30 pmol of proteins were combined with 1 pmol of DNA.RESULTSThe Domain Structure of Tf1 IN—The GP(Y/F) domain was reported to be a conserved module in the INs of the Metaviridae family of LTR retrotransposons and in the γ family of retroviruses (10Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5186-5190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jern P. Sperber G.O. Blomberg J. Retrovirology. 2005; 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The alignment of INs in Fig. 1A shows the broad conservation of the GP(Y/F) domain among these distantly related families. The amino acids of Tf1 IN that encompass the GP(Y/F) domain are aa 339–368 (10Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5186-5190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this is the definition we use in this report. The alignment also indicates that the INs of the lenti and β families of retroviruses lack a significant portion of the domain, including the N-terminal amino acids and the Y/F that defines the GP(Y/F) domain.Tf1 belongs to the Metaviridae family and was one of the initial members reported to have an IN with the GP(Y/F) domain (10Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5186-5190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IN of Tf1, as a recombinant protein, is highly soluble and possesses robust catalytic activity (16Hizi A. Levin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These properties motivated us to examine the IN of Tf1 as a model to study the function of the GP(Y/F) domain. Since little was known about the structure of Tf1 IN, our initial experiments tested whether it possessed the three domain architecture typical of INs. A scaled drawing of Tf1 IN indicates that the position of its HHCC and DDE motifs are quite similar to those of M-MuLV IN (Fig. 1B). To map the position of its domains, Tf1 IN purified from bacteria was subjected to partial proteolysis with trypsin, and the N termini of the products were sequenced. The results confirmed that the IN does have a three-domain structure with an N-terminal domain (aa 1–110), a catalytic core (aa 111–354), and a C-terminal domain (aa 355–477) (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, the cleavage between the central and C-terminal domains occurred in the middle of the GP(Y/F) domain. This indicated that the GP(Y/F) domain assembles into two stable segments split by protease-accessible residues.Substitutions in the GP(Y/F) Domain Significantly Reduce Transposition Activity—To test whether the amino acids of the GP(Y/F) domain possessed an important function, we made substitutions in the GPF residues of the transposon and measured the resulting transposition activity in vivo (Fig. 2). The assay for transposition activity consisted of expressing neo-containing copies of Tf1 in S. pombe and measuring the resistance to G418 that results from integration (17Lin J.H. Levin H.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 270-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The transposition frequencies of elements with the substitutions G364A, P365A, F366A, and G364A/P365A/F366A ((364–366)AAA) were significantly reduced (Fig. 2A). When the proportion of the cells with resistance to G418 was quantified, we found the substitutions G364A, P365A, F366A, and G364A/P365A/F366A reduced transposition by 59-, 7.6-, 26-, and 72-fold, respectively (supplemental Table S3). In order to analyze which steps of transposition were disrupted by the substitutions, cDNA synthesis and levels of IN were analyzed. Immunoblots revealed that the substitutions significantly reduced the levels of IN expressed in S. pombe (Fig. 2B). These reduced levels of IN made it difficult to identify a specific function of the GP(Y/F) domain in in vivo assays. DNA blots of cells expressing Tf1-neo revealed that the substitutions caused no more than a 2-fold defect in cDNA production (supplemental Fig. S2A). In addition, the substitutions did not reduce levels of reverse transcriptase (supplemental Fig. S2B).FIGURE 2Analysis of Tf1 transposons with substitutions in the GP(Y/F) residues. A, activities of the transposons with the GP(Y/F) substitutions, G364A, P365A, F366A, and G364A/P365A/F366A ((364–366)AAA), were measured in each of four independent transformants (T1–T4). The control strains included wild-type Tf1, Tf1 with a frameshift in IN, and Tf1 with a frameshift in protease. B, the levels of IN and GAG produced by the altered versions of Tf1 were measured on immunoblots probed with anti Gag (number 660) and anti IN (number 657) rabbit antibodies.

Each of the protein preparations exhibited a high degree of purity (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3The sections of Tf1 IN expressed as recombinant proteins. A, the regions of IN expressed are illustrated relative to the zinc finger-like motif, the DDE catalytic residues, the GP(Y/F) domain, and the CHD. The His tag and the residues expressed are shown for each protein. The coordinates of the trypsin cleavages (triangles), the GP(Y/F) domain (horizontal lines), and the CHD (shaded) are shown. B, the purified proteins were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The disintegration assay is a sensitive method for identifying the core structures necessary for catalyzing strand breakage and joining. For example, the catalytic core domain of HIV-1 and Rous sarcoma virus INs are by themselves able to catalyze disintegration (18Bushman F.D. Engelman A. Palmer I. Wingfield P. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3428-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 19Kulkosky J. Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Virology. 1995; 206: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Each of the recombinant Tf1 proteins was assayed for disintegration activity with a previously established substrate that mimics the U3 end of the LTR inserted in a target site (Fig. 4A) (16Hizi A. Levin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). By itself, the catalytic core domain of Tf1 IN lacked activity (Fig. 4B, lanes 9–12). As observed previously, IN lacking the CHD (aa 1–406) was considerably more active than the full-length IN (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–8) (16Hizi A. Levin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Truncations revealed that the N-terminal domain was required for catalytic activity (Fig. 4C, lanes 4–8). Other deletions revealed that the C-terminal domain was also necessary for activity (Fig. 4C, lanes 9 and 10). This requirement of the C-terminal domain is consistent with studies of the M-MuLV IN that found a similar requirement for the C terminus using disintegration assays (20Jonsson C.B. Donzella G.A. Gaucan E. Smith C.M. Roth M.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4585-4597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the same study found that the N-terminal domain of M-MuLV IN was not required for activity. Thus, Tf1 IN is distinct from the IN of M-MuLV in that it requires both N-terminal and C-terminal domains for disintegration activity.FIGURE 4The disintegration activity of the purified INs. A, the substrate for the disintegration assays consisted of a 76-nt DNA annealed to a 20-nt DNA that was labeled with 32P on its 5′-end. The DNA in red models the end of the transposon sequence, and the DNA in blue represents the target. The arrows represent the 3′-ends. The product of the reaction produced a 63-nt DNA that contained the 32P label on its 5′-end. B, the disintegration products of full-length IN-(1–477), CH--(1–406), and the central core domain (aa 110–354) are shown. The reaction mixture in lanes 1, 5, and 9 contained 0.5 μg of IN protein. The reactions in lanes 2, 6, and 10 contained 1.0 μg of IN protein. The reactions in lanes 3, 7, and 11 contained 3.0 μg of IN protein. The reactions in l"
