https://openalex.org/W2894662039,"We expanded GWAS discovery for type 2 diabetes (T2D) by combining data from 898,130 European-descent individuals (9% cases), after imputation to high-density reference panels. With these data, we (i) extend the inventory of T2D-risk variants (243 loci, 135 newly implicated in T2D predisposition, comprising 403 distinct association signals); (ii) enrich discovery of lower-frequency risk alleles (80 index variants with minor allele frequency <5%, 14 with estimated allelic odds ratio >2); (iii) substantially improve fine-mapping of causal variants (at 51 signals, one variant accounted for >80% posterior probability of association (PPA)); (iv) extend fine-mapping through integration of tissue-specific epigenomic information (islet regulatory annotations extend the number of variants with PPA >80% to 73); (v) highlight validated therapeutic targets (18 genes with associations attributable to coding variants); and (vi) demonstrate enhanced potential for clinical translation (genome-wide chip heritability explains 18% of T2D risk; individuals in the extremes of a T2D polygenic risk score differ more than ninefold in prevalence)."
https://openalex.org/W2894584497,"Preclinical studies suggest that treatment with neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade is associated with enhanced survival and antigen-specific T cell responses compared with adjuvant treatment1; however, optimal regimens have not been defined. Here we report results from a randomized phase 2 study of neoadjuvant nivolumab versus combined ipilimumab with nivolumab in 23 patients with high-risk resectable melanoma ( NCT02519322 ). RECIST overall response rates (ORR), pathologic complete response rates (pCR), treatment-related adverse events (trAEs) and immune correlates of response were assessed. Treatment with combined ipilimumab and nivolumab yielded high response rates (RECIST ORR 73%, pCR 45%) but substantial toxicity (73% grade 3 trAEs), whereas treatment with nivolumab monotherapy yielded modest responses (ORR 25%, pCR 25%) and low toxicity (8% grade 3 trAEs). Immune correlates of response were identified, demonstrating higher lymphoid infiltrates in responders to both therapies and a more clonal and diverse T cell infiltrate in responders to nivolumab monotherapy. These results describe the feasibility of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma and emphasize the need for additional studies to optimize treatment regimens and to validate putative biomarkers."

https://openalex.org/W3098600872,"Optical frequency combs are broadband sources that offer mutually-coherent, equidistant spectral lines with unprecedented precision in frequency and timing for an array of applications. Kerr frequency combs in microresonators require a single-frequency pump laser and have offered the promise of highly compact, scalable, and power efficient devices. Here, we realize this promise by demonstrating the first fully integrated Kerr frequency comb source through use of extremely low-loss silicon nitride waveguides that form both the microresonator and an integrated laser cavity. Our device generates low-noise soliton-modelocked combs spanning over 100 nm using only 98 mW of electrical pump power. Our design is based on a novel dual-cavity configuration that demonstrates the flexibility afforded by full integration. The realization of a fully integrated Kerr comb source with ultra-low power consumption brings the possibility of highly portable and robust frequency and timing references, sensors, and signal sources. It also enables new tools to investigate the dynamics of comb and soliton generation through close chip-based integration of microresonators and lasers."
https://openalex.org/W2895074862,"Modern sugarcanes are polyploid interspecific hybrids, combining high sugar content from Saccharum officinarum with hardiness, disease resistance and ratooning of Saccharum spontaneum. Sequencing of a haploid S. spontaneum, AP85-441, facilitated the assembly of 32 pseudo-chromosomes comprising 8 homologous groups of 4 members each, bearing 35,525 genes with alleles defined. The reduction of basic chromosome number from 10 to 8 in S. spontaneum was caused by fissions of 2 ancestral chromosomes followed by translocations to 4 chromosomes. Surprisingly, 80% of nucleotide binding site-encoding genes associated with disease resistance are located in 4 rearranged chromosomes and 51% of those in rearranged regions. Resequencing of 64 S. spontaneum genomes identified balancing selection in rearranged regions, maintaining their diversity. Introgressed S. spontaneum chromosomes in modern sugarcanes are randomly distributed in AP85-441 genome, indicating random recombination among homologs in different S. spontaneum accessions. The allele-defined Saccharum genome offers new knowledge and resources to accelerate sugarcane improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2887294814,"Topological insulators (TIs) are a striking example of materials in which topological invariants are manifested in robustness against perturbations. Their most prominent feature is the emergence of topological edge states with reduced dimension at the boundary between areas with distinct topological invariants. The observable physical effect is unidirectional robust transport, unaffected by defects or disorder. TIs were originally observed in the integer quantum Hall effect for fermionic systems of correlated electrons. However, during the past decade the concepts of topological physics have been introduced into numerous fields beyond condensed matter, ranging from microwaves and photonic systems to cold atoms, acoustics and even mechanics. Recently, TIs were proposed in exciton-polariton systems organized as honeycomb lattices, under the influence of a magnetic field. Topological phenomena in polaritons are fundamentally different from all topological effects demonstrated experimentally thus far: exciton-polaritons are part-light part-matter quasiparticles emerging from the strong coupling of quantum well excitons and cavity photons. Here, we demonstrate experimentally the first exciton-polariton TI. This constitutes the first symbiotic light-matter TIs. Our polariton lattice is excited non-resonantly, and the chiral topological polariton edge mode is populated by a polariton condensation mechanism. We image real- and Fourier-space to measure photoluminescence, and demonstrate that the topological edge mode avoids defects, and that the propagation direction of the mode can be reversed by inverting the applied magnetic field. Our exciton-polariton TI paves the way for a variety of new topological phenomena, as they involve light-matter interaction, gain, and perhaps most importantly - exciton-polaritons interact with one another as a nonlinear many-body system."

https://openalex.org/W2894894185,"CRISPR-Cas-based genome editing holds great promise for targeting genetic disorders, including inborn errors of hepatocyte metabolism. Precise correction of disease-causing mutations in adult tissues in vivo, however, is challenging. It requires repair of Cas9-induced double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks by homology-directed mechanisms, which are highly inefficient in nondividing cells. Here we corrected the disease phenotype of adult phenylalanine hydroxylase (Pah)enu2 mice, a model for the human autosomal recessive liver disease phenylketonuria (PKU)1, using recently developed CRISPR-Cas-associated base editors2-4. These systems enable conversion of C∙G to T∙A base pairs and vice versa, independent of dsDNA break formation and homology-directed repair (HDR). We engineered and validated an intein-split base editor, which allows splitting of the fusion protein into two parts, thereby circumventing the limited cargo capacity of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Intravenous injection of AAV-base editor systems resulted in Pahenu2 gene correction rates that restored physiological blood phenylalanine (L-Phe) levels below 120 µmol/l [5]. We observed mRNA correction rates up to 63%, restoration of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme activity, and reversion of the light fur phenotype in Pahenu2 mice. Our findings suggest that targeting genetic diseases in vivo using AAV-mediated delivery of base-editing agents is feasible, demonstrating potential for therapeutic application."
https://openalex.org/W2893655504,"Here we use deep sequencing to identify sources of variation in mRNA splicing in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 450 subjects from two aging cohorts. Hundreds of aberrant pre-mRNA splicing events are reproducibly associated with Alzheimer's disease. We also generate a catalog of splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL) effects: splicing of 3,006 genes is influenced by genetic variation. We report that altered splicing is the mechanism for the effects of the PICALM, CLU and PTK2B susceptibility alleles. Furthermore, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study and identified 21 genes with significant associations with Alzheimer's disease, many of which are found in known loci, whereas 8 are in novel loci. These results highlight the convergence of old and new genes associated with Alzheimer's disease in autophagy-lysosomal-related pathways. Overall, this study of the transcriptome of the aging brain provides evidence that dysregulation of mRNA splicing is a feature of Alzheimer's disease and is, in some cases, genetically driven."
https://openalex.org/W2784010253,"While social media offer great communication opportunities, they also increase the vulnerability of young people to threatening situations online. Recent studies report that cyberbullying constitutes a growing problem among youngsters. Successful prevention depends on the adequate detection of potentially harmful messages and the information overload on the Web requires intelligent systems to identify potential risks automatically. The focus of this paper is on automatic cyberbullying detection in social media text by modelling posts written by bullies, victims, and bystanders of online bullying. We describe the collection and fine-grained annotation of a cyberbullying corpus for English and Dutch and perform a series of binary classification experiments to determine the feasibility of automatic cyberbullying detection. We make use of linear support vector machines exploiting a rich feature set and investigate which information sources contribute the most for the task. Experiments on a hold-out test set reveal promising results for the detection of cyberbullying-related posts. After optimisation of the hyperparameters, the classifier yields an F1 score of 64% and 61% for English and Dutch respectively, and considerably outperforms baseline systems."
https://openalex.org/W2895334061,"In utero gene editing has the potential to prenatally treat genetic diseases that result in significant morbidity and mortality before or shortly after birth. We assessed the viral vector–mediated delivery of CRISPR–Cas9 or base editor 3 in utero, seeking therapeutic modification of Pcsk9 or Hpd in wild-type mice or the murine model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1, respectively. We observed long-term postnatal persistence of edited cells in both models, with reduction of plasma PCSK9 and cholesterol levels following in utero Pcsk9 targeting and rescue of the lethal phenotype of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 following in utero Hpd targeting. The results of this proof-of-concept work demonstrate the possibility of efficiently performing gene editing before birth, pointing to a potential new therapeutic approach for selected congenital genetic disorders. Viral-mediated base editing in utero enables therapeutic editing of two metabolic genes in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2895709954,"Understanding the organization of the hippocampus is fundamental to understanding brain function related to learning, memory, emotions, and diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Physiological studies in humans and rodents have suggested that there is both structural and functional heterogeneity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. However, the recent discovery of discrete gene expression domains in the mouse hippocampus has provided the opportunity to re-evaluate hippocampal connectivity. To integrate mouse hippocampal gene expression and connectivity, we mapped the distribution of distinct gene expression patterns in mouse hippocampus and subiculum to create the Hippocampus Gene Expression Atlas (HGEA). Notably, previously unknown subiculum gene expression patterns revealed a hidden laminar organization. Guided by the HGEA, we constructed the most detailed hippocampal connectome available using Mouse Connectome Project ( http://www.mouseconnectome.org ) tract tracing data. Our results define the hippocampus’ multiscale network organization and elucidate each subnetwork’s unique brain-wide connectivity patterns. Bienkowski et al. have created a new subregional atlas of the mouse hippocampus that integrates gene expression with anatomical connectivity to reveal the multiscale organization of the hippocampus and its connections throughout the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2893026352,"Retinal gene therapy is increasingly recognized as a novel molecular intervention that has huge potential in treating common causes of blindness, the majority of which have a genetic aetiology1-5. Choroideremia is a chronic X-linked retinal degeneration that was first described in 18726. It leads to progressive blindness due to deficiency of Rab-escort protein 1 (REP1). We designed an adeno-associated viral vector to express REP1 and assessed it in a gene therapy clinical trial by subretinal injection in 14 patients with choroideremia. The primary endpoint was vision change in treated eyes 2 years after surgery compared to unoperated fellow eyes. Despite complications in two patients, visual acuity improved in the 14 treated eyes over controls (median 4.5 letter gain, versus 1.5 letter loss, P = 0.04), with 6 treated eyes gaining more than one line of vision (>5 letters). The results suggest that retinal gene therapy can sustain and improve visual acuity in a cohort of predominantly late-stage choroideremia patients in whom rapid visual acuity loss would ordinarily be predicted."
https://openalex.org/W2892391774,"Common variant heritability has been widely reported to be concentrated in variants within cell-type-specific non-coding functional annotations, but little is known about low-frequency variant functional architectures. We partitioned the heritability of both low-frequency (0.5%≤ minor allele frequency <5%) and common (minor allele frequency ≥5%) variants in 40 UK Biobank traits across a broad set of functional annotations. We determined that non-synonymous coding variants explain 17 ± 1% of low-frequency variant heritability ( $$h_{{\mathrm{lf}}}^2$$ ) versus 2.1 ± 0.2% of common variant heritability ( $$h_{\mathrm{c}}^2$$ ). Cell-type-specific non-coding annotations that were significantly enriched for $$h_{\mathrm{c}}^2$$ of corresponding traits were similarly enriched for $$h_{{\mathrm{lf}}}^2$$ for most traits, but more enriched for brain-related annotations and traits. For example, H3K4me3 marks in brain dorsolateral prefrontal cortex explain 57 ± 12% of $$h_{{\mathrm{lf}}}^2$$ versus 12 ± 2% of $$h_{\mathrm{c}}^2$$ for neuroticism. Forward simulations confirmed that low-frequency variant enrichment depends on the mean selection coefficient of causal variants in the annotation, and can be used to predict effect size variance of causal rare variants (minor allele frequency <0.5%). The authors extend stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression to partition the heritability of both low-frequency and common variants in 40 heritable traits from the UK Biobank, providing insights into low-frequency and rare variant functional architectures."

https://openalex.org/W2895770703,"The new European model stipulates the achievement of an inclusive, sustainable and intelligent economic growth. Increasing the share of renewable energy is one of the factors that improve the quality of economic growth, similar to research, development and investment in human capital. In this paper we tested the correlation between economic growth and renewable energy consumption for ten European Union (EU) member states from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) in the period 1990–2014, using Auto-regressive and Distributed Lag (ARDL) modeling procedure, a technique that captures causal relationships both on a short run and on a long run. The short run perspective reveals the transition towards a new energy paradigm, while the long run approach corresponds to the long-term equilibrium of the analyzed factors. Our results shows that, in the short run, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Renewable Energy Consumption (REC) dynamics are independent in Romania and Bulgaria, while in Hungary, Lithuania and Slovenia an increasing renewable energy consumption improves the economic growth. The hypothesis of bi-directional causality between renewable energy consumption and economic growth is validated in the long run for both the whole group of analyzed countries as well as in the case of seven CEE states which were studied individually. These results allow us to look into the feasibility of the Europe 2020 goals regarding the increase of energy efficiency and to propose public policies to achieve these goals."
https://openalex.org/W2893878927,"Available corrector drugs are unable to effectively rescue the folding defects of CFTR-ΔF508 (or CFTR-F508del﻿), the most common disease-causing mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, a plasma membrane (PM) anion channel, and thus to substantially ameliorate clinical phenotypes of cystic fibrosis (CF). To overcome the corrector efficacy ceiling, here we show that compounds targeting distinct structural defects of CFTR can synergistically rescue mutant expression and function at the PM. High-throughput cell-based screens and mechanistic analysis identified three small-molecule series that target defects at nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1), NBD2 and their membrane-spanning domain (MSD) interfaces. Although individually these compounds marginally improve ΔF508-CFTR folding efficiency, function and stability, their combinations lead to ~50–100% of wild-type-level correction in immortalized and primary human airway epithelia and in mouse nasal epithelia. Likewise, corrector combinations were effective against rare missense mutations in various CFTR domains, probably acting via structural allostery, suggesting a mechanistic framework for their broad application. Targeting different aspects of mutant CFTR structural defects with combination therapy leads to more potent rescue of function than that following single therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2893870376,"Impaired immunity in patients with late-stage cancer is not limited to antitumor responses, as demonstrated by poor vaccination protection and high susceptibility to infection1-3. This has been largely attributed to chemotherapy-induced impairment of innate immunity, such as neutropenia2, whereas systemic effects of tumors on hematopoiesis and adoptive immunity remain incompletely understood. Here we observed anemia associated with severe deficiency of CD8+ T cell responses against pathogens in treatment-naive mice bearing large tumors. Specifically, we identify CD45+ erythroid progenitor cells (CD71+TER119+; EPCs) as robust immunosuppressors. CD45+ EPCs, induced by tumor growth-associated extramedullary hematopoiesis, accumulate in the spleen to become a major population, outnumbering regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The CD45+ EPC transcriptome closely resembles that of MDSCs, and, like MDSCs, reactive oxygen species production is a major mechanism underlying CD45+ EPC-mediated immunosuppression. Similarly, an immunosuppressive CD45+ EPC population was detected in patients with cancer who have anemia. These findings identify a major population of immunosuppressive cells that likely contributes to the impaired T cell responses commonly observed in patients with advanced cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2895563925,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most frequent cancer in humans and results from constitutive activation of the Hedgehog pathway1. Several Smoothened inhibitors are used to treat Hedgehog-mediated malignancies, including BCC and medulloblastoma2. Vismodegib, a Smoothened inhibitor, leads to BCC shrinkage in the majority of patients with BCC3, but the mechanism by which it mediates BCC regression is unknown. Here we used two genetically engineered mouse models of BCC4 to investigate the mechanisms by which inhibition of Smoothened mediates tumour regression. We found that vismodegib mediates BCC regression by inhibiting a hair follicle-like fate and promoting the differentiation of tumour cells. However, a small population of tumour cells persists and is responsible for tumour relapse following treatment discontinuation, mimicking the situation found in humans5. In both mouse and human BCC, this persisting, slow-cycling tumour population expresses LGR5 and is characterized by active Wnt signalling. Combining Lgr5 lineage ablation or inhibition of Wnt signalling with vismodegib treatment leads to eradication of BCC. Our results show that vismodegib induces tumour regression by promoting tumour differentiation, and demonstrates that the synergy between Wnt and Smoothened inhibitors is a clinically relevant strategy for overcoming tumour relapse in BCC."
https://openalex.org/W2896794380,"Lonicera japonica is a typical Chinese herbal medicine. We previously reported a method to isolate polysaccharides from Lonicera japonica (LJP). In this study, we first performed a qualitative analysis of LJP using the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FT-IR) and explored the monosaccharide composition of LJP using the pre-column derivatization high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. We then investigated the immunomodulatory function of LJP in cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced immunosuppressed mouse models. The results showed that LJP had the characteristic absorption of typical polysaccharides consisting of 6 types of monosaccharides. In addition, LJP can increase significantly the organ index, splenic lymphocyte proliferation, macrophage phagocytosis, and natural killer (NK) cell activity in CTX-treated mice. LJP could also restore the levels of serum cytokines interleukin (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in the CTX-treated mice. Finally, the results on measuring the T-lymphocytes subsets of spleen also confirmed LJP-induced immunomodulatory activity in immunosuppressed mice from another perspective. Therefore, LJP could be used as a potential immunomodulatory agent."
https://openalex.org/W2896747239,"Background To develop targeted policy strategies to increase sports participation, more insight is needed into the behavioural patterns and preferences of users of different club-organized (i.e., sports clubs) and non-club organized (i.e., gyms, health centres or swimming pools) or informal sports settings such as public spaces. This study investigates 1) how users of different settings differ regarding self-determined motivations and goals, and sociodemographic and sports-related characteristics, and 2) how the association of motivations and goals with sports participation may differ between users of different sports settings. Methods Data were collected through online surveys among Dutch adults aged 18–80 years (N = 910). Ordinal regression analyses were used to investigate the effects of sports settings, the level of self-determined motivations and goals, and interaction effects of motivations and goals with different sports settings, on sports frequency. Results Users of different sports settings differed in their personal characteristics, motivations and goals. In general, controlled motivations were negatively associated with sports frequency (B = -0.46). However, among club members, extrinsic goals related to image (B = 0.44), as well as intrinsic goals related to skill development (B = 0.40) and social affiliation (B = 0.47) had significant positive associations with sports frequency. Health-related goals significantly increased sports frequency among users of informal settings, such as public spaces. Conclusion The association of motivational variables with sports participation differs between settings. This implies that sports frequency is higher when participants engage in settings that better fit their motivations and goals. Because of the growing importance of informal and flexible settings and health goals, professionals in the sports and health domains should take into account the motivations, goals and needs of different target groups who (want to) use unorganized, informal sports settings including public spaces."
https://openalex.org/W2896556665,"Seagrass meadows are among the most important coastal/ marine ecosystems for long-term carbon storage and conditioning of coastal waters. A combined air-water flux of CO2 and CH4 from the seagrass meadows was studied for the first time from Asia’s largest brackish–water lagoon, Chilika, India. Ecosystem-based comparisons were carried out during two hydrologically different conditions of dry and wet seasons in the seagrass dominated southern sector (SS); macrophyte-dominated northern sector (NS); the largely un-vegetated central sector (CS) and the tidally active outer channel (OC) of the lagoon. The mean fluxes of CO2 from SS, NS, CS and OC were 9.8, 146.6, 48.4 and 33.0mM m-2d-1, and that of CH4 were 0.12, 0.11, 0.05 and 0.07mM m-2d-1, respectively. The net emissions (in terms of CO2 equivalents), considering the global warming potential of CO2 (GWP: 1) and CH4 (GWP: 28) from seagrass meadows were over 14 times lower compared to the macrophyte-dominated sector of the lagoon. Contrasting emissivity characteristics of CO2 and CH4 were observed between macrophytes and seagrass, with the former being a persistent source of CO2. It is inferred that although seagrass meadows act as a weak source of CH4, they could be effective sinks of CO2 if land-based pollution sources are minimized."
https://openalex.org/W2898013775,"Background Human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cells are a critical cell source for ovarian cancer research; however, they are difficult to obtain and maintain under standard laboratory conditions in large quantities. The aim of this study was to generate immortalized HOSE (IHOSE) cells with maintained properties to the original cell source, thereby guaranteeing a sufficiently large cell quantity for ovarian cancer research. Methods HOSE cells isolated from four non-cancer patients and five IHOSE cell lines were established by induction of HPV-E6/E7 expression or SV40 large T antigen using a lenti-viral system. Each of IHOSE cells was confirmed to be distinct by STR profiling. RNA-sequencing was used to compare gene expression profiles in HOSE, IHOSE and ovarian cancer cells. Results RNA-sequencing results revealed a stronger linear correlation in gene expression between IHOSE and HOSE cells (R2 = 0.9288) than between IHOSE or HOSE cells and ovarian cancer cells (R2 = 0.8562 and R2 = 0.7982, respectively). The gene expression pattern of 319 differentially expressed genes revealed minimal differences between HOSE and IHOSE cells, while a strong difference between ovarian cancer cells and HOSE or IHOSE cells was observed. Furthermore, the five IHOSE cell lines displayed morphological characteristics typical of epithelial cells but showed a lower level of EpCAM, CD133 and E-cadherin, as cancer stem marker, than ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, unlike cancer cells, IHOSE cells could not form colonies in the anchorage-independent soft agar growth assay. Conclusion These findings demonstrate that five newly established IHOSE cell lines have characteristics of progenitor HOSE cells while exhibiting continuous growth, and thus, should be highly useful as control cells for ovarian cancer research."
https://openalex.org/W2896101021,"The environmental and health impacts of reliance on solid fuels and traditional cookstoves in low-income countries have motivated the promotion of household cooking energy systems that use cleaner burning fuels and cookstoves that lead to reduced exposure to harmful pollutants. Little is known about adoption and use of such systems from the users' perspective.We explored the facilitators and barriers to adoption and use of a private sector marketed household cooking energy system that uses sustainably produced biomass pellets and the cleanest burning fan micro-gasification stove currently available. We conducted 48 in-depth qualitative interviews in Gisenyi, Rwanda with decision-makers and cooks in 16 households that adopted the improved cookstove system and 8 non-adopter households.Reported facilitators and barriers to adoption and non-adoption, as well as use and non-use were complex, and in some cases, contradictory. Some adopters noted that cleanliness and low smoke production were major facilitators to adoption and use, while other adopters and non-adopters said the cookstoves blackened and damaged cooking pots and produced excessive smoke. Our findings suggest that correct use of the stove mediates user experience. Cost was likewise reported as a facilitator among some adopters and a barrier among other adopters and non-adopters. Peer influence played a significant role as both a barrier and a facilitator to adoption and transcended other factors. Positive peer influence describing the cleanliness, affordability, and efficiency of the cookstove system encouraged adoption and use, while negative comments by peers regarding excessive smoke and damaged cooking pots discouraged adoption. Commentaries by some participants suggest that inadequate training and instruction may be primary causes of the discrepancies.Cost, cleanliness, communication among peer networks, and adequate training and instruction are important factors associated with the adoption and use of improved cookstoves and should be prioritized in the implementation of improved cookstove programs."
https://openalex.org/W2897739503,"The role of tobacco-smoke exposure on serum vitamin D concentration in US pediatric population is not known. We hypothesized that tobacco smoke exposure would increase the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in US children.Representative national data were accessed from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2010 databank on 2,263 subjects of ages 3 to 17 years. Subjects were categorized into two groups based on their age: children, if <10 years; and youth if 10 to 17 years. Descriptive and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the effect of serum cotinine-verified tobacco smoke exposure on vitamin D status after controlling for key sociodemographic confounders. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D <20 ng/mL, insufficiency as 25(OH)D of 20-29.9 ng/mL, and sufficiency as 25(OH)D of ≥30 ng/mL. Tobacco smoke exposure status was defined by serum cotinine concentration as follows: unexposed and non-smoking (<0.05 ng/mL) and exposed (passive and active smokers combined) (≥0.05ng/mL). Specifically, passive and active smoking were defined as cotinine of 0.05-10 ng/mL, and ≥10ng/mL respectively.The prevalence of second-hand smoke exposure was 42.0% (95%CI, 36.7%-47.5%); while the prevalence of active smoking among teenagers was 9.0% (95%CI, 6.2%-12.5%). Vitamin D deficiency occurred at a frequency of 15.1% in children unexposed to tobacco smoke, 20.9% in children exposed to passive tobacco smoke, and 18.0% among actively smoking youth (p<0.001). Tobacco smoke exposure independently predicted vitamin D deficiency after controlling for age, sex, race, BMI, maternal education, and family socio-economic status (OR:1.50; 95%CI, 1.14-1.85, p = 0.002).This analysis of a nationwide database reports that tobacco smoke exposure is an independent predictor of vitamin D deficiency in US children."
https://openalex.org/W2897332282,"Correctly ordering a sequence of speech sounds is a crucial aspect of speech production. Although studies have yielded a rich body of data on the neural substrates of visuomotor sequencing and sequence learning, research on brain regions and their functions involving speech sequence production hasn’t attracted much attention until recently. Previous functional MRI studies manipulating the complexity of sequences at the phonemic, syllabic, and suprasyllabic levels have revealed a network of motor-related cortical and sub-cortical speech regions. In this study, we directly compared human brain activity measured with functional MRI during processing of a sequence of syllables compared with the same syllables processed individually. Among a network of regions independently identified as being part of the sensorimotor circuits for speech production, only the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis, lIFG), the supplementary motor area (SMA), and the left inferior parietal lobe (lIPL) responded more during the production of syllable sequences compared to producing the same syllables articulated one at a time."
https://openalex.org/W2894672228,"α-Ketoglutarate (αKG) is a key node in many important metabolic pathways. The αKG analog N-oxalylglycine (NOG) and its cell-permeable prodrug dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) are extensively used to inhibit αKG-dependent dioxygenases. However, whether NOG interference with other αKG-dependent processes contributes to its mode of action remains poorly understood. Here we show that, in aqueous solutions, DMOG is rapidly hydrolyzed, yielding methyloxalylglycine (MOG). MOG elicits cytotoxicity in a manner that depends on its transport by monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2) and is associated with decreased glutamine-derived tricarboxylic acid-cycle flux, suppressed mitochondrial respiration and decreased ATP production. MCT2-facilitated entry of MOG into cells leads to sufficiently high concentrations of NOG to inhibit multiple enzymes in glutamine metabolism, including glutamate dehydrogenase. These findings reveal that MCT2 dictates the mode of action of NOG by determining its intracellular concentration and have important implications for the use of (D)MOG in studying αKG-dependent signaling and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2897019435,"To determine the prevalence of asymptomatic dengue virus-infected blood donors during the largest dengue outbreak in Taiwan history occurred in 2015, we examined the evidence of dengue virus (DENV) infection by the detection of DENV RNA genome using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR), DENV NS1 antigen using rapid diagnosis test (RDT) and anti-dengue antibody using IgM/IgG capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (capture ELISA) and RDT in eight thousand serum samples from blood donations to the blood centers of the Taiwan Blood Services Foundation (TBSF) in Kaohsiung City and Tainan City during the largest dengue outbreak in Taiwan history occurred in 2015. Only one serum sample was positive for DENV RNA detection by using dengue-specific real-time RT-PCR, the virus was DENV-2 determined by serotype-specific real-time RT-PCR and sequencing, and the DENVs in the serum were confirmed as being infectious by a plaque assay. The recipient of this blood did not develop any dengue fever symptom on follow-up. None of the samples was NS1 RDT-reactive. Seventeen IgM-positive samples were identified. There was a low prevalence of asymptomatic confirmed or probable DENV-infected blood donors in our study (0.013% and 0.21%, respectively), and no symptomatic transfusion-transmitted dengue (TT dengue) was developed during the largest dengue outbreak in Taiwan history in highly endemic areas and periods."

The findings can inform programmes to reduce maternal mortality. During 2007–15, 136 maternal deaths were reported in Chandigarh, India. Using World Health Organisation’s verbal autopsy questionnaire, interviews were conducted with primary caregivers of 68 (50%) of the 136 deceased women, as majority of the families had returned to their native places. We used process-tracing techniques to construct the care pathways and identify delays, and explored open-ended responses using thematic analysis. The mean age of the deceased women was 27 years, 51% resided in slums, 32% were primigravida, 25% had their deliveries assisted by traditional birth attendants, and 23% had Caesarean section. Eight percent died at home, and 54% died in tertiary level facilities. Post-partum haemorrhage (26.5%), and complications of puerperium (25%) and labour/delivery (14.7%) were the reported medical causes. Male child preference and norms for home delivery were identified as the distal socio-cultural causes. Individual and family level factors included: shame on multiple pregnancies; fear of discrimination from providers; past successful deliveries at home leading to overconfidence and not seeking institutional care; and lack of awareness about family planning, antenatal care, and danger signs of pregnancy. Healthcare system factors were: non-availability of senior doctors at the time of consultation in the emergency that delayed initiation of immediate treatment, and lack of availability of life-saving equipment due to patient load. Empirical evidence was found on social causes of maternal deaths, which could have been prevented by appropriate actions at individual, family, societal, institutional and policy levels. This study identified potential preventable causes of primarily social origin, which could help in taking actionable steps at several levels to further reduce maternal deaths in India."
https://openalex.org/W2896114422,"Platelets have been implicated in pulmonary inflammation following exposure to bacterial stimuli. The mechanisms involved in the platelet-mediated host response to respiratory bacterial infection remain incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate that platelet-derived chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 4 (CXCL4) plays critical roles in a mouse model of acute bacterial pneumonia using Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Platelets are activated during P. aeruginosa infection, and mice depleted of platelets display markedly increased mortality and impaired bacterial clearance. CXCL4 deficiency impairs bacterial clearance and lung epithelial permeability, which correlate with decreased neutrophil recruitment to BALF. Interestingly, CXCL4 deficiency selectively regulates chemokine production, suggesting that CXCL4 has an impact on other chemokine expression. In addition, CXCL4 deficiency reduces platelet-neutrophil interactions in blood following P. aeruginosa infection. Further studies revealed that platelet-derived CXCL4 contributes to the P. aeruginosa-killing of neutrophils. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that CXCL4 is a vital chemokine that plays critical roles in bacterial clearance during P. aeruginosa infection through recruiting neutrophils to the lungs and intracellular bacterial killing."
https://openalex.org/W2896175173,"The activation of peroxisomeproliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α can stimulate the expression of ceramide-related enzymes, and a major component of strawberry seed extract (SSE) tiliroside enhances the expression of PPARα. We determined whether SSE and tiliroside may stimulate ceramide synthesis in the stratum corneum (SC) of the human epidermal equivalents (HEEs) culture model. Treatment with SSE at 1.0 and 3.0 μg/mL elicited a significant increase in the total ceramide content in the SC, which was accompanied by a significant increase in almost all ceramide species except for ceramide [EOS] and [AP]. Treatment with tiliroside at 0.3 μg/mL slightly accentuated the total ceramide content in the SC together with a significant increase in the ceramide [NS, NDS] content. Messenger RNA analysis demonstrated that SSE at 1 or 3 μg/mL significantly stimulated the gene expression of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) 2, ceramide synthase (CerS) 3, glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), and β-glucocerebrosidase (GBA) but not of SPT1, sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) 1/2 and acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). In contrast, tiliroside elicited significant increases in the gene expression levels of GCS and GBA only at 0.3 and/or 0.1 μg/mL. Western blotting analysis revealed that both SSE and tiliroside enhanced the protein expression levels of GCS and GBA but not of SPT2 at 1 or 3 and 0.1 or 0.3 μg/mL, respectively. These findings suggested that both SSE and tiliroside have a distinct potential to stimulate the level of ceramide [NS, NDS] in the SC by enhancing the expression of GCS and GBA. The higher stimulatory effect with SSE than tiliroside on SC ceramide synthesis correlates with the significant increase observed with SSE but not tiliroside in the gene expression levels of SPT2 and CerS3. Therefore, it is anticipated that SSE is effective in improving skin barrier function and moisture retention in several ceramide-deficit skin conditions, including surfactant-induced roughened skin, xerosis, and atopic dermatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2896825546,"Motion in a distorted virtual 3D space may cause visually induced motion sickness. Geometric distortions in stereoscopic 3D can result from mismatches among image capture, display, and viewing parameters. Three pairs of potential mismatches are considered, including 1) camera separation vs. eye separation, 2) camera field of view (FOV) vs. screen FOV, and 3) camera convergence distance (i.e., distance from the cameras to the point where the convergence axes intersect) vs. screen distance from the observer. The effect of the viewer’s head positions (i.e., head lateral offset from the screen center) is also considered. The geometric model is expressed as a function of camera convergence distance, the ratios of the three parameter-pairs, and the offset of the head position. We analyze the impacts of these five variables separately and their interactions on geometric distortions. This model facilitates insights into the various distortions and leads to methods whereby the user can minimize geometric distortions caused by some parameter-pair mismatches through adjusting of other parameter pairs. For example, in postproduction, viewers can correct for a mismatch between camera separation and eye separation by adjusting their distance from the real screen and changing the effective camera convergence distance."
https://openalex.org/W2897156969,"BG-Malaria (BGM) trap is a simple adaptation of the widely-used BG-Sentinel trap (BGS). It is proven to be highly effective for trapping the Brazilian malaria vector, Anopheles darlingi, in field conditions, and the African vector, Anopheles arabiensis, under controlled semi-field environments, but has not been field-tested in Africa. Here, we validated the BGM for field sampling of malaria vectors in south-eastern Tanzania. Using a series of Latin-Square experiments conducted nightly (6pm-7am) in rural villages, we compared mosquito catches between BGM, BGS and human landing catches (HLC). We also compared BGMs baited with different attractants (Ifakara-blend, Mbita-blend, BG-Lure and CO2). Lastly, we tested BGMs baited with Ifakara-blend from three odour-dispensing methods (BG-Cartridge, BG-Sachet and Nylon strips). One-tenth of the field-collected female Anopheles gambiae s.l. and Anopheles funestus were dissected to assess parity. BGM captured more An. gambiae s.l. than BGS (p < 0.001), but HLC caught more than either trap (p < 0.001). However, BGM captured more An. funestus than HLC. Proportions of parous An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus consistently exceeded 50%, with no significant difference between methods. While the dominant species caught by HLC was An. gambiae s.l. (56.0%), followed by Culex spp. (33.1%) and Mansonia spp. (6.0%), the BGM caught mostly Culex (81.6%), followed by An. gambiae s.l. (10.6%) and Mansonia (5.8%). The attractant-baited BGMs were all significantly superior to un-baited controls (p < 0.001), although no difference was found between the specific attractants. The BG-Sachet was the most efficient dispenser for capturing An. gambiae s.l. (14.5(2.75-42.50) mosquitoes/trap/night), followed by BG-Cartridge (7.5(1.75-26.25)). The BGM caught more mosquitoes than BGS in field-settings, but sampled similar species diversity and physiological states as BGS. The physiological states of malaria vectors caught in BGM and BGS were similar to those naturally attempting to bite humans (HLC). The BGM was most efficient when baited with Ifakara blend, dispensed from BG-Sachet. We conclude that though BGM traps have potential for field-sampling of host-seeking African malaria vectors with representative physiological states, both BGM and BGS predominantly caught more culicines than Anopheles, compared to HLC, which caught mostly An. gambiae s.l."
https://openalex.org/W2897294638,"Child victims' reports of psychological and physical abuse by caregivers are a fundamental source of information beyond official records and caregiver reports. However, few or no sensitive and age-appropriate child-report instruments exist that have undergone in-depth validity and reliability testing across a broad age-range. Our study addresses this gap by examining psychometric properties of a picture-based, modularized version of the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale (CTSPC-R), encompassing the maltreatment subtypes of psychological and physical abuse. A sample of 904 children and adolescents aged 4-16 years from the community (n = 568), child psychiatric services (n = 159), and from Child Protective Services (CPS; n = 177) completed the CTSPC-R. Measures to test convergent (maltreatment in parent interviews and CPS records) and concurrent validity (psychiatric symptoms) were collected. The CTSPC-R comprises 22 items, arranged in three severity modules by increasing level of psychological and physical abuse by caregivers. Companion picture cards were provided for children aged 4 and 8 years. The best fit to the data was attained with a second-order factor model, assuming three inter-correlated factors corresponding to the three severity modules, and a latent second-order factor representing combined physical and psychological abuse. The three factors showed good internal consistencies. Supporting convergent validity at the global and subtype-level of maltreatment, the CTSPC-R severity scale was associated with lifetime CPS-contact, presence of caregiver-reported emotional maltreatment and physical abuse, and dimensions of chronicity and severity. Discriminant validity was supported by non-significant correlations with caregiver-reported lack of supervision, failure to provide, and sexual abuse. Bolstering concurrent validity, moderate and severe physical abuse predicted caregiver-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. These effects were independent of child age, gender or community vs. non-community samples. Our study supports the CTSPC-R as a scientifically and clinically sound tool for ascertaining the child's own perspective on psychological and physical abuse from an early age onwards."
https://openalex.org/W2897723853,"Female-dominant tendinopathies are musculoskeletal disorders caused by repetitive hand posture and motion; they are considered overuse syndromes. Both external mechanical stress and changes in hormone levels might affect disease progression. We have previously reported that estrogen receptor-β (ER)-β expression was associated with the pathogenesis of de Quervain's disease. To study the underlying mechanisms, a cyclic stretching culture system was applied to tendon tissue from ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Furthermore, a collagenase I-induced rat tendinopathy model was established to examine the association of ER-β with disease progression. Our results showed that ER-β expression and the number of apoptotic cells were higher and associated with disease severity in rats with tendinopathy. Mechanical stress altered the morphology of primary tenocytes and collagen fiber alignment in tendons, and up-regulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9, ER-β, and interleukin-1β, as well as induced apoptosis in tenocytes and tendon tissue from OVX rats. This is the first report on the effects of ER-β and mechanical stress in tendinopathy. We hope these findings contribute to new pharmacological therapies targeting ER-β signaling pathways to treat tendon-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2897511558,"The study of genome size variation can contribute valuable information on species relationships as well as correlate to several morphological or ecological features, among others. Here we provide an extensive report on genome sizes on genus Tripleurospermum and its closely related genus Matricaria, which are two typically Mediterranean genera particularly widespread and diverse in Turkey, the origin of most of the populations here studied. We analyse and discuss genome size variation in the first relatively complete molecular phylogenetic framework of Tripleurospermum (based on ITS and ETS ribosomal DNA–rDNA–regions). We find cases of intraspecific genome size variation, which could be taxonomically significant. Genome downsizing is also detected as the typical response to polyploidisation in Tripleurospermum taxa, being most conspicuous at the tetraploid level. Several positive correlations with genome size, including those with pollen and stomatal size or cypsela length, among others, are also found. Remarkably, taxa presenting rhizomes tend to present higher genome sizes, confirming a trend to accumulate nuclear DNA in such species, which could be explained by the nutrient reserves availability in their storage organs, allowing genome expansion, or by the lower rates of sexual reproduction in rhizomatous taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2894683475,"This work demonstrates a new method for the generation of mechanical shear wave during magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) that creates greater forces at higher vibrational frequencies as opposed to conventionally used pneumatic transducers. We developed an MR-compatible pneumatic turbine with an eccentric mass that creates a sinusoidal centrifugal force. The turbine was assessed with respect to its technical parameters and evaluated for MRE on a custom-made anthropomorphic prostate phantom. The silicone-based tissue-mimicking materials of the phantom were selected with regard to their complex shear moduli examined by rheometric testing. The tissue-mimicking materials closely matched human soft tissue elasticity values with a complex shear modulus ranging from 3.21 kPa to 7.29 kPa. We acquired MRE images on this phantom at 3 T with actuation frequencies of 50, 60 Hz, 70 Hz, and 80 Hz. The turbine generated vibrational wave amplitudes sufficiently large to entirely penetrate the phantoms during the feasibility study. Increased wave length in the stiffer inclusions compared to softer background material were detected. Our initial results suggest that silicone-based phantoms are useful for the evaluation of elasticities during MRE. Furthermore, our turbine seems suitable for the mechanical assessment of soft tissue during MRE."
https://openalex.org/W2896355545,"There is increasing interest in the search for accurate, repeatable and widely applicable clinical biomarkers for the early detection of cardiometabolic alterations and oxidative status. Viscosity is a promising tool in that sense, although most studies have used simple viscosimeters, providing limited information, and have not considered oxidative status. The aim of this study was to assess whether viscosity determinations were associated with cardiometabolic and oxidative status in subjects at a primary stage of cardiometabolic risk. A pilot study (n = 20) was conducted in subjects with abdominal obesity, determining urine and plasma viscosity with a rotational rheometer at different shear rates (10000–1000 s–1 in plasma and 1000–50 s–1 in urine). Simple regression showed that urine viscosity was significantly (p< 0.05) associated with markers of oxidative status, and plasma viscosity with blood glucose. Categorical Principal Component Analysis plots showed that urine viscosity measurements at different shear rates clustered in three groups (low, intermediate and high shear rates) were selectively associated with uric acid, polyphenols and antioxidant capacity respectively. Plasma viscosity did not seem to be a relevant clinical marker in subjects with abdominal obesity. Therefore, urine viscosity could potentially serve as a complimentary marker in the evaluation of oxidative status."

https://openalex.org/W2896631553,"Sexual reproduction and meiotic recombination generate new genetic combinations and may thereby help an individual infected by a parasite to protect its offspring from being infected. While this idea is often used to understand the evolutionary forces underlying the maintenance of sex and recombination, it also suggests that infected individuals should increase plastically their rate of recombination. We tested the latter idea with the mosquito Aedes aegypti and asked whether females infected by the microsporidian Vavraia culicis were more likely to have recombinant offspring than uninfected females. To measure the rate of recombination over a chromosome we analysed combinations of microsatellites on chromosome 3 in infected and uninfected females, in the (uninfected) males they copulated with and in their offspring. As predicted, the infected females were more likely to have recombinant offspring than the uninfected ones. These results show the ability of a female to diversify her offspring in response to parasitic infection by plastically increasing her recombination rate."
https://openalex.org/W2897421220,"Industrial gelatins have different physicochemical properties that mainly depend of the raw materials origin and the extraction conditions. These properties are closely related to the molar mass distribution of these gelatins. Several methods exist to characterize molar mass distribution of polymer, including the Asymmetrical Flow Field Flow Fractionation method. The goal of this study is to analyze the relationship between physicochemical properties and the gelatins molar mass distribution obtained by Asymmetrical Flow Field Flow Fractionation. In this study, 49 gelatins samples extracted from pig skin are characterized in terms of gel strength and viscosity and their molar mass distribution are analyzed by Asymmetrical Flow Field Flow Fractionation coupled to an Ultraviolet and Multi Angle Light Scattering detector. This analytical method is an interesting tool for studying, simultaneously, the primary chains and the high-molar-mass fraction corresponding to the polymer chains. Correlation analysis between molar mass distribution data from the different fractions highlights the importance of high molar mass polymer chains to explain the gel strength and viscosity of gelatins. These results are confirmed by an additional chemometric approach based on the UV absorbance of gelatin fractograms to predict gel strength (r2Cal = 0.85) and viscosity (r2Cal = 0.79)."
https://openalex.org/W2897342500,"Ran (ras-related nuclear protein) is a small GTPase belonging to the RAS superfamily that is specialized in nuclear trafficking. Through different accessory proteins, Ran plays key roles in several processes including nuclear import-export, mitotic progression and spindle assembly. Consequently, Ran dysfunction has been linked to several human pathologies. This work illustrates the high degree of amino acid conservation of Ran orthologues across evolution, reflected in its conserved role in nuclear trafficking. Moreover, we studied the evolutionary scenario of the pre-metazoan genetic linkage between Ran and Stx, and we hypothesized that chromosomal proximity of these two genes across metazoans could be related to a regulatory logic or a functional linkage. We studied, for the first time, Ran expression during amphioxus development and reported its presence in the neural vesicle, mouth, gill slits and gut corresponding to body regions involved in active cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2952140851,"Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are a key component of neuronal signaling and fulfil different roles depending on their composition. In electron micrograms of neurites, two types of vesicles can be distinguished by morphological criteria, the classical “clear core” vesicles (CCV) and the typically larger “dense core” vesicles (DCV), with differences in electron density due to their diverse cargos. Compared to CCVs, the precise function of DCVs is less defined. DCVs are known to store neuropeptides, which function as neuronal messengers and modulators [1]. In C. elegans, they play a role in locomotion, dauer formation, egg-laying, and mechano- and chemosensation [2]. Another type of DCVs, also referred to as granulated vesicles, are known to transport Bassoon, Piccolo and further constituents of the presynaptic density in the center of the active zone (AZ), and therefore are important for synaptogenesis [3]. To better understand the role of different types of SVs, we present here a new automated approach to classify vesicles. We combine machine learning with an extension of our previously developed vesicle segmentation workflow, the ImageJ macro 3D ART VeSElecT. With that we reliably distinguish CCVs and DCVs in electron tomograms of C. elegans NMJs using image-based features. Analysis of the underlying ground truth data shows an increased fraction of DCVs as well as a higher mean distance between DCVs and AZs in dauer larvae compared to young adult hermaphrodites. Our machine learning based tools are adaptable and can be applied to study properties of different synaptic vesicle pools in electron tomograms of diverse model organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2895155331,"Background Physician assistants are expected to have an important role in providing both primary and specialty care. Iowa has a large rural (and aging) population and faces challenges to provide equitable access to care. This study examined changes in the Iowa physician assistant workforce (1995–2015) focusing on practice setting (primary v. subspecialty care) and geographic location (rural/urban, Health Professional Shortage Area). Documenting their current locations and service in HPSAs for primary care will help health planners track future changes. Methods Data from 1995–2015 from the Iowa Health Professions Inventory (Office of Statewide Clinical Education Programs, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa) were combined with US census data on rural location and HPSA status. SPSS was used to compare Iowa and national data. Growth trends were analyzed using joinpoint regression. Results The overall Iowa physician assistant workforce increased 161% between 1995 and 2015. In 2015, more than two-thirds (71%) were female and more than 30% practiced in rural counties. The average annual growth rate of primary care PAs (per 100,000 population) was significantly higher in the periods from 1995–1997 and 1997–2001 (22.4% and 7.4% respectively) than in period from 2001–2015 (3.8%). By 2015, 56% of Iowa’s physician assistants practiced in primary care (versus 29.6% nationally). Of these, 44% of primary care physician assistants in Iowa practiced in counties, geographic locations or worksites designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas for primary care. Conclusions A high proportion of Iowa’s physician assistant workforce practiced in primary care and many served patients in Health Professional Shortage Areas. The number of physician assistants in Iowa will continue to grow and serve an important role in providing access to health care, particularly to rural Iowans."
https://openalex.org/W2897410801,"Evoked potential monitoring has evolved as an essential tool not only for elaborate neurological diagnostics, but also for general clinical practice. Moreover, it is increasingly used to guide surgical procedures and prognosticate neurological outcome in the critical care unit, e.g. after cardiac arrest. Experimental animal models aim to simulate a human-like scenario to deduct relevant clinical information for patient treatment and to test novel therapeutic opportunities. Porcine models are particularly ideal due to a comparable cardiovascular system and size. However, certain anatomic disparities have to be taken into consideration when evoked potential monitoring is used in animal models. We describe a non-invasive and reproducible set-up useful for different modalities in porcine models. We further illustrate hints to overcome multi-faceted problems commonly occurring while using this sophisticated technique. Our descriptions can be used to answer a plethora of experimental questions, and help to further facilitate experimental therapeutic innovation."
https://openalex.org/W2894549794,"Turfgrasses have been widely utilized by humans to enhance the environment for more than several centuries. Seed germination is of great importance in the development of the turfgrass industry. In this study, the seed germination models of the responses of three types of turfgrasses to water were studied. The results indicated that irrigation water was mainly related to the variation of seed volume rather than a fixed value in this experiment. The maximum k value of tall fescue, Kentucky bluegrass and perennial ryegrass is 1.1548, 1.6946 and 4.0940, respectively. The optimal value of k is 1.0617 for tall fescue, 1.4610 for Kentucky bluegrass, and 1.6614 for perennial ryegrass. Perennial ryegrass seeds are more sensitive to water than those of tall fescue and Kentucky bluegrass, and this turfgrass is the fastest to reach the maximum value of the germination rate. Based on the results from the present experiment, the seed germination function can describe the response of turfgrass seed germination to external water content variation and their sensitivities. The function obtained could be used to perform quantitative studies on the dynamic changes of seed germination under different water conditions that will contribute to improved predictions of the optimal fitting curves of the germination over a range of water."
https://openalex.org/W2896088853,"Aphids are an attractive food source to many predators and parasitoids because of their small size, soft bodies and slow movement. To combat predation, aphids evolved both behavioral and chemical defensive mechanisms that are operated via siphunculi (cornicles), differently developed structures that more or less extend from their abdomen. Although both direct and indirect linkages between siphunculi and their defensive mechanisms have been explored, their ultimate effects on aphid fitness are still broadly debated. To explicitly test the influence of siphunculi on brown citrus aphid, Aphis (Toxoptera) citricida (Kirkaldy), fitness, we razor-cut and laser-sealed the siphunculi. Siphunculi removal resulted in two distinct behavior modifications, (false aggregation and increased drop-off rates) that led to decreased survival and the loss of the ability to right themselves from an inverted position. These results together indicate that siphunculi play an important role in survival, and removal of these organs will have negative effect on aphid fitness. Furthermore, results suggested that released alarm pheromone may play an important role in communication among aphid clone-mate, and omitting it results in miscommunication and competition among clonemates. These findings will help in better understanding the aphid biology."
https://openalex.org/W2896217439,"An engineered phiC31 ""Disintegrase"" able to make an attP site in Drosophila out of an attR-attL pair is described. This was used to generate attP sites at genomic locations where a mini-white (mini-w) transgene was subject to chromosomal position effects (CPE). The first step was random genomic integration of a P-element-based transposon with an insulated mini-w transgene. We then removed the upstream insulator using FLP recombinase to detect CPE. Next mini-w and the downstream insulator were ""dis-integrated"" leaving behind an attP site. The location is marked by a yellow+ transgene that is flanked by loxP sites, so it can also be removed. Using this system, we generated 10 new attP landing platforms. Three of these showing strong activating CPE were selected for further analysis. We show that the attP sites are functional by integrating in plasmids with attB sites. The CPE is recapitulated and can be blocked by insulators. We show that a dimerized 215 bp fragment of the 500 bp BEAF-dependent scs' insulator containing a high affinity BEAF binding site blocks the CPE, while a monomer of the sequence is less effective. This indicates that two BEAF binding sites make a stronger insulator than a single site. This system could be useful for generating attP sites at prescreened sites for other purposes, such as studying CPE in embryos or other tissues or for use with ""trapped"" enhancers of interest."
