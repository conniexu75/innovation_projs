https://openalex.org/W3008198525,"Tissue repair after spinal cord injury requires the mobilization of immune and glial cells to form a protective barrier that seals the wound and facilitates debris clearing, inflammatory containment and matrix compaction. This process involves corralling, wherein phagocytic immune cells become confined to the necrotic core, which is surrounded by an astrocytic border. Here we elucidate a temporally distinct gene signature in injury-activated microglia and macrophages (IAMs) that engages axon guidance pathways. Plexin-B2 is upregulated in IAMs and is required for motor sensory recovery after spinal cord injury. Plexin-B2 deletion in myeloid cells impairs corralling, leading to diffuse tissue damage, inflammatory spillover and hampered axon regeneration. Corralling begins early and requires Plexin-B2 in both microglia and macrophages. Mechanistically, Plexin-B2 promotes microglia motility, steers IAMs away from colliding cells and facilitates matrix compaction. Our data therefore establish Plexin-B2 as an important link that integrates biochemical cues and physical interactions of IAMs with the injury microenvironment during wound healing."

We investigated the interactions between explicit strategy and implicit motor adaptation by designing a sensorimotor learning paradigm that drives adaptive changes in some dimensions but not others. We find that strategy and implicit adaptation synergize in driven dimensions, but effectively cancel each other in undriven dimensions. Independent analyses—based on time lags, the correlational structure in the data and computational modeling—demonstrate that this cancellation occurs because implicit adaptation effectively compensates for noise in explicit strategy rather than the converse, acting to clean up the motor noise resulting from low-fidelity explicit strategy during motor learning. These results provide new insight into why implicit learning increasingly takes over from explicit strategy as skill learning proceeds. Implicit learning increases the fidelity of performance during motor learning by acting to adaptively clean up the noise resulting from a low-fidelity explicit strategy."

Despite an explosion of cross-disciplinary interest in researching the gut microbiome, there remains to be a gold-standard method for operationalizing gut microbiome alpha diversity. Given researchers’ interest in examining the relationships among gut microbiome alpha diversity and health-related outcomes of interest, a way of operationalizing the microbiome that yields a numeric value, which could be used in common statistical approaches, is needed. Thus, the current study aims to provide methodological guidance for how to operationalize microbiome alpha diversity. Findings suggest that alpha diversity of the human gut microbiome is comprised of two sub-constructs (richness and evenness), and we propose a step-by-step method of creating alpha diversity composite measures based on this key insight. Finally, we demonstrate that our empirically derived richness and evenness composite measures are significantly associated with health-related variables of interest (alcohol use, symptoms of depression) among a human clinical sample."

These PrPC polymorphisms can affect prion transmission, disease progression, neuropathology, and emergence of new prion strains, but the mechanistic steps in prion evolution are not understood. Here, using conformation-dependent immunoassay, conformation stability assay, and protein-misfolding cyclic amplification, we monitored the conformational and phenotypic characteristics of CWD prions passaged through deer and transgenic mice expressing different cervid PrPC polymorphisms. We observed that transmission through hosts with distinct PrPC sequences diversifies the PrPCWD conformations and causes a shift toward oligomers with defined structural organization, replication rate, and host range. When passaged in host environments that restrict prion replication, distinct co-existing PrPCWD conformers underwent competitive selection, stabilizing a new prion strain. Nonadaptive conformers exhibited unstable replication and accumulated only to low levels. These results suggest a continuously evolving diversity of CWD conformers and imply a critical interplay between CWD prion plasticity and PrPC polymorphisms during prion strain evolution.

https://openalex.org/W3009593324,"Systematic collection of mortality/morbidity data over time is crucial for monitoring trends in population health, developing health policies, assessing the impact of health programs. In Poland, a comprehensive analysis describing trends in disease burden for major conditions has never been published. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides data on the burden of over 300 diseases in 195 countries since 1990. We used the GBD database to undertake an assessment of disease burden in Poland, evaluate changes in population health between 1990-2017, and compare Poland with other Central European (CE) countries.The results of GBD 2017 for 1990 and 2017 for Poland and CE were used to assess rates and trends in years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Data came from cause-of-death registration systems, population health surveys, disease registries, hospitalization databases, and the scientific literature. Analytical approaches have been used to adjust for missing data, errors in cause-of-death certification, and differences in data collection methodology. Main estimation strategies were ensemble modelling for mortality and Bayesian meta-regression for disability.Between 1990-2017, age-standardized YLL rates for all causes declined in Poland by 46.0% (95% UI: 43.7-48.2), YLD rates declined by 4.0% (4.2-4.9), DALY rates by 31.7% (29.2-34.4). For both YLLs and YLDs, greater relative declines were observed for females. There was a large decrease in communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disease DALYs (48.2%; 46.3-50.4). DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) decreased slightly (2.0%; 0.1-4.6). In 2017, Poland performed better than CE as a whole (ranked fourth for YLLs, sixth for YLDs, and fifth for DALYs) and achieved greater reductions in YLLs and DALYs than most CE countries. In 2017 and 1990, the leading cause of YLLs and DALYs in Poland and CE was ischaemic heart disease (IHD), and the leading cause of YLDs was low back pain. In 2017, the top 20 causes of YLLs and YLDs in Poland and CE were the same, although in different order. In Poland, age-standardized DALYs from neonatal causes, other cardiovascular and circulatory diseases, and road injuries declined substantially between 1990-2017, while alcohol use disorders and chronic liver diseases increased. The highest observed-to-expected ratios were seen for alcohol use disorders for YLLs, neonatal sepsis for YLDs, and falls for DALYs (3.21, 2.65, and 2.03, respectively).There was relatively little geographical variation in premature death and disability in CE in 2017, although some between-country differences existed. Health in Poland has been improving since 1990; in 2017 Poland outperformed CE as a whole for YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs. While the health gap between Poland and Western Europe has diminished, it remains substantial. The shift to NCDs and chronic disability, together with marked between-gender health inequalities, poses a challenge for the Polish health-care system. IHD is still the leading cause of disease burden in Poland, but DALYs from IHD are declining. To further reduce disease burden, an integrated response focused on NCDs and population groups with disproportionally high burden is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3009862607,"Jaundice is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the newborn. Globally, early identification and home monitoring are significant challenges in reducing the incidence of jaundice-related neurological damage. Smartphone cameras are promising as colour-based screening tools as they are low-cost, objective and ubiquitous. We propose a novel smartphone method to screen for neonatal jaundice by imaging the sclera. It does not rely on colour calibration cards or accessories, which may facilitate its adoption at scale and in less economically developed regions. Our approach is to explicitly address three confounding factors in relating colour to jaundice: (1) skin pigmentation, (2) ambient light, and (3) camera spectral response. (1) The variation in skin pigmentation is avoided by imaging the sclera. (2) With the smartphone screen acting as an illuminating flash, a flash/ no-flash image pair is captured using the front-facing camera. The contribution of ambient light is subtracted. (3) In principle, this permits a device- and ambient-independent measure of sclera chromaticity following a one-time calibration. We introduce the concept of Scleral-Conjunctival Bilirubin (SCB), in analogy with Transcutaneous Bilirubin (TcB). The scleral chromaticity is mapped to an SCB value. A pilot study was conducted in the UCL Hospital Neonatal Care Unit (n = 37). Neonates were imaged using a specially developed app concurrently with having a blood test for total serum bilirubin (TSB). The better of two models for SCB based on ambient-subtracted sclera chromaticity achieved r = 0.75 (p<0.01) correlation with TSB. Ambient subtraction improved chromaticity estimates in proof-of-principle laboratory tests and screening performance within our study sample. Using an SCB decision threshold of 190μmol/L, the sensitivity was 100% (specificity 61%) in identifying newborns with TSB>250μmol/L (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, AUROC, 0.86), and 92% (specificity 67%) in identifying newborns with TSB>205μmol/L (AUROC 0.85). These results are comparable to modern transcutaneous bilirubinometers."
https://openalex.org/W3009715240,"Abstract Molecular characteristics of carcinoma arising from mature cystic teratoma of the ovary (MCT) remain unclear due to its rarity. We analyzed RNA-sequencing data of 2322 pan-cancer [1378 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 6 adenosquamous carcinomas (ASC), and 938 adenocarcinomas (AC)] including six carcinomas arising from MCT (four SCCs, one ASC, and one AC). Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis showed that gene expression profiles of carcinomas arising from MCT were different between each histological type and that gene expression profiles of SCCs arising MCT (MCT-SCCs) was apparently similar to those of lung SCCs. By epidermis-associated pathways activity based on gene set enrichment analysis, 1030 SCCs were divided into two groups: epidermis-signature high (head and neck, esophagus, and skin) and low (cervix, lung, and MCT). In addition to pan-SCC transcriptome analysis, cytokeratin profiling based on immunohistochemistry in the independent samples of 21 MCT-SCCs clarified that MCT-SCC dominantly expressed CK18, suggesting the origin of MCT-SCC was columnar epithelium. Subsequently, we investigated differentially expressed genes in MCT-SCCs compared with different SCCs and identified XCL1 was specifically overexpressed in MCT-SCCs. Through immunohistochemistry analysis, we identified XCL1 expression on tumor cells in 13/24 (54%) of MCT-SCCs but not in MCTs. XCL1 expression was also significantly associated with the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8-positive T cells and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. XCL1 produced by tumor cells may induce PD1/PD-L1 interaction and dysfunction of CD8-positive T cells in tumor microenvironment. XCL1 expression may be a novel biomarker for malignant transformation of MCT into SCC and a biomarker candidate for therapeutic response to an anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3007657682,"The neural retina metabolizes glucose through aerobic glycolysis generating large amounts of lactate. Lactate flux into and out of cells is regulated by proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), which are encoded by members of the Slc16a family. MCT1, MCT3, and MCT4 are expressed in the retina and require association with the accessory protein basigin, encoded by Bsg, for maturation and trafficking to the plasma membrane. Bsg-/- mice have severely reduced electroretinograms (ERGs) and progressive photoreceptor degeneration, which is presumed to be driven by metabolic dysfunction resulting from loss of MCTs. To understand the basis of the Bsg-/- phenotype, we generated mice with conditional deletion of Bsg in rods (RodΔBsg), cones (Cone∆Bsg), or retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPEΔBsg). RodΔBsg mice showed a progressive loss of photoreceptors, while ConeΔBsg mice did not display a degenerative phenotype. The RPEΔBsg mice developed a distinct phenotype characterized by severely reduced ERG responses as early as 4 weeks of age. The loss of lactate transporters from the RPE most closely resembled the phenotype of the Bsg-/- mouse, suggesting that the regulation of lactate levels in the RPE and the subretinal space is essential for the viability and function of photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W3008635968,"Abstract Lung cancer occurrence and associated mortality ranks top in all countries. Despite the rapid development of targeted and immune therapies, many patients experience relapse within a few years. It is urgent to uncover the mechanisms that drive lung cancer progression and identify novel molecular targets. Our group has previously identified FGF19 as a prognostic marker and potential driver gene of lung squamous cell carcinomas (LSQ) in Chinese smoking patients. However, the underlying mechanism of how FGF19 promotes the progression of LSQ remains unclear. In this study, we characterized and confirmed that FGF19 serves as an oncogenic driver in LSQ development and progression, and reported that the amplification and high expression of FGF19 in LSQ was significantly associated with poor overall and progression-free survival. A higher serum level of FGF19 was found in lung cancer patients, which could also serve as a novel diagnostic index to screen lung cancer. Overproduction of FGF19 in LSQ cells markedly promoted cell growth, progression and metastasis, while downregulating FGF19 effectively inhibited LSQ progression in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, downregulating the receptor FGFR4 was also effective to suppress the growth and migration of LSQ cells. Since FGF19 could be induced by smoking or endoplasmic reticulum stress, to tackle the more malignant FGF19-overproducing LSQ, we reported for the first time that inhibiting mTOR pathway by using AZD2014 was effective and feasible. These findings have offered a new strategy by using anti-FGF19/FGFR4 therapy or mTOR-based therapy in FGF19-driven LSQ."
https://openalex.org/W3008903683,"Motor protein-based active transport is essential for mRNA localization and local translation in animal cells, yet how mRNA granules interact with motor proteins remains poorly understood. Using an unbiased yeast two–hybrid screen for interactions between murine RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and motor proteins, here we identified protein interaction with APP tail-1 (PAT1) as a potential direct adapter between zipcode-binding protein 1 (ZBP1, a β-actin RBP) and the kinesin-I motor complex. The amino acid sequence of mouse PAT1 is similar to that of the kinesin light chain (KLC), and we found that PAT1 binds to KLC directly. Studying PAT1 in mouse primary hippocampal neuronal cultures from both sexes and using structured illumination microscopic imaging of these neurons, we observed that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) enhances co-localization of dendritic ZBP1 and PAT1 within granules that also contain kinesin-I. PAT1 is essential for BDNF-stimulated neuronal growth cone development and dendritic protrusion formation, and we noted that ZBP1 and PAT1 co-locate along with β-actin mRNA in actively transported granules in living neurons. Acute disruption of the PAT1–ZBP1 interaction in neurons with PAT1 siRNA or a dominant-negative ZBP1 construct diminished localization of β-actin mRNA but not of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) mRNA in dendrites. The aberrant β-actin mRNA localization resulted in abnormal dendritic protrusions and growth cone dynamics. These results suggest a critical role for PAT1 in BDNF-induced β-actin mRNA transport during postnatal development and reveal a new molecular mechanism for mRNA localization in vertebrates.

However, how tubulins are regulated and recruited to support these distinct cellular processes is incompletely understood. Posttranslational modifications of tubulins are proposed to regulate microtubule function and dynamics. Although many of these modifications have been investigated, only one prior study reports tubulin methylation and an enzyme responsible for this methylation. Here we used in vitro radiolabeling, MS, and immunoblotting approaches to monitor protein methylation and immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and pulldown approaches to measure protein–protein interactions. We demonstrate that N-lysine methyltransferase 5A (KMT5A or SET8/PR-Set7), which methylates lysine 20 in histone H4, bound α-tubulin and methylated it at a specific lysine residue, Lys311. Furthermore, late SV40 factor (LSF)/CP2, a known transcription factor, bound both α-tubulin and SET8 and enhanced SET8-mediated α-tubulin methylation in vitro. In addition, we found that the ability of LSF to facilitate this methylation is countered by factor quinolinone inhibitor 1 (FQI1), a specific small-molecule inhibitor of LSF. These findings suggest the general model that microtubule-associated proteins, including transcription factors, recruit or stimulate protein-modifying enzymes to target tubulins.

https://openalex.org/W3009607605,"Various brain injuries lead to the activation of adult neural stem/progenitor cells in the mammalian hippocampus. Subsequent injury-induced neurogenesis appears to be essential for at least some aspects of the innate recovery in cognitive function observed following traumatic brain injury (TBI). It has previously been established that Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays a regulatory role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is of particular interest as the presence of the human ApoE isoform ApoE4 leads to significant risk for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, where impaired neurogenesis has been linked with disease progression. Moreover, genetically modified mice lacking ApoE or expressing the ApoE4 human isoform have been shown to impair adult hippocampal neurogenesis under normal conditions. Here, we investigate how controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury affects dentate gyrus development using hippocampal stereotactic injections of GFP-expressing retroviruses in wild-type (WT), ApoE-deficient and humanized (ApoE3 and ApoE4) mice. Infected adult-born hippocampal neurons were morphologically analyzed once fully mature, revealing significant attenuation of dendritic complexity and spine density in mice lacking ApoE or expressing the human ApoE4 allele, which may help inform how ApoE influences neurological diseases where neurogenesis is defective."
https://openalex.org/W3007265301,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp; also known as MDR1 or ABCB1) is an ATP-driven multidrug transporter that extrudes various hydrophobic toxic compounds to the extracellular space. P-gp consists of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that form the substrate translocation pathway and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that bind and hydrolyze ATP. At least two P-gp states are required for transport. In the inward-facing (pre-drug transport) conformation, the two NBDs are separated, and the two TMDs are open to the intracellular side; in the outward-facing (post-drug transport) conformation, the NBDs are dimerized, and the TMDs are slightly open to the extracellular side.

Nakatsu T. Matsuoka K. Kimura Y. Ueda K. Kato H. Inward- and outward-facing X-ray crystal structures of homodimeric P-glycoprotein CmABCB1.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 (30622258): 8810.1038/s41467-018-08007-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Conformational changes from the inward-facing to the outward-facing state during drug transport could be clearly visualized at these high resolutions. In the inward-facing state (pre-drug transport), a large inner cavity was formed in the center of the TMDs, extending from the middle of the lipid bilayer to the cytosol, and the two NBDs were separated by about 26 Å. In the outward-facing state (post-drug transport), the NBDs were in close proximity, resulting in the formation of nucleotide-binding sites composed of a Walker A motif (P-loop) in one NBD and a signature motif (LSGGQ) in the other NBD. Conformational changes in the NBDs caused by nucleotide binding mediated TMD movements. The outward-facing structure at 1.9 Å resolution (13Kodan A. Yamaguchi T. Nakatsu T. Matsuoka K. Kimura Y. Ueda K. Kato H. Inward- and outward-facing X-ray crystal structures of homodimeric P-glycoprotein CmABCB1.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 (30622258): 8810.1038/s41467-018-08007-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) revealed that a relay of van der Waals interactions and hydrogen-bond networks formed by ATP binding propagate from the NBDs to the TMDs and make the whole molecule move as a rigid body. In contrast, the inward-facing structure (12Kodan A. Yamaguchi T. Nakatsu T. Sakiyama K. Hipolito C.J. Fujioka A. Hirokane R. Ikeguchi K. Watanabe B. Hiratake J. Kimura Y. Suga H. Ueda K. Kato H. Structural basis for gating mechanisms of a eukaryotic P-glycoprotein homolog.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These structural features suggest that ATP binding in both NBDs drives conformational movements from the flexible inward-facing conformation (where the networks between the NBDs and TMDs are not formed) to the rigid outward-facing conformation (where the networks between the NBDs and TMDs are formed) of P-gp, and that ATP hydrolysis releases the rigid outward-facing conformation to the inward-facing conformation. This mechanism, in which ATP hydrolysis triggers conformational change from the outward-facing to the inward-facing state, is supported by a study using mouse P-gp reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs composed of a scaffold protein and lipid bilayer (7Zoghbi M.E.

However, recent double electron–electron resonance (DEER) studies of purified mouse P-gp suggested that ATP binding is insufficient for the formation of tight NBD dimer and that ATP hydrolysis powers the isomerization of P-gp from the inward-facing to the outward-facing conformation (14Verhalen B.

Because the membrane environment is very likely to affect the function of membrane-embedded P-gp, the detailed transport mechanism should be investigated in the native membrane environment. Thus, in this study, we analyzed the roles of ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis in the conformational changes of human P-gp in living cells by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The distances between the C terminus of NBD1 and NBD2 of human P-gp are estimated to be about 30 and 11 Å in the inward-facing and outward-facing structures, respectively (Movie S1). Because this difference in distance is assumed to be one of the largest between the inward-facing and outward-facing structures, we considered it suitable for FRET analysis in order to detect the conformational change of human P-gp in living cells in real time. We generated a FRET construct, P-gp–FRET, in which a monomeric (m)Cerulean (donor) was inserted after NBD1 and a monomeric (m)Venus (19Kremers G.J. Goedhart J. van Munster E.B. Gadella T.W. Cyan and yellow super-fluorescent proteins with improved brightness, protein folding, and FRET Förster radius.Biochemistry. 2006; 45 (16716067): 6570-658010.1021/bi0516273Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) (acceptor) was fused after NBD2 of human P-gp (Fig. 1A). Another FRET construct, P-gp–VsCn, in which mVenus and mCerulean were fused tandemly after NBD2, was predicted to show a high level of FRET despite the conformation. P-gp–mCerulean, in which mCerulean was inserted after NBD1, and P-gp–mVenus, in which mVenus was fused after NBD2, were constructed as negative controls. When these constructs were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, fluorescence signals were observed on the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B). Basal and strong signals were observed in the FRET channel with P-gp–FRET and P-gp–VsCn, respectively, whereas weak and almost no signals were observed with P-gp–mCerulean and P-gp–mVenus, respectively (Fig. 1B, right). The weak signals were due to the broad emission spectrum of mCerulean. The substrate transport activity of P-gp constructs was evaluated by measuring the accumulation of the fluorescent substrate rhodamine 6G (R6G). Because hydrophobic R6G freely penetrates membranes and accumulates in cells, mock cells transfected by the empty vector showed high R6G accumulation (Fig. 1C, gray). However, when P-gp was expressed on the plasma membrane, R6G was extruded from the cells, and R6G accumulation was reduced (Fig. 1C, blue). However, when cells were co-incubated with PSC-833, a specific inhibitor of P-gp, R6G accumulated as much as in mock cells (Fig. 1C, red). These results suggest that the low R6G accumulation is due to the efflux activity of P-gp. All P-gp constructs caused a leftward shift of R6G fluorescence in the absence of PSC-833, whereas the degree of the shift was smaller in cells expressing P-gp constructs containing mVenus due to the leakage of mVenus fluorescence in the detection channel. These results indicated that neither the insertion nor fusion of fluorescent proteins impaired the plasma membrane localization or function of P-gp. Next, we investigated whether the addition of a transport substrate could affect the level of FRET. We defined the proximity ratio as the ratio of the corrected intensity of the FRET signal divided by the mCerulean intensity (20Vanderklish P.W. Krushel L.A. Holst B.H. Gally J.A. Crossin K.L. Edelman G.M. Marking synaptic activity in dendritic spines with a calpain substrate exhibiting fluorescence resonance energy transfer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The proximity ratio of P-gp–FRET on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A, green) was low, and the signal of P-gp–VsCn (shown in yellow or red) was high in the absence of a transport substrate. When verapamil, a transport substrate of P-gp (21Kimura Y. Matsuo M. Takahashi K. Saeki T. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. ATP hydrolysis-dependent multidrug efflux transporter: MDR1/P-glycoprotein.Curr.

Next, the plasma membrane was extracted by automatic membrane segmentation of the mVenus image of P-gp–FRET and -VsCn or the mCerulean image of P-gp–mCerulean (Fig. 2B), and the proximity ratio on the plasma membrane was calculated. The proximity ratio of P-gp–FRET increased about 1.5-fold upon the addition of 100 μm verapamil, which approximates the level of P-gp–VsCn (Fig. 2C). When cells were co-transfected with P-gp–mCerulean and P-gp–mVenus, the proximity ratio was negligible and unaffected by the addition of verapamil (Fig. 3A). The expression level of P-gp–FRET did not affect the proximity ratio either (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that intermolecular FRET did not affect the proximity ratio of P-gp–FRET with or without verapamil treatment. Indeed, verapamil increased the proximity ratio in a concentration-dependent manner, and the EC50 was 3.7 ± 0.9 μm (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the proximity ratio of P-gp–VsCn was unaffected by verapamil and that of P-gp–mCerulean was less than one-tenth that of P-gp–VsCn (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that verapamil causes conformational changes in P-gp.Figure 5membrane permeabilized semi-intact cells.

Like P-gp–VsCn, control constructs P-gp(MM)–VsCn and P-gp(QQ)–VsCn exhibited a high-proximity ratio independent of verapamil.Figure 4Proximity ratio of ATP-binding–deficient and ATP hydrolysis-deficient mutants.

SLO forms 25–30-nm aqueous pores within the plasma membrane, which allows the free passage of ions and small molecules (25Stewart S.E. D'Angelo M.E. Paintavigna S. Tabor R.F. Martin L.L. Bird P.I.

Therefore, cells with a DAPI-positive nucleus and permeabilized plasma membranes were used for the FRET analysis (Fig. 5A). DAPI is not a transport substrate of P-gp and does not stimulate its ATPase activity (Fig. 5B). In the presence of exogenously-added ATP, the proximity ratio of P-gp–FRET was increased by the addition of verapamil (Fig. 6A), consistent with the observations for intact cells (Fig. 2C). However, in the absence of ATP, the proximity ratio of P-gp–FRET was not increased even after the addition of verapamil. These results suggest that both ATP and substrate binding are required for enhancing the conformational change from the inward-facing state (Fig. 8, A–D). Next, to investigate the role of ATP hydrolysis in the conformational change of P-gp, we analyzed P-gp(QQ)–FRET, which binds ATP but has impaired ATP hydrolysis. The proximity ratio of P-gp(QQ)–FRET was high in the presence of exogenously-added ATP even without verapamil, but was low in the absence of ATP (Fig. 6B). In addition, when ATP-depleted cells were incubated with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMP-PNP, the proximity ratio of P-gp–FRET was increased 1.5-fold even without verapamil treatment (Figs. 6C and 8I).

https://openalex.org/W3007429206,"Abstract Overactivation of the cAMP signal transduction pathway plays a central role in the pathogenesis of endocrine tumors. Genetic aberrations leading to increased intracellular cAMP or directly affecting PKA subunit expression have been identified in inherited and sporadic endocrine tumors, but are rare indicating the presence of nongenomic pathological PKA activation. In the present study, we examined the impact of hypoxia on PKA activation using human growth hormone (GH)-secreting pituitary tumors as a model of an endocrine disease displaying PKA-CREB overactivation. We show that hypoxia activates PKA and enhances CREB transcriptional activity and subsequently GH oversecretion. This is due to a previously uncharacterized ability of HIF-1α to suppress the transcription of the PKA regulatory subunit 2B ( PRKAR2B ) by sequestering Sp1 from the PRKAR2B promoter. The present study reveals a novel mechanism through which the transcription factor HIF-1α transduces environmental signals directly onto PKA activity, without affecting intracellular cAMP concentrations. By identifying a point of interaction between the cellular microenvironment and intracellular enzyme activation, neoplastic, and nonneoplastic diseases involving overactivated PKA pathway may be more efficiently targeted."
https://openalex.org/W3010028387,"Abstract ZBTB7A is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;21) translocation. However, the oncogenic collaboration between mutated ZBTB7A and the RUNX1–RUNX1T1 fusion gene in AML t(8;21) remains unclear. Here, we investigate the role of ZBTB7A and its mutations in the context of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. We demonstrate that clinically relevant ZBTB7A mutations in AML t(8;21) lead to loss of function and result in perturbed myeloid differentiation with block of the granulocytic lineage in favor of monocytic commitment. In addition, loss of ZBTB7A increases glycolysis and hence sensitizes leukemic blasts to metabolic inhibition with 2-deoxy- d -glucose. We observed that ectopic expression of wild-type ZBTB7A prevents RUNX1-RUNX1T1-mediated clonal expansion of human CD34+ cells, whereas the outgrowth of progenitors is enabled by ZBTB7A mutation. Finally, ZBTB7A expression in t(8;21) cells lead to a cell cycle arrest that could be mimicked by inhibition of glycolysis. Our findings suggest that loss of ZBTB7A may facilitate the onset of AML t(8;21), and that RUNX1-RUNX1T1-rearranged leukemia might be treated with glycolytic inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3006937932,"Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are important models for analyzing cellular metabolism and individual development. As a hypoxia-inducible factor subunit, HIF-1α plays an important role in maintaining the pluripotency of PSCs under hypoxic conditions. However, the mechanisms underlying the self-renewal and pluripotency maintenance of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) via regulating HIF-1α largely remain elusive. In this study, we found that disrupting the expression of HIF-1α reduced self-renewal and pluripotency of hiPSCs. Additionally, HIF-1α-knockdown led to lower mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and higher reactive oxygen species production in hiPSCs. However, HIF-1α-overexpression increased ATP content in hiPSCs, while the role of HIF-1α-knockdown was opposite. The embryoid body (EB) and teratoma formation assays showed that HIF-1α-knockdown promoted endoderm differentiation and development in vitro and in vivo. In terms of the underlying molecular mechanisms, HIF-1α-knockdown inhibited the expression of Actl6a and histone H3K9ac acetylation (H3K9ac). Actl6a knockdown reduced the expression of H3K9ac and the pluripotency of hiPSCs, and also affected endoderm differentiation. These data suggest that hindering HIF-1α expression causes the changes in mitochondrial properties and metabolic disorders in hiPSCs. Furthermore, HIF-1α affects hiPSC pluripotency, and germ layer differentiation via Actl6a and histone acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W3010255445,"Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) of ~20–200 nm diameter that shuttle DNAs, RNAs, proteins and other biomolecules between cells. The large number of biomolecules present in exosomes demands the frequent use of high-throughput analysis. This, in turn, requires technical replicates (TRs), and biological replicates (BRs) to produce accurate results. As the number and abundance of identified biomolecules varies between replicates (Rs), establishing the replicate variability predicted for the event under study is essential in determining the number of Rs required. Although there have been few reports of replicate variability in high throughput biological data, none of them focused on exosomes. Herein, we determined the replicate variability in protein profiles found in exosomes released from 3 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, H1993, A549 and H1975. Since exosome isolates are invariably contaminated by a small percentage of ~200–300 nm microvesicles, we refer to our samples as exosome-enriched EVs (EE-EVs). We generated BRs of EE-EVs from each cell line, and divided each group into 3 TRs. All Rs were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and customized bioinformatics and biostatistical workflows (raw data available via ProteomeXchange: PXD012798). We found that the variability among TRs as well as BRs, was largely qualitative (protein present or absent) and higher among BRs. By contrast, the quantitative (protein abundance) variability was low, save for the H1975 cell line where the quantitative variability was significant. Importantly, our replicate strategy identified 90% of the most abundant proteins, thereby establishing the utility of our approach."
https://openalex.org/W3010383207,"Depression has been a mental health issue worldwide. We previously reported that ginger-degraded collagen hydrolysate (GDCH) suppressed depression-like behavior in mice. Furthermore, prolyl-hydroxyproline (PO) and hydroxyprolyl-glycine (OG) were detected in the circulating blood after the oral administration of GDCH. In the present study, PO, but not OG, was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of rats after the oral administration of GDCH, suggesting that PO is transported from blood to the brain. We then investigated the effects of PO and OG on the depression-like behavior of mice. The oral administration of PO significantly decreased depression-like behavior in the forced swim test. OG had no antidepressant-like effect. In addition, proline and hydroxyproline, components of PO, also had no antidepressant-like effect after their oral administration. PO significantly increased the gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor in the hippocampus, and promoted the proliferation of neural progenitor cells in vivo and in vitro. PO also increased the dopamine concentration in the prefrontal cortex. Thus, PO-dependent regulation of neurotrophic function and neurotransmitter may be the mechanism for antidepressant-like behavior. Together, these results demonstrate that PO is an antidepressant bioactive peptide accompanying the proliferation of hippocampal neural progenitor cells."

Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical initiators of innate immune responses; as such, they orchestrate inflammation following hepatic injury. Here, we subjected EP3-deficient (Ptger3-/- ) and wild-type (WT) mice to hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and demonstrate that signaling via the prostaglandin E (PGE) receptor EP3 in DCs regulates macrophage plasticity during liver repair. Compared with WT mice, Ptger3-/- mice showed delayed liver repair accompanied by reduced expression of hepatic growth factors and accumulation of Ly6Clow reparative macrophages and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). MoDCs were recruited to the boundary between damaged and undamaged liver tissue in an EP3-dependent manner. Adoptive transfer of moDCs from Ptger3-/- mice resulted in impaired repair, along with increased numbers of Ly6Chigh inflammatory macrophages. Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) up-regulated expression of genes related to a reparative macrophage phenotype when co-cultured with moDCs; this phenomenon was dependent on EP3 signaling. In the presence of an EP3 agonist, interleukin (IL)-13 derived from moDCs drove BMMs to increase expression of genes characteristic of a reparative macrophage phenotype. The results suggest that EP3 signaling in moDCs facilitates liver repair by inducing IL-13-mediated switching of macrophage phenotype from pro-inflammatory to pro-reparative."
https://openalex.org/W3008499688,"Nitrate is one of the major inorganic nitrogen sources for microbes. Many bacterial and archaeal lineages have the capacity to express assimilatory nitrate reductase (NAS), which catalyzes the rate-limiting reduction of nitrate to nitrite. Although a nitrate assimilatory pathway in mycobacteria has been proposed and validated physiologically and genetically, the putative NAS enzyme has yet to be identified. Here, we report the characterization of a novel NAS encoded by Mycolicibacterium smegmatis Msmeg_4206, designated NasN, which differs from the canonical NASs in its structure, electron transfer mechanism, enzymatic properties, and phylogenetic distribution. Using sequence analysis and biochemical characterization, we found that NasN is an NADPH-dependent, diflavin-containing monomeric enzyme composed of a canonical molybdopterin cofactor-binding catalytic domain and an FMN–FAD/NAD-binding, electron-receiving/transferring domain, making it unique among all previously reported hetero-oligomeric NASs. Genetic studies revealed that NasN is essential for aerobic M. smegmatis growth on nitrate as the sole nitrogen source and that the global transcriptional regulator GlnR regulates nasN expression. Moreover, unlike the NADH-dependent heterodimeric NAS enzyme, NasN efficiently supports bacterial growth under nitrate-limiting conditions, likely due to its significantly greater catalytic activity and oxygen tolerance. Results from a phylogenetic analysis suggested that the nasN gene is more recently evolved than those encoding other NASs and that its distribution is limited mainly to Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. We observed that among mycobacterial species, most fast-growing environmental mycobacteria carry nasN, but that it is largely lacking in slow-growing pathogenic mycobacteria because of multiple independent genomic deletion events along their evolution.

https://openalex.org/W3010601671,"Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is an important transcription factor implicated in numerous cellular processes. However, whether Sp1 is involved in the regulation of RNA polymerase III (Pol III)-directed gene transcription in human cells remains unknown. Here, we first show that filamin A (FLNA) represses Sp1 expression as well as expression of TFIIB-related factor 1 (BRF1) and general transcription factor III C subunit 2 (GTF3C2) in HeLa, 293T, and SaOS2 cell lines stably expressing FLNA-silencing shRNAs. Both BRF1 promoter 4 (BRF1P4) and GTF3C2 promoter 2 (GTF3C2P2) contain putative Sp1-binding sites, suggesting that Sp1 affects Pol III gene transcription by regulating BRF1 and GTF3C2 expression. We demonstrate that Sp1 knockdown inhibits Pol III gene transcription, BRF1 and GTF3C2 expression, and the proliferation of 293T and HeLa cells, whereas Sp1 overexpression enhances these activities. We obtained a comparable result in a cell line in which both FLNA and Sp1 were depleted. These results indicate that Sp1 is involved in the regulation of Pol III gene transcription independently of FLNA expression. Reporter gene assays showed that alteration of Sp1 expression affects BRF1P4 and GTF3C2P2 activation, suggesting that Sp1 modulates Pol III-mediated gene transcription by controlling BRF1 and GTF3C2 gene expression. Further analysis revealed that Sp1 interacts with and thereby promotes the occupancies of TATA box-binding protein, TFIIAα, and p300 at both BRF1P4 and GTF3C2P2. These findings indicate that Sp1 controls Pol III-directed transcription and shed light on how Sp1 regulates cancer cell proliferation."

Genome-wide association studies have identified dominant LRRK2 alleles that predispose their carriers to late-onset idiotypic Parkinson's disease (PD) and also to autoimmune disorders such as Crohn's disease. Considerable evidence indicates that PD initiation and progression involve activation of innate immune functions in microglia, which are brain-resident macrophages. Here we asked whether LRRK2 modifies inflammatory signaling and how this modification might contribute to PD and Crohn's disease. We used RNA-Seq–based high-resolution transcriptomics to compare gene expression in activated primary macrophages derived from WT and Lrrk2 knockout mice. Remarkably, expression of a single gene, Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 (Rapgef3), was strongly up-regulated in the absence of LRRK2 and down-regulated in its presence. We observed similar regulation of Rapgef3 expression in cells treated with a highly specific inhibitor of LRRK2 protein kinase activity. Rapgef3 encodes an exchange protein, activated by cAMP 1 (EPAC-1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates the small GTPase Rap-1. Rap-1 mediates cell adhesion, polarization, and directional motility, and our results indicate that LRRK2 modulates chemotaxis of microglia and macrophages.

There is great interest in all aspects of LRRK2 biology because genome-wide association studies have identified many variants in this protein that predispose to late-onset Parkinson's disease. The most common mutation in the LRRK2 gene results in a change from glycine to serine at amino acid 2019 (G2019S). This SNP is the highest known risk factor for development of Parkinson's disease, accounting for 5%–7% of autosomal dominant familial cases (4Di Fonzo A. Rohé C.F. Ferreira J. Chien H.F. Vacca L.

Genome-wide association studies have also revealed a link with Crohn's disease and leprosy. Genetic links with these diseases demonstrate a nonneuronal but clearly innate immune component to LRRK2 biology (7Greggio E. Civiero L. Bisaglia M. Bubacco L. Parkinson's disease and immune system: is the culprit LRRKing in the periphery?.J. Neuroinflammation. 2012; 9 (22594666): 94Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). LRRK2 expression is enriched in macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells (8Gardet A. Benita Y. Li C. Sands B.E. Ballester I. Stevens C. Korzenik J.R. Rioux J.D. Daly M.J. Xavier R.J. Podolsky D.K. LRRK2 is involved in the IFN-γ response and host response to pathogens.J. Immunol. 2010; 185 (20921534): 5577-558510.4049/jimmunol.1000548Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Innate immune stimuli, such as IFN-γ, stimulate LRRK2 expression, revealing responsiveness to activation of innate immune signaling pathways mediated by pattern recognition receptors (9Thévenet J. Pescini Gobert R. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Wiessner C. Sagot Y.J. Regulation of LRRK2 expression points to a functional role in human monocyte maturation.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 (21738687): e2151910.1371/journal.pone.0021519Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) by pathogen-associated molecules such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to phosphorylation of LRRK2 by IκB kinase at two serine residues (Ser-910 and Ser-935) (10Dzamko N. Inesta-Vaquera F. Zhang J. Xie C. Cai H. Arthur S. Tan L. Choi H. Gray N. Cohen P. Pedrioli P. Clark K. Alessi D.R. The IκB kinase family phosphorylates the Parkinson's disease kinase LRRK2 at Ser935 and Ser910 during Toll-like receptor signaling.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 (22723946): e3913210.1371/journal.pone.0039132Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The IκB kinase family is normally associated with phosphorylation of IκB proteins that sequester NF-κB in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IκB proteins leads to proteolysis and subsequent transfer of NF-κB into the nucleus (11Karin M. How NF-κB is activated: the role of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex.Oncogene. 1999; 18 (10602462): 6867-687410.1038/sj.onc.1203219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). LRRK2 phosphorylation depends on the TLR adaptor (Myd88), an innate immune signal transducer that mediates signaling from cell-surface TLRs, as well as TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, which signal from the endosomal compartment. The role of inflammatory processes in the etiology of Parkinson's disease is further illustrated by administration of LPS systemically and directly into the substantia nigra. In the latter case, LPS causes irreversible degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the pars compacta, observed a week after injection (12Castaño A. Herrera A.J. Cano J. Machado A. The degenerative effect of a single intranigral injection of LPS on the dopaminergic system is prevented by dexamethasone, and not mimicked by rh-TNF-α, IL-1β and IFN-γ.J.

Notably nondopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal system, as well as proximal dopaminergic neurons not associated with the nigrostriatal pathway, remain unaffected by direct LPS injection. Therefore, LPS injection and the resulting inflammatory insult demonstrate remarkable sensitivity and specificity to the dopaminergic circuitry associated with Parkinson's disease. In another study, the same pattern of Parkinson's disease–like microglial activation, followed by neurodegeneration over 10 months, was observed when LPS or tumor necrosis factor α were administered systemically in mice via intraperitoneal injection (14Qin L. Wu X. Block M.L. Liu Y. Breese G.R. Hong J.S. Knapp D.J. Crews F.T.

In humans, a laboratory worker accidentally exposed to Salmonella-derived LPS developed many symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor at rest, as well as other neurological problems resulting from damage to the substantia nigra as well as the cerebral cortex (15Niehaus I. Lange J.H. Endotoxin: is it an environmental factor in the cause of Parkinson's disease?.Occup. Environ. Med. 2003; 60 (12709528): 37810.1136/oem.60.5.378Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Human parkinsonism has been further linked to immune activation through neurotrophic viral infection and, in particular, infection by the human influenza virus. Individual cases of viral infection leading to neuropathology and death have been reported, as well as increased incidence of Parkinson's disease following pandemic flu, such as experienced in 1918 (16Jang H. Boltz D.A. Webster R.G. Smeyne R.J. Viral parkinsonism.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1792 (18760350): 714-72110.1016/j.bbadis.2008.08.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). At present, little is known about how Lrrk2 modifies the gene expression program induced by innate signaling pathways and how this might contribute to Parkinson's disease initiation and progression. In this study, we used high-resolution transcriptomics to compare gene expression in primary macrophages derived from WT and Lrrk2-deficient mice. This analysis reveals that LRRK2 modulates the expression of a small subset of genes that are involved in chemotaxis and membrane remodeling. We used RNA-Seq to determine how LRRK2 modifies gene expression in primary bone marrow–derived macrophages from WT and Lrrk2−/− mice. If valid comparisons are to be made, then it is necessary to confirm the similarity in the nature and purity of macrophage cultures before RNA extraction and RNA-Seq. One day prior to RNA extraction, a portion of differentiated macrophages was prepared for flow cytometry analysis and stained for various cell surface markers: CD11b for cells of the myeloid lineage, F4/80 for mouse macrophages, and CD11c for monocyte-derived cells, including macrophages (17Murray P.J. Wynn T.A. Protective and pathogenic functions of macrophage subsets.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11 (21997792): 723-73710.1038/nri3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar). These markers revealed no significant differences in the differentiation state of the cells, with uniform expression of CD11b and highly similar expression levels of F4/80 and CD11c. CD11c surface expression in Lrrk2 KO macrophages displayed a slightly higher level of variability between cultures than equivalent WT cells (Fig. S1). Overall, cultures were considered similar enough to proceed with differential gene expression analysis. We then treated WT and Lrrk2−/− macrophages with either LPS or muramyl dipeptide (MDP), activators of the TLR4- and NOD2-mediated innate responses, respectively. After 2 h of stimulation, RNA was extracted for mRNA sequencing. A mean read depth of over 22.2 × 106 reads/sample was achieved with a range of 16.0 × 106 to 24.9 × 106 reads/sample (Table S1). Reads were of high quality, requiring a mean of less than 0.1% of reads to be trimmed during quality control. A mean of 87.5% of reads could be unambiguously mapped to gene-encoding regions of the genome. Therefore, by comparing the frequency of reads per gene between samples, relative levels of expression could be determined. These datasets were then analyzed for differential gene expression. Datasets of mapped counts were interrogated for differences in each Lrrk2 genotype upon innate immune stimulation as well as for underlying differences between genotypes in unstimulated cells (Fig. 1a). DEseq2 (18Love M.I. Huber W. Anders S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2.Genome Biol. 2014; 15 (25516281): 55010.1186/s13059-014-0550-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (32857) Google Scholar) determines a statistical model accounting for variance in counts per gene and base mean of counts, allowing the statistical significance of apparent differences in gene expression to be estimated. This analysis revealed that LPS treatment caused differential expression of 4985 and 5354 genes in WT and Lrrk2−/− macrophages, respectively. In contrast, MDP treatment resulted in 1483 significantly differentially expressed genes in WT macrophages compared with 1478 genes in Lrrk2 KO macrophages (Fig. 1b). In the absence of stimulation, only eight genes were significantly differentially expressed (Table 1). One of these is Lrrk2, a result confirmed by qPCR. The lesion in the Lrrk2 KO mouse deletes part of exon 1 and exon 2, leading to termination at an out-of-frame stop codon in exon 3. As the Lrrk2 transcription unit has 51 exons, this should lead to nonsense-mediated decay of the transcript. The level of transcript measured is about 50% of the WT, which indicates that nonsense-mediated decay is inefficient in this case (19Linde L. Boelz S. Neu-Yilik G. Kulozik A.E. Kerem B. The efficiency of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is an inherent character and varies among different cells.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 15 (17625509): 1156-116210.1038/sj.ejhg.5201889Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Other genes regulated include kif21a, a member of the kinesin family of motor proteins; camk2b, a calcium/calmodulin-responsive protein kinase; cd59a, a regulator of the membrane attack complex in mice; and nnt, a NAD(P) transhydrogenase with implications in defense against oxidative stress. Very little is known about the lrmda gene except that it consists of a region of LRRs. The remaining results are not represented at the protein level and so are unlikely to have relevance to the current study. The gene detected as being of the highest significance, gm14150, is described as a pseudogene, produced by incorporation of reverse-transcribed mRNA into the genome, whereas gm44305 is a retained intron. These are likely not differentially expressed genes but pre-existing genomic differences between strains (20Akagi K. Li J. Stephens R.M. Volfovsky N. Symer D.E.

In LPS and MDP experiments, a greater number of genes were up-regulated than down-regulated. LPS treatment led to 3192 genes being up-regulated and 2696 down-regulated; MDP treatment caused 1020 genes to be up-regulated and 676 down-regulated (Fig. 1). Furthermore, quantification confirmed that a greater number of genes was differentially expressed upon LPS treatment in Lrrk2-deficient macrophages than WT macrophages. Perhaps the most interesting observation from this analysis is that a single gene was found to be down-regulated in WT macrophages and up-regulated in Lrrk2−/− macrophages upon treatment with LPS. Transcription of this gene, Rapgef3, is almost halved upon LPS treatment in WT macrophages while being increased just over 7-fold in Lrrk2-null macrophages, a complete reversal in transcriptional regulation upon loss of LRRK2. In contrast to conventional differential gene expression analysis, two-parameter analysis provides an alternative method to identify differentially responding genes between genotypes (21Robinson M.D. McCarthy D.J. Smyth G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 (19910308): 139-14010.1093/bioinformatics/btp616Crossref PubMed Scopus (21040) Google Scholar) (RRID: SCR_012802). This method revealed 11 genes with significantly different responses to LPS as between WT and Lrrk2−/− macrophages (adjusted P-value (Padj) < 0.1) (Fig. 3 and Table 2). All differentially responding genes showed an increased level of transcription upon LPS stimulation in Lrrk2 KO cells compared with WT cells. Rapgef3 with a Padj value of 5 × 10−37 and a -fold change of about 11 was the gene most strongly regulated by the presence of Lrrk2. Four other genes identified encode either chemokine ligands (Ccl3, Ccl4, and Ccl5) or receptors (Ccrl2) that mediate chemotactic responses, suggesting a common theme of regulated motility (see “Discussion”).Table 2Differentially responding genes in LPS stimulated macrophagesEnsembl Gene IDBaseMean-Fold Change (KO/WT)PadjGene SymbolENSMUSG00000022469176.3410.974.98E − 37Rapgef3ENSMUSG0000001893011796.253.261.94E − 12Ccl4ENSMUSG000000266282039.032.725.58E − 07Atf3ENSMUSG000000009824095.932.241.02E − 03Ccl3ENSMUSG000000325151117.611.731.07E − 03Csrnp1ENSMUSG00000032724417.682.805.72E − 03Abtb2ENSMUSG000000350423664.772.022.75E − 02Ccl5ENSMUSG000000439531652.793.392.75E − 02Ccrl2ENSMUSG00000045502249.853.554.19E − 02Hcar2ENSMUSG00000001156477.832.099.07E − 02Mxd1ENSMUSG000000002758075.681.409.83E − 02Trim25 Open table in a new tab To confirm the results of the RNA-Seq experiments, qRT-PCR was used to directly measure the level of six of the 11 genes identified in WT and Lrrk2−/− macrophages (Fig. 4A). This confirms the results of the RNA-Seq analysis for Rapgef3, chemokines, and the transcription factor atf3. We next asked whether chemical inhibition of the LRRK2 kinase also induces expression of Rapgef3. We treated WT and Lrrk2−/− macrophages with the highly specific inhibitor GSK2578215A (22Reith A.D. Bamborough P. Jandu K. Andreotti D. Mensah L. Dossang P. Choi H.G. Deng X. Zhang J. Alessi D.R. Gray N.S. GSK2578215A; a potent and highly selective 2-arylmethyloxy-5-substitutent-N-arylbenzamide LRRK2 kinase inhibitor.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2012; 22 (22863203): 5625-562910.1016/j.bmcl.2012.06.104Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Rapgef3 was induced about 6-fold in treated WT macrophages compared with untreated controls. In contrast, no differences in expression level were detected when Lrrk2 mutant macrophages were treated with GSK2578215A relative to the untreated controls (Fig. 4B). Thus, Lrrk2 kinase activity is required for the observed regulation of Rapgef3 gene expression, consistent with the results of the RNA-Seq analysis. In contrast to LPS, MDP treatment identified no significant differentially responding genes (Fig. 3, c and d). This aligns with the less immunogenic nature of MDP compared with LPS stimulation and demonstrates the high stringency of the two-parameter method. To determine whether Rapgef3 mRNA and Epac-1 protein levels are correlated, we stained Lrrk2-deficient and WT macrophages with a fluorescent mAb specific for Epac-1. As shown in Fig. 5a, Epac-1 is ubiquitous and, in many cells, distributed in the expected punctate, perinuclear pattern (Fig. S2). We then quantified protein levels. 6 h after treatment with LPS, Lrrk2-deficient cells had significantly higher levels of Epac-1, consistent with the RNA-Seq and qPCR results (Fig. 5b). We were unable to further validate these observations using Western blotting, as the available antibodies are insufficiently specific or sensitive in this assay. To explore whether LRRK2 affects innate immune function, we used a model of subclinical bacterial infection. WT and Lrrk2-deficient mice were infected with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and three markers of inflammation were measured: IL-18, IFN-γ, and splenomegaly. As shown in Fig. 6 Lrrk2−/− mice had elevated levels of IL-18 and IFN-γ compared with controls 14 days after challenge. These results are statistically significant (p < 0.05, with the exception IFN-γ at 14 days, p = 0.06; see legend for Fig. 6). This indicates that absence of Lrrk2 causes an enhanced inflammatory response. In this study, we investigated how Lrrk2 modifies inflammatory signaling mediated by LPS and MDP. We identified a small subset of genes that are activated by LPS in macrophages that lack Lrrk2 but not in WT control cells. About half of these molecules are involved in cell migration, motility, and chemotaxis. Of particular note is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Rapgef3, by far the most strongly induced gene identified, with an 11- to 15-fold increase in transcription in the absence of Lrrk2. Rapgef3 is also the only gene that is down-regulated in WT macrophages but up-regulated in Lrrk2−/− cells as compared with unstimulated control cells. Rapgef 3 is also derepressed by treatment of macrophages with the highly specific kinase inhibitor GSK2578215A (22Reith A.D. Bamborough P. Jandu K. Andreotti D. Mensah L. Dossang P. Choi H.G. Deng X. Zhang J. Alessi D.R. Gray N.S. GSK2578215A; a potent and highly selective 2-arylmethyloxy-5-substitutent-N-arylbenzamide LRRK2 kinase inhibitor.Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Rapgef3 encodes Epac-1, a GEF that mediates cAMP-dependent activation of the small G-protein Rap1. Epac-1 promotes Rap-1 GDP–GTP exchange, leading to cell adhesion, cell polarization, and enhanced leukocyte chemotaxis (23Robichaux 3rd, W.G. Cheng X. Intracellular cAMP sensor EPAC: physiology, pathophysiology, and therapeutics development.Physiol. Rev. 2018; 98 (29537337): 919-105310.1152/physrev.00025.2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Lorenowicz M.J. van Gils J. de Boer M. Hordijk P.L. Fernandez-Borja M. Epac1-Rap1 signaling regulates monocyte adhesion and chemotaxis.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2006; 80 (16940330): 1542-155210.1189/jlb.0506357Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). On the other hand, another study found that LPS treatment paralyzes monocyte chemotaxis, an effect that requires activated Rap-1 (25Yi L. Chandrasekaran P. Venkatesan S. TLR signaling paralyzes monocyte chemotaxis through synergized effects of p38 MAPK and global Rap-1 activation.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 (22347375): e3040410.1371/journal.pone.0030404Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that LRRK2 indirectly regulates the mobility of macrophages and microglia that have been activated by innate stimuli such as LPS. An attractive hypothesis is that dominant PD-associated LRRK2 alleles, such as G2019S, that have higher constitutive kinase activity may regulate the motility of macrophages by further suppressing EPAC-1 levels. In that regard, a recent study found that G2019S microglia and LRRK2−/− cells, when activated by ADP, have retarded and enhanced motility, respectively, compared with WT control cells. G2019S microglia also have an impaired ability to isolate brain injury (26Choi I. Kim B. Byun J.W. Baik S.H. Huh Y.H. Kim J.H. Mook-Jung I. Song W.K. Shin J.H. Seo H. Suh Y.H. Jou I. Park S.M. Kang H.C. Joe E.H. LRRK2 G2019S mutation attenuates microglial motility by inhibiting focal adhesion kinase.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26365310): 825510.1038/ncomms9255Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These authors present evidence of involvement of focal adhesion kinases; however, this may be indirect, and a possible role of the LRRK2/EPAC-1/RAP-1 axis should be investigated. LRRK2 is part of an ancient and highly conserved pathway of directional motility (2Marín I. van Egmond W.N. van Haastert P.J. The Roco protein family: a functional perspective.FASEB J. 2008; 22 (18523161): 3103-311010.1096/fj.08-111310Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the slime mold Dictyostelium, gbpC is one of 11 paralogs of LRRK2. GbpC-null cells are severely defective in chemotaxis because they cannot polarize cells effectively and have altered patterns of myosin phosphorylation that are probably mediated by activation of Rap1. It is interesting to also note that, in Dictyostelium, many LRRK2 paralogues encode GEFs within their modular structure. As well as Epac1, four other messages that encode proteins with functions in chemotaxis are differentially expressed. Three are chemokines, and one is a chemokine receptor–like protein. CCL3 is also known as macrophage inflammatory protein 1, and CCL4 is also known as MIP-1α and MIP-1β. CCL5 is also known as regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). These chemokines are all members of the CC chemokine/receptor family and share a common receptor in CCR5. CCL3 and CCL5 may also bind CCR1, whereas CCL5 binds a further receptor, CCR3 (27Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Chemokines: a new classification system and their role in immunity.Immunity. 2000; 12 (10714678): 121-12710.1016/S1074-7613(00)80165-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3280) Google Scholar). These chemokines are all classified as pro-inflammatory, meaning they are induced by inflammatory stimuli to recruit inflammatory cells to a site of inflammation, as opposed to homeostatic chemokines, which are constitutively expressed in certain tissues (28Turner M.D. Nedjai B.

Transformation of FGM/C include medicalization although poorly understood has increased undermining abandonment efforts for the practice. We sought to understand drivers of medicalization in FGM/C among selected Kenyan communities. A qualitative study involving participants from Abagusii, Somali and Kuria communities and key informants with health care providers from four Kenyan counties was conducted. Data were collected using in-depth interviews (n = 54), key informant interviews (n = 56) and 45 focus group discussions. Data were transcribed and analyzed thematically using NVivo version 12. We found families practiced FGM/C for reasons including conformity to culture/tradition, religion, marriageability, fear of negative sanctions, and rite of passage. Medicalized FGM/C was only reported by participants from the Abagusii and Somali communities. Few Kuria participants shared that medicalized FGM/C was against their culture and would attract sanctions. Medicalized FGM/C was perceived to have few health complications, shorter healing, and enables families to hide from law. To avoid arrest or sanctions, medicalized FGM/C was performed at home/private clinics. Desire to mitigate health complications and income were cited as reasons for health providers performing of FGM/C. Medicalization was believed to perpetuate the practice as it was perceived as modernized FGM/C. FGM/C remains pervasive in the studied Kenyan communities albeit changed form and context. Findings suggest medicalization sustain FGM/C by allowing families and health providers to conform to social norms underpinning FGM/C while addressing risks of FGM/C complications and legal prohibitions. This underscores the need for more nuanced approaches targeting health providers, families and communities to promote abandonment of FGM/C while addressing medicalization."

Here, we used the pharmacological and genetic tools to determine the autophagy effect of sustained β2 -adrenoceptor activation in rodents with neurogenic myopathy, which display impaired skeletal muscle autophagic flux. Sustained β2 -adrenoceptor activation using Formoterol (10 μg kg-1  day-1 ), starting at the onset of neurogenic myopathy, prevents disruption of autophagic flux in skeletal muscle 14 days after sciatic nerve constriction. These changes are followed by reduction of the cytotoxic protein levels and increased skeletal muscle cross-sectional area and contractility properties. Of interest, sustained administration of Formoterol at lower concentration (1 μg kg-1  day-1 ) induces similar improvements in skeletal muscle autophagic flux and contractility properties in neurogenic myopathy, without affecting the cross-sectional area. Sustained pharmacological inhibition of autophagy using Chloroquine (50 mg kg-1  day-1 ) abolishes the beneficial effects of β2 -adrenoceptor activation on the skeletal muscle proteostasis and contractility properties in neurogenic myopathy. Further supporting an autophagy mechanism for β2 -adrenoceptor activation, skeletal muscle-specific deletion of ATG7 blunts the beneficial effects of β2 -adrenoceptor on skeletal muscle proteostasis and contractility properties in neurogenic myopathy in mice. These findings suggest autophagy as a critical downstream effector of β2 -adrenoceptor signaling pathway in skeletal muscle."

During study visits every three months, participants underwent structured interviews to collect behavioral data, received HIV education, and were provided free condoms and condom compatible lubricants. Five HIV-related knowledge questions were asked at enrollment and repeated after 9 and 15 months. The mean number of correct responses was calculated for each visit with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariable Poisson regression was used to calculate adjusted risk ratios and CIs for factors associated with answering more knowledge questions correctly.From March 2013 to April 2018, 2122 persons assigned male sex at birth were enrolled, including 234 TGW (11.2%). The mean number of correct responses at enrollment was 2.36 (95% CI: 2.31-2.41) and increased to 2.95 (95% CI: 2.86-3.04) and 3.06 (95% CI: 2.97-3.16) after 9 and 15 months in the study, respectively. Among 534 participants who completed all three HIV-related knowledge assessments, mean number of correct responses rose from 2.70 (95% CI: 2.60-2.80) to 3.02 (95% CI: 2.93-3.13) and then 3.06 (95% CI: 2.96-3.16). Factors associated with increased overall HIV-related knowledge included longer duration of study participation, HIV seropositivity, higher education level, and more frequent internet use.There was suboptimal HIV-related knowledge among Nigerian MSM and TGW at that improved modestly with engagement in care.

This study assessed intention to donate blood on adults of Gondar city administration using the theory of planned behavior. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted. The study was conducted on two randomly selected Gondar sub-cities using systematic sampling on a sample size of 524 adults. Epi Data version 3.0 and STATA version 14 were used for entry and analysis of data respectively. Multiple linear regression was carried out to see the association between intention and sociodemographic variables, past donation experience, attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control and with 95% confidence interval and a p-value of less than 0.05 was used to detect statistical significance. Results A total of 515 respondents participated in the study giving a response rate of 98%. Most of the participants were females (66.4%) and the participants’ age ranges from 18 to 65 years. The variance explained by the model was 49%. The mean intention to donate blood was 3.02±1.13.

With increased use, this method progressively pollutes the environment with technological waste represented by so called ghost tags (PIT tags ending in the environment due to reproductive expulsions, shedding or animal mortality). However, their presence in the environment may lead to failed detections of living individuals. We used tagging data from studies of the asp Leuciscus aspius and the bleak Alburnus alburnus collected from 2014 to 2018 and located ghost tag positions on the monitored spawning site using portable backpack reader for their detection. We modelled virtual river-wide flat-bed antennas (widths 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 m) representing monitoring effort and estimated the probability of the presence of ghost tags within the antenna field. Of 3724 PIT tags used in the study, we detected on the spawning ground 173 ghost tags originating from long-term monitoring. The ghost tags accumulated in the environment in time, suggesting insufficient degradation rate or shift downstream from the research site. Number of ghost tags present on the spawning ground led to high probability of disabled readings of tagged fish passing through the antenna electro-magnetic field. We demonstrate how accumulated ghost tags may cause detection failures for focal species and incomplete data acquisition. We infer that intensive long-term monitoring using PIT tag technology may encumber future data acquisition or entail additional costs for clean-up."

It has been associated with breed-specific variants in the SUV39H2 gene encoding a histone 3 methyltransferase involved in epigenetic silencing. Formalin-fixed biopsies of the nasal planum of Labrador Retrievers were screened by immunofluorescence microscopy for the presence and distribution of epidermal proliferation and differentiation markers. Gene expression of these markers was further analysed using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ultrastructural epidermal differences were investigated by electron microscopy. Differentiation of the nasal planum in the basal and suprabasal epidermal layers of HNPK-affected dogs (n = 6) was similar compared to control dogs (n = 6). In the upper epidermal layers, clear modifications were noticed. Loricrin protein was absent in HNPK-affected nasal planum sections in contrast to sections of the same location of control dogs. However, loricrin was present in the epidermis of paw pads and abdominal skin from HNPK dogs and healthy control dogs. The patterns of keratins K1, K10 and K14, were not markedly altered in the nasal planum of HNPK-affected dogs while the expression of the terminal differentiation marker involucrin appeared less regular. Based on RNA-seq, LOR and IVL expression levels were significantly decreased, while KRT1, KRT10 and KRT14 levels were up-regulated (log2fold-changes of 2.67, 3.19 and 1.71, respectively) in HNPK-affected nasal planum (n = 3) compared to control dogs (n = 3). Electron microscopical analysis revealed structural alterations in keratinocytes and stratum corneum, and disrupted keratinocyte adhesions and distended intercellular spaces in lesional samples (n = 3) compared to a sample of a healthy control dog (n = 1). Our findings demonstrate aberrant keratinocyte terminal differentiation of the nasal planum of HNPK-affected Labrador Retrievers and provide insights into biological consequences of this inactive SUV39H2 gene variant."
https://openalex.org/W3010511801,"Background Surgical decision-making in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is complex. Neurosurgeons weigh risks and benefits of interventions that have the potential to both maximize the chance of recovery and prolong suffering. Inaccurate prognostication can lead to over- or under-estimation of outcomes and influence treatment recommendations. Objective To evaluate the impact of evidence-based risk estimates on neurosurgeon treatment recommendations and prognostic beliefs in severe TBI. Methods In a survey-based randomized experiment, a total of 139 neurosurgeons were presented with two hypothetical patient with severe TBI and subdural hematoma; the intervention group received additional evidence-based risk estimates for each patient. The main outcome was neurosurgeon treatment recommendation of non-surgical management. Secondary outcomes included prediction of functional recovery at six months. Results In the first patient scenario, 22% of neurosurgeons recommended non-surgical management and provision of evidence-based risk estimates increased the propensity to recommend non-surgical treatment (odds ratio [OR]: 2.81, 95% CI: 1.21–6.98; p = 0.02). Neurosurgeon prognostic beliefs of 6-month functional recovery were variable in both control (median 20%, IQR: 10%-40%) and intervention (30% IQR: 10%-50%) groups and neurosurgeons were less likely to recommend non-surgical management when they believed prognosis was favorable (odds ratio [OR] per percentage point increase in 6-month functional recovery: 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95–0.99). The results for the second patient scenario were qualitatively similar. Conclusions Our findings show that the provision of evidence-based risk predictions can influence neurosurgeon treatment recommendations and prognostication, but the effect is modest and there remains large variability in neurosurgeon prognostication."
https://openalex.org/W3007333473,"Background and aims Radiotherapy is one of the major remedies for the treatment of cancer, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Radioresistance occurs very often in target cells that is a large drawback in cancer treated with radiotherapy. Livin involves the over-growth of cancer cells. This study aims to investigate the role of livin in the radioresistance formation in NPC cells. Methods NPC cell lines were exposed to small doses of irradiation to establish a cell model of radioresistance, in which the role of livin in the development of radioresistance was evaluated. Results The expression of livin was observed in NPC cells, which was significantly increased after exposing to small doses of irradiation. A negative correlation was detected between livin and Fas expression in NPC cells. Livin formed a complex with heat shock factor-1 (HSF1, the transcription factor of Fas) in NPC cells after irradiation, which sped up ubiquitination of HSF1. Livin was involved in suppressing Fas expression in NPC cells with radioresistance. Exposure to livin inhibitors prevented radioresistance development and overcame the established radioresistance in NPC cells. Conclusions Livin expression in NPC cells plays a critical role in the development of radioresistance. Depletion of livin increases the sensitiveness of NPC cells to irradiation. Target therapy against livin may have the translational potential for the treatment of NPC."
https://openalex.org/W3007871512,"Punishment aims to deter individuals’ selfish behaviors, but it can occasionally backfire. Some scholars have proposed promoting prosocial behaviors using punishment that communicates positive social norms because it provides additional motivation. However, it is unclear which factors affect the norm expressive function of punishment. This study proposes that third-party punishment communicates more positive normative information, and thus, promotes more prosocial behavior in observers than does second-party punishment. Using dictator games, we investigated the effects of second-party punishment compared to third-party punishment of another’s unfair sharing on observers’ norm perceptions and subsequent sharing decision-making. Two experiments consistently found that third-party punishment was more effective than second-party punishment at inducing observers’ beliefs that unfair distribution was unusual (descriptive norm) and unacceptable (injunctive norm). The altered descriptive but not injunctive norm perception further guided individuals’ own sharing behaviors. Taken together, these results suggest that third-party punishment might be better than second-party punishment at decreasing selfish behaviors by shaping individuals’ norm perceptions, especially descriptive norm perception, regarding the relevant behaviors."

Pure CSi scaffolds were fabricated using a direct ink writing technique, and the pore-wall was modified with 0%, 6%, or 10% Mg-doped CSi slurry (CSi, CSi-Mg6, or CSi-Mg10) through electrostatic interaction. Modified CSi@CSi-Mg6 and CSi@CSi-Mg10 scaffolds with over 60% porosity demonstrated an appreciable compressive strength beyond 20 MPa, which was ~2-fold higher than that of pure CSi scaffolds. CSi-Mg6 and CSi-Mg10 coating layers were specifically favorable for retarding bio-dissolution and mechanical decay of scaffolds in vitro. In-vivo investigation of critical-size femoral bone defects repair revealed that CSi@CSi-Mg6 and CSi@CSi-Mg10 scaffolds displayed limited biodegradation, accelerated new bone ingrowth (4-12 weeks), and elicited a suitable mechanical response. In contrast, CSi scaffolds exhibited fast biodegradation and retarded new bone regeneration after 8 weeks. Thus, tailoring of the chemical composition of pore-wall struts of CSi scaffolds is beneficial for enhancing the biomechanical properties and bone repair efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3010112848,"In conservation agriculture systems, farmers gain many advantages from retaining crop residue on the soil surface, but crop residue retention in these systems may intervene with the activity of pre-emergence herbicides. A pot study was conducted to evaluate the effect of different rates of pre-emergence herbicides [imazethapyr (100 and 150 g a. i. ha-1), isoxaflutole (100 and 200 g a. i. ha-1), metolachlor (1.5 and 2.25 kg a. i. ha-1), pendimethalin (2.25 and 3.38 kg a. i. ha-1) and prosulfocarb + metolachlor (2.5 and 3.75 kg a. i. ha-1)] on seedling emergence and biomass of Echinochloa colona and Chloris virgata when applied in the presence of sorghum residue at rates equivalent to (0, 3 and 6 t ha-1). When seeds of E. colona and C. virgata were not covered with sorghum residue, the seedling emergence and biomass of both weeds was inhibited by 93-100% and 56-100%, respectively, with the application (both rates) of isoxaflutole, metolachlor, pendimethalin and prosulfocarb + metolachlor. Using sorghum residue resulted in lower herbicide efficacy on both weeds. At 3 t ha-1 sorghum residue, E. colona emergence and biomass reduced by 38-100% and 30-100%, respectively, with application of isoxaflutole, metolachlor and pendimethalin (both rates) in comparison with the no-herbicide treatment. Similarly, the emergence and biomass of C. virgata was also reduced by 92-100% and 25-100%, respectively. The results of this study suggest that crop residue may influence efficacy of commonly used pre-emergence herbicides and that the amount of crop residue on the soil surface should be adjusted according to the nature of the pre-emergence herbicides to achieve adequate weed control."
https://openalex.org/W3010136176,"The introduction of high-yielding semi-dwarf varieties of wheat into cultivation has led to a ""green revolution."" This has required intensive research into various sources of dwarfism in wheat. However, there has been very little advancement in research on dwarfing genes in rye in comparison to wheat or barley. So far, three dominant dwarfing genes (Ddw1, Ddw3, and Ddw4) and three recessive genes (ct1, ct2, and np) have been characterized and precisely mapped in rye. There is no complete catalog of dwarfing genes available in rye. This paper presents an identification of the source of dwarfism and preliminary characterization of the new recessive gene dw9 from the BK-1 line. The gene was mapped on the long arm of the 6R chromosome and belongs to the GA-insensitive group. The initial characterization of the influence of this gene on morphological traits shows that it significantly affects the decrease of yielding trait parameters. A full evaluation can be performed after detailed breeding studies."
https://openalex.org/W3010571750,"The mitochondrial theory of aging attributes much of the aging process to mitochondrial DNA damage. The polymerase gamma (PolG) mutant mouse was designed to evaluate this theory and thus carries a mutated proofreading region of polymerase gamma (D257A) that exclusively transcribes the mitochondrial genome. As a result, PolGD257A mice accumulate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations that lead to premature aging, as evidenced by hair loss, weight loss, kyphosis, increased rates of apoptosis, organ damage, and an early death, occurring around 12 months of age. Research has shown that exercise decreases skeletal muscle mtDNA mutations and normalizes protein levels in PolG mice. However, brain mtDNA changes with exercise in PolG mice have not been studied. We found no effects of exercise on mtDNA mutations or copy number in either the brain or liver of PolG mice, despite changes to body mass. Our results suggest that mitochondrial mutations play little role in exercise-brain interactions in the PolG model of accelerated aging. In addition to evaluating the effect of exercise on mtDNA outcomes, we also implemented novel methods for both extracting mtDNA and measuring mtDNA mutations, with aims for improving the efficiency and accuracy of these methods."
https://openalex.org/W3008944801,"Objectives To investigate the correlation between histogram-based Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) parameters and positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG-PET) values in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), both in primary tumors (PTs) and in metastatic lymph nodes (LNs). Methods 52 patients with a new pathologically-confirmed OPSCC were included in the present retrospective cohort study. Imaging including DCE-MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were acquired in all patients. Both PTs and the largest LN, if present, were volumetrically contoured. Quantitative parameters, including the transfer constants, Ktrans and Kep, and the volume of extravascular extracellular space, ve, were calculated from DCE-MRI. The percentiles (P), P10, P25, P50, P75, P90, and skewness, kurtosis and entropy were obtained from the histogram-based analysis of each perfusion parameter. Standardized uptake values (SUV), SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were calculated applying a SUV threshold of 40%. The correlations between all variables were investigated with the Spearman-rank correlation test. To exclude false positive results under multiple testing, the Benjamini-Hockberg procedure was applied. Results No significant correlations were found between any parameters in PTs, while significant associations emerged between Ktrans and 18F-FDG PET parameters in LNs. Conclusions Evident relationships emerged between DCE-MRI and 18F-FDG PET parameters in OPSCC LNs, while no association was found in PTs. The complex relationships between perfusion and metabolic biomarkers should be interpreted separately for primary tumors and lymph-nodes. A multiparametric approach to analyze PTs and LNs before treatment is advisable in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)."
https://openalex.org/W3008854857,"Solid-state drives (SSDs) that do not have internal dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) are being widely spread for client SSD and embedded SSD markets in recent years because they are cheap and consume less power. Obviously, their performance is lower than conventional SSDs because they cannot exploit advantages of DRAM in the controller. However, this problem can be alleviated by using host memory buffer (HMB) feature of Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe), which allows SSDs to utilize the DRAM of host. In this paper, we show that commercial DRAM-less SSDs clearly exhibit worse I/O performance than SSDs with internal DRAM, but this can be improved by using the HMB feature. We also present methods that reveal how the host memory buffer is used in commercial DRAM-less SSDs to improve I/O performance. Through extensive experiments, we conclude that DRAM-less SSDs evaluated in this study mainly exploit the host memory buffer as an address mapping table cache rather than a read cache or write buffer to improve I/O performance."

This retrospective study aimed to clarify the short-term and mid-term outcomes in patients who underwent surgical rescues for hemopericardium complicated by ATAAD.Between January 2007 and March 2019, 586 consecutive patients underwent ATAAD repair at our institution. According to preoperative computed tomography, hemopericardium was found in 191 patients (32.6%), 150 were stabilized with medical treatment, and 41 underwent surgical rescues for critical hemodynamics. The 41 patients were classified into groups according to their rescue procedures: emergent subxiphoid pericardiotomy (E-SXP group, n = 26, 63.4%) or emergent cardiopulmonary bypass (E-CPB group, n = 15, 36.6%). Clinical features, surgical information, postoperative complications, and 3-year survival were analyzed and compared.Demographics, comorbidities and aortic repair procedures were generally homogenous between the two groups, except for sex. The average systolic blood pressure was 62.4 ± 13.3 mmHg and 67.1 ± 13.1 mmHg in the E-SXP and E-CPB groups, respectively. A total of 29.3% of patients underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) before surgical rescues. The in-hospital mortality was similar (30.8% versus 33.3%, P = 0.865) in the two groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative CPR was an in-hospital predictor of mortality. For patients who survived to discharge, 3-year cumulative survival rates were 87.8% ± 8.1% and 60.0% ± 19.7% in the E-SXP and E-CPB groups, respectively (P = 0.170).Patients who underwent surgical rescues for ATAAD-complicated hemopericardium are at a high risk of in-hospital mortality. The two rescue procedures revealed similar short-term and mid-term outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3009798622,"The objective of the present study was to characterize the rumen bacterial and archaeal communities in dairy cows fed different ratios of maize silage (MS) and grass silage (GS), and place the findings in the context of ruminal fermentation as well as previously reported methane (CH4) emissions. Rumen fluid from 12 rumen cannulated dairy cows was collected after 10 and 17 days of feeding one of four diets, all of which had the same roughage to concentrate ratio of 80:20 based on dry matter (DM). Roughage in the four diets (GS100, GS0, GS67, GS33) consisted of either 1000 g/kg DM GS (GS100), 1000 g/kg DM MS (GS0), or a mixture of both silages in different proportions [667 g/kg DM GS and 333 g/kg DM MS (GS67); 333 g/kg DM GS and 677 g/kg DM MS (GS33)]. Total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations and the molar proportions of the ruminal VFA were not affected by diet. Only the molar proportion of isovalerate was affected by time, being lower on day 17 than on day 10. Bacterial and archaeal concentrations were not affected by diet but increased from day 10 to day 17. The bacterial community composition was affected by diet, time and diet × time, whereas the archaeal community composition was only affected by diet. Several bacterial and archaeal genus level groups were associated with diet, but not with time. Analysis indicated the increased use of hydrogen by succinate and lactate producing bacteria is likely to at least partially explain the previously reported lower CH4 emissions from MS fed dairy cows. Furthermore, time had a significant effect on both bacterial and archaeal concentrations, and also bacterial community composition. This indicates that the rumen microbiota had not stabilized after 10 days of feeding the experimental diets."
https://openalex.org/W3009839289,"Gallid alphaherpesvirus 1 causes infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) in farmed poultry worldwide. Intertypic recombination between vaccine strains of this virus has generated novel and virulent isolates in field conditions. In this study, in vitro and in ovo systems were co-infected and superinfected under different conditions with two genomically distinct and commonly used ILTV vaccines. The progeny virus populations were examined for the frequency and pattern of recombination events using multi-locus high-resolution melting curve analysis of polymerase chain reaction products. A varied level of recombination (0 to 58.9%) was detected, depending on the infection system (in ovo or in vitro), viral load, the composition of the inoculum mixture, and the timing and order of infection. Full genome analysis of selected recombinants with different in vitro phenotypes identified alterations in coding and non-coding regions. The ability of ILTV vaccines to maintain their capacity to recombine under such varied conditions highlights the significance of recombination in the evolution of this virus and demonstrates the capacity of ILTV vaccines to play a role in the emergence of recombinant viruses."
https://openalex.org/W3009185582,"Language is critical to coordination in groups. Though, how language affects coordination in groups is not well understood. We prime distributive and integrative language in a bargaining experiment to better understand the links between group outcomes and communication. We accomplish this by priming interests or positions language in randomized groups. We find that priming positions as opposed to interests language leads to agreements where controllers, subjects with unilateral authority over the group outcome, receive a larger share of the benefits but where the total benefits to the group are unaffected. In contrast to common justifications for the use of integrative language in bargaining, our experimental approach revealed no significant differences between priming interests and positions language in regards to increasing joint outcomes for the groups. Across treatments, we find subjects that use gain frames and make reference to visuals aids during bargaining experience larger gains for the group, while loss frames and pro-self language experience larger gains for the individual through side payments. This finding suggests a bargainer's dilemma: whether to employ language that claims a larger share of group's assets or employ language to increase joint gains."
https://openalex.org/W3009394785,"It is standard practice to model site-to-site variability of substitution rates by discretizing a continuous distribution into a small number, K, of equiprobable rate categories. We demonstrate that the variance of this discretized distribution has an upper bound determined solely by the choice of K and the mean of the distribution. This bound can introduce biases into statistical inference, especially when estimating parameters governing site-to-site variability of substitution rates. Applications to two large collections of sequence alignments demonstrate that this upper bound is often reached in analyses of real data. When parameter estimation is of primary interest, additional rate categories or more flexible modeling methods should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3009407268,"Numerous studies show that various genes in all kinds of organisms are transcribed discontinuously, i.e. in short bursts or pulses with periods of inactivity between them. But it remains unclear whether ribosomal DNA (rDNA), represented by multiple copies in every cell, is also expressed in such manner. In this work, we synchronized the pol I activity in the populations of tumour derived as well as normal human cells by cold block and release. Our experiments with 5-fluorouridine (FU) and BrUTP confirmed that the nucleolar transcription can be efficiently and reversibly arrested at +4°C. Then using special software for analysis of the microscopic images, we measured the intensity of transcription signal (incorporated FU) in the nucleoli at different time points after the release. We found that the ribosomal genes in the human cells are transcribed discontinuously with periods ranging from 45 min to 75 min. Our data indicate that the dynamics of rDNA transcription follows the undulating pattern, in which the bursts are alternated by periods of rare transcription events."
https://openalex.org/W3009575201,"Background and objective The SC+ haemodialysis system developed by Quanta Dialysis Technologies is a small, easy-to-use dialysis system designed to improve patient access to self-care and home haemodialysis. A prototype variant of the standard SC+ device with a modified fluidic management system generating a pulsatile push-pull dialysate flow through the dialyser during use has been developed for evaluation. It was hypothesized that, as a consequence of the pulsatile push-pull flow through the dialyser, the boundary layers at the membrane surface would be disrupted, thereby enhancing solute transport across the membrane, modifying protein fouling and maintaining the surface area available for mass and fluid transport throughout the whole treatment, leading to solute transport (clearance) enhancement compared to normal haemodialysis (HD) operation. Methods The pumping action of the SC+ system was modified by altering the sequence and timings of the valves and pumps associated with the flow balancing chambers that push and pull dialysis fluid to and from the dialyser. Using this unique prototype device, solute clearance performance was assessed across a range of molecular weights in two related series of laboratory bench studies. The first measured dialysis fluid moving across the dialyser membrane using ultrasonic flowmeters to establish the validity of the approach; solute clearance was subsequently measured using fluorescently tagged dextran molecules as surrogates for uraemic toxins. The second study used human blood doped with uraemic toxins collected from the spent dialysate of dialysis patients to quantify solute transport. In both, the performance of the SC+ prototype was assessed alongside reference devices operating in HD and pre-dilution haemodiafiltration (HDF) modes. Results Initial testing with fluorescein-tagged dextran molecules (0.3 kDa, 4 kDa, 10 kDa and 20 kDa) established the validity of the experimental pulsatile push-pull operation in the SC+ system to enhance clearance and demonstrated a 10 to 15% improvement above the current HD mode used in clinic today. The magnitude of the observed enhancement compared favourably with that achieved using pre-dilution HDF with a substitution fluid flow rate of 60 mL/min (equivalent to a substitution volume of 14.4 L in a 4-hour session) with the same dialyser and marker molecules. Additional testing using human blood indicated a comparable performance to pre-dilution HDF; however, in contrast with HDF, which demonstrated a gradual decrease in solute removal, the clearance values using the pulsatile push-pull method on the SC+ system were maintained over the entire duration of treatment. Overall albumin losses were not different. Conclusions Results obtained using an experimental pulsatile push-pull dialysis flow configuration with an aqueous blood analogue and human blood ex vivo demonstrate an enhancement of solute transport across the dialyser membrane. The level of enhancement makes this approach comparable with that achieved using pre-dilution HDF with a substitution fluid flow rate of 60 mL/min (equivalent to a substitution volume of 14.4 L in a 4-hour session). The observed enhancement of solute transport is attributed to the disruption of the boundary layers at the fluid-membrane interface which, when used with blood, minimizes protein fouling and maintains the surface area."
https://openalex.org/W3010350225,"Geography, including climatic factors, have long been considered potentially important elements in shaping socio-economic activities, alongside other determinants, such as institutions. Here we demonstrate that geography and climate variables satisfactorily explain the worldwide economic activity as measured by the per capita Gross Cell Product (GCP-PC) at a fine geographical resolution, typically much higher than country average. A 1° by 1° GCP-PC dataset has been key for establishing and testing a direct relationship between ‘local’ geography/climate and GCP-PC. Not only have we tested the geography and climate hypothesis using many possible explanatory variables, importantly we have also predicted and reconstructed GCP-PC worldwide by retaining the most significant predictors. While this study confirms that latitude is the most important predictor for GCP-PC when taken in isolation, the accuracy of the GCP-PC prediction is greatly improved when other factors mainly related to variations in climatic variables, rather than average climatic conditions as typically used, are considered. However, latitude diminishes in importance when only the wealthier parts of the globe are considered. This work points to specific features of the climate system which explain economic activity, such as the variability in air pressure. Implications of these findings range from an improved understanding of why socio-economically better-off societies are geographically placed where they are in the present, past and future to informing where new economic activities could be established in order to yield favourable economic outcomes based on geography and climate conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3007159871,"Background Aortic stenosis (AS) may lead to diastolic dysfunction and later on heart failure (HF) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF) via increased afterload and left-ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Since epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a metabolically active fat depot that is adjacent to the myocardium and can influence cardiomyocytes and LV function via secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, we hypothesized that high amounts of EAT, as assessed by computed tomography (CT), may aggravate the development and severity of LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction in the context of AS. Methods We studied 50 patients (mean age 71 ± 9 years; 9 women) in this preliminary study with mild or moderate AS and mild to severe LV diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), diagnosed by echocardiography, who underwent non-contrast cardiac CT and echocardiography. EAT parameters were measured on 2nd generation dual source CT. Conventional two-dimensional echocardiography and Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) was performed to assess LV function and to derive myocardial straining parameter. All patients had a preserved LV ejection fraction > 50%. Data was analysed using Pearson’s correlation. Results Only weak correlation was found between EAT volume or density and E/é ratio as LVDD marker (r = -.113 p = .433 and r = .260, p = .068 respectively). Also, EAT volume or density were independent from Global Strain Parameters (r = 0.058 p = .688 and r = -0.207 p = .239). E/é ratio was strongly associated with LVDD (r = .761 p≤0.0001) and Strain Parameters were moderately associated with LV Ejection Fraction (r = -.669 p≤0.001 and r = -.454 P≤0.005). Conclusions In this preliminary study in patients with AS, the EAT volume and density as assessed by CT correlated only weakly with LVDD, as expressed by the commonly used E/é ratio, and with LV strain function. Hence, measuring EAT volume and density may neither contribute to the prediction nor upon the severity of LVDD, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3007326855,"Legislative gridlock is a failure of one of the key functions of government: to pass legislation. Can voters counter such political dysfunction? This paper examines whether and how voters hold politicians accountable for gridlock. We focus on the passage of the government budget, the central task of any legislature, and define a legislature to experience budgetary gridlock if it fails to pass the budget on time. We argue, based on evidence from twenty years of budget enactment data, that voters hold state legislators accountable for budget gridlock in US state governments, with gridlocked incumbents losing their seat more often than incumbents passing budgets on time. Based on established theories of party organization in American politics, we develop three competing theoretical hypotheses to guide our understanding of the observed patterns of retrospective voting. We find strong support for collective electoral accountability with voters punishing incumbent members of state legislature majority parties."
