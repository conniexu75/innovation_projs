https://openalex.org/W1970679679,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved sequence-specific gene regulatory mechanism mediated by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is composed of a single-stranded guide RNA and an Argonaute protein. The PIWI domain, a highly conserved motif within Argonaute, has been shown to adopt an RNase H fold critical for the endonuclease cleavage activity of RISC. Here we report the crystal structure of Archaeoglobus fulgidus Piwi protein bound to double-stranded RNA, thereby identifying the binding pocket for guide-strand 5'-end recognition and providing insight into guide-strand-mediated messenger RNA target recognition. The phosphorylated 5' end of the guide RNA is anchored within a highly conserved basic pocket, supplemented by the carboxy-terminal carboxylate and a bound divalent cation. The first nucleotide from the 5' end of the guide RNA is unpaired and stacks over a conserved tyrosine residue, whereas successive nucleotides form a four-base-pair RNA duplex. Mutation of the corresponding amino acids that contact the 5' phosphate in human Ago2 resulted in attenuated mRNA cleavage activity. Our structure of the Piwi-RNA complex, and that determined elsewhere, provide direct support for the 5' region of the guide RNA serving as a nucleation site for pairing with target mRNA and for a fixed distance separating the RISC-mediated mRNA cleavage site from the anchored 5' end of the guide RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2064667228,"RNA interference and related RNA silencing phenomena use short antisense guide RNA molecules to repress the expression of target genes1,2. Argonaute proteins3, containing amino-terminal PAZ (for PIWI/Argonaute/Zwille) domains and carboxy-terminal PIWI domains, are core components of these mechanisms. Here we show the crystal structure of a Piwi protein from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AfPiwi) in complex with a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-like duplex, which mimics the 5′ end of a guide RNA strand bound to an overhanging target messenger RNA. The structure contains a highly conserved metal-binding site that anchors the 5′ nucleotide of the guide RNA. The first base pair of the duplex is unwound, separating the 5′ nucleotide of the guide from the complementary nucleotide on the target strand, which exits with the 3′ overhang through a short channel. The remaining base-paired nucleotides assume an A-form helix, accommodated within a channel in the PIWI domain, which can be extended to place the scissile phosphate of the target strand adjacent to the putative slicer catalytic site. This study provides insights into mechanisms of target mRNA recognition and cleavage by an Argonaute–siRNA guide complex."

https://openalex.org/W2075551125,"Exposure of biological chromophores to ultraviolet radiation can lead to photochemical damage. However, the role of visible light, particularly in the blue region of the spectrum, has been largely ignored. To test the hypothesis that blue light is toxic to non-pigmented epithelial cells, confluent cultures of human primary retinal epithelial cells were exposed to visible light (390–550 nm at 2.8 milliwatts/cm2) for up to 6 h. A small loss of mitochondrial respiratory activity was observed at 6 h compared with dark-maintained cells, and this loss became greater with increasing time. To investigate the mechanism of cell loss, the damage to mitochondrial and nuclear genes was assessed using the quantitative PCR. Light exposure significantly damaged mitochondrial DNA at 3 h (0.7 lesion/10 kb DNA) compared with dark-maintained controls. However, by 6 h of light exposure, the number of lesions was decreased in the surviving cells, indicating DNA repair. Isolated mitochondria exposed to light generated singlet oxygen, superoxide anion, and the hydroxyl radical. Antioxidants confirmed the superoxide anion to be the primary species responsible for the mitochondrial DNA lesions. The effect of lipofuscin, a photoinducible intracellular generator of reactive oxygen intermediates, was investigated for comparison. Exposure of lipofuscin-containing cells to visible light caused an increase in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA lesions compared with non-pigmented cells. We conclude that visible light can cause cell dysfunction through the action of reactive oxygen species on DNA and that this may contribute to cellular aging, age-related pathologies, and tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2075840960,"In the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity, electrons form (Cooper) pairs through an interaction mediated by vibrations in the underlying crystal structure. Like lattice vibrations, antiferromagnetic fluctuations can also produce an attractive interaction creating Cooper pairs, though with spin and angular momentum properties different from those of conventional superconductors. Such interactions have been implicated for two disparate classes of materials--the copper oxides and a set of Ce- and U-based compounds. But because their transition temperatures differ by nearly two orders of magnitude, this raises the question of whether a common pairing mechanism applies. PuCoGa5 has a transition temperature intermediate between those classes and therefore may bridge these extremes. Here we report measurements of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate and Knight shift in PuCoGa5, which demonstrate that it is an unconventional superconductor with properties as expected for antiferromagnetically mediated superconductivity. Scaling of the relaxation rates among all of these materials (a feature not exhibited by their Knight shifts) establishes antiferromagnetic fluctuations as a likely mechanism for their unconventional superconductivity and suggests that related classes of exotic superconductors may yet be discovered."
https://openalex.org/W2068986375,"Diverse oxidative pathways, such as direct oxidation of amino acids, glycoxidation, and lipoxidation could contribute to Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. A global survey for the amount of structurally characterized probes for these reactions is lacking and could overcome the lack of specificity derived from measurement of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reactive carbonyls. Consequently we analyzed (i) the presence and concentrations of glutamic and aminoadipic semialdehydes, Nϵ-(carboxymethyl)-lysine, Nϵ-(carboxyethyl)-lysine, and Nϵ-(malondialdehyde)-lysine by means of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, (ii) the biological response through expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products, (iii) the fatty acid composition in brain samples from Alzheimer disease patients and agematched controls, and (iv) the targets of Nϵ-(malondialdehyde)-lysine formation in brain cortex by proteomic techniques. Alzheimer disease was associated with significant, although heterogeneous, increases in the concentrations of all evaluated markers. Alzheimer disease samples presented increases in expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products with high molecular heterogeneity. Samples from Alzheimer disease patients also showed content of docosahexaenoic acid, which increased lipid peroxidizability. In accordance, Nϵ-(malondialdehyde)-lysine formation targeted important proteins for both glial and neuronal homeostasis such as neurofilament L, α-tubulin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex protein I, and the β chain of ATP synthase. These data support an important role for lipid peroxidation-derived protein modifications in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis.

These data support an important role for lipid peroxidation-derived protein modifications in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. Oxidative stress-induced molecular alterations affect all sorts of biological molecules, including especially sensitive amino acid residues in proteins, such as tyrosine, methionine, arginine, proline, and lysine, among others (1Amici A. Levine R.L. Tsai L. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 365: 3341-3346Google Scholar). Brain aging is associated with changes increasing the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD). 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine; GSA, glutamic semialdehyde; AASA, aminoadipic semialdehyde; CEL, Nϵ-(carboxyethyl)-lysine; CML, Nϵ-(carboxymethyl)-lysine; AGE, advanced glycation end products; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids; MDAL, Nϵ-malondialdehyde-lysine; Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation end products; CHAPS, 3-[(cholamidopropyl)dimethylamino]-1-propanesulfonate; DTT, dithiothreitol; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; UFA, unsaturated fatty acids; MUFA, monounsaturated fatty acids; ACL, average chain length; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; MALDI-reTOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization reflectron time-of-flight. A corollary of this fact is that AD shows an acceleration of those phenomena underlying aging. Accordingly, an increased amount of protein bound 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNP)-reactive carbonyls, generated by protein oxidation are a common finding in brain samples from AD patients (2Aksenov M.Y. Aksenova M.V. Butterfield D.A. Geddes J.W. Markesbery W.R. Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 3Smith C.D. Carney J.M. Starke-Reed P.E. Oliver C.N. Stadtman E.R. Floyd R.A. Markesbery W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10540-10543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). All these works rely on the reaction of DNP with carbonyl groups. However, this assay has been criticized because of the possibility of artifacts (4Cao G. Cutler R.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The direct measure of the concentration of structurally characterized products could overcome this fact and it may be used as a complement for assessing the effects of oxidative stress in vivo. Glutamic semialdehyde (GSA) derives from the metal-catalyzed oxidation of proline and arginine, whereas aminoadipic semialdehyde (AASA) results from lysine oxidation (5Requena J.R. Chao C.C. Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). These products are among the main carbonyl products of metal-catalyzed oxidation of proteins (5Requena J.R. Chao C.C. Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), thus specific probes of oxidation of amino acids in protein. However, their presence and the factors affecting their concentrations in human brains are unknown to date. The chemical pathways linking increased free radical efflux and protein structural modification also involve third-party molecules, which may give rise to increased DNP-reactive carbonyls in proteins (6Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Particularly, carbohydrates, when reacting with free radicals generate highly reactive dicarbonyl compounds, such as glyoxal and methylglyoxal (7Thornalley P.J. Langborg A. Minhas H.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). In the cellular context, these may also be derived from glycolysis, triose phosphate metabolism, acetone metabolism (7Thornalley P.J. Langborg A. Minhas H.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), lipid peroxidation (8Fu M.X. Requena J.R. Jenkins A.J. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9982-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), and hypochlorite-mediated reactions (9Anderson M.M. Requena J.R. Crowley J.R. Thorpe S.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These compounds generate stable adducts reacting with lysine, arginine, and cysteine in proteins. Nϵ-(Carboxyethyl)-lysine (CEL) and Nϵ-(carboxymethyl)-lysine (CML) are two of these adducts, first described as advanced glycation end products (AGE), later named glycoxidation products and now recognized as mixed AGEs-advanced lipoxidation products. Despite that CML has been detected in AD lesions by immunohistochemical analyses (reviewed in Ref. 10Kikuchi S. Shinpo K. Takeuchi M. Yamagishi S. Makita Z. Sasaki N. Tashiro K. Brain Res. Rev. 2003; 41: 306-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), no chemical evidence have been reported for this product in AD samples or models. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are other third-party molecules. PUFA are molecules very susceptible to the oxidative action of free radicals (11Cosgrove J.P. Church D.F. Pryor W.A. Lipids. 1987; 22: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), generating specific reactive aldehydes, such as malondialdehyde or 4-hydroxynonenal, among others (12Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). These aldehydes could react with proteins, generating also DNP-reactive moieties (6Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). The important PUFA content in brain and its high oxygen consumption support the possible significance of lipid peroxidation-derived processes in brain aging and AD pathogenesis (2Aksenov M.Y. Aksenova M.V. Butterfield D.A. Geddes J.W. Markesbery W.R. Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Analogously to the other modifications pointed out above, evidence for lipid peroxidation-derived protein damage in AD comprise immunohistochemistry (13Butterfield D.A. Castegna A. Lauderback C.M. Drake J. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 203: 655-664Crossref Scopus (609) Google Scholar). However, there is no chemical evidence for lipid peroxidative damage of proteins in AD, based on structurally identified compounds and supported by mass spectrometry. Concerning the pathogenic role of these products, many recent studies of mechanisms underlying cellular dysfunction in Alzheimer disease have focused on amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). Persistent chronic inflammation appears to have a significant role in AD pathogenesis and evidence suggests that the sustained microglial response to Aβ could play a role in this process (14Akiyama H.S. Barger S. Barnum S. Bradt B. Bauer J. Cole G.M. Cooper N.R. Eikelenboom P. Emmerling M. Fiebich B.L. Finch C.E. Frautschy S. Griffin W.S. Hampel H. Hull M. Landreth G. Lue L. Mrak R. Mackenzie I.R. McGreer P.L. O'Banion M.K. Pachter J. Pasinetti G. Plata-Salaman C. Rogers J. Rydel R. Shen Y. Streit W. Strohmeyer R. Tooyoma I. Van Muiswinke F.L. Veerhuis R. Walker D. Webster S. Wegryniak B. Wenk G. Wysscoray T. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 383-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (3733) Google Scholar). In AD brains, the most highly activated microglia is observed in close association with Aβ plaques (15Itagaki S. McGreer P.L. Akiyama H. Zhu S. Selkoe D. J. Neuroimmunol. 1989; 24: 173-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). In addition, many inflammatory mediators detected in AD brains are of microglial origin (14Akiyama H.S. Barger S. Barnum S. Bradt B. Bauer J. Cole G.M. Cooper N.R. Eikelenboom P. Emmerling M. Fiebich B.L. Finch C.E. Frautschy S. Griffin W.S. Hampel H. Hull M. Landreth G. Lue L. Mrak R. Mackenzie I.R. McGreer P.L. O'Banion M.K. Pachter J. Pasinetti G. Plata-Salaman C. Rogers J. Rydel R. Shen Y. Streit W. Strohmeyer R. Tooyoma I. Van Muiswinke F.L. Veerhuis R. Walker D. Webster S. Wegryniak B. Wenk G. Wysscoray T. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 383-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (3733) Google Scholar). In vitro, interaction of Aβ with microglia has been shown to cause the induction of a range of inflammatory products, including proinflammatory cytokines, neurotoxic factors, reactive oxygen species, and complement pathway proteins (15Itagaki S. McGreer P.L. Akiyama H. Zhu S. Selkoe D. J. Neuroimmunol. 1989; 24: 173-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 16Haga S. Ikeda K. Sato M. Ishii T. Brain Res. 1993; 601: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Multiple Aβ-binding protein or receptors have been identified on a number of different cell types, including microglia. They cover cell surface heparan proteoglycans and signal transduction receptors (17Yaar M. Zhai S. Pilch P.F. Doyle S.M. Eisenhauer P.B. Fine R.E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 100: 2333-2340Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is one of these cell surface Aβ-binding proteins (18Brett J. Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Zou Y.S. Weidman E. Pinski D. Nowygrod R. Neeper M. Przysiecki C. Shaw A. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1699-1712PubMed Google Scholar). RAGE is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules whose expression is up-regulated at sites of diverse pathologies from atherosclerosis to AD (19Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Wautier J.L. Stern D.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The generation of reactive oxygen species, an early event after ligation of the receptor, may be fundamental for many RAGE-induced changes in cellular properties. In the case of neurons, RAGE-induced cellular activation ultimately results in induction of programmed cell death (20Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Yan S.F. Stern D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In this work, we attempted to identify and quantify the amount of oxidation-derived modified amino acids in proteins from the frontal cerebral cortex of human brains with AD. Prior, we evaluated the distribution of these protein modifications by Western blot, the possible influence of sample preparation in DNP-based outcomes, and studied part of the biological response to these products by examining RAGE expression. Finally, given the importance of PUFA in lipid peroxidation, we also studied the fatty acid profile from these samples and the identification of major targets of lipoxidative damage in brain cortex. Human Brain Specimens and Reagents—Brain samples were obtained from the Institute of Neuropathology Brain bank following the guidelines of the local ethics committee. The brains of 8 patients with AD (four men and four women) and 5 age-matched controls (three women and two men) were obtained from 2 to 13 h after death, and were immediately prepared for morphological and biochemical studies. The agonal state was short with no evidence of acidosis or prolonged hypoxia. AD changes were categorized following the nomenclature of Braak and Braak (21Braak H. Braak E. Cerebral Cortex: Neurodegenerative and Age-related Changes in Structure and Function of the Cerebral Cortex. 14. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Press, NY1999Google Scholar). Stage C of amyloid A4 deposition implicates involvement of the whole neocortex, whereas stages V and VI of neurofibrillary degeneration indicate moderate and severe involvement of the neocortex. No additional vascular or degenerative anomalies were present in these cases. Age-matched controls did not show neuropathological anomalies, particularly considering the absence of amyloid deposits often considered as normal old-age changes. Frozen samples of the frontal cortex (area 8) were used for biochemical studies. Samples of control and diseased brains were processed in parallel. Summary of the main clinical and neuropathological aspects is shown in Table I. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were from Aldrich or Sigma, of the highest purity available.Table ISummary of the main clinical and neuropathological findings in the present series Alzheimer disease, stages C of amyloid-βA4 deposition, and stages V and VI of neurofibrillary degeneration (NFT) according to Braak and Braak (21Braak H.

After a brief centrifugation (500 × g, 5 min) to pellet cellular debris, protein concentrations were measured in the supernatants using the Lowry assay (Bio-Rad). Prior to electrophoresis, samples were derivatized with DNP as previously described (22Portero-Otin M. Pamplona R. Ruiz M.C. Cabiscol E. Prat J. Bellmunt M.J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, to 15-μl homogenates adjusted to 3.75 μg/μl of protein, SDS was added to a final concentration of 6%, and after boiling for 3 min, 20 μl of 10 mm DNP in 10% trifluoroacetic acid were added. After 7 min at room temperature, 20 μl of a solution containing 2 m Tris base, 30% glycerol, and 15% β-mercaptoethanol were added for neutralization and sample preparation for loading onto SDS-PAGE gels. For sample clarification, prior to derivatization, chloroform (2:1, v/v) was added to an aliquot of the homogenates. Samples were then vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The proteins in the resulting supernatant were measured using the Bio-Rad method and equalized. Immunodetection of Protein-bound 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazones, AGEs and CML—For immunodetection, after SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred using a Mini Trans-Blot Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad) to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunodetection was performed using as primary antibodies: a rabbit anti-DNP antiserum (1:4000, Dako, Carpenteria, CA); 6D12, a monoclonal anti-CML antibody (1:2000, Transgenic Inc., Kumamoto, Japan); and a polyclonal anti-AGE antiserum, raised against glyoxilic acid-treated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (1:2000). Peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were used from the Tropix chemiluminescence kit (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Luminescence was recorded and quantified in Lumi-Imager equipment (Boehringer), using the Lumianalyst software. Control experiments showed that EDTA presence does not lead to generation of artifactual oxidation and that omission of the derivatization step, primary or secondary antibody addition produced blots with no detectable signal (data not shown). Immunodetection of RAGE—A slightly modified protocol was used. Briefly, samples (0.2g) from diseased and control cases were homogenized in a glass homogenizer in 10 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellet fractions were discarded and protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples containing 50 μg of protein were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters. After transfer, the filters were blocked by incubation with 5% nonfat dry milk in 100 mm Tris-buffered saline-Tween, containing 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4 (TBS-T), 1 h at room temperature. Then the filters were incubated overnight with TBS-T containing 3% bovine serum albumin and anti-RAGE antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:100 dilution. Next, the filters were washed three times in TBS-T and incubated with TBS-T containing 5% skimmed milk and horseradish peroxidase-linked goat immunoglobulins (Dako) diluted 1:1000 for 45 min at room temperature. Filters were washed several times in TBS-T, and immunoreactivity was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences), followed by exposure to ECL HYPER film (Amersham Biosciences). Mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin at a dilution of 1:5000 was used to ensure equal loading of samples. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Cortex samples were homogenized in a denaturation buffer (9 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 0.8% 3–11 IPG NL Buffer (Amersham Biosciences), 1% DTT and protein was quantified. An aliquot containing 50 μg of protein was adjusted to a final volume of 200 μl using rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 0,5% CHAPS, 0,5% 3–11 IPG NL Buffer, 18, 15 mm DTT, and 2% bromphenol blue) and applied overnight to 3–11 NL 11-cm IPG Strips (Amersham Biosciences). Isoelectric focusing was performed as follows: 500 V for 3 h, a linear gradient to 1000 V for 1 h, and finally 6000 V for 3 h in a Bio-Rad system. Strips were then incubated for 10 min in 37.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, containing 6 m urea, 2% (w/v) SDS 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5% DTT, and then re-equilibrated for 10 min in the same buffer except that DTT was replaced with 4.5% iodoacetamide. The equilibrated strips were loaded in a 11% 20-cm long SDS-PAGE gel and run as described in one-dimensional electrophoresis. Immunoblotting was performed as described above, using a Semidry transfer system and an anti-MDAL polyclonal antibody (Academy Biomedical Co., Houston, TX) as primary antibody (1:2000). For gel staining, a MS-modified silver staining method (Amersham Biosciences) was used as described by the manufacturer. For membrane staining, a silver staining method based on the Gallyas intensifier was used according to previously described procedures (23Sorensen B.K. Hojrup P. Ostergard E. Jorgensen C.S. Enghild J. Ryder L.R. Houen G. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 304: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Image Analysis—The gels (4 for each group) and polyvinylidene difluoride blots (n = 5) were scanned using a GS800 Calibrated Densitometer (Bio-Rad). PDQuest two-dimensional analysis software (Bio-Rad) was used for matching and analysis of silver-stained gels and membranes. The average mode of background subtraction was chosen to compare protein and MDAL immunoreactivity content between cortex samples from AD patients and control individuals. Normalized intensities of each protein spot from individual gels (or membranes) were compared between groups by the Student's t test. Mass Spectrometry for Protein Identification—After excision from gel, proteins were reduced with 10 mm DTT and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide. Enzymatic digestion was performed with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) following conventional procedures as described (24Forne I. Carrascal M. Martinez-Lostao L. Abian J. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Juarez C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50641-50644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After evaporation and redissolution in methanol/water (1:2 v/v), 1% acetic acid, digests were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization reflectron time-of-flight (MALDI-reTOF MS). The MALDI-reTOF MS analysis of the samples was performed using a Voyager DE-PRO MALDI-reTOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The instrument was run in reflectron mode with an average resolution of 12,000 full-width half-maximum at m/z 1500. A 5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic solution was used as MALDI matrix. Spectra were externally calibrated using a standard peptide mixture consisting of angiotensin II, substance P, bombesin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. When the ions corresponding to known trypsin autolytic peptides (m/z 842.5100 and 2111.1046) were detected, a second automatic internal calibration of the spectra was performed using these ions as reference. Data Base Search—The Protein Prospector software version 4.0.1 (University of California San Francisco, Mass Spectrometry Facility) was used to identify proteins from the peptide mass fingerprinting obtained from MALDI-reTOF MS. Swiss-Prot (European Bioinformatics Institute, Heidelberg, Germany) and GenBank™ (National Center for Biotechnology Information) data bases were used for the search. Measurement of GSA, AASA, CML, CEL, and MDAL—GSA, AASA, CML, CEL, and MDAL concentrations in total proteins from cerebral cortex homogenates were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as previously described (25Pamplona R. Portero-Otin M. Requena J. Gredilla R. Barja G. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Samples containing 0.75–1 mg of protein were delipidated using chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and proteins were precipitated by adding 10% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration) and subsequent centrifugation. Protein samples were reduced overnight with 500 mm NaBH4 (final concentration) in 0.2 m borate buffer, pH 9.2, containing 1 drop of hexanol as an anti-foam reagent. Proteins were then reprecipitated by adding 1 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid and subsequent centrifugation. The following isotopically labeled internal standards were then added: [2H8]lysine (d8-Lys; CDN Isotopes); [2H4]CML (d4-CML), [2H4]CEL (d4-CEL), and [2H8]MDAL (d8-MDAL), prepared as described (8Fu M.X.

The samples were hydrolyzed at 155 °C for 30 min in 1 ml of 6 n HCl, and then dried in vacuo. The N,O-trifluoroacetyl methyl ester derivatives of the protein hydrolysate were prepared as previously described (5Requena J.R. Chao C.C. Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

GC/MS analyses were carried out on a Hewlett-Packard model 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 30-m HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) coupled to a Hewlett-Packard model 5973A mass selective detector (Agilent, Barcelona, Spain). The injection port was maintained at 275 °C; the temperature program was 5 min at 110 °C, then 2 °C/min to 150 °C, then 5 °C/min to 240 °C, then 25 °C/min to 300 °C, and finally hold at 300 °C for 5 min. Quantification was performed by external standardization using standard curves constructed from mixtures of deuterated and non-deuterated standards. Analytes were detected by selected ion-monitoring GC/MS. The ions used were: lysine and d8-lysine, m/z 180 and 187, respectively; 5-hydroxy-2-aminovaleric acid and d5–5-hydroxy-2-aminovaleric acid (stable derivatives of GSA), m/z 280 and 285, respectively; 6-hydroxy-2-aminocaproic acid and d4–6-hydroxy-2-aminocaproic acid (stable derivatives of AASA), m/z 294 and 298, respectively; CML and d4-CML, m/z 392 and 396, respectively; CEL and d4-CEL, m/z 379 and 383, respectively; and MDAL and d8-MDAL, m/z 474 and 482, respectively. The amounts of products were expressed as the ratio of micromole of glutamic semialdehyde, aminoadipic semialdehyde, CML, CEL, or MDAL/mol of lysine. Fatty Acid Analysis—Fatty acid analysis was performed as previously described (25Pamplona R. Portero-Otin M. Requena J. Gredilla R. Barja G. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Total lipids from human brain homogenates were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) in the presence of 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene. The chloroform phase was evaporated under nitrogen, and the fatty acids were transesterified by incubation in 2.5 ml of 5% methanolic HCl for 90 min at 75 °C. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters were extracted by adding 2.5 ml of n-pentane and 1 ml of saturated NaCl solution. The n-pentane phase was separated, evaporated under nitrogen, redissolved in 75 μl of carbon disulfide, and 1 μl was used for GC/MS analysis. Separation was performed in a SP2330 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.20 μm) in a Hewlett-Packard 6890 Series II gas chromatograph (Agilent). A Hewlett-Packard 5973A mass spectrometer was used as detector in the electron-impact mode. The injection port was maintained at 220 °C, and the detector at 250 °C; the temperature program was 2 min at 100 °C, then 10 °C/min to 200 °C, then 5 °C/min to 240 °C, and finally hold at 240 °C for 10 min. Identification of fatty acid methyl esters was made by comparison with authentic standards and based on mass spectra. Results are expressed as mol %. From fatty acid composition, the following indexes were calculated: saturated fatty acids = Σ % of saturated fatty acids; unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) = Σ % unsaturated fatty acids; monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) = Σ % of monoenoic fatty acids; polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids (PUFAn-3) = Σ % of polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3 series; polyunsaturated n-6 fatty acids (PUFAn-6) = Σ % of polyunsaturated fatty acids n-6 series; average chain length = [(Σ % Total14 × 14) +... + (Σ % totaln × n)]/100 (n = carbon atom number); peroxidizability index = [(Σ mol % monoenoic × 0.025) + (Σ mol % dienoic × 1) + (Σ mol % trienoic × 2) + (Σ mol % tetraenoic × 4) + (Σ mol % pentaenoic × 6) + (Σ mol % hexaenoic × 8)] (11Cosgrove J.P.

Here we report the discovery of a new family of proteins with homology to MURR1. These proteins form multimeric complexes and were identified in a biochemical screen for MURR1-associated factors. The family is defined by the presence of a conserved and unique motif termed the COMM (copper metabolism gene MURR1) domain, which functions as an interface for protein-protein interactions. Like MURR1, several of these factors also associate with and inhibit NF-κB. The proteins designated as COMMD or COMM domain containing 1–10 are extensively conserved in multicellular eukaryotic organisms and define a novel family of structural and functional homologs of MURR1. The prototype of this family, MURR1/COMMD1, suppresses NF-κB not by affecting nuclear translocation or binding of NF-κB to cognate motifs; rather, it functions in the nucleus by affecting the association of NF-κB with chromatin.

Through transcriptional regulation of many gene products, NF-κB participates in a number of biological processes including innate and adaptive immune responses, programmed cell death, cell cycle progression, and oncogenesis (1Ghosh S.

Additionally, by its ability to regulate transcription of various viral genomes including human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (7Perkins N.D. Edwards N.L. Duckett C.S. Agranoff A.B. Schmid R.M.

Studies into the regulation of NF-κB activation have largely focused on the role of cytoplasmic sequestration of the NF-κB complex as a mainstay level of control. In most cells NF-κB is localized in the cytoplasm through the interaction of the complex with members of the IκB family (11Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). These proteins contain ankyrin repeats that allow their interaction with NF-κB and mask the nuclear localization signal present in the RHD. Phosphorylation of IκB by a multimeric kinase known as the IκB kinase complex targets these proteins for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (3Karin M. Yamamoto Y. Wang Q.M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 12Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). This allows the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus where it binds to cognate DNA sequences present in an array of gene promoters. MURR1 is a recently identified factor that has been shown to participate in two apparently distinct activities, regulation of the transcription factor NF-κB and control of copper metabolism (13Greene W.C. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 18-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Mutations in MURR1 are responsible for copper toxicosis in an inbred canine strain (Bedlington terriers) (14van De Sluis B. Rothuizen J. Pearson P.L. van Oost B.A. Wijmenga C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and an interaction between MURR1 and the copper transporter ATP7B (15Tao T.Y. Liu F. Klomp L. Wijmenga C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41593-41596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) has been recently reported. In addition to its role in copper metabolism in mammals, more recent studies implicate MURR1 in the regulation of the transcription factor NF-κB (13Greene W.C. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 18-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Ganesh L. Burstein E. Guha-Niyogi A. Louder M.K. Mascola J.R. Klomp L.W. Wijmenga C. Duckett C.S. Nabel G.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). MURR1 was found to be a broad inhibitor of NF-κB, affecting κB-responsive transcription from endogenous and viral promoters including the HIV-1 enhancer (16Ganesh L. Burstein E. Guha-Niyogi A. Louder M.K. Mascola J.R. Klomp L.W. Wijmenga C. Duckett C.S. Nabel G.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Through this effect, MURR1 can function as a factor that limits HIV-1 replication in resting CD4+ lymphocytes. Here we report the discovery of a family of proteins structurally and functionally related to MURR1. These factors contain a unique and defining domain termed the COMM (copper metabolism gene MURR1) domain, and thus, these proteins have been named COMM domain-containing or COMMD proteins. Similar to MURR1/COMMD1, several of these factors associate with NF-κB and inhibit its transcriptional activity. In addition, we find that COMMD proteins form heteromeric complexes that are mediated by the COMM domain. The prototype of the family, MURR1/COMMD1, exerts its ability to inhibit κB-mediated transcription without affecting nuclear translocation but through nuclear regulation of NF-κB. We show here that MURR1/COMMD1 is recruited to chromatin of a κB-responsive promoter upon NF-κB activation and negatively regulates the association of RelA to chromatin. Therefore, this work identifies a novel family of factors that regulate NF-κB-mediated transcription by controlling the occupancy of NF-κB on chromatin.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assays—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and prostate cancer and DU145 cells were obtained from ATCC. 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and l-glutamine, and DU145 cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, sodium bicarbonate, and pyruvate. A standard calcium phosphate transfection protocol (20Duckett C.S. Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to transfect plasmids and siRNA oligonucleotides into 293 cells. Delivery of siRNA oligonucleotides into DU145 cells was performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as specified by the manufacturer. For luciferase reporter experiments, cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with 4 μg of pEBB plasmid, and 25 ng of the reporter plasmid 2κB-luciferase. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (25Birkey Reffey S. Wurthner J.U. Parks W.T. Roberts A.B. Duckett C.S. J. Biol.

For immunoprecipitation experiments cells were seeded in 10-cm plates and transfected with a total of 12 μg of plasmid. Finally, suppression of endogenous COMMD expression was achieved by transfection of 293 cells seeded in 6-well plates with 2 μg of the corresponding siRNA oligonucleotides (Qiagen). TAP Screening—293 cells seeded in 15-cm plates were transiently transfected with pEBB-MURR1-TAP (15 μg of plasmid/plate) and 2 days later were lysed in Triton lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors). The lysate was supplemented with NaCl and Nonidet P-40 and applied to a chromatography column containing IgG-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C the column was drained and washed with IPP150 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH+ 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors) and TEV cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH+ 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors). After incubation for 2 h at 16 °C in TEV cleavage buffer supplemented with TEV enzyme (Invitrogen), the eluate was collected and supplemented with CaCl2 and IPP150 calmodulin binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH+ 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). This was then applied to a chromatography column containing calmodulin 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The column was then drained and washed with IPP150 calmodulin binding buffer. After incubation at 4 °C with IPP150 calmodulin elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH+ 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), a final eluate was collected. Proteins were precipitated by adding cold 10% trichloroacetic acid in acetone; after overnight incubation at –20 °C, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 4 °C (10,000 × g for 30 min), rinsed in 100% acetone, and allowed to air dry. These samples were then submitted to the Proteomics Centre at the University of Victoria for further processing, including tryptic digestion, high performance liquid chromatography separation, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to determine peptide sequences. RT-PCR and Expression Data—Total RNA was extracted from 293 cells using RNeasy (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Yield and purity was determined by measuring A260/280 of RNA diluted in water. Oligonucleotides and internal probes for RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR of COMMD transcripts were designed with the use of the automated primer design tool, AutoPrime (www.autoprime.de). Detailed information about sequences and cycling parameters are available upon request. For non-quantitative RT-PCR, Titan One-Tube RT-PCR (Roche Applied Science) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. For quantitative RT-PCR reactions, an RT reaction with 500 ng of total RNA in 25 μl was performed using random hexamers and Taqman reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). This was followed by quantitative PCR performed in the 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). In all reactions, Taqman PCR Master Mix with the appropriate primers and probes was used. Primers and probe sets for c-IAP2 (BIRC3) and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) as an internal control were obtained from Applied Biosystems.

A polyclonal COMMD1 antiserum was raised by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits. Recombinant protein, which was used as immunogen, was produced in Escherichia coli by expressing GST-COMMD1 using the pGEX-4T1 bacterial expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). GST-COMMD1 was purified over a glutathione-Sepharose chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences), and COMMD1 was generated by thrombin cleavage of the GST affinity tag according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Confocal and Fluorescence Microscopy—293 cells were plated in chambered cover glass plates or 6-well plates and transfected with EGFP-p65 (25 or 50 ng/well, respectively). Morphological assays for nuclear translocation of EGFP-p65 were performed by observing cells with a Zeiss Axiovert 100 m confocal microscope before and after treatment with TNF. Representative images were obtained, and 250–400 cells were observed and scored accordingly. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—293 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes and transfected as indicated. TNF stimulation, when performed, consisted of treating cells with 1000 units/ml for 30 min before lysis. The preparation of nuclear extracts and EMSA have been described previously (24Duckett C.S.

For our studies, a double-stranded oligonucleotide encompassing a canonical κB sequence was used as probe (forward sequence, AGCTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGG). Cellular Fractionation—293 cells were plated in 10-cm plates 48 h before the procedure. Medium was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and collected in a microcentrifuge tube. The cells were resuspended in 200 μl of buffer 1 (25 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). After that, 200 μl of buffer 2 were added (Buffer 1 with 1% Nonidet P-40), and the cells were incubated with constant rotation at 4 °C for 15 min. The samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 600 × g, and the supernatant, corresponding to the cytoplasmic fraction, was collected. The precipitated material was gently rinsed in 100 μl of buffer 3 (1:1 mixture of buffers 1 and 2). After centrifuging the samples again as before, the supernatant was collected as part of the cytoplasmic fraction. The remaining precipitated material was then treated by the addition of 500 μl of buffer 5 (25 mm HEPES, 10% sucrose, 350 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors) and incubated with constant rotation at 4 °C for 60 min. After this, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,100 × g. The supernatant, corresponding to the nuclear fraction, was collected separately. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Subconfluent DU145 cells were treated with TNF (1000 units/ml) before cross-linking for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. For attachment assays, 293 cells were re-plated in serum-free media on laminin-coated plates (Discovery Labware) as previously described (27Hoberg J.E. Yeung F. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). ChIP protocol and primers sequences have been previously described (28Yeung F. Hoberg J.E. Ramsey C.S. Keller M.D. Jones D.R. Frye R.A. Mayo M.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2369-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Antibodies used in the ChIP studies include COMMD1 (described above), M2 Flag (Sigma, F3165), RNA polymerase II (Santa Cruz, SC-9001), and RelA (Upstate, 06-418). Biochemical Screen for MURR1-associated Factors—To further understand the cellular activities of MURR1, a biochemical screen for associated proteins was performed based on the TAP scheme that has been previously described (23Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Briefly, MURR1 in fusion with the TAP affinity tag was transiently expressed in 293 cells, and MURR1-TAP was subsequently purified from cells lysates using two sequential chromatography columns containing IgG and calmodulin beads, respectively (Fig. 1A). The material obtained was subjected to tryptic digestion, and the peptides generated were then identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) after initial separation using liquid chromatography. A number of associated factors were identified, including three proteins that upon close inspection demonstrated the presence of a region with close homology to MURR1 in their carboxyl termini (Fig. 1, A and B). These factors were later designated as COMMD3, -4, and -6 (see below). Identification of the COMMD Protein Family—After the identification of three MURR1 homologous factors in our biochemical screen, we performed an extensive search of the sequence databases for additional homologs. Through this approach we were able to identify 10 proteins in humans, including MURR1, that contain highly conserved carboxyl-terminal sequences (Fig. 1B). The majority of these genes were only known as open reading frames and had not been previously characterized. Further analysis of orthologs present across multiple species demonstrated that the area of close homology in the carboxyl termini of these proteins represents a previously unrecognized, unique, and highly conserved motif (Fig. 1C). This leucine-rich, 70–85 amino acid long sequence is predicted to form a β-sheet. We have termed this region the copper metabolism gene MURR1 (COMM) domain. The designation of homologs of MURR1 identified here required the generation of a new nomenclature. Murr1 derived its name from its proximity to the U2af1-rs1 locus in mice (mouse U2af1-rs1 region 1); however, this genomic organization is not observed in other organisms including humans. In addition, an unrelated gene that also lies in close proximity to U2af1-rs1 has been designated Murr2, precluding the use of this name for MURR1 homologs (29Nabetani A. Hatada I. Morisaki H. Oshimura M. Mukai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In consultation with the HUGO gene nomenclature committee, the term COMMD (COMMDomain containing) is proposed to designate these factors based on the shared structural domain that defines this family of proteins and has been adopted in NCBI public databases. The name COMMD1 is suggested for MURR1 as a means to standardize the nomenclature to designate this protein family and will be used hereafter. With the exception of COMMD1, no other COMMDs have been previously described in any detail. COMMD5 was identified as an open reading frame that is overexpressed in naturally hypertensive rats and suppressed in a number of primary tumors and cancer cell lines (30Solban N. Jia H.P. Richard S. Tremblay S. Devlin A.M. Peng J. Gossard F. Guo D.F. Morel G. Hamet P. Lewanczuk R. Tremblay J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32234-32243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The expressed protein localizes to the nucleus, although a direct role in transcription had not been previously demonstrated. COMMD6 is orthologous to a mouse gene located in a region that is necessary for normal embryonic development, although it is unclear whether COMMD6 itself is required for normal embryogenesis (31Semenova E. Wang X. Jablonski M.M. Levorse J. Tilghman S.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similarly, COMMD3 was previously identified as a locus with close proximity to the Polycomb-group gene Bmi-1 (32Haupt Y. Barri G. Adams J.M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 17: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Finally, an expressed sequence tag corresponding to COMMD7 was found to be consistently repressed in an experimental system designed to screen for factors involved in leukemogenesis (33Roperch J.P. Lethrone F. Prieur S. Piouffre L. Israeli D. Tuynder M. Nemani M. Pasturaud P. Gendron M.C. Dausset J. Oren M. Amson R.B. Telerman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8070-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). COMMD Genes Are Highly Conserved—We found that all 10 genes have been conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, as can be gleaned from orthologs found in Silurana tropicalis, Xenopus laevis, Danio rerio, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and Oryzias latipes (see the supplemental table). In general, mammalian sequences are about 90% conserved when compared with their human orthologs. Furthermore, lower metazoans, including insects, worms, and molds, also possess COMMD genes; however, none of these genes were identified in unicellular eukaryotic organisms or bacteria. Five of these genes were found in Drosophila melanogaster (COMMD2, -3, -4, -5, and -10) and Dictyostelium discoideum (COMMD4, -5, -7, -8, and -10). Overall, eight of the COMMD genes can be found in lower metazoans, with COMMD1 and COMMD9 orthologs being restricted to vertebrate species (see the supplemental figure). Despite the presence of a conserved and defining motif in all these proteins, a significant proportion of the sequence of each COMMD protein is composed of unique regions that are divergent across members of the family. For example, human and zebrafish COMMD1 are 72% conserved, whereas human COMMD1 and COMMD10 are only 34% conserved when regions outside the COMM domain are included in the comparison (data not shown). COMMD Genes Are Widely Expressed—Given that COMMD proteins were initially identified as COMMD1-associated factors in 293 cells, we first investigated the pattern of expression of human COMMD genes in this cell line. To this end, we designed primers for RT-PCR of each one of these genes including in each case one primer that was selected at an exon-exon junction. This strategy minimizes the possibility of spurious amplification from contaminating genomic DNA because such junctions are generated only after splicing. In addition, the potential for mispriming against the intronic boundary was taken into account in the design. With this algorithm we identified primers for all 10 human COMMD genes, with the amplicon size and position of exon-exon primers indicated in Fig. 2A. Using these primers and total RNA extracted from 293 cells we were able to amplify the appropriate size products for each of the COMMD genes (Fig. 2B). Template-lacking negative controls did not amplify these products (data not shown). This indicated that 293 cells express all COMMD genes, a fact that was also confirmed by publicly available expression data (not shown here). Next, the level of COMMD expression in multiple tissues was analyzed using data available from the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation. Utilizing oligonucleotide arrays, expression levels for more than 44,000 mRNA transcripts across 79 human tissues were determined (26Su A.I. Wiltshire T. Batalov S. Lapp H. Ching K.A. Block D. Zhang J. Soden R. Hayakawa M. Kreiman G. Cooke M.P. Walker J.R. Hogenesch J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6062-6067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2862) Google Scholar). This raw data were downloaded, and the corresponding probes for most COMMD genes (with the exception of COMMD6) were identified. Expression levels in 13 selected tissues were further analyzed and are presented in Fig. 2C. As shown, COMMDs are widely expressed in human tissues, but the relative abundance of any given COMMD mRNA is different across the samples. For example, whereas COMMD1 expression is highest in the testis, COMMD3 is the highest expressed in the thymus, COMMD7 in the lung, and COMMD8 in the thyroid. Conversely, any given tissue has a complement of COMMD genes that demonstrate highest expression, and these subsets are not identical in each case (data not shown). COMMD1 Can Associate with Other COMMD Proteins— COMMD3, -4, and -6 were initially identified biochemically by their ability to interact with COMMD1. Therefore, the ability of all the members of the family to interact with COMMD1 was evaluated. Each of the 10 COMMD proteins was fused to GST and expressed in 293 cells. COMMD-GST fusion proteins were then precipitated from cell lysates with glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the recovered material was immunoblotted for endogenous COMMD1 (Fig. 3A). COMMD1–8 and COMMD10 could readily precipitate endogenous COMMD1; COMMD9 also co-associates with COMMD1 but to a lesser extent (not shown here). These experiments demonstrated that COMMD1 can interact with itself and with all other COMMD proteins, consistent with the interactions detected in the initial TAP screen. COMMD-COMMD Protein Interactions Are Mediated by the COMM Domain—To define the domain(s) required for COMMD multimer formation, a variety of deletion constructs of COMMD1 were tested for their ability to bind COMMD1 and COMMD3. The coding regions corresponding to each exon of COMMD1 were used as boundaries in constructs expressing fusion proteins with GST (Fig. 3B). The hereditary canine copper toxicosis mutation described previously consists of a genomic deletion encompassing exon 2 of COMMD1 such that the expressed open reading fram"

These studies suggest that the loss of the normal function of DJ-1 leads to PD. However, the nature of the normal function of DJ-1 and the mechanism by which DJ-1 deficiency leads to PD are not well established. Studies prior to the report of its association with PD suggested that DJ-1 might play a role in oncogenesis (11Nagakubo D. Taira T. Kitaura H. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Biochem.

PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e362Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Therefore, putative functions of DJ-1 seem to converge on the common pathogenesis of PD implicated in other genetic and sporadic forms of PD. Despite those new insights into the biochemical and cellular functions of DJ-1, the in vivo evidence of how the loss of DJ-1 function leads to PD has not been presented. Specifically, it will be important to find out whether animal models that harbor similar mutations to those found in PD patients will develop dopamine neuron degeneration and/or parkinsonian motor symptoms. Since human genetic studies suggest that a loss-of-function of DJ-1 is responsible for the pathogenesis of this genetic form of PD, we have generated DJ-1 null mice with a mutation that resembles the large deletion mutation reported in patients. Our behavioral analyses indicate that DJ-1 deficiency leads to age-dependent motoric behavioral deficits. Even though no obvious dopamine neuron loss was found in 6-month- and 11-month-old mice, neurochemical examination of dopaminergic function revealed significant alterations in tissue dopamine content and reuptake in DJ-1 null mice. Generation of DJ-1 Null Mice—We generated DJ-1 null mice by deleting 9.3-kb genomic DNA including the first 5 exons and part of the promoter region of DJ-1 gene to mimic the deletion mutation in humans (1Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C. Squitieri F. Ibanez P. Joosse M. van Dongen J.W. Vanacore N. van Swieten J.C. Brice A. Meco G. van Duijn C.M. Oostra B.A. Heutink P. Science. 2003; 299: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Both the 5.4- and 3.3-kb fragments of the targeting construct were amplified by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from E14Tg2A.4 embryonic stem cells (BayGenomics) as a template. The selection marker PGK-neo-poly(A) was flanked by FRT sequences. E14Tg2A.4 embryonic stem cells were electroporated (800 V and 3 microfarads) with 30 μg of linearized targeting construct. G418-resistant clones were screened by Southern blot for homologous recombination with a 5′-external probe. Positive cells were injected into C57BL6/J blastocysts to generate chimeras, which were then mated with C57BL6/J wild-type mice to generate heterozygotes. Heterozygous mutant mice on a 129 × C57B/6 mixed background were bred to generate DJ-1 null mice and their wild-type littermate controls for experiments. Mice were genotyped by multiplex PCR on genomic DNA extracted from tail snips (Fig. 1B): first primer pair amplifies part of intron 6 of DJ-1 (present in all mice); second primer pair amplifies part of neor (absent in wild-type mice); third primer pair amplifies part of intron 3 (absent in homozygous mutants). The genotypes of some mice were confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1C). The absence of DJ-1 expression was confirmed by in situ hybridization. A full-length mouse DJ-1 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and used as an in situ hybridization probe. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee of The University of Chicago. Behavioral Studies—All mice were kept on a 06:00–18:00 light cycle with ad libitum food and water. Behavioral tests were performed during the light period. Open Field Test—Each mouse was placed in an open field chamber (40 cm long × 40 cm wide × 37 cm high, Med Associates). Illumination of open field was set to 20 lux. No background noise was provided. They were monitored by infrared beams that record the location and path of the animal (locomotor activity) as well as the number of rearing movements (vertical activity). Data were collected in 5-min trials for six trials, and the average was reported. Rotarod Test—Mice were first trained to stay on the rod of the rotarod (Columbus Instrument) at a constant speed of 5 rpm for at least 1 min. Following training, mice were tested for a total of three trials with an accelerating speed of 0.2 rpm/s, starting at 5 rpm. The latency to fall was recorded for each trial, and the average of three trials was reported. Adhesive Tape Removal Task—Adhesive tapes (Avery labels) of five sizes (0.625, 0.5, 0.375, 0.25, 0.125 in2) were placed on the forehead in the above order. To remove the tape, mice typically raised both forepaws and swiped off the tape. Each trial was given a score equal to the size of the largest tape the mouse was unable to remove within 60 s (5 to 1, a higher score indicates worse performance). Results were obtained from the average over two trials. Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) Immunohistochemistry and Stereology—TH catalyzes the rate-limiting step of dopamine synthesis and was used as a marker for dopamine neurons in the substantial nigra pars compacta (SNc). The number of TH-immunoreactive (THir) cells was assessed using an unbiased stereological procedure (29Mouton P.R. Principles and Practices of Unbiased Stereology: An Introduction for Bioscientists. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore2002Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were perfused by 4% paraformaldehyde, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. The entire brain was sliced on a sliding microtome into consecutive 40-μm sections. Every third section was immunohistochemically processed for TH and NeuN. For TH staining, rabbit anti-mouse TH antibody (1:1000, Pel-Freez), biotinylated horse anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Vector Laboratories), and peroxidase-conjugated avidin-biotin complex (VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) were used. The reaction was visualized by using Sigmafast diaminobenzidine tablets (Sigma) with the addition of nickel sulfate. For NeuN staining, mouse anti-mouse NeuN antibody (1:1000, Chemicon), biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500; Vector Laboratories) and diaminobenzidine without nickel sulfate were used. The estimation of the total number of THir neurons in the SNc was determined using the computerized optical fractionator probe (Stereo Investigator 6 from MicroBrightField), which allowed for the stereological estimation of THir cells in the entire structure independent of size, shape, orientation, tissue shrinkage, or anatomical level. The 100 × 100-μm grid and 40 × 40-μm counting frame were used. Sections were counted in rostral-caudal order. The most rostral section containing THir neurons was designated as the first section. The absolute THir neuron number was directly calculated without estimating reference volume. The Gundersun's coefficient of error was 0.06 (m = 1) in this study. Immunofluorescence Double Labeling—Rabbit anti-mouse TH (1:500, Pel-Freez) and mouse anti-mouse α-synuclein (1:500, BD Transduction Laboratories) antibodies were used to detect α-synuclein expression in dopamine neurons. Mouse anti-mouse TH (1:500, BD Transduction Laboratories) and rabbit anti-ubiquitin antibodies (1:500, Dako) were used to detect protein ubiquitination in dopamine neurons. All fluorescence secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sections were analyzed under a Zeiss Confocal LSM510 Microscope. HPLC Assessment of Brain Tissue Content of Dopamine and Metabolites—Mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Dissected striata of adult mice were homogenized in 0.1 m perchloric acid containing 1 × 10-6 m methyldopa as an internal standard. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 × g. Supernatants were filtered through an YM-10 Microcon centrifugal filter unit (Millipore) and analyzed for dopamine and metabolites using high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Dopamine and metabolites were separated on a reverse-phase column (Velosep RP-18, 3 μm, 100 × 3.2 mm, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a mobile phase consisting of 0.1 m phosphate buffer with 0.6 mm octyl sodium sulfate, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 3% methanol (pH 2.6) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Samples (25 μl) were injected with a Rheodyne injector, and the compounds were analyzed using a coulometric detector with analytical cell (model 5014, ESA). The potential for the first and second cell was set at -100 and +310 mV, respectively. A guard cell (model 5020, ESA, potential +330 mV) was placed before the injector. Levels of dopamine and metabolites detected in the supernatants were calculated using internal standards. Final concentrations of dopamine and metabolites were expressed per protein amount. Protein levels were measured by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Western Blot—Mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Brains were dissected and frozen immediately on powdered dry ice and stored in -80 °C until use. Frozen brains were lysed in NTE buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS), and 50 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were electrophorectically transferred to PVDF membrane and nonspecific sites blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS (135 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris, 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.4)). Membranes were then incubated with various primary antibodies in TBS with 2% nonfat dry milk: rat anti-mouse dopamine transporter (DAT) antibody (1:4000, Chemicon), rabbit anti-mouse TH antibody (1:2000, Pel-Freez), goat anti-mouse vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-mouse α-synuclein antibody (1:2000, BD Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-mouse androgen receptor antibody (1:1000, Abcam), mouse anti-mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody (1:200,000, Abcam). Signals were then detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (ICN) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Membranes were then stripped and reprobed with the monoclonal mouse antibodies against mouse β-actin (1:200,000, Abcam) to confirm equal loading of samples. Protein Carbonyl Analysis—The commonly used indicator of protein oxidation is protein carbonyl content (30Stadtman E.R. Oliver C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2005-2008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The OxyBlot protein oxidation detection kit from Chemicon was used following the manufacturer's instructions. Cyclic Voltammetry in Brain Slices—Mice were killed by decapitation, and the brain was rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold, preoxygenated (95% O2/5% CO2) modified Kreb's buffer. The tissue was then sectioned into 400-μm-thick coronal slices containing the caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens with a vibrating tissue slicer (Leica VT100S, Leica Instruments). Slices were kept in a reservoir of oxygenated Krebs buffer at room temperature until required. Thirty minutes before each experiment, a brain slice was transferred to a submersion recording chamber. The slices were perfused at 1 ml/min with room temperature (20 °C) oxygenated Krebs and allowed to equilibrate. The Kreb's buffer contained (in mm): NaCl, 126; KCl, 2.5; NaH2PO4, 1.2; CaCl2, 2.4; MgCl, 1.2; NaHCO3, 25; glucose, 11; HEPES, 20; and l-ascoribic acid, 0.4 (pH 7.4). Dopamine release was evoked by a single, rectangular, electrical pulse (300 μA, 2 ms per phase, biphasic) applied every 5 min. Dopamine was detected by using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry as described earlier (31Budygin E.A. John C.E. Mateo Y. Jones S.R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: RC222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Phillips P.E. Johns J.M. Lubin D.A. Budygin E.A. Gainetdinov R.R. Lieberman J.A. Wightman R.M. Brain Res. 2003; 961: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Electrodes were placed in the dorsal and ventral portion of the caudate-putamen and in the core and shell of the nucleus accumbens. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using StatView 5.0.1. Unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was used when genotype was the only grouping variable. Analysis of variance was used when genotype was not the only grouping variable and when data were collected in a single trial. Repeated measure analysis of variance was used when data were collected in multiple trials. Generation of DJ-1 Null Mice—DJ-1 null mice were generated by deleting the first 5 exons and part of the promoter to mimic the deletion mutation reported in human PD patients (1Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C. Squitieri F. Ibanez P. Joosse M. van Dongen J.W. Vanacore N. van Swieten J.C. Brice A. Meco G. van Duijn C.M. Oostra B.A. Heutink P. Science. 2003; 299: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The lack of DJ-1 transcript expression in homozygous mutants was confirmed both by reverse transcription-PCR in cultured adult skin fibroblasts (Fig. 1D) and by in situ hybridization on brain sections (Fig. 1E). DJ-1 mRNA signal was detected throughout the wild-type mouse brain by in situ hybridization. The high expression level of DJ-mRNA was found in the SNc, cerebellum, cerebral cortex (Fig. 1E), hippocampus, striatum, and olfactory bulb (data not shown). Most of the expression was in cells exhibiting neuronal morphology. However, strong expression was also present in the choroid plexus (data not shown). These data are similar to the expression patterns reported by others (33Shang H. Lang D. Jean-Marc B. Kaelin-Lang A. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 367: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34Bandopadhyay R. Kingsbury A.E. Cookson M.R. Reid A.R. Evans I.M. Hope A.D. Pittman A.M. Lashley T. Canet-Aviles R. Miller D.W. McLendon C. Strand C. Leonard A.J. Abou-Sleiman P.M. Healy D.G. Ariga H. Wood N.W. de Silva R. Revesz T. Hardy J.A. Lees A.J. Brain. 2004; 127: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The ratios of wild-type: heterozygotes:homozygotes of both sexes were consistent with Mendelian inheritance (Fig. 1F, p = 0.09 by χ2 test). DJ-1 null mice were viable and appeared indistinguishable from the wild-type or heterozygotes littermates in gross inspection. No significant body weight difference was found between genotypes (p = 0.41; Fig. 1G). Age-dependent Motor Deficits in DJ-1 Null Mice—Three independent age groups of DJ-1 null mice (5, 9, and 11 months) and their wild-type littermate controls were subjected to systematic behavioral assessment of various motor functions. In the open field test, DJ-1 null mice displayed decreased locomotor (p = 0.001) and rearing (p = 0.005) activities (Fig. 2). Such a deficit seemed to be age-dependent (genotype × age interaction: p = 0.032 for rearing and p = 0.068 for locomotion). Post hoc test revealed that only 11-month-old DJ-1 null mice showed significantly impaired locomotion and rearing compared with their wild-type controls (p = 0.002 for locomotion and p = 0.037 for rearing). There was no significant genotype × sex interaction. To determine whether more sensitive measures of nigrostriatal dysfunction could differentiate DJ-1 null mice from their wild-type controls at an earlier age, an adhesive tape removal test that has been shown to be a good discriminator in mouse models of PD was employed (35Goldberg M.S. Fleming S.M. Palacino J.J. Cepeda C. Lam H.A. Bhatnagar A. Meloni E.G. Wu N. Ackerson L.C. Klapstein G.J. Gajendiran M. Roth B.L. Chesselet M.F. Maidment N.T. Levine M.S. Shen J. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9434-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Behavioral deficits in the adhesive tape remove test could be seen as early as 5 months of age in DJ-1 null mice compared with their wild-type controls (Fig. 3). The behavioral deficit in DJ-1 null mice was more pronounced at 11 months of age than at 5 months (p = 0.0001 for overall genotype effect, p = 0.013 for 5-month group, and p = 0.007 for 11-month group), although there was no statistically significant genotype × age interaction (p = 0.19). Interestingly, male mice seemed to be more affected than female mice on this task (p = 0.0027 for genotype × sex interaction). Post hoc tests revealed that only male mice displayed significant deficits (p < 0.0001 for males and p = 0.50 for females). The rotarod treadmill behavioral test is also widely used as a measure of various neurological dysfunctions. However, the rotarod treadmill test did not detect any genotype differences in any age groups including 11 months of age (Fig. 3). Functional Alterations in Dopaminergic Neurotransmission in DJ-1 Null Mice—Since functional alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission may precede obvious dopaminergic neuronal loss or pathological abnormalities, we examined dopamine release, uptake kinetics, and total striatal tissue content of dopamine in DJ-1 null mice and their wild-type controls. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was employed to evaluate electrically stimulated dopamine release and uptake kinetics of the dopamine transporter. The caudate-putamen was divided into dorsal and ventral halves for data analysis. At 4 months of age, DJ-1 null mice had increased stimulated dopamine release (Fig. 4A; p = 0.0002) and faster uptake (Vmax) (Fig. 4E; p = 0.0001) compared with wild-type littermate controls in the dorsal caudate-putamen. However, in ventral caudate-putamen, dopamine release (Fig. 4B; p = 0.61) and Vmax for uptake (Fig. 4F; p = 0.18) were not significantly affected by genotype. There were no significant sex differences. We further characterized dopamine terminal regions in the core and shell of the nucleus accumbens of DJ-1 null mice. There were no significant differences in dopamine release (Fig. 4D; p = 0.79) or Vmax for uptake (Fig. 4H; p = 0.91) in the nucleus accumbens shell. There was also no significant difference in dopamine release (Fig. 4C; p = 0.47) in the nucleus accumbens core. However, in the core, there was a trend toward an increased Vmax value for dopamine uptake (Fig. 4G; p = 0.084). To investigate whether the increases in uptake and release reflect changes in dopamine tissue content, the caudate-putamens of 6-month- and 11-month-old mice were dissected out and subjected to HPLC analysis for dopamine and metabolite content. Dopamine levels in DJ-1 null mice were higher than those in wild-type control mice in both age groups (p = 0.0014 for genotype effect; p < 0.0001 for age effect Fig. 4I). There was no significant age × genotype interaction or sex differences. There was an insignificant trend for elevation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (p = 0.11) and homovanillic acid (p = 0.14) in DJ-1 null mice compared with wild-type control mice. We investigated whether the increases in tissue dopamine content, release, and uptake are due to changes in expression levels of dopamine synthesis enzymes or transporters. However, no significant differences between genotypes were seen in TH, DAT, or VMAT2 protein levels in 5-month- (not shown) and 11-month-old (Fig. 4J) mouse brains measured by Western blot analysis. DJ-1 Null Mice Did Not Show Loss of SN Dopamine Neurons or Obvious Neuropathology—To determine whether the behavioral deficits resulted from the loss of dopaminergic neurons, stereological analysis of THir neurons in the SNc was performed in 6-month- and 11-month-old mice. However, comparable numbers of dopaminergic neurons were present in DJ-1 null mice and their wild-type controls (Fig. 5). DJ-I has been implicated in oxidative stress and protein folding and degradation. The pathological inclusions are commonly found in neurodegenerative diseases in susceptible population of remaining neurons and the presence of such inclusions could indicate dysfunctional cells. Intracytoplasmic Lewy body inclusion is characteristic of PD and the Lewy bodies contain α-synuclein and ubiquitin (37Lowe J. Blanchard A. Morrell K. Lennox G. Reynolds L. Billett M. Landon M.

https://openalex.org/W2036879415,"To study synapse formation by neuroligins, we co-cultured hippocampal neurons with COS cells expressing wild type and mutant neuroligins. The large size of COS cells makes it possible to test the effect of neuroligins presented over an extended surface area. We found that a uniform lawn of wild type neuroligins displayed on the cell surface triggers the formation of hundreds of uniformly sized, individual synaptic contacts that are labeled with neurexin antibodies. Electron microscopy revealed that these artificial synapses contain a presynaptic active zone with docked vesicles and often feature a postsynaptic density. Neuroligins 1, 2, and 3 were active in this assay. Mutations in two surface loops of neuroligin 1 abolished neuroligin binding to neurexin 1β, a presumptive presynaptic binding partner for postsynaptic neuroligins, and blocked synapse formation. An analysis of mutant neuroligins with an amino acid substitution that corresponds to a mutation described in patients with an autistic syndrome confirmed previous reports that these mutant neuroligins have a compromised capacity to be transported to the cell surface. Nevertheless, the small percentage of mutant neuroligins that reached the cell surface still induced synapse formation. Viewed together, our data suggest that neuroligins generally promote artificial synapse formation in a manner that is associated with β-neurexin binding and results in morphologically well differentiated synapses and that a neuroligin mutation found in autism spectrum disorders impairs cell-surface transport but does not completely abolish synapse formation activity.

At the synapse, transsynaptic cell-adhesion complexes presumably link presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments, but the nature and function of these complexes remain unclear (reviewed in Refs. 1Goda Y.

Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 933-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Three neurexin genes are expressed in mammals. Each gene produces two principal forms, the longer α- and the shorter β-neurexins (14Rowen L. Young J. Birditt B. Kaur A. Madan A. Philipps D.L. Qin S. Minx P. Wilson R.K. Hood L. Graveley B.R.

Structurally, all neurexins are composed of alternatively spliced extracellular domains, a single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail and thus resemble cell-surface receptors. α-Neurexins and β-neurexins differ only in their N-terminal extracellular sequences but share identical C-terminal domains, including the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail. Neurexin 1α, the primary α-latrotoxin receptor, is required for full stimulation of neurotransmitter release by α-latrotoxin, suggesting that neurexins are at least in part presynaptic (16Geppert M. Khvotchev M. Krasnoperov V. Goda Y. Missler M. Hammer R.E. Ichtchenko K. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Neuroligins are composed of a large extracellular N-terminal sequence that is homologous to the α/β-hydrolase fold domain of acetylcholinesterase (5Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), an O-linked sugar-rich domain, a single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Neuroligin binding to β-neurexins is regulated by alternative splicing of β-neurexins (5Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Südhof T.C.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26032-26039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In brain, neuroligin 1 is localized to postsynaptic densities (7Song J-Y. Ichtchenko K. Südhof T.C. Brose N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1100-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), indicating that postsynaptic neuroligins may form a transsynaptic complex with presynaptic β-neurexins. Neuroligin 1, when expressed in a non-neuronal HEK293 cell, can induce presynaptic differentiation in co-cultured pontine explants (9Scheiffele P. Fan J. Choih J. Fetter R. Serafini T. Cell. 2000; 101: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Similar to acetylcholinesterase, neuroligins constitutively dimerize via their extracellular domain (18Comoletti D. Flynn R. Jennings L.L. Chubykin A. Matsumura T. Hasegawa H. Südhof T.C. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50497-50505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Dimerization of postsynaptic neuroligins may be required for stable association with presynaptic β-neurexins and/or for activation of presynaptic signaling via β-neurexin binding. Mutations of the putative dimerization sequences of neuroligin 1 abolished its ability to form synapses, and the addition of agents that bind to β-neurexins (immobilized recombinant neuroligin 1 or antibodies to epitope-tagged transfected neurexins) promoted the clustering of synaptic vesicle antigens in cultured neurons (19Dean C. Scholl F.G. Choih J. DeMaria S. Berger J. Isacoff E. Scheiffele P. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Rodents have at least three neuroligin genes (6Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2676-2682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), but humans have five neuroligin genes (20Bolliger M.F. Frei K. Winterhalter K.H. Gloor S.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies uncovered a missense mutation in human neuroligin 3 (R451C) and two frameshift mutations in neuroligin 4 in patients with familial forms of autism, mental retardation, and/or Asperger syndrome (21Jamain S. Quach H. Betancur C. Rastam M. Colineaux C. Gillberg I.C. Soderstrom H. Giros B. Leboyer M. Gillberg C. Bourgeron and Paris Autism Research International Sibpair Study Nat.

The neuroligin 4 mutations probably act as null mutants, because the protein is truncated in the middle of the acetylcholinesterase domain. The R471C mutation in rat neuroligin 3 (which corresponds to the human R451C substitution) causes at least partial retention of neuroligin 3 in the endoplasmic reticulum (24Comoletti D. De Jaco A. Jennings L.L. Flynn R.E. Gaietta G. Tsigelny I. Ellisman M.H. Taylor P. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4889-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 25Chih B. Afridi S.K. Clark L. Scheiffele P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), which might be responsible for the autistic phenotype observed in human patients. Viewed together, these findings indicate that neuroligins are important for synapse formation in vitro and synaptic function in vivo but raise several questions. Does postsynaptic neuroligin 1 induce synapse formation in co-culture systems by binding to presynaptic β-neurexins? Do the resulting artificial junctions represent non-physiological cell-cell contacts, or do they structurally resemble synapses? Are other neuroligins active in this assay? What is the effect of the R451C mutation found in autistic patients on synapse formation? Because information on the biological basis and molecular target for autistic syndromes is limited, mechanistic insights into the molecular nature of neuroligin function may lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to the disorder. Unfortunately, these issues are difficult to address directly. Mutants of neuroligin that do not bind to β-neurexins are not currently known, and the relative properties of different neuroligins have not been investigated. As an initial approach to these questions, we have extended the in vitro synapse formation assay (9Scheiffele P. Fan J. Choih J. Fetter R. Serafini T. Cell. 2000; 101: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 29Biederer T. Sara Y. Mozhayeva M. Atasoy D. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. Südhof T.C. Science. 2002; 297: 1525-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) using transfected COS cells to allow a more quantitative morphological analysis. We employed this assay in conjunction with neuroligin mutants to analyze the relation between neuroligin binding to neurexin 1β and synapse formation. Our data reveal that artificial synapses are formed as hundreds of uniformly sized individual synaptic specializations on a single transfected COS cell expressing neuroligins. All of the rat neuroligins (neuroligins 1–3) were able to induce synapse formation. Mutant analysis showed that all of the substitutions in neuroligin 1 that abolish neurexin 1β binding also abolish synapse formation, consistent with the notion that the neuroligin 1/neurexin 1β complex is truly a transsynaptic cell-adhesion complex. As described before (24Comoletti D. De Jaco A. Jennings L.L. Flynn R.E. Gaietta G. Tsigelny I. Ellisman M.H. Taylor P. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4889-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 25Chih B. Afridi S.K. Clark L. Scheiffele P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), the autism mutation R471C in rat neuroligin 3 and the corresponding R473C mutation in rat neuroligin 1 inhibited transport of the affected neuroligins to the cell surface. Nevertheless, the small fraction of mutant neuroligin displayed on the cell surface appeared sufficient for synapse induction in the transfected cells, suggesting that the autism mutation does not completely abolish this activity of neuroligins. This is consistent with the observation that the small exported fraction of the truncated mutant neuroligin shows a normal disulfide-bonding pattern (24Comoletti D. De Jaco A. Jennings L.L. Flynn R.E. Gaietta G. Tsigelny I. Ellisman M.H. Taylor P. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4889-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Together our data indicate that the ability to induce synapse formation is a conserved property of all rodent neuroligins, that the synapses thus formed represent morphological units resembling normal synapses, and that the autism mutations act as loss-of-function mutants because transport to the surface is compromised but not because the expressed proteins are inactive in the induction of synapse formation.

Chimeric neuroligin 1/acetylcholinesterase mutants (NA) 1The abbreviations used are: NA, neuroligin 1/acetylcholinesterase mutant; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ERC, ELKS/Rab6-binding protein/CAST; NL, neuroligin; IgNrx1β-1, Ig-neurexin 1β. were generated by PCR with corresponding oligonucleotides to create junctions between rat neuroligin 1 and mouse acetylcholinesterase sequences. The following neuroligin constructs are schematically depicted in Fig. 4. For pCMV5-NA1, the loop Pro118-Gln149 in neuroligin 1 was replaced by Tyr101-Leu123 from acetylcholinesterase. For pCMV5-NA2, neuroligin 1 Asn343-Val348 was replaced by acetylcholinesterase Pro289-Thr298. For pCMV5-NA3, neuroligin 1 (NL1) Ile535-Cys546 was replaced by acetylcholinesterase Leu488-Leu494. For pCMV5-NA4, neuroligin 1 Gln574-Glu591 was replaced by acetylcholinesterase Asp522-Lys527. pCMV5-NA1/3 encodes the double mutant of -NA1 and -NA3. For pcDNA3-NA5, the N-terminal sequence of acetylcholinesterase was fused at Leu570 to the C-terminal part of neuroligin 1 starting at His634. For expression vectors that encode secreted proteins containing the neuroligin extracellular domains without transmembrane or intracellular sequences, the rat-NL1/AChE chimeras were subcloned into FLAG-tagged vector (Sigma) for detection and purification, resulting in FLAG-NL1/AChE (18Comoletti D.

FLAG-NL1/AChE proteins were truncated by introducing a stop codon at Ile639, generating the protein FLAG-NL1/AChE-638. Cell Culture and Neurexin Binding Experiments—HEK293 and COS cells were maintained at 37 °C and 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml) and periodically tested to ensure the absence of mycoplasma. Cells were transfected using Fu-GENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). To obtain cell clones expressing secreted neuroligin truncated at Ile639, HEK293 cells were transfected and selected as previously described (18Comoletti D. Flynn R. Jennings L.L. Chubykin A.

After calcium phosphate transfection, cells were selected by growth in 800 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Sigma) and 32 resistant clones for each chimera were transferred into two 24-well plates. After incubating the growing cells for a period of 5–8 days, the media were tested for the presence of soluble FLAG-NL1/AChE chimera. To purify IgG neurexin fusion proteins, the supernatant of COS cells transfected with the corresponding plasmids was harvested 3–4 days after transfection, adjusted to 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 0.1 g/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, cleared by centrifugation (2500 × g), and incubated overnight with protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). The Ig fusion proteins attached to Sepharose were washed three times with PBS before pull-down experiments for elution with 10 mm glycine buffer at pH 3.5. The eluate was immediately pH-equilibrated with 20 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8/ml eluate. Pull-down experiments were performed with neuroligins expressed in transfected COS cells that were harvested 3–5 days after transfection and solubilized in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 g/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm CaCl2 under stirring at 4 °C for 90 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to remove insoluble materials. The supernatant was incubated with neurexin IgG fusion proteins immobilized on protein A beads at 4 °C for 2–4 h. Proteins bound to the protein A beads containing the IgG fusion proteins were washed with PBS and eluted with sample buffer, and neuroligin binding to neurexin 1β was analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, Western blotting, and staining with antibodies to neuroligin 1 (4C12, L067). For cell surface labeling experiments, wild type and mutant neuroligins were transfected into HEK293 cells. Three days after transfection, soluble IgNrx1β-1 fusion protein was added to the media and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS without permeabilization and incubated with antibodies against the extracellular part of NL1 (4C12) in PBS with 1% goat serum and 2% bovine serum albumin. Bound IgNrx1β-1 fusion protein and neuroligin antibodies were detected by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated protein A and by Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies, respectively (Molecular Probes). Z-section images were collected using Leica TCS2 confocal microscope. Primary Neuronal Culture and Neuron/COS Cell Co-culture Experiments—Primary hippocampal neuronal cultures used for synapse formation assays were prepared from embryonic day 18 rats as previously described (27Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar). Dissociated neurons were plated onto poly l-lysine-treated glass coverslips at a density of 50–200 cells/mm2 and co-cultured over a monolayer of glia. Cultures were maintained in neurobasal medium supplemented with N2 (Invitrogen). Transfected COS cells were added to the neurons at 10–14 days in vitro. After 2–5 days of co-culture, cells were fixed in cold 100% methanol or 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS or 0.1% saponin/PBS, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies in PBS with 1% goat serum and 2% bovine serum albumin. To test the effect of adding soluble neurexin ligand for neuroligins on synapse formation, soluble IgNrx1β-1 fusion protein (final concentration = 10 μg/ml) was added to the neuronal media before the transfected COS cells were seeded onto the neurons. Two days later, the co-cultures were fixed and stained as described earlier. Soluble IgNrx1β-1 was visualized using protein A-488 conjugate, and neuroligin and synapsin antibodies were visualized subsequently using Alexa Fluor 546- and 633-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence imaging was performed using sequential acquisition of different channels on a Leica TCS2 confocal microscope. The following antibodies were used for immunocytochemistry of the co-cultures: anti-neuroligin 1 mouse monoclonal 4C12 (7Song J-Y. Ichtchenko K. Südhof T.C. Brose N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

Secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488-, 546-, or 633-labeled highly cross-adsorbed goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antisera) were from Molecular Probes. Electron Microscopy—For standard electron microscopy, cultured cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 20 min and postfixed in 1% OsO4, 0.8% potassium ferricyanide (K3FeCN6) for 15 min on ice followed by 15 s in a microwave oven (350 watts, BioWave, Ted Pella Inc., Redding. CA). For immunoelectron microscopy, cells were fixed in 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 1 h and then blocked in 2% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% saponin in PBS. The primary incubation was carried out for 1 h with the anti-green fluorescent protein antibody at a dilution of 1:1000. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to 1.4-nm gold particles (Nanoprobes, Yaphank, NY) for 1 h and then enhanced with silver using the HQ silver enhancement kit (Nanoprobes). The immunolabeled cells were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol to 100% (15 s each at 350 watts in the microwave oven) and embedded in Poly/Bed 812 epoxy resin (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA). Ultrathin sections (70 nm) are stained with 5% uranyl acetate solution and examined under a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope at a 80-kV accelerating voltage. Image Acquisition and Analysis—Images were recorded in a confocal microscope Leica TCS2 with the same confocal acquisition settings for all of the samples of an experiment. Collected Z-section images were converted to maximal projection images and analyzed blindly using Leica Confocal Software. Transfected COS cells in close proximity to neurons were selected based on neuroligin and synapsin labeling. The contours of the transfected COS cell were chosen as the region of interest. Fluorescence intensity was quantified for both green and red channels in the region of interest. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test.

Such high density cultures are particularly suited for functional analysis (e.g. see Refs. 29Biederer T. Sara Y. Mozhayeva M. Atasoy D. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. Südhof T.C.

However, in these cultures, glia often ensheath neuronal processes and prevent the processes from contacting transfected HEK293 cells and the densely packed neurons surrounding the transfected HEK293 cells may provide factors for synapse formation that contribute to the activity of the transfected non-neuronal cells. As a result, heterologous synapses are often formed sparsely on the non-neuronal cells and are difficult to analyze morphologically (9Scheiffele P. Fan J. Choih J. Fetter R. Serafini T. Cell. 2000; 101: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 29Biederer T. Sara Y. Mozhayeva M. Atasoy D. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. Südhof T.C. Science. 2002; 297: 1525-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). To remedy these problems, we tested whether synapse formation could be induced onto a transfected non-neuronal cell expressing neuroligin 1 when neurons are cultured at a low density. In these experiments, we increased the surface area of the target membrane by using larger COS cells instead of the smaller HEK293 cells, the standard cell employed for such experiments. We transfected COS cells with wild type neuroligin 1 and, as a negative control, a mutant neuroligin 1 that does not bind to neurexin 1β (see below). We co-cultured the transfected COS cells with hippocampal neurons at low density and examined synapse formation by indirect immunofluorescence. We stained the co-cultures with a series of antibodies to presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins to identify synapses and with antibodies to neuroligin 1 applied at a low dilution to visualize COS cells that express neuroligin 1 (Fig. 1 and data not shown). In the transfected COS cells, neuroligin 1 was uniformly expressed over the entire COS cell surface as visualized by indirect immunofluorescence labeling. The presence of neuroligin 1 stimulated the elaboration of hundreds of presynaptic specializations by the co-cultured neurons. Despite the uniform expression of neuroligin 1 on the COS cell surface, the induced synapses formed separate individual units that were densely spaced and covered entire cells (e.g. see Fig. 1A) or clustered in a particular region (e.g. see Fig. 1B). The artificially induced nerve terminals on the COS cells were stained with multiple presynaptic markers, including all of the vesicle proteins tested (data not shown; also see examples provided below). In particular, the terminals contained high concentrations of neurexins (Fig. 1A), demonstrating that neurexins are enriched in presynaptic terminals. Active zone proteins such as ERCs (Fig. 1B) were also present, whereas we observed no significant labeling of postsynaptic markers such as PSD-95 (Fig. 1C). To characterize further the heterologous synapses induced by neuroligin 1, we examined them by confocal microscopy at higher resolution (Fig. 2). Synapses form on the surface of the COS cells as hundreds of densely packed presynaptic specializations with a uniform size (∼0.75 μm2). In most cases, the synapses on a transfected COS cell are derived from 2–4 adjacent neurons but occasionally the hundreds of synapses on a COS cell are generated from a single adjacent neuron. The density of synapses between neurons and the neuroligin-expressing COS cells is much higher than that observed between neurons, suggesting that the overexpressed"

In the liver, synthesized TG is either stored in cytoplasmic droplets or secreted as very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) is a membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the last step in the synthesis of TG. Classified by detergent sensitivity, two types of DGATs in microsomes have been proposed: the overt type (on the cytosol) catalyzes the synthesis of TG destined for cytoplasmic droplets, and latent type (on the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum) catalyzes the synthesis of TG for VLDL formation (1Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).

J. 1996; 320: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the relative activities of these two functions of DGAT may have a significant impact on the level of triglyceridemia as well as on the development of steatosis. Regarding the molecular aspects of DGAT, the cDNAs of DGATs, viz. DGAT1 and DGAT2, have been recently cloned and sequenced (3Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S.

It is evident that DGAT1 and DGAT2 have distinct roles in the whole body, but the roles of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in tissues such as liver, adipose, and small intestine that synthesize TG have not been well studied. In this work, to elucidate the roles of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in the liver, especially in overt and latent DGAT activities, we created liver DGAT1- and DGAT2-overexpressing mice by adenovirus-mediated gene transfection, and we investigated their phenotypes. Preparation of Recombinant Adenoviruses—The full-length mouse Dgat1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_010046) and Dgat2 (GenBank™ accession number AF384160) coding sequences were amplified by PCR. The primers used for amplifying DGAT1 and DGAT2 cDNAs were tailed with either an XbaI site (forward) or a KpnI site (reverse). PCR products were subcloned into the XbaI/KpnI site of the pShuttle vector provided in the BD Adeno-X expression system (BD Biosciences). All sequences of DGATs were verified by DNA sequencing. An I-CeuI/PI-SceI restriction fragment from pShuttle containing the cytomegalovirus-IE promoter/enhancer 5′ to the DGAT cDNAs insert and the polyadenylation signal was ligated into an adenoviral DNA backbone that was also restricted with I-CeuI and PI-SecI. Following amplification and purification of recombinant viral DNA from bacteria, recombinant viral DNA was further amplified by transfecting PacI-linearized recombinant viral DNA into human embryonic kidney 293 cells via the use of Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). The adenoviruses containing DGAT1 cDNA (Ad-DGAT1) and DGAT2 cDNA (Ad-DGAT2) were purified for injection into mice using the BD Adeno-X purification kit (BD Biosciences). BD Adeno-X enhanced green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP; BD Biosciences) was used as a control. Each recombinant adenovirus (Ad-DGAT1, Ad-DGAT2, or Ad-GFP) was injected intravenously in a single dose (2 × 109 plaque-forming units in 200 μl) into a non-fasted mouse. The C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks of age) used in this experiment were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The animals were fed standard rodent chow (CE2, CLEA, Tokyo). Animals were exposed to 12-h light/12-h dark cycles and maintained at a constant temperature of 22 °C. Northern Blotting—The cDNA clones containing the coding sequences of mouse DGAT1 and DGAT2 were obtained by PCR as described above. cDNAs encoding the rat VLDL receptor (VLDLR) and mouse perilipin were kindly provided by Dr. T. Yamamoto (Tohoku University Gene Research Center) and Dr. C. Londos (National Institutes of Health), respectively. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A portion of the RNA (20 μg/lane) was denatured with glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide and analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. After transfer to nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and UV cross-linking, RNA blots were stained with methylene blue to locate 28 S and 18 S rRNAs (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

The stained 18 S rRNA is shown in Figs. 1 and 7 to indicate that the amount of loaded RNAs was similar in each group. cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) using a random primer labeling kit (Rediprime II DNA labeling system, Amersham Biosciences). The amounts of mRNAs were quantitated with a BAS-2000 imaging analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo).Fig. 7Increased VLDLR expression in epididymal WAT. A and B, total RNA was isolated from abdominal subcutaneous WAT and epididymal WAT, and 20 μg of RNA was subjected to electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with the 32P-labeled VLDLR and perilipin cDNA probes. Perilipin mRNA was measured on the same membrane sheet as a control. Each lane represents a sample from an individual mouse. The molecular sizes of VLDLR and perilipin mRNAs are 3.4 and 2.7 kb, respectively (A). Quantification of each mRNA is expressed relative to subcutaneous WAT (B). Data represent means ± S.E. (n = 3). **, p < 0.01 (significantly different); ***, p < 0.001 (significantly different). C, VLDLR proteins in pooled membrane fractions of isolated adipocytes from either abdominal subcutaneous WAT or epididymal WAT from three mice were measured by immunoblotting. The molecular size of the VLDLR protein is 135 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Liver Homogenization and Permeabilization of Microsomes for DGAT Assay—To examine the effects of homogenization methods on the recovery and intactness of microsomes, liver tissues (0.2 g) were homogenized in three different types of tissue grinders: Dounce-type (Kimble/Kontes, Vineland, NJ), type B pestle, 30 strokes; motor-driven Potter-type (Iuchi, Osaka, Japan), 200, 400, 600, 1000, 2000, and 4000 rpm for 3 × 10 s; and Polytron (PT10/35, Kinematica AG, Lucerne, Switzerland), setting 4 for 3 × 10 s. All homogenization steps were carried out in 2 ml of ice-cold medium containing 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C to obtain the microsomes. The microsomes were resuspended to a final volume of 1 ml and separated into aliquots, which were snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C. The recovery of microsomes was compared by measuring the total mannose-6-phosphatase activity in microsomal fractions. The intactness of microsomes was estimated by measuring the mannose-6-phosphatase activities in microsomal fractions in the presence and absence of permeabilizing agents. Potter-type homogenization at 200 or 400 rpm for 3 × 10 s, a relatively mild method, resulted in a poor recovery of total microsomes (32–48% relative to those obtained by Polytron homogenizer) but a good recovery of intact microsomes (81–84%), whereas Polytron homogenization, a powerful method, resulted in a relatively good recovery of total microsomes but a poor recovery of intact microsomes (54%). Because the intactness of microsomes was more important than the recovery of microsomes in measuring overt and latent DGAT activities of microsomes, we chose Potter-type homogenization at 400 rpm for 3 × 10 s in the following experiment. To examine the effects of permeabilizing agents on DGAT activity, a portion of the microsomes (2 mg/ml protein) was permeabilized by preincubation on ice for 30 min with either the channel-forming peptide alamethicin (final concentration of 0.06 mg/ml in 0.38% ethanol; Sigma) or deoxycholate (final concentration of 2 mg/ml; Sigma) (1Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 12Nordlie R.C. Arion W.J.

Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1835-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The permeabilizing efficiency estimated by mannose-6-phosphatase activity was not different between these two agents, but DGAT activity in the presence of deoxycholate was 76% lower than in the presence of alamethicin (data not shown). It was shown previously that taurocholate inhibits DGAT activity by 30%, but alamethicin does not (1Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, in the study, we used alamethicin as a permeabilizing agent of microsomes. Assay of DGAT Activity—DGAT activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of the [14C]oleoyl moiety into trioleoylglycerol with [14C]oleoyl-CoA (acyl donor) and sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol (acyl acceptor) as described previously (14Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Cao J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25657-25663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The acyl acceptors were introduced into the reaction mixture by liposomes prepared with phosphatidylcholine (molar ratio of acyl acceptor to phosphatidylcholine of 1:5). The reaction mixture (200 μl) contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Serologicals Corp., Kankakee, IL), 200 mm sucrose, 25 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 200 μm acyl acceptors, and 10 μg of either permeabilized or non-permeabilized liver microsomal protein. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, lipids were extracted with 2:1(v/v) chloroform/methanol. After centrifugation to remove debris, aliquots of the organic phase-containing lipids were dried and separated on Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with 80:20:1 (v/v/v) hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid. Individual lipid moieties were identified by standards with exposure to I2 vapor. The TLC plates were exposed to an Fujifilm imaging plate to assess the formation of 14C-labeled lipid products. Imaging signals were visualized and quantitated with a BAS-2000 imaging analyzer. To estimate overt and latent DGAT activities, mannose-6-phosphatase activity, a marker of latent enzyme in microsomes, was used for correction of membrane damage and inside-out sealing of microsome in overt DGAT activity (1Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, the following equations were used to calculate overt and latent DGAT activities: overt DGAT = D0 - ((Dt - D0)M0/Mt), and latent DGAT = (Dt - D0)Mt/(Mt - M0), where D0 and Dt represent DGAT activity before and after treatment with alamethicin, respectively, and M0 and Mt represent mannose-6-phosphatase activity before and after treatment with alamethicin, respectively (1Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Waterman I.J. Zammit V.A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1708-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Diced mouse liver samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) for 24 h. After washing with phosphate buffer, glutaraldehyde-fixed blocks were placed in 2% osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer for 2 h at 4 °C, dehydrated, infiltrated with Epon 812, and polymerized for 3 days. Sections were cut out with Ultratome III (LKB Bromma, Stockholm, Sweden) and stained with saturated uranyl acetate and lead acetate. Thin sections were examined with a Hitachi H-300 electron microscope. Serum Lipoprotein Analysis—Serum obtained from the retro-orbital plexus of an individual mouse was subjected to gel filtration HPLC on two tandemly connected TSK-Gel Lipopropak XL columns (300 × 7.8 mm; Tosoh Corp., Tokyo) as described (17Usui S. Hara Y. Hosaki S. Okazaki M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TG and cholesterol were measured simultaneously using an on-line dual detection system. The particle size of lipoproteins was estimated by the elution time of the column and appropriate size markers. Liver and Microsomal Lipid Analysis—Lipids in the liver were extracted quantitatively with ice-cold 2:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol by the method of Folch et al. (18Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total cholesterol and TG concentrations in the liver homogenates and microsomal fractions were measured by enzymatic colorimetric methods using the cholesterol and TG E tests (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka), respectively. Measurement of in Vivo VLDL Secretion Rates—Hepatic production of VLDL TG was measured in Ad-GFP-, Ad-DGAT1-, and Ad-DGAT2-injected mice. On day 12 after adenovirus injection, Triton WR-1339 (Sigma) was intravenously administered after a 4-h fast (19Siri P. Candela N. Zhang Y.L. Ko C. Eusufzai S. Ginsberg H.N. Huang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46064-46072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mice were bled prior to injection and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h post-injection. Increases in serum TG concentrations over 4 h in Ad-GFP-, Ad-DGAT1-, and Ad-DGAT2-injected mice after intravenous injection of Triton WR-1339 were measured by enzymatic colorimetric methods using the TG E test. Immunoblotting—Pooled membrane fractions of either isolated epididymal or subcutaneous adipocytes from three mice of each group were prepared by collagenase digestion and differential centrifugation as described by Kono et al. (20Kono T. Robinson F.W. Blevins T.L. Ezaki O. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10942-10947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ten μg of membrane protein obtained by centrifugation at 175,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C was applied to 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Clear Blot Membrane-P (Atto Corp., Tokyo). Immunoblot analysis was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system kit (Amersham Biosciences). Membrane sheets were first incubated with antibody against the VLDLR (sc-18824, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at 22 °C, washed three times, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The amount of VLDLR was quantitated using NIH Image Version 1.6.3. Statistical Methods—Statistical comparisons of groups were made by one-way analysis of variance, and the VLDL secretion curve in Fig. 4 was compared by repeated measure analysis (StatView Version 5.0, Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). When statistically significant, each group was compared with the others by Fisher's protected least significant difference test. Overexpression of DGAT1 or DGAT2 in Mouse Liver—To gain insight into the physiological roles of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in the liver, either DGAT1 or DGAT2 was overexpressed in the liver by adenovirus-mediated gene transfection. We injected 2 × 109 plaque-forming units of recombinant virus containing DGAT1 cDNA, DGAT2 cDNA, or GFP cDNA (control) into mice. This dose has been found to cause expression of the foreign gene in the majority of hepatocytes (21Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). On day 12 after administration of the recombinant viruses, the expression levels of DGAT1 and DGAT2 were measured by Northern blotting. Because the molecular sizes of DGAT1 mRNAs derived from the endogenous Dgat1 gene and the Ad-DGAT1 construct were almost the same, they could not be distinguished by Northern blotting, whereas because the molecular size of DGAT2 mRNA derived from the Ad-DGAT2 construct was smaller than that of DGAT2 mRNA derived from the endogenous Dgat2 gene, they could be distinguished (Fig. 1). The DGAT1 mRNA levels in Ad-DGAT1-injected mice were increased by 19-fold in the liver and by 1.7-fold in the gastrocnemius compared with endogenous DGAT1 mRNA levels in control Ad-GFP-injected mice, but no changes were seen in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal WAT. DGAT2 expression in Ad-DGAT1-injected mice was not affected in all of these tissues. The DGAT2 mRNA levels in Ad-DGAT2-injected mice were increased by 4-fold in the liver compared with endogenous DGAT2 mRNA levels in control Ad-GFP-injected mice, but were not altered in BAT, WAT, and the gastrocnemius. The DGAT1 expression levels in Ad-DGAT2-injected mice were not affected in any of these tissues. Because DGAT1 expression in the gastrocnemius was increased slightly in both Ad-DGAT1-injected (significantly) and Ad-DGAT2-injected (insignificantly) mice, an increase in gastrocnemius DGAT1 expression might be due to metabolic changes in the whole body, secondary to liver DGAT overexpression. Because, as estimated by Northern blotting, the expression level of DGAT1 in normal liver was very low compared with that of DGAT2, when expressed as the -fold increase relative to endogenous DGAT1 mRNA levels, the increased DGAT1 mRNA levels in Ad-DGAT1-injected mice were much higher than the increased DGAT2 mRNA levels in Ad-DGAT2-injected mice. Plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were not elevated after gene transfection, and liver damage did not occur (data not shown). DGAT1 Possesses Latent DGAT Activity—To examine whether overexpressed liver DGAT1 and DGAT2 are functional, the overt and latent DGAT activities in liver microsomes from Ad-GFP-, Ad-DGAT1-, and Ad-DGAT2-injected mice were estimated (Fig. 2). DGAT activity was assessed by the formation of 14C-labeled TG from [14C]oleoyl-CoA (Fig. 2A). Overt DGAT activity in microsomes is defined as enzyme activity on the cytosol involved in the synthesis of cytosolic droplet TG, whereas latent DGAT activity is defined as enzyme activity on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen involved in VLDL synthesis (1Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Overt and latent DGAT activities were estimated by measuring DGAT and mannose-6-phosphatase activities in the absence and presence of alamethicin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” DGAT activity in the absence of alamethicin was significantly increased in both DGAT1- and DGAT2-overexpressing mice compared with control Ad-GFP-injected mice, whereas DGAT activity in the presence of alamethicin (total DGAT activity in microsomes) was markedly increased by 3.2-fold in DGAT1-overexpressing mice, but did not differ in DGAT2-overexpressing mice (Fig. 2B). When latent and overt DGAT activities were estimated by measuring the mannose-6-phosphatase activity (22Arion W.J. Ballas L.M. Lange A.J. Wallin B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4891-4897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), latent DGAT activity was increased by 4.2-fold in DGAT1-overexpressing mice, and overt DGAT activity was increased by 2.5-fold in DGAT2-overexpressing mice (Fig. 2C). Because DGAT protein concentrations in microsomal fractions were not measured because of the lack of appropriate antibodies to DGAT1 and DGAT2, comparison of DGAT activity on a protein basis was not made between DGAT1- and DGAT2-overexpressing mice. However, if we assume that alamethicin did not affect the DGAT1 and DGAT2 molecules, this indicates that the latent/overt DGAT activity was much larger in DGAT1-overexpressing mice than in DGAT2-overexpressing mice; the latent/overt DGAT activity in Ad-GFP-, Ad-DGAT1-, and Ad-DGAT2-injected mice was 2.4, 14.1, and 0.35, respectively. Thus, these data indicate that DGAT1 but not DGAT2 possesses marked latent DGAT activity, whereas DGAT2 might possess overt DGAT activity. DGAT1-overexpressing Mice Have Increased Serum VLDL Concentrations and Particle Size—Because latent DGAT activity was increased in DGAT1-overexpressing mice, we expected that blood VLDL concentrations might be increased in DGAT1-overexpressing mice. Thus, we measured serum lipoprotein profiles in DGAT1- and DGAT2-overexpressing mice by HPLC (Fig. 3). As expected, compared with the control Ad-GFP-injected mice, VLDL TG concentrations were increased by 1.6-fold in DGAT1-overexpressing mice, but were not changed in DGAT2-overexpressing mice (Fig. 3A and Table I). High density lipoprotein (HDL) TG concentrations were very low in each group of mice. VLDL cholesterol concentrations were also increased in DGAT1-overexpressing mice (Fig. 3B and Table I). However, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and HDL cholesterol concentrations did not differ among the different groups of mice. The particle size of lipoproteins was estimated by the elution time of TSK-Gel Lipopropak XL columns. VLDL particle size was significantly enlarged in DGAT1-overexpressing mice (Fig. 3C), but there were no changes in HDL particle size among the different groups of mice (data not shown).Table ISerum lipoprotein profiles in Ad-GFP-, Ad-DGAT1-, and Ad-DGAT2-injected mice Serum lipoproteins in male mice were assayed on day 12 after adenovirus injection as described in the legend to Fig. 3.

To determine the cause, the rate of hepatic VLDL secretion was estimated by monitoring serum TG concentrations in the presence of Triton WR-1339 (Fig. 4), which blocks lipolysis of VLDL in peripheral tissues. The TG concentration significantly increased in DGAT1-overexpressing mice compared with control mice following Triton WR-1339 administration (by repeated analysis of variance, p < 0.01). An increase in the TG concentration in DGAT2-overexpressing mice was not observed. Thus, the increase in the blood TG concentration in DGAT1-overexpressing mice was due, at least in part, to increased VLDL secretion.

Although mechanisms for bile ductular proliferation are unknown, recent evidence suggests that extracellular nucleotides regulate cell proliferation via activation of P2Y receptors. Portal fibroblasts may regulate bile duct epithelial P2Y receptors via expression of the ecto-nucleotidase NTPDase2. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that portal fibroblasts regulate bile duct epithelial proliferation via expression of NTPDase2. We generated a novel co-culture model of Mz-ChA-1 human cholangiocarcinoma cells and primary portal fibroblasts. Cell proliferation was measured by bromodeoxyuridine uptake. NTPDase2 expression was assessed by immunofluorescence and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. NTPDase2 expression in portal fibroblasts was blocked using short interfering RNA. NTPDase2 overexpression in portal myofibroblasts isolated from bile duct-ligated rats was achieved by cDNA transfection. Co-culture of Mz-ChA-1 cells with portal fibroblasts decreased their proliferation to 26% of control. Similar decreases in Mz-ChA-1 proliferation were induced by the soluble ecto-nucleotidase apyrase and the P2 receptor inhibitor suramin. The proliferation of Mz-ChA-1 cells returned to baseline when NTPDase2 expression in portal fibroblasts was inhibited using NTPDase2-specific short interfering RNA. Untransfected portal myofibroblasts lacking NTPDase2 had no effect on Mz-ChA-1 proliferation, yet portal myofibroblasts transfected with NTPDase2 cDNA inhibited Mz-ChA-1 proliferation. We conclude that portal fibroblasts inhibit bile ductular proliferation via expression of NTPDase2 and blockade of P2Y activation. Loss of NTPDase2 may mediate the bile ductular proliferation typical of obstructive cholestasis.

Bile duct epithelia (BDE), 1The abbreviations used are: BDE, bile duct epithelia; BDL, bile duct ligation; PF, portal fibroblast; PMF, portal myofibroblast; siRNA, short interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription. 1The abbreviations used are: BDE, bile duct epithelia; BDL, bile duct ligation; PF, portal fibroblast; PMF, portal myofibroblast; siRNA, short interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription. also known as biliary epithelia or cholangiocytes, are the targets of a number of chronic liver diseases. These cholangiopathies include such diverse conditions as primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, cystic fibrosis hepatopathy, AIDS cholangiopathy, biliary atresia, and many others (1Fitz J.G. Semin. Liver Dis. 2002; 22: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 2Alpini G. McGill J.M. Larusso N.F. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1256-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Together these conditions comprise a significant health burden, with a disproportionate effect on the health of children. Although the causes and presentations of cholangiopathies are diverse, they are all characterized by disordered proliferation of BDE (3Strazzabosco M. Spirli C. Okolicsanyi L. J. Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2000; 15: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Factors regulating proliferation of BDE are not well understood. Although it has long been known that extrahepatic biliary obstruction (either via neoplasms in patients or bile duct ligation (BDL) in experimental animals) induces massive bile ductular proliferation, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown (4LeSage G. Glaser S. Alpini G. Liver. 2001; 21: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recent experimental work has suggested that the hydrophilic bile acid tauroursodeoxycholic acid and the peptide hormone gastrin attenuate BDE proliferation (5Alpini G. Baiocchi L. Glaser S. Ueno Y. Marzioni M. Francis H. Phinizy J.L. Angelico M. Lesage G. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Glaser S. Benedetti A. Marucci L. Alvaro D. Baiocchi L. Kanno N. Caligiuri A. Phinizy J.L. Chowdury U. Papa E. LeSage G. Alpini G. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, neither of these mechanisms has been shown to mediate bile ductular proliferation after neoplastic biliary obstruction or BDL. Moreover, the mechanisms by which these occur are just beginning to be elucidated. Recently, we reported that signaling in BDE may be regulated by a novel liver cell type, the portal fibroblast (PF), via expression of the ecto-nucleotidase NTPDase2 (also known as ecto-ATPase or CD39L1) (7Dranoff J.A. Kruglov E.A. Robson S.C. Braun N. Zimmermann H. Sevigny J. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 1135-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have directed us to examine the role of NTPDase2 in the regulation of bile ductular proliferation. First, BDE express basolateral P2Y receptors for extracellular nucleotides that are tonically regulated by nucleotide hydrolysis that is likely mediated by NTPDase2 (8Dranoff J.A. Masyuk A.I. Kruglov E.A. LaRusso N.F. Nathanson M.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1059-G1067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the role of these basolateral BDE P2Y receptors is unknown. Third, strong evidence has been provided over the past several years demonstrating that activation of P2Y receptors has marked effects on cell proliferation (9Burnstock G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Finally, BDL induces marked down-regulation of NTPDase2 expression by PF (10Dranoff J.A. Kruglov E. Toure J. Braun N. Zimmermann H. Jain D. Knowles A.F. Sevigny J. J. Investig. Med. 2004; 52: 475-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the hypothesis that the physiologic role of basolateral P2Y receptors is to regulate BDE proliferation, and PF regulate this process via NTPDase2 expression. We further tested whether this hypothesis explains bile ductular proliferation induced by BDL. Chemical Reagents—Apyrase, suramin, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody were purchased from Sigma. Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 568 secondary antibodies and TOPRO-3 nuclear stain were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were of the highest quality available. Experimental Animals—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–250 g) were used for all experiments. For production of portal myofibroblasts (PMF), rats underwent BDL for 1 week (10Dranoff J.A. Kruglov E. Toure J. Braun N. Zimmermann H. Jain D. Knowles A.F. Sevigny J. J. Investig. Med. 2004; 52: 475-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). The abdomen was washed with isopropyl alcohol, and midline laparotomy was performed. The common bile duct was exposed using blunt dissection and ligated with dual sutures. Treatment of animals was within the prescribed guidelines of the Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Isolation of Portal Fibroblasts and Portal Myofibroblasts—PF were isolated as described previously (11Kruglov E.A. Jain D. Dranoff J.A. J. Investig Med. 2002; 50: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat nonparenchymal cell fractions were obtained by collagenase and pronase digestion of rat livers. Cell suspensions were separated using serial mesh filtration. The resulting suspension of nonparenchymal cells was plated in medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 2% penicillin-streptomycin, 10% fetal calf serum, 0.3% gentamycin, and 0.1% fungizone. Cells were used 96 h after isolation, at which time cell purity approaches 100%. PMF (12Libbrecht L. Cassiman D. Desmet V. Roskams T.

Liver. 2002; 22: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were isolated from rats that had undergone BDL as described above using identical conditions (10Dranoff J.A. Kruglov E. Toure J. Braun N. Zimmermann H. Jain D. Knowles A.F. Sevigny J. J. Investig. Med. 2004; 52: 475-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells from each batch were demonstrated to be myofibroblasts by staining for α-smooth muscle actin (not shown). Culture of Mz-ChA-1 Cells—Mz-ChA-1 human cholangiocarcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium with identical additives to the culture medium for PF, so that observed changes would not be because of differences in cell culture conditions. Cells were used at ∼75% confluence at 2–4 days after splitting. Isolation of Rat Bile Duct Epithelia Cells—Rat BDE were prepared and characterized in the Cell Isolation Core Facilities of the Yale Liver Center as described previously (8Dranoff J.A. Masyuk A.I. Kruglov E.A. LaRusso N.F. Nathanson M.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1059-G1067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This preparation results in a bile duct epithelial preparation that is ∼98% pure as assessed by staining positively for the biliary epithelial markers γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, cytokeratin-19, and cytokeratin-7 (14Ishii M. Vroman B. LaRusso N.F. Gastroenterology. 1989; 97: 1236-1247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-culture of Mz-ChA-1 or BDE and PF—PF were split and plated onto individual wells of 6-well cell culture plates. After 2 days, PF were quantitated, and cells were added at an approximate 2:1 ratio to PF (based on pilot experiments demonstrating optimal cell contiguity to PF; not shown). After co-culture, cells were maintained in the same medium described in the section titled “Isolation of Portal Fibroblasts and Portal Myofibroblasts.” Measurement of BrdUrd Incorporation—Cell proliferation was measured by BrdUrd enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Proliferation ELISA, BrdUrd Colorimetric; Roche Diagnostics GmbH). For experiments in Mz-ChA-1 cells alone, cells were plated in 6-well culture plates and treated for 24 h with BrdUrd labeling solution with either saline (control), suramin (50 μm) (15Eichhorst S.T. Krueger A. Muerkoster S. Fas S.C. Golks A. Gruetzner U. Schubert L. Opelz C. Bilzer M. Gerbes A.L. Krammer P.H. Nat.

Colorimetric substrate was added, and BrdUrd incorporation was quantitated using a multiplate reader. For experiments in Mz-ChA-1 cells in co-culture, cell proliferation was measured in Mz-ChA-1 cells only by loading the cells with BrdUrd prior to co-culture. Mz-ChA-1 cells were exposed to BrdUrd labeling solution for 24 h. Subsequently, PF or PMF were suspended by addition of trypsin and were plated with BrdUrd-labeled Mz-ChA-1 cells. Medium alone was added to control cells. After 24 h, determination of BrdUrd incorporation was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described in the preceding paragraph. Treatment of PF with siRNA—NTPDase2 protein expression in PF was down-regulated using siRNA. NTPDase2-specific siRNA was designed based on the published sequence of rat NTPDase2 (GenBank™ accession number NM-172030) (18Dranoff J.A. Ogawa M. Kruglov E.A. Gaca M.D. Sevigny J. Robson S.C. Wells R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: G417-G424Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The siRNA, 5′-r(AGUUGGUGUCACUGGUGCC)d(TT)-3′ and a control siRNA known not to correspond to any published cDNA sequences (“nonsense siRNA”) were labeled with fluorescein on the 3′-end (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as a marker of successful transfection. The siRNAs were provided as annealed double-stranded siRNA. PF were transfected with siRNAs using TransMessenger transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each well of a 6-well plate was loaded with 1.6 μg of siRNA, and cells were examined after 48 and 96 h. Transfection of PMF with NTPDase2—Up-regulation of NTPDase2 expression in PMF was accomplished via transfection with murine NTPDase2. Mouse NTPDase2 was cloned as follows. Total RNA was isolated from mouse heart with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The complementary DNA was synthesized with SuperScript II (Invitrogen) from 500 ng of total RNA with oligo(dT)18 as the primer, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For amplification, 10% of the reverse transcription (RT) reaction was used as template in a final volume of 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 0.6 μm primer, 400 μm dNTP, and 3.5 units of Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). The following sets of primers were designed based on the 5′- and 3′-ends of mouse NTPDase2 published sequences (AK002553 and NM_009849): set 1, forward 5′-GGG-GTC-CCT-GCT-GTG-TTC-3′ and reverse 5′-CCG-AGG-GCA-TCT-CTG-ACC-3′; set 2, forward 5′-TCC-CTG-CTG-TGT-TCT-CCC-G-3′ and reverse 5′-TGA-AGC-AGC-CTG-GAC-GGT-C-3′. Amplification was initiated by an incubation of 2 min at 94 °C, which was followed by 30 cycles of 1 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at 60 °C, and 2 min of primer extension at 72 °C, ending with 7 min of incubation at 72 °C. The PCR product of ∼1.8 kb was purified on agarose gel using the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) and ligated into the expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was purified with QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen), and orientation of the insert was verified by restriction mapping. One clone obtained with each set of primers was amplified and fully sequenced in one direction. Both sequences were identical. The corresponding and combined sequence is provided in GenBank™ accession number AY37674. The clone obtained with the first set of primers was verified using ecto-ATPase activity assays. PMF were grown to 75–90% confluence and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confocal Immunofluorescence—Cells were examined by confocal immunofluorescence to detect NTDPase2 expression. Cells were plated on coverslips and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were washed and stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-NTPDase2 and AlexaFluor 568 (Molecular Probes) as described previously (7Dranoff J.A. Kruglov E.A. Robson S.C. Braun N. Zimmermann H. Sevigny J. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 1135-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Nuclei were counterstained with the fluorophore TOPRO-3 (Molecular Probes). Sections were examined using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal imaging system using krypton and helium/neon lasers at ×400 magnification. Real-time RT-PCR—Alterations in expression of NTPDase2 mRNA in PF were determined using real-time RT-PCR (18Dranoff J.A. Ogawa M. Kruglov E.A. Gaca M.D. Sevigny J. Robson S.C. Wells R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: G417-G424Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PF were isolated from rats as described above and treated with either vehicle alone (control), nonsense siRNA, or NTPDase-2-specific siRNA for 96 h. Total RNA was isolated using chaotropic methods and subjected to real-time PCR using the-ABI-PRISM 7700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Detection of NTPDase2 was accomplished by labeling with 6-FAM. PCR was performed using the following cycling parameters: reverse transcription at 48 °C × 30 min; activation of AmpliTaq polymerase (Applied Biosystems) at 95 °C × 10 min; PCR cycling 40 cycles of 95 °C × 15 s (denaturation), and 60 °C × 1 min (annealing/extension). Experiments were performed in triplicate. Statistical Analysis—Changes in proliferation were determined by two-tailed Student's t test. Data are represented as mean ± S.D. Co-culture of Mz-ChA-1 Cells with PF Markedly Attenuates Their Proliferation—To determine the effect of PF on bile ductular proliferation, we developed a novel model of co-culture of Mz-ChA-1 cholangiocarcinoma cells and primary PF. Successful co-culture of Mz-ChA-1 cells and PF was determined using confocal immunofluorescence. As seen in Fig. 1, MCL-1-expressing Mz-ChA-1 cells and vimentin-expressing PF closely abutted one another. Mz-ChA-1 proliferation was assessed by BrdUrd uptake. Mz-ChA-1 cells were loaded with BrdUrd prior to co-culture, so that all changes in BrdUrd uptake reflected changes in Mz-ChA-1 proliferation. Relative to control Mz-ChA-1 cells, Mz-ChA-1 in co-culture with PF had a marked decrease in proliferation to 26 ± 12% of control (p <0.002) as seen in Fig. 2A. This finding demonstrates that co-culture of Mz-ChA-1 cells with PF markedly attenuates proliferation of these cells. To confirm that Mz-ChA-1 cells are appropriate models for these experiments, we repeated these experiments on primary immuno-isolated rat BDE (14Ishii M. Vroman B. LaRusso N.F. Gastroenterology. 1989; 97: 1236-1247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-culture of BDE with PF decreased proliferation to 34 ± 4% of control, suggesting that Mz-ChA-1 cells are appropriate cell models for these studies (Fig. 2B). P2Y Receptor Blockade Attenuates Mz-ChA-1 Proliferation—To test the hypothesis that the effect of PF on Mz-ChA-1 proliferation might be mediated via blockade of P2Y receptors, we examined the effect of the soluble ecto-nucleotidase apyrase and the P2 receptor inhibitor suramin on BrdUrd uptake in Mz-ChA-1 cells. Compared with control, both apyrase (65 ± 20%) and suramin (49 ± 16%) attenuated Mz-ChA-1 proliferation (p <0.01), though not to the extent of co-culture with PF (Fig. 3). These data suggest that P2 receptor activation regulates Mz-ChA-1 proliferation and that this is mediated by endogenous nucleotide release. NTPDase2 Mediates PF-regulated Attenuation of Mz-ChA-1 Proliferation—To test directly whether the attenuation of Mz-ChA-1 cell proliferation induced by PF was mediated by NTPDase2, we “knocked out” expression of NTPDase2 in PF using siRNA. As seen in Fig. 4, transfection of PF with NTPDase2 siRNA (but not nonsense siRNA) markedly decreased the expression of NTPDase2 in these cells, demonstrating the effectiveness of siRNA in specifically down-regulating NTPDase2 mRNA and protein expression using this system. The effect of PF expressing or lacking NTPDase2 expression on Mz-ChA-1 proliferation was assessed by BrdUrd uptake (Fig. 5). Consistent with the findings in Fig. 2, untransfected PF (54 ± 10%) and PF transfected with nonsense siRNA (48 ± 20%) decreased Mz-ChA-1 proliferation (p <0.03). Importantly, when NTPDase2 expression was decreased in PF using NTPDase2-specific siRNA, the ability of Mz-ChA1 cells to proliferate recovered (88 ± 12%; p was not significant). This finding demonstrates directly that the attenuation of Mz-ChA-1 proliferation induced by PF is mediated by NTPDase2. Mz-ChA-1 Proliferation Is Not Attenuated by PMF Lacking NTPDase2 Expression because of BDL—To test the hypothesis that the bile ductular proliferation characteristic of BDL is mediated by loss of NTPDase2 expression, we determined Mz-ChA-1 proliferation in the presence of PMF lacking and expressing NTPDase2. We transfected BDL PMF lacking NTPDase2 expression with an NTPDase2 plasmid. As seen in Fig. 6, transfection of BDL PMF with NTPDase2 induced a marked increase in NTPDase2 expression at the plasma membrane. Proliferation of Mz-ChA-1 cells was determined using BrdUrd as described above. As seen in Fig. 7, untransfected BDL PMF had no significant effect on Mz-ChA-1 proliferation (82 ± 40%; p was not significant), whereas BDL PMF transfected with NTPDase2 decreased Mz-ChA-1 proliferation (41 ± 20%; p <0.001). These findings show that BDL PMF lacking NTPDase2 do not attenuate Mz-ChA-1 proliferation, whereas BDL PMF expressing NTPDase2 do, and support the hypothesis that bile ductular proliferation after BDL may be regulated by loss of NTPDase2 expression. Cholangiopathies are conditions in which BDE are the target of disease. These conditions contribute greatly to the burden of liver disease in the United States and throughout the world, yet there are few effective therapies for them (19Lazaridis K.N. Strazzabosco M. Larusso N.F. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 1565-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In recent years, understanding of BDE physiology has increased because of improved techniques for their study (2Alpini G. McGill J.M. Larusso N.F. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1256-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). One of the areas in which BDE physiology has been well characterized is the role of extracellular nucleotides acting via P2Y nucleotide receptors expressed on BDE (20Dranoff J.A. Alpini G. Alvaro D. Marzoni M. LeSage E. LaRusso N.F. Pathobiology of Bile Duct Epithelia. Eurekah Press, Georgetown, TX2004: 96-100Google Scholar). Extracellular nucleotides are known to regulate electrolyte transport in BDE (21McGill J.M. Basavappa S. Mangel A.W. Shimokura G.H. Middleton J.P. Fitz J.G. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 236-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are important mediators of cell volume autoregulation (22Roman R.M. Wang Y. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G239-G248PubMed Google Scholar). Because BDE express diverse P2Y receptors (8Dranoff J.A. Masyuk A.I. Kruglov E.A. LaRusso N.F. Nathanson M.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1059-G1067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that extracellular nucleotides regulate other BDE cell functions as well. Because P2Y receptors are thought to be of greatest importance for autocrine/paracrine communication, it is likely that these receptors mediate communication between BDE and their adjacent stroma. Epithelial/mesenchymal interactions are of great importance in the regulation of a variety of cell functions. Specifically, recent reports have highlighted the importance of underlying stroma in the regulation of epithelial proliferation and/or differentiation (23Somasiri A. Howarth A. Goswami D. Dedhar S. Roskelley C.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1125-1136PubMed Google Scholar, 24Smyth I. Du X. Taylor M.S. Justice M.J. Beutler B. Jackson I.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13560-13565Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Aoki S. Toda S. Ando T. Sugihara H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4647-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26Shigetani Y. Sugahara F. Kawakami Y. Murakami Y. Hirano S. Kuratani S. Science. 2002; 296: 1316-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27Elghazi L. Cras-Meneur C. Czernichow P. Scharfmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3884-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, few studies have demonstrated a cross-talk loop created by a functional interaction between an ecto-enzyme expressed by one cell type and a receptor on the other. Here we have demonstrated directly that PF regulate the proliferation of BDE via expression of the ecto-nucleotidase NTPDase2. Furthermore, we showed that this regulatory mechanism is lost in the best-known model of bile ductular hyperproliferation (Fig. 8). This change in the NTPDase2-dependent regulation of BDE proliferation appears to parallel transdifferentiation of portal fibroblasts to myofibroblast-like, α-smooth muscle actin-positive cells known as portal myofibroblasts. This transdifferentiation is similar to the one observed in hepatic stellate cells (28Friedman S.L. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 1244-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and other fibrogenic cells in which pro-fibrogenic stimuli induce myofibroblastic transdifferentiation. Thus, the interaction between PF and BDE may be a model of these critical interactions throughout the body. In fact, an interaction between epithelia and mesenchyme is necessary for development of the liver. If the primordial liver epithelia contained in the liver diverticulum does not interact with septum transversum mesenchyme, the liver fails to form (29Karpen S.J. Suchy F.J. Suchy F.J. Sokol R.J. Balistreri W.F. Liver Disease in Children. 2nd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 3-21Google Scholar). This basic interaction is mirrored in other organs, such as the lungs (30Roman J. Fishman A.P. Elias J.A. Fishman J.A. Grippi M.A. Kaiser L.R. Senior R.M. Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders. 3rd Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1998: 73-89Google Scholar), heart (31Keller B.B. Wessels A. Markwald R.R. Fuster V. Alexander R.W. O'Rourke R.A. Hurst's The Heart. 11th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2004: 155-180Google Scholar), and kidney/urogenital tract (32Park J.M. Walsh P.C. Retik A.B. Vaughan E.D. Wein A.J. Campbell's Urology. 8th Ed. Saunders, Philadelphia2002: 1737-1764Google Scholar). Because development of these organs requires an epithelial/mesenchymal interaction, it seems plausible that these cell types should develop mechanisms for regulating each other's growth. Is it possible that epithelial/mesenchymal interactions are dysfunctional in disease states? In the kidneys, transformation of renal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts may mediate cyst growth in polycystic kidney disease (33Kuehn E.W. Park K.M. Somlo S. Bonventre J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F1326-F1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In fact, changes in the stroma are characteristic of polycystic diseases of both the kidneys and the liver, conditions characterized by overgrowth of overlying epithelia (33Kuehn E.W. Park K.M. Somlo S. Bonventre J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F1326-F1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Okada H. Ban S. Nagao S. Takahashi H. Suzuki H. Neilson E.G. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 35Everson G.T. Taylor M.R. Doctor R.B. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 774Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the lung, new approaches are targeting fibroblasts/myofibroblasts rather than epithelia or inflammatory cells as primary mediators of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting that abnormal epithelial/fibroblast cross-talk may also be important in this disease (36Selman M. Pardo A. Respir. Res. 2002; 3: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 37Selman M. King T.E. Pardo A. Ann. Intern. Med. 2001; 134: 136-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Finally, interaction with mesenchyme renders pancreatic ductal cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy, and desmoplastic reactions mediated by myofibroblast-like cells are characteristic of a variety of cancers (38Muerkoster S. Wegehenkel K. Arlt A. Witt M. Sipos B. Kruse M.L. Sebens T. Kloppel G. Kalthoff H. Folsch U.R. Schafer H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1331-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thus, epithelial/mesenchymal interactions may be critical in a variety of disease states in which epithelial proliferation is disordered. This study is also the first to propose a direct physiologic and pathophysiologic role for NTPDase2. NTPDase2 is one of a small collection of ecto-nucleotidases of the ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase family (39Sneddon P. Westfall T.D. Todorov L.D. Mihaylova-Todorova S. Westfall D.P. Kennedy C. Prog. Brain Res. 1999; 120: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40Bigonnesse F. Levesque S.A. Kukulski F. Lecka J. Robson S.C. Fernandes M.J. Sevigny J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5511-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These enzymes all share catalytic activity for nucleotides such as ATP. However, only several are expressed primarily at the plasma membrane, allowing them to regulate activation of P2X and P2Y nucleotide receptors (40Bigonnesse F. Levesque S.A. Kukulski F. Lecka J. Robson S.C. Fernandes M.J. Sevigny J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5511-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 41Kittel A. Pelletier J. Bigonnesse F. Guckelberger O. Kordas K. Braun N.

The best known NTPDase, NTPDase1, is a critical regulator of platelet activation (45Enjyoji K. Sevigny J. Lin Y. Frenette P.S. Christie P.D. Esch II, J.S. Imai M. Edelberg J.M. Rayburn H. Lech M. Beeler D.L. Csizmadia E. Wagner D.D. Robson S.C. Rosenberg R.D. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1010-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). However, the physiologic role of NTPDase2 was previously unknown. Previously, we demonstrated that NTPDase2 is limited to PF in the normal liver, where it might regulate activation of basolateral BDE P2Y receptors (7Dranoff J.A. Kruglov E.A. Robson S.C. Braun N. Zimmermann H. Sevigny J. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 1135-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8Dranoff J.A. Masyuk A.I. Kruglov E.A. LaRusso N.F. Nathanson M.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1059-G1067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now shown that NTPDase2 functions in the normal liver to regulate BDE proliferation, presumably via blockade of basolateral BDE P2Y receptor activation. Moreover (and perhaps more interestingly), loss of NTPDase2 in obstructive cholestasis may be an important factor in the disregulation of bile ductular proliferation in this condition. It remains to be investigated whether changes in NTPDase2 expression in other organs regulate proliferation of other epithelial tissues. In these studies, Mz-ChA-1 human cholangiocarcinoma cells were used as a model of BDE for several reasons. Mz-ChA-1 cells are very well characterized models of BDE proliferation (46Kanno N. Lesage G. Phinizy J.L. Glaser S. Francis H. Alpini G. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 47Tadlock L. Yamagiwa Y. Marienfeld C. Patel T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G924-G932PubMed Google Scholar). For these reasons, Mz-ChA-1 cells have been studied extensively, and their similarities to primary BDE are well known (22Roman R.M. Wang Y. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G239-G248PubMed Google Scholar, 48Shimokura G.H. McGill J.M. Schlenker T. Fitz J.G. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 965-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have validated the use of Mz-ChA-1 cells for these experiments by repeating our initial findings of the effects of PF co-culture on primary BDE. Thus, we believe that Mz-ChA-1 cells are appropriate models of BDE proliferation for these studies. In summary, we have defined a novel cross-talk signaling pathway between bile duct epithelia and the portal fibroblasts that underlie them. Moreover, we have demonstrated that this regulation is disordered in the most important model of bile duct epithelial hyperproliferation. We have shown that NTPDase2 may be an important mediator of this interaction. Future studies will define the downstream mechanism by which NTPDase2 and P2 receptors act to direct proliferation of bile ducts and other epithelia. These studies will also be extended to other models of altered bile ductular proliferation and to representative human diseases to generate novel pharmacologic treatments for critical diseases within and outside of the liver.

Others studies have shown that N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is involved in the neuroprotection of ischemic preconditioning. Here we examined whether ischemic preconditioning down-regulates activation of the mixed lineage kinase-JNK signaling pathway via NMDA receptor-mediated Akt1 activation. In our present results, ischemic preconditioning could not only inhibit activations of mixed lineage kinase 3, JNK1/2, and c-Jun but also enhanced activation of Akt1. In addition, both NMDA (an agonist of NMDA receptor) and preconditioning showed neuroprotective effects. In contrast, ketamine, an antagonist of NMDA receptor, prevented the above effects of preconditioning. Further studies indicated that LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase that is an upstream signaling protein of Akt1, could block neuroprotection of preconditioning, and KN62, an inhibitor of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, also achieved the same effects as LY294002. Therefore, both phosphoinositide 3-kinase and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase are involved in the activation of Akt1 in ischemic tolerance. Taken together, our results indicate that preconditioning can inhibit activation of JNK signaling pathway via NMDA receptor-mediated Akt1 activation and induce neuroprotection in hippocampal CA1 region.

Taken together, our results indicate that preconditioning can inhibit activation of JNK signaling pathway via NMDA receptor-mediated Akt1 activation and induce neuroprotection in hippocampal CA1 region. Glutamate is the most prevalent excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Based on studies of pharmacology, electrophysiology, and molecular biology, the ionotropic receptors are further divided into NMDA, 1The abbreviations used are: NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; NR, NMDA receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MLK, mixed lineage kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; I/R, ischemia/reperfusion; GluR6, glutamate receptor 6; p-, phospho-; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; ANOVA, analysis of variance; CaMK, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxsazole-4-propionic acid, and kainate receptors (1Hollmann M.

Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The ionotropic glutamate receptor NMDA subtype is a kind of prominent ligand-gated ionic channel in excitatory synapses that is involved in ischemic neuronal cell damage events. Functional NMDA receptor (NR) is composed of three types of subunits: NR1, NR2 (2A–2D), and NR3 (3A/3B) (3Andersson O. Stenqvist A. Attersand A. von Euler G. Genomics. 2001; 78: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Chatterton J.E. Awobuluyi M. Premkumar L.S. Takahashi H. Talantova M. Shin Y. Cui J. Tu S. Sevarino K.A. Nakanishi N. Tong G.

NR1 is a principal subunit for NMDA receptor channel activity, and NR2 subunits determine the specificity of receptor function (1Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). The overactivation of NMDA receptor has been widely believed to be the main signal resulting in cell injury in response to ischemic insults (6Schramm M. Eimerl S. Costa E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 89: 1193-1197Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, the mild activation of NMDA receptor is supposed to induce neuroprotection against excitotoxicity in cultured cerebellar granule neurons in vitro (7Chuang D.M. Gao X.M. Paul S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 210-216PubMed Google Scholar). Some previous studies have shown a neuroprotective effect of NMDA on kainate-induced neuronal cell death in mouse hippocampus in vivo (8Ogita K. Okuda H. Yamamoto Y. Nishiyama N. Yoneda Y. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1336-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The bulk of studies have shown that the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell is the most vulnerable neuron to ischemic injury (9Kirino T. Brain Res. 1982; 239: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (2524) Google Scholar, 10Pulsinelli W.A. Brierley J.B. Plum F. Ann. Neurol. 1982; 11: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar, 11Smith M-L. Bendek G. Dahlgren N. Rosen I. Wieloch T. Siesjö B.K. Acta Neurol. Scand. 1984; 69: 385-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). However, after a relative mild brain ischemia, cells will become more resistant to severe ischemic insult. This phenomenon has been called ischemic tolerance (12Kitagawa K. Matsumoto M. Tagaya M. Hata R. Ueda H. Niinobe M. Brain Res. 1990; 528: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar) or ischemic preconditioning. Ischemic preconditioning has drawn considerable attention as it provides a way to study the mechanisms of endogenous neuroprotection. Although the overactivation of NMDA receptor has been widely believed to be the main signal resulting in cell injury in ischemic insults, the mild activation of NMDA receptor has been proposed to be involved in the induction of brain ischemic tolerance (13Bond A. Lodge D. Hicks C.A. Ward M.A. O'Neill M.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 380: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Grabb M.C. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1657-1662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kato H. Liu Y. Araki T. Kogure K. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 139: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, the subsequent cellular signaling pathways leading to neuronal protective effects are largely unknown. MAPK signaling pathway is believed to be an important mediator in the signal transduction from cell surface to the nucleus playing a pivotal role in the regulation of neuronal survival and apoptosis (16Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 16: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 17Mielke K. Herdegen T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). This pathway consists of MAPK kinase kinases, MAPK kinases, and MAPKs. Every member is activated through phosphorylation by its upstream kinases (18Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. Essays Biochem. 1997; 32: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). Mixed lineage kinase (MLK) phosphorylates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4/7, which in turn phosphorylates JNK at its dual specific residues and activates it (19Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3665) Google Scholar). JNK, also named stress-activated protein kinase, has already been widely investigated for its active actions in response to various stimuli, such as heat shock, inhibition of protein glycosylation, exposure to inflammatory cytokines, ultraviolet irradiation, and ischemia (20Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that JNK is significantly activated with two peaks occurring at 30 min and 3 days after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) (21Gu Z.L. Jiang Q. Zhang G.Y. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 897-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The latter activation peak is considered to account for apoptosis. Other studies have documented that JNK is activated by MLK3, which is activated via GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 module in brain ischemia and reperfusion (22Pei D.S. Sun Y.F. Guan Q.H. Hao Z.B. Xu T.L. Zhang G.Y. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 367: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As apoptosis is an active form of cell death, it should be associated with alterations of gene expression. Gene expression is regulated by immediate early genes such as c-jun and c-fos. Therefore, these genes are considered to be involved in apoptotic neuronal cell death. In fact, some studies have revealed that c-Jun plays important roles in neuronal cell death in vitro and in vivo (23Watson A. Eliers A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 751-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). That c-Jun activates gene transcription is dependent on its phosphorylation state. Furthermore, activated JNK specifically phosphorylates the N-terminal activation domain of transcription factor c-Jun at serines 63 and 73, thereby increasing transcriptional activity of c-Jun (24Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Akt, also known as protein kinase B, is one of the downstream kinases of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) that is involved in survival signals in growth factor-mediated signaling cascades. The activation of Akt has been shown to depend on the phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473 (25Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 17: 599-602Crossref Scopus (1884) Google Scholar, 26Franke T. Yang S. Chan T. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D. Kaplan D. Tsichlis P. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). Studies show that NMDA receptor 2B subunit binds to the Src homology 2 domain of PI3K during global ischemia (27Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Mishina M. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Takagi N. Sasakawa K. Besshoh S. Miyake-Takagi K. Takeo S. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that Akt can be activated by NMDA receptor upon the participation of PI3K. In addition, Yano et al. (29Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) show that NMDA receptor stimulation induces Akt activation through Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase in NG108-15 cells, leading to antiapoptosis. In many cases, active Akt phosphorylates Bad (30Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4956) Google Scholar, 31del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar), caspase-9 (32Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar), and forkhead-related transcription factors (33Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar) and thereby induces antiapoptotic effects. Furthermore Akt also phosphorylates MLK3 Thr-674 and negatively regulates MLK3. Akt is a survival protein, and previous studies have shown that Akt plays a pivotal role in ischemic tolerance (34Yano S. Morioka M. Fukunaga K. Kawano T. Hara T. Kai Y. Hamada J. Miyamoto E. Ushio Y. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Therefore, based upon the evidence mentioned above, we postulated that ischemic preconditioning might inhibit the activation of JNK via Akt activation induced by NMDA receptor. In the present studies, we examined the effects of preconditioning, ketamine, or NMDA treatment on the activation of JNK1/2, c-Jun, and Akt1 in hippocampal CA1 region. We also examined functional interaction between Akt1 and the JNK pathway to identify the mechanism underlying ischemic tolerance. Materials—Anti-JNK1/2 antibody, anti-p-MLK3, anti-MLK3, NMDA, ketamine, KN62, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and goat anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Sigma. Anti-c-Jun antibody, anti-p-c-Jun, and anti-Akt1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-p-JNK1/2, nitroblue tetrazolium, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate were obtained from Promega. Anti-p-Akt1 and LY294002 were from Upstate Biotechnology. All other chemicals were from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Induction of Ischemia—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Shanghai Experimental Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Science) weighing 250–300 g were used. Surgical procedures were conducted with the guidelines below and under the terms of all relevant local legislations. Under anesthesia with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), vertebral arteries were electrocauterized, and common carotid arteries were dissected free. Rats were allowed to recover for 24 h and fasted overnight. To achieve global ischemia, four-vessel occlusion was induced by occluding the common arteries with aneurysm clips. Rats that lost their righting reflex within 15 s and whose pupils were dilated and unresponsive to light were selected for the experiments. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37–38 °C throughout the procedure. Rats with seizures were discarded. An electroencephalogram was monitored to ensure isoelectricity after carotid artery occlusion. Carotid artery blood flow was restored by releasing the clips (35Pulsinelli W.A. Brierley J.B. Stroke. 1979; 10: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). As preconditioning ischemia, the occlusion lasted for 3 min. Three days later, 6 min of ischemia was induced (36Liu Y. Kato H. Nakata N. Kogure K. Brain. Res. 1992; 586: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Sham operations were performed using the same surgical exposure procedures except that the arteries were not occluded. All the rats were housed in a room with a light-dark cycle of 12 h that was maintained at a constant temperature of 23–25 °C and a humidity of 55%. The rats were allowed free access to food and water for at least 2 weeks before use. Drug Administration—All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering, to reduce the number of animals used, and to utilize alternatives to in vivo technique. Drug administration was invariably carried out between 10.00 and 15.00 h to avoid possible diurnal rhythm effects as described previously (37Azuma Y. Ogita K. Yoneda Y. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The rats were injected intraperitoneally with ketamine (30 mg/kg) dissolved in 0.9% NaCl 20 min before preconditioning ischemia. NMDA dissolved in 1% phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) was administrated at a dose of 100 mg/kg three times with an interval of 2 h. 24 h later, ischemia was induced (9Kirino T. Brain Res. 1982; 239: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (2524) Google Scholar). LY294002 and KN62, dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 5 μg/μl, were administrated intracerebroventricularly (5 μl; bregma: 1.5 mm lateral, 0.8 mm posterior, 3.5 mm deep). Western Blotting—Rats were killed by decapitation at the specified time. Hippocampi were dissected into CA1 and CA3/DG subfields from hippocampal fissure. Tissues were homogenized in 1:10 (w/v) ice-cold homogenization buffer consisting of 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaF, 20 mm NaPPi, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A with a Teflon-glass homogenizer followed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used. The nuclear pellets were extracted with extraction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and enzyme inhibitors for 30 min at 4 °C with constant agitation. After being centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, supernatants as nuclear parts were collected. Samples were stored at –70 °C and were thawed only once. After determination of the protein concentration, 50 μg of protein of each sample was heated at 100 °C for 5 min with loading buffer containing 0.125 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% mercaptoethanol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue and then separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% acrylamide gels (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar). The proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose filter (pore size, 0.45 μm) according to the method of Towbin et al. (39Towbin H. Stachelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). Blotting filters were incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) at 4 °C for 6 h and probed with anti-JNK1/2 antibody (1:5000), anti-active (diphosphorylated) JNK1/2 antibody (1:3000), anti-c-Jun antibody (1:200), anti-active (diphosphorylated) c-Jun (1:100), anti-p-MLK3 (1:1000), anti-MLK3 (1:200), anti-Akt1 antibody (1:5000), or anti-active (diphosphorylated) Akt1 (1:3000) at 4 °C overnight. Detection was carried out using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000), goat anti-mouse IgG (1:40,000), or donkey anti-goat IgG (1:5000) and developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium color substrate. After immunoblotting, the bands on the filters were scanned and analyzed with an image analyzer (LabWorks Software, UVP Inc., Upland, CA). The optical density of the band in each lane was expressed as -fold versus that in sham control in the same filter. Histology—Five days after ischemia, rats were deeply anesthetized and perfused intracardially with 0.9% NaCl followed by 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Brains were removed quickly and further fixed with the same fixation solution at 4 °C overnight. Postfixed brains, dehydrated with 30, 50, 70, 80, 90, 95, and 100% ethanol, respectively, were embedded with paraffin. The coronal sections were prepared 5 μm thick using a microtome followed by deparaffinizing with xylene, redehydrating with ethanol at graded concentrations of 30–100% (v/v), and washing with water. Sections were stained with 0.1% (w/v) cresyl violet for assessment of neuronal damage in the hippocampus. The sections were examined with a light microscopy (400×), and the numbers of viable neurons were quantitatively analyzed within rectangular areas of 0.02 mm2. Data Analysis—Five and eight independent animals were sampled for each treatment for Western blotting study and histology examination, respectively. Data of those results were evaluated statistically using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Newman-Keuls test. In all cases, differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Preconditioning Inhibited Phosphorylation of MLK3, JNK1/2, and c-Jun and Enhanced That of Akt1 in Hippocampal CA1 Region—First, to investigate the role of JNK pathway in ischemic preconditioning, we examined the phosphorylation levels of MLK3 and JNK1/2 in hippocampal CA1 region. Our previous studies indicated that activation of MLK3 in the hippocampal CA1 subfield peaks at 30 min and 6 h after I/R, and that of JNK1/2 peaks at 30 min and 3 days (17Mielke K. Herdegen T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The latter peaks are considered to account for delayed neuronal death because JNK signaling activation alone is not sufficient to lead to neuronal death. In addition, prolonged JNK activation above a threshold might be required for brain cell death. Thus, we investigated the effect of preconditioning on the activation of MLK3 and JNK1/2 at 6 h or 3 days after reperfusion, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the activations of MLK3 and JNK1/2 after brain ischemia were inhibited markedly by preconditioning in hippocampal CA1 region. Second, we explored the effect of preconditioning on phosphorylation of c-Jun, a specific substrate of JNK. Because the activation of c-Jun has already been reported to peak at 3 h after lethal ischemia, 2Q. H. Guan, D. S. Pei, and Q. G. Zhang, submitted. we investigated c-Jun at 3 h after reperfusion. As shown in Fig. 1C, the phosphorylations of c-Jun induced by brain ischemia and reperfusion were inhibited markedly by preconditioning in hippocampal CA1 region. Third, some studies have demonstrated that Akt negatively regulates MLK3, which is an upstream of JNK (40Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R. Rana A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and that MLK3 activation peaks at 6 h after reperfusion (41Tian H. Zhang Q.G. Li H.C. Zhang G.Y. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 47: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore our primary experiments demonstrated that Akt activation is enhanced at 10 min after reperfusion but attenuated at 6 h by preconditioning. Therefore, we selected 10 min after reperfusion to investigate Akt1 activation based on the consideration that the phosphorylation state of MLK3, which was induced by an increase of Akt1 activation at 10 min, is maintained for at least 6 h and leads to the inhibition of MLK3 activation at 6 h after reperfusion. As shown in Fig. 1D, activation of Akt1 was increased markedly by preconditioning. No significant changes occurred concerning the expressions of JNK1/2 and Akt1. The protein levels of c-Jun were not altered between ischemic and ischemic preconditioning. Finally we examined whether preconditioning is associated with cell survival in hippocampal CA1 region. Normal CA1 pyramidal cells showed round and pale stained nuclei after cresyl violet staining. Five days after lethal ischemia, most CA1 pyramidal cells were shrunken with pyknotic nuclei. As shown in Fig. 2, A–C, a single ischemic insult of 6 min induced severe cell death. Neuronal density was significantly increased by preconditioning ischemia compared with neuronal density after a single ischemic insult. The numbers of surviving pyramidal cells in hippocampal CA1 region after a single ischemic insult and after preconditioning treated rats were 12 ± 5 and 82 ± 4% of those in the sham operation (Fig. 2, H–J), respectively. These data indicated that preconditioning inhibited the phosphorylations of both JNK1/2 and c-Jun but enhanced activations of Akt1, inducing neuroprotection in hippocampal CA1 region.Fig. 2Effect of pretreatment with NMDA on ischemia-induced neuronal loss and LY294002 on preconditioning-induced neuronal survival in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampal CA1 subfield. Rats were pretreated with NMDA (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1 day before 6 min of ischemia and reperfusion. Another group of rats were pretreated with LY294002 (25 μg/rat) or Me2SO (DMSO) 20 min before preconditioning. Five days later, brains were fixed with paraformaldehyde followed by preparation of coronal sections from paraffin-embedded brains and subsequent staining with cresyl violet to determine cell survival in neuronal layers of the hippocampi (n = 4). The boxed areas of CA1 subfield are shown at higher magnification, and the number of viable neurons in these areas was counted. A–G, images of hippocampi at lower magnification (×40).

Lodge D. Hicks C.A. Ward M.A. O'Neill M.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 380: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15Kato H. Liu Y. Araki T. Kogure K. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 139: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) have demonstrated a critical role of NMDA receptor in the induction of ischemic tolerance. Here we determined whether NMDA receptor mediates the effects of preconditioning-induced inhibitions of JNK1/2 and c-Jun and an increase of Akt1 activation. Rats were pretreated with ketamine 20 min before preconditioning followed by 6 min of ischemia. Phosphorylation levels of JNK1/2, c-Jun, and Akt1 in CA1 regions were examined at 3 days, 3 h, and 10 min after reperfusion, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, A–C, ketamine alone did not affect the activation levels of JNK1/2 and c-Jun in normal rats and the I/R-insulted rats. However, the attenuating effect of preconditioning on JNK1/2 and c-Jun activation and the increase in Akt1 activation in CA1 regions were prevented by ketamine, an antagonist of NMDA receptor. Rats pretreated with vehicle did not achieve the same results. At the same time, there was no change in the expression of JNK1/2 and Akt1. In addition, the protein levels of c-Jun were not affected by ketamine or vehicle. These data suggested that the inhibitions of JNK1/2 and c-Jun as well as Akt1 activation by preconditioning might be mediated by NMDA receptor activation. NMDA Treatment Inhibited Activation of JNK1/2 and c-Jun, Enhanced Activation of Akt1, and Resulted in Neuronal Survival—To further confirm whether NMDA receptor plays a pivotal role in ischemic tolerance and moderates activation of NMDA receptor leading to cell survival, we treated rats with NMDA 1 day before 6 min of ischemia. The phosphorylations and expressions of JNK1/2, c-Jun, and Akt1 in CA1 regions were examined in contrast with those in sham operation and vehicle control at 3 days, 3 h, and 10 min, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4A–C, the activations of JNK1/2 and c-Jun were significantly decreased, whereas Akt1 activation was increased. Vehicle controls had no change in the activations of the three proteins compared with the rats without pretreatment. The expressions of JNK1/2 and Akt1 remained unchanged. The protein level of c-Jun was not affected by NMDA or vehicle. Next we also examined whether NMDA is associated with cell survival in CA1 region. Rats were subjected to 6 min of ischemia with administration of NMDA 1 day before and were perfusion-fixed with paraformaldehyde 5 days later. Coronal sections were subjected to cresyl violet staining for examining the neurons. In hippocampal CA1 regions, neurons subjected to single ischemia or phosphate-buffered saline administration were severely damaged in contrast to that of sham control (Fig. 2E). CA1 region of NMDA-treated rats showed significant neuroprotection (Fig. 2D). The numbers of surviving pyramidal cells in CA1 region of phosphate-buffered saline-treated and NMDA-treated rats were 12 ± 6 and 80 ± 5% of those in sham operation, respectively (Fig. 2, K and L). These results further indicated the possibility that NMDA receptor might mediate the inhibition of JNK1/2 and c-Jun as well as Akt1 activation in ischemic tolerance. Furthermore NMDA receptor might mediate the neuroprotection induced by preconditioning. PI3K and CaMK Are Involved in the Signaling Pathway Induced by Preconditioning—It is well known that Akt is one of the downstream kinases of PI3K, and Akt1 negatively regulates MLK3, which is upstream of the JNK pathway (40Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R. Rana A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, the functional interaction between Akt1 and MLK3 will explain the mechanism underlying the inhibition of the activations of JNK and c-Jun by preconditioning. To determine whether Akt is involved in neuroprotection induced by preconditioning, we first administered rats with LY294002 20 min before preconditioning and examined the alteration of the phosphorylation of Akt1, MLK3, JNK1/2, and c-Jun. The results showed that the activations of MLK3, JNK1/2, and c-Jun were significantly enhanced and activation of Akt1 was inhibited by LY294002 compared with preconditioned only or vehicle control group (Fig. 5, A–D). No change was observed regarding expression of any of the proteins. To further determine whether Akt is involved in neuroprotection induced by preconditioning, we also administrated rats with LY294002 20 min before preconditioning and perfusion-fixed them on the 5th day of reperfusion. Results from cresyl violet staining showed that neurons in hippocampi subjected to preconditioning were protected significantly compared with those without preconditioning. However, hippocampal CA1 regions pretreated with LY294002 showed sever neuron loss (Fig. 2G). The viable pyramidal cells counted within the 0.02-mm2 rectangular areas were 81 ± 7, 85 ± 9, and 15 ± 6% of those in sham control, corresponding to hippocampi with preconditioning and with vehicle or LY294002 pretreatment, respectively (Fig. 2, J, M, and N). It has been reported previously that Akt is activated by CaMK (29Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanism underlying the induction of ischemic tolerance, we administered KN62 20 min before preconditioning and examined the phosphorylation of Akt1. As shown in Fig. 6A, the activation of Akt1 was inhibited by KN62 compared with the preconditioned and vehicle groups. No change was observed regarding expression of Akt1. Taken together, the above data indicated that both PI3K and CaMK were involved in the activation of Akt1 and the neuroprotection induced by preconditioning.Fig. 6Western blotting analysis of the effects of KN62 on Akt1 activation in hippocampal CA1 subfields. Rats were administrated with KN62 or 0.9% Me2SO (DMSO) 20 min prior to preconditioning and were decapitated after 6 min of ischemia. Extracts obtained from rats with sham operation, KN62 alone, reperfusion only, reperfusion plus KN62, preconditioning, vehicle, and LY294002 or KN62-treated rats before preconditioning were subjected to Western blotting.

KN, KN62; m, minutes; P, preconditioning; R, reperfusion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the present studies, we showed that preconditioning inhibited the activations of JNK1/2 and c-Jun during reperfusion after lethal ischemia through NMDA receptor-mediated activation of Akt1. These findings might provide some clues to understanding the mechanism underlying ischemia tolerance and to finding clinical therapies for stroke using the endogenous neuroprotection. JNK, an important signaling protein in cell apoptosis, is activated significantly in I/R with two peaks at 30 min and 3 days after reperfusion (21Gu Z.L. Jiang Q. Zhang G.Y. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 897-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). c-Jun, which is directly downstream of JNK and initiates transcription and expression of apoptosis proteins, is also involved in ischemic neuronal death (42Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that both JNK and c-Jun activations were inhibited markedly by preconditioning. On the other hand, ketamine pretreatment blocked the inhibiting effect of preconditioning on the two proteins. This provided a direct proof that NMDA receptor is a pivotal mediator in the induction of ischemic tolerance, consistent with the finding that an NMDA receptor antagonist, MK801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine), inhibits the induction of tolerance to ischemia in the gerbil hippocampus (13Bond A. Lodge D. Hicks C.A. Ward M.A. O'Neill M.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 380: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15Kato H. Liu Y. Araki T. Kogure K. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 139: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore we also showed that NMDA treatment prior to lethal ischemia achieved the same effects as preconditioning did, inhibiting the activations of JNK and c-Jun. Additionally NMDA pretreatment promoted neuronal survival in I/R, further suggesting the pivotal role of NMDA receptor in the induction of ischemic tolerance. Consistent with our results, NMDA can protect hippocampal pyramidal neurons against kainate-induced excitotoxicity in murine (8Ogita K. Okuda H. Yamamoto Y. Nishiyama N. Yoneda Y. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1336-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, moderate stimulation on NMDA receptor is beneficial and promotes survival, although most of the time NMDA receptor mediates excitotoxicity. Previous studies have reported that Ca2+ signaling activates Akt through NMDA receptors (29Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). However, other studies have also shown that NMDA receptor 2B subunit binds to Src homology 2 domain of PI3K during global ischemia (27Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Mishina M. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Takagi N. Sasakawa K. Besshoh S. Miyake-Takagi K. Takeo S. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In growth factor-mediated signaling cascades, Akt is activated by PI3K through phosphorylation of Akt Ser-473. Therefore, both CaMK and PI3K pathways participate in the mechanism of Akt activation induced by NMDA receptor stimulation. Furthermore Akt activation in glutamate-treated striatal neurons is Ca2+-dependent and PI3K-dependent (43Perkinton M.S. Ip J.K. Wood G.L. Crossthwaite A.J. Williams R.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 2239-2254Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Consistent with the above facts, both LY294002 and KN62 prevented the activation of Akt, which was induced by preconditioning in our studies. This confirms that preconditioning activates Akt1 through both CaMK and PI3K. In the present studies, we showed that Akt1 activation was increased by preconditioning, whereas Akt1 activation could be blocked by ketamine pretreatment. Akt1 activation was also significantly increased upon NMDA treatment 1 day before lethal ischemia. Therefore, it is clear that Akt1 plays a role closely associated with NMDA receptor in ischemic tolerance. Akt1 negatively regulates MLK3 through phosphorylating MLK3 Thr-674 (40Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R. Rana A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); thus it can be postulated that Akt1 activation inhibits JNK (a downstream kinase of MLK3) and c-Jun (a specific substrate of JNK) in ischemic tolerance. Additionally we found that LY294002 treatment prior to preconditioning decreased Akt1 activation and increased the activation of MLK3, JNK, and c-Jun, thus blocking neuroprotection of preconditioning. Thus, Akt1 functions as a critical mediator in the signaling pathway in which NMDA receptor mediated inhibition of the activations of MLK3, JNK1/2, and c-Jun. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that neither of the two activation peaks of JNK in I/R was due to NMDA receptor (44Tian H. Zhang G.Y. Li H.C. Zhang Q.G. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 46: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The 30-min peak could be eliminated by N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant, suggesting that the early activation of JNK was likely induced by reactive oxygen species (44Tian H. Zhang G.Y. Li H.C. Zhang Q.G. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 46: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas the 3-day peak could be significantly inhibited by 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3(1H,4H)-dione, a non-NMDA receptor antagonist (41Tian H. Zhang Q.G. Li H.C. Zhang G.Y. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 47: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, in I/R, the latter activation of JNK was mediated by stimulation of non-NMDA receptor, which could be explained by GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 module in rat hippocampus (22Pei D.S. Sun Y.F. Guan Q.H. Hao Z.B. Xu T.L. Zhang G.Y. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 367: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although NMDA receptor did not mediate the activation of the JNK pathway in I/R, it mediated the inhibition of JNK in ischemic tolerance. Additionally Akt1 is a pivotal mediator in the down-regulation of the JNK pathway in ischemic tolerance. This reflects the cross-talk between the two types of glutamate receptors. In this cross-talk, Akt also acts as a pivotal mediator. Therefore, we can conclude that preconditioning-induced downregulations of JNK and c-Jun and neuronal survival were mediated by NMDA receptor via Akt1 activation."

To identify Akt/PKB substrates that mediate these effects, we used antibodies that recognize phosphopeptide sites containing the Akt/PKB substrate motif (RXRXX(p)S/T) to immunoprecipitate proteins from insulin-stimulated adipocytes. Tryptic peptides from a 250-kDa immunoprecipitated protein were identified as the protein kinase WNK1 (with no lysine) by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, consistent with a recent report that WNK1 is phosphorylated on Thr60 in response to insulin-like growth factor I. Insulin treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated WNK1 phosphorylation, as detected by immunoprecipitation with antibody against WNK1 followed by immunoblotting with the anti-phosphoAkt substrate antibody. WNK1 phosphorylation induced by insulin was unaffected by rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase pathway but abolished by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. RNA interference-directed depletion of Akt1/PKBα and Akt2/PKBβ attenuated insulin-stimulated WNK1 phosphorylation, but depletion of protein kinase Cλ did not. Whereas small interfering RNA-induced loss of WNK1 protein did not significantly affect insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, it significantly enhanced insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation by about 2-fold. Furthermore, depletion of WNK1 promoted serum-stimulated cell proliferation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, as evidenced by a 36% increase in cell number after 48 h in culture. These data suggest that WNK1 is a physiologically relevant target of insulin signaling through PI3K and Akt/PKB and functions as a negative regulator of insulin-stimulated mitogenesis.

However, it is possible that other unknown Akt/PKB effectors regulate important cellular responses to insulin.

We confirmed WNK1 as a novel Akt/PKB substrate in insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, extending a recent report that insulin-like growth factor I in other cells caused phosphorylation of this kinase on Thr60, a putative Akt/PKB substrate site (33Vitari A.C.

RNAi-mediated gene silencing of WNK1 did not alter insulin-sensitive glucose transport in cultured adipocytes, but it did significantly enhance DNA synthesis and cell growth in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. This suggests that WNK1 may be a negative regulatory element in the insulin signaling pathway involving Akt/PKB that regulates cell proliferation. Materials—Human insulin was obtained from Eli Lilly Co. Goat polyclonal anti-Akt1/PKBα antibody (antigen human Akt1/PKBα peptide near carboxyl terminus, sc-7126), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG, and polyclonal anti-PKCλ/ζ (C-20, sc216) were from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against Akt2/PKBβ was kindly provided by Dr. Morris J. Birnbaum (University of Pennsylvania). Polyclonal antibodies against phospho-Akt/PKB serine 473, phospho-Erk1/2, and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated Akt/PKB substrate motif was generated as described previously (29Zhang H. Zha X. Tan Y. Hornbeck P.V. Mastrangelo A.J. Alessi D.R. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39379-39387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection of siRNAs—The 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin and differentiated into adipocytes as described previously (34Harrison S.A.

Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—After experimental treatments, the cells were solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100. Total cell lysates of 1–2 mg of protein were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against phospho-Akt/PKB substrates (1:100 dilution) or WNK1 (1:200 dilution) for 2 h followed by incubation with 80 μl of protein A-Sepharose 6MB for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with lysis buffer before boiling for 5 min in Laemmli buffer. To detect phospho-Akt/PKB substrates, phosphorylation of Akt/PKB serine 473 and tyrosine/threonine phosphorylation of Erk1/2 total cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were resolved with SDS-PAGE and electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-specific antibodies (1:1000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. Primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Akt2/PKBβ (1:1000 dilution) and PKCλ/ζ (1:500 dilution) were used to detect their antigens using 25 μg of protein from total cell lysates. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins was detected with monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10, 1 μg/ml). Akt1/PKBα was detected with primary goat polyclonal antibody (1:750 dilution). All the membranes were then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (1:10,000 dilution each) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed with wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature after incubation with each antibody before detection with ECL™ kit. Mass Spectrometry—Proteins immunoprecipitated with PAS antibody were resolved in 5–15% gradient SDS-PAGE and visualized with a Silver-plus kit according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). The 250-kDa band was excised from the silver-stained gel and digested with sequencing grade porcine-modified trypsin (Promega). The tryptic peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The peptide mass spectrum was acquired over a range 500–3500 Da. Peptide mass mapping was carried out against the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base using the MS-FIT program (University of California, San Francisco, CA; www-.prospector.ucsf.edu). To further verify the MS-FIT identification, selected peptides were fragmented via Post-Source-Decay and searched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base using the MSTag program. Deoxyglucose Uptake Assay—To detect the effect of specific gene silencing on insulin-stimulated glucose transport, [3H]deoxyglucose uptake assays were carried out in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as described previously (35Jiang Z.Y.

Briefly, 5 million adipocytes (day 5 of differentiation) were transfected with siRNA by electroporation, and this procedure usually leads to about 30% cell loss. The cells were reseeded for 60 h before serum starvation for 3 h with Krebs-Ringer HEPES (KRH) buffer (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were then stimulated with insulin for 30 min at 37 °C. Glucose uptake was initiated by addition of [1,2-3H]2-deoxy-d-glucose to a final assay concentration of 100 μm for 5 min at 37 °C. Assays were terminated by four washes with ice-cold KRH buffer, and the cells were solubilized with 0.4 ml of 1% Triton X-100, and 3H was determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecific deoxyglucose uptake was measured in the presence of 20 μm cytochalasin B and subtracted from each determination to obtain specific uptake. Thymidine Incorporation Assay and Assessment of Cell Growth—To detect the effect of gene silencing on insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis, [3H]thymidine incorporation assays were carried out in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Briefly, preadipocytes were transfected with siRNA by electroporation as described previously (35Jiang Z.Y. Zhou Q.L. Colman K.A. Chouinard M. Boese Q. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7569-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and this procedure kills about 15% of the cells. The electroporated cells were reseeded into 6-well plates for 36 h before serum starvation with DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 5 h. Cells were then incubated with or without insulin for 16 h in the starvation media before adding 0.1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (in the presence of 5 μm cold thymidine) for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by incubation with 0.5 ml of 300 mm NaOH and 100 μl of 10% SDS for 30 min. Macromolecules were precipitated by 20% trichloroacetic acid using 100 μl of 1 mg/ml DNA as carrier. The resulting trichloroacetic acid-insoluble pellet was washed two times with 5% trichloroacetic acid and then washed with 75% ethanol prior to dissolution in 0.4 ml of formic acid. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA was measured by scintillation counting. To assess cell growth rate, the preadipocytes were transfected with designed siRNAs by electroporation and reseeded for up to 72 h in normal DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The phase-contrast images (10 random flames for each group) were taken at 3, 24, 48, and 72 h after reseeding, and cell numbers were counted on each flame. RNAi-based Depletion of Akt/PKB Proteins in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Inhibits Insulin-stimulated Phosphorylation of Proteins Detected by PAS Antibodies—PAS antibody has been reported to recognize the Akt/PKB substrate motif RXRXXS/T in the target proteins of the kinase (28Kane S.

However, this polyclonal antibody may also cross-react with phosphoproteins that are not Akt/PKB substrates. In preliminary experiments we tested whether insulin-stimulated protein phosphorylation in cultured adipocytes could be detected with PAS antibody. Analysis of lysates from control or insulin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with PAS antibody revealed multiple phosphoprotein bands (Fig. 1). The intensity of many of the insulin-sensitive bands was markedly diminished by treatment of the cells with wortmannin, indicating that their phosphorylation is downstream of the PI3K pathway. To identify Akt/PKB-specific targets in insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we compared the insulin-stimulated protein phosphorylations detectable by PAS antibody in samples from cells transfected with the scrambled, nonspecific siRNA versus siRNA duplexes directed against mouse Akt1/PKBα plus Akt2/PKBβ. As shown in Fig. 1 (bottom panels), both Akt1/PKBα and Akt2/PKBβ protein levels were significantly reduced in cells transfected with siRNA species against Akt1/PKBα plus Akt2/PKBβ for 48 h as compared with the cells transfected with the scrambled siRNA. Interestingly, depletion of both Akt1/PKBα and Akt2/PKBβ significantly reduced phosphorylation of several proteins (indicated by arrowheads in Fig. 1), suggesting that Akt/PKB protein kinases are required for insulin-induced phosphorylation of those proteins. It is possible that those proteins are potential physiological target substrates of Akt/PKB in the adipocytes. However, insulin-induced phosphorylation of several other proteins (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 1) was not altered by the loss of Akt1/PKBα and Akt2/PKBβ, suggesting that those insulin-sensitive phosphoproteins are not substrates of Akt/PKB. Identification of a 250-kDa Phosphoprotein as Protein Kinase WNK1—To identify potential Akt/PKB targets, total cell lysates from control and insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were immunoprecipitated with PAS antibody and separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining. As shown in Fig. 2A, PAS antibody immunoprecipitated several proteins from insulin-stimulated cells including 250-, 220-, 160-, 140-, 120-, 100-, 90-, 75-, 40-, and 32-kDa proteins. Protein bands were excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. The peptides produced were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. We identified the 32-kDa protein as S6 ribosomal protein, which is likely phosphorylated by the insulin-activated pp70 S6 kinase, based on previous reports that its phosphorylation can be recognized by PAS antibody (28Kane S.

It is interesting to note that the 140-kDa phosphoprotein was identified as ATP-citrate lyase, as reported previously from its isolation by fractionation with Mono-Q chromatography (37Berwick D.C.

Initially, we focused on the 250-kDa phosphoprotein for several reasons. First, the tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting from this protein was identical to human and rat protein kinase WNK1 (30Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 31Wilson F.H.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5562-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry peptide mapping in two separate experiments. Second, a Blast search for the mouse homologue within the Celera data base identified the mouse WNK1 as similar to rat and human WNK1 in the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base. Motif scanning in the Scansite (www.scansite.mit.edu) identified that WNK1, from all three species, had a conserved putative Akt phosphorylation motif at the amino-terminal region (RRRRHTM). In addition, depletion of both Akt1/PKBα and Akt2/PKBβ abolished insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the 250-kDa protein in total lysates from adipocytes (indicated by the top arrowhead in Fig. 1). To confirm that the 250-kDa protein was indeed WNK1 and was phosphorylated in insulin-stimulated cells, PAS antibody was used to immunoprecipitate endogenous phosphoproteins from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and the enriched pool was immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal antibody against the amino-terminal peptide of mouse WNK1. As shown in Fig. 3, left panel, the amount of WNK1 precipitated by PAS antibody was dramatically increased in insulin-stimulated cells as compared with control adipocytes, whereas pretreatment of the cells with wortmannin completely demolished the effect of insulin. In addition, immunoprecipitation was also carried out with anti-WNK1 antibody followed by immunoblotting with PAS antibody. As expected, higher phosphorylation of WNK1 detected by PAS antibody was also observed in insulin-stimulated cells, although equal amounts of WNK1 were present in control and insulin-stimulated cells (Fig. 3, bottom right panel). Again, wortmannin totally inhibited insulin-stimulated WNK1 phosphorylation. These data confirm that insulin stimulates PAS-detectable phosphorylation of WNK1 through a wortmannin-sensitive PI3K pathway in adipocytes. A similar conclusion was reached in another study, which was published after we collected the data presented in Figs. 1, 2, 3, with respect to insulin-like growth factor I signaling (33Vitari A.C. Deak M. Collins B.J. Morrice N. Prescott A.R. Phelan A. Humphreys S. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This published study (33Vitari A.C. Deak M. Collins B.J. Morrice N. Prescott A.R. Phelan A. Humphreys S. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) showed that the regulated phosphorylation site on WNK1 is Thr60. Insulin Induces WNK1 Phosphorylation through the Akt/PKB Pathway—Because insulin signaling through the PI3K pathway leads to the activation of multiple downstream serine/threonine kinases in addition to Akt/PKB, including atypical PKC, mTOR, and p70 S6 kinase, we further investigated whether any of those kinases may be required for insulin-induced WNK1 phosphorylation. In this study, rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, was used to examine whether the mTOR-p70 S6 kinase pathway is involved in WNK1 phosphorylation in cultured adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 4A, incubation of the adipocytes with rapamycin prior to insulin treatment did not alter insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and WNK1, detected by phospho-Akt/PKB Ser473-specific antibody and PAS antibody, respectively. However, rapamycin effectively blocked insulin-stimulated threonine 389 phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase mediated by mTOR (Fig. 4A). In contrast, wortmannin inhibited not only phosphorylation of threonine 389 of the p70 S6 kinase but also phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and WNK1. These data indicate that the mTOR-p70 S6 kinase pathway is not involved in insulin-stimulated WNK1 phosphorylation. We next tested whether protein kinases Akt/PKB and atypical protein kinase C, both downstream of the PI3K pathway, are required for the phosphorylation of WNK1. In these studies, siRNA duplexes against Akt1/PKBα and Akt2/PKBβ or PKCλ, the major form of atypical PKC in the adipocytes, were electroporated into 3T3-L1 adipocytes (31Wilson F.H. Disse-Nicodeme S. Choate K.A. Ishikawa K. Nelson-Williams C. Desitter I. Gunel M. Milford D.V. Lipkin G.W. Achard J.M. Feely M.P. Dussol B. Berland Y. Unwin R.J. Mayan H. Simon D.B. Farfel Z. Jeunemaitre X.

As shown in Fig. 4B, depletion of both Akt/PKB proteins by siRNA almost abolished insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of WNK1 detected by PAS antibody, whereas equal amounts of WNK1 were precipitated by WNK1 antibody. However, RNAi-directed depletion of PKCλ had no effect on insulin-stimulated WNK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). These data strongly suggest that insulin induces phosphorylation of WNK1 through an Akt/PKB protein kinase-specific pathway. WNK1 Is Not Involved in the Regulation of Upstream Signaling of the Insulin Receptor—No data are available on the function of WNK1 in adipocytes. Multiple studies have suggested that cellular stress and prolonged incubation of adipocytes with insulin lead to desensitization of insulin signaling through protein kinase-dependant phosphorylation and the decrease of IRS protein level (39Sun X.J.

https://openalex.org/W2081863297,"The SK2 subtype of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system and modulates neuronal excitability by contributing to the afterhyperpolarization that follows an action potential. Western blots of brain membrane proteins prepared from wild type and SK2-null mice reveal two isoforms of SK2, a 49-kDa band corresponding to the previously reported SK2 protein (SK2-S) and a novel 78-kDa form. Complementary DNA clones from brain and Western blots probed with an antibody specific for the longer form, SK2-L, identified the larger molecular weight isoform as an N-terminally extended SK2 protein. The N-terminal extension of SK2-L is cysteine-rich and mediates disulfide bond formation between SK2-L subunits or with heterologous proteins. Immunohistochemistry revealed that in brain SK2-L and SK2-S are expressed in similar but not identical patterns. Heterologous expression of SK2-L results in functional homomeric channels with Ca2+ sensitivity similar to that of SK2-S, consistent with their shared core and intracellular C-terminal domains. In contrast to the diffuse, uniform surface distribution of SK2-S, SK2-L channels cluster into sharply defined, distinct puncta suggesting that the extended cysteine-rich N-terminal domain mediates this process. Immunoprecipitations from transfected cells and mouse brain demonstrate that SK2-L co-assembles with the other SK subunits. Taken together, the results show that the SK2 gene encodes two subunit proteins and suggest that native SK2-L subunits may preferentially partition into heteromeric channel complexes with other SK subunits.

SK channels are voltage-independent K+ channels that are activated by elevated levels of intracellular Ca2+, such as occur following an action potential (1Bond C.T. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In many central neurons, SK channel activity dampens excitability by contributing to the afterhyperpolarization, affecting interspike intervals during a burst of action potentials as well as the length of the burst (2Sah P.

SK1, SK2, and SK3 are expressed in overlapping yet distinct patterns throughout the central nervous system with SK2 being the most highly expressed (6Köhler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M.

These genes are also expressed in many peripheral tissues along with the fourth member of the SK gene family, IK1 (SK4), whose expression is limited to the periphery (9Ishii T.M. Silvia C. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11651-11656Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). 1T. Strassmaier, C. T. Bond, C. A. Sailer, H. G. Knaus, J. Maylie, and J. P. Adelman, unpublished results. Apamin specifically blocks SK1–3 channels, and the physiological consequences of apamin application likely reflect SK channel blockade. Apamin block of hippocampal SK channels facilitates the induction of synaptic plasticity at CA3 Schaffer collateral to CA1 synapses. Consistent with this result, systemic apamin injection facilitates the acquisition of hippocampal dependent learning (10Stackman R.W. Hammond R.S. Linardatos E. Gerlach A. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Tzounopoulos T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10163-10171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects depend upon SK2 channels as SK2-null mice lack apamin-sensitive currents in CA1 neurons, but these currents are unchanged in SK1-null or SK3-null mice (11Bond C.T. Herson P.S.

SK channels share the six transmembrane domain topology of the Shaker prototype. Within their transmembrane core domains the different SK subunits are highly homologous but exhibit considerable divergence in their intracellular N- and extreme C-terminal domains. The most highly conserved domain is the calmodulin-binding domain in the proximal C terminus. Calmodulin is constitutively associated with the channel and gating is a result of Ca2+ binding to the N-lobe E-F hands of CaM 2The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; TBS, Tris-buffered saline.

Protein kinase CK2 also associates with SK channels, forming a multimeric complex that may include additional components. In this complex, CK2 phosphorylates CaM and modulates the Ca2+ sensitivity of the channels (13Bildl W. Strassmaier T. Thurm H. Andersen J. Eble S. Oliver D. Knipper M. Mann M. Schulte U. Adelman J.P. Fakler B. Neuron. 2004; 43: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression studies showed that rat or mouse SK2 and SK3, but not SK1 subunits, form functional homomeric channels, and all three subtypes are capable of co-assembly (14Ishii T.M.

J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 553: 13-19Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, other reports suggest that SK channels form exclusively homomeric channels in the brain, indicating that there may be mechanisms to compartmentalize the different SK subtypes and prevent heteromeric channel formation (17Sailer C.A. Hu H. Kaufmann W.A. Trieb M. Schwarzer C. Storm J.F. Knaus H.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9698-9707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the macromolecular composition of SK2-containing complexes in vivo, membrane protein extracts from wild type and SK2-null mice were examined, revealing a previously unknown N-terminally extended SK2 subunit. This novel SK isoform, SK2-L, is expressed in a subset of SK2-expressing neurons, and both forms of SK2 co-assemble into heteromeric channels with the other SK subunits. Molecular Biology—An SK2 cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AK033158) from mouse testis was used to design a primer for amplification of SK2-L from mouse brain cDNA. The entire SK2-L coding sequence was amplified with Pfu Turbo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the 5′-primer TCGGGAGAACGTGCAAATGTGA and the 3′-primer CTAGCTACTCTCTGATGAAGTTG. Sequencing of two independent clones revealed three discrepancies with the mouse testis cDNA sequence, deletion of C712, A968C, and A1066C (numbering according to GenBank™ accession number AK033158). Deletion of C712 results in a frameshift that extends the predicted open reading frame at the N terminus. For expression in transient transfections, the SK2-L coding sequence was cloned into the cytomegalovirus-based vector, pJPA. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The tandem triple myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) was inserted at the S3-S4 loop of SK2-L or SK2-S using complementary oligonucleotides cloned into a BamHI site that had been introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (18Lee W.S.

Similarly, the C8 epitope (PRGPDRPEGIEE) was appended to the N terminus of the channels. All sequences were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Antibodies—A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide from the C terminus of SK2 (α-SK2-C) has been described previously (11Bond C.T. Herson P.S. Strassmaier T. Hammond R. Stackman R. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5301-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody (α-SK2-L) was raised in rabbits against a peptide from the N terminus of SK2-L (METPLQFQRGFFPEQP). A cysteine residue was included at the C terminus to allow coupling to cysteine-reactive Sepharose (Sulfo-Link, Pierce). Both α-SK2 polyclonal antibodies were purified by peptide affinity chromatography. Mouse monoclonal α-C8 antibody was purified from the tissue culture supernatant of Chessie 8 (C8) hybridoma (19Abacioglu Y.H. Fouts T.R. Laman J.D. Claassen E. Pincus S.H. Moore J.P. Roby C.A. Kamin-Lewis R. Lewis G.K. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal α-CaM antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). Mouse monoclonal α-myc antibody was from Invitrogen. A rabbit polyclonal α-SK2 antibody was purchased from Alomone Laboratories. Purified α-SK2-L antibody was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions at 2 mg of antibody/ml of Sepharose. Mouse Brain Membrane Preparations—Whole mouse brains were homogenized in ice-cold HS (in mm: 320 sucrose, 10 Hepes, 1 EGTA) supplemented with Sigma mammalian protease inhibitor mixture in a glass/Teflon homogenizer. An initial centrifugation (10 min at 900 × g) removed unbroken cells and nuclei; the resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant (light membrane fraction), was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min to collect the membranes. The 10,000 × g pellet was processed further by fractionation on a sucrose step gradient. First, the membranes were resuspended in hypotonic HE (10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Following this hypotonic lysis, the membranes were collected by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer HS and layered on a sucrose step gradient (0.32, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 m sucrose in buffer HE) and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 90 min in a Beckman Sw41Ti rotor. Membranes were collected from the 1.0/1.2 m sucrose interface, diluted with HE, and pelleted by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min. All membranes were resuspended in HS, and protein content was determined using the BCA method (Pierce) and verified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Western Blots—Thirty-μg samples of light membrane or sucrose gradient purified brain membranes were mixed in SDS-PAGE loading buffer supplemented with 50 mm dithiothreitol for reducing conditions or 12.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide for non-reducing conditions prior to SDS-PAGE separation. N-Ethylmaleimide was included to prevent formation of disulfide bonds upon SDS denaturation. Unless specified, reducing conditions were employed. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes. Primary antibodies were diluted in 3% nonfat dry milk in PBS as follows: α-CaM to 0.5 μg/ml, α-C8 to 0.2 μg/ml, Alomone α-SK2 to 0.4 μg/ml, α-SK2C to 2 μg/ml for brain membranes (or 0.1 μg/ml for COS membranes), and α-SK2-L to 5 μg/ml. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted 1:10,000 in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were developed with SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitation—Brain membranes (at 5 mg/ml) were solubilized in buffer A (in mm: 190 NaCl, 10 KCl, 10 Hepes, 1 EGTA, pH 7.4) containing 1% β-d-dodecyl maltoside (DDM) (Anatrace, Maumee, OH) for 45 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 15 mg of solubilized membrane protein were incubated with 15 μl of α-SK2-L-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed 15 times with 1 ml of buffer A containing 0.1% DDM. Bound proteins were eluted at room temperature with a denaturing solution (8 m urea, 0.1% DDM, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). COS cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, and the immunoprecipitation of SK2-L was performed as described above except that buffer B (in mm: 490 NaCl, 10 KCl, 10 Hepes, 1 EGTA, pH 7.4) replaced buffer A. For each 10-cm dish of COS cells, 1 ml of buffer B containing 1% DDM was used for solubilization. Control immunoprecipitations were performed by combining 0.5 ml of SK2-L-transfected COS cells with 0.5 ml of C8-SK1-, C8-SK2-S-, or C8-SK3-transfected COS cells at the start of solubilization. In each immunoprecipitation, 10 μlof α-SK2-L-Sepharose was used, and binding proceeded for 90 min at 4 °C. Cell Culture and Transfection—COSm6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin and CHO cells in Ham's/F-12 with the same supplements. CHO and COS cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For electrophysiological recordings and immunocytochemistry cells were co-transfected with a channel expression plasmid and a green fluorescent protein expression plasmid at a 9:1 ratio. Electrophysiology—Recordings were performed at room temperature 1–2 days after transfection under phase contrast using an EPC9 amplifier (Instrutech Corp., Port Washington, NY) interfaced to a Macintosh G4. Data were collected using Pulse software (Heka Elektronik, Southboro, MA) and analyzed using Igor (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Transfected cells were identified by fluorescence. Whole-cell recordings pipettes were prepared from thin-walled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and had resistances of 3–4 MΩ when filled with (in mm) 150 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, pH-adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH, after adding CaCl2 to 10 μm. The bath solution was 30 KCl, 112 NaCl, 10 dextrose, 10 Hepes, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2 (pH-adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH). Current amplitudes were measured at –80 mV before and after application of 100 μm d-tubocurarine. For excised patch recordings macroscopic currents were measured in symmetrical K+ solution containing (in mm) 150 KOH, 10 HEPES, and 1 EGTA, supplemented with CaCl2, pH-adjusted to 7.2 with methanesulfonic acid; the amount of CaCl2 required to yield the indicated concentrations was calculated according to Fabiato and Fabiato (20Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1979; 75: 463-505Google Scholar). Current amplitudes for the Ca2+ dose response were measured at –80 mV unless otherwise indicated. Immunostaining—For transfected cells immunocytochemistry was performed 1–2 days post-transfection. Live cell immunostaining was performed by incubating the cells at 37 °C with a 1:250 dilution of α-myc monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) in complete medium for 10 min. After five washes in PBS+ (1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2), cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS+ and incubated with a Texas Red-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Vector, Burlingame, CA) at 1:5000 in PBS+ supplemented with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with PBS+ and mounted (ProLong Antifade Kit, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for imaging. Images were acquired with epifluorescence using an optical microscope Axioplan2 (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) and OpenLab program (Improvision, Lexington, MA). For tissue sections, immunohistochemistry with the pan-SK2 antibody, α-SK2-C, was performed as described previously (8Sailer C.A. Kaufmann W.A. Marksteiner J. Knaus H.G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and for α-SK2-C and α-SK2-L affinity-purified antibody was used at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Experiments applying the α-SK2-L antibody used free-floating 40-μm mouse brain cryosections (perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde). These sections were subjected to an antigen retrieval solution from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark) for 7 min at 70 °C and thereafter permeabilized for 90 min in TBS, pH 7.4, 0.4% Triton X-100 (TBS-T). Subsequently, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 10% normal goat serum in TBS-T for 90 min and the α-SK2-L antibody was applied overnight (in TBS-T containing 3% normal goat serum). In control experiments, the antibody was pre-adsorbed with 20 μm immunogenic peptide, or the respective pre-immune serum was used. Three rinses in TBS-T were performed before incubation with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:400) for 150 min. Finally, the sections were washed with TBS, pH 8.0, and SK2-L immunoreactivity was visualized by reaction with 0.63 mm 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, 10 mm nickel ammonium sulfate, and 0.002% H2O2 in TBS, pH 8.0. The sections were analyzed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a Zeiss Axio Cam digital camera. Native SK2 subunits were investigated by performing Western blots of brain membrane preparations from wild type and SK2-null mice (11Bond C.T. Herson P.S. Strassmaier T. Hammond R. Stackman R. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5301-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), using a commercially available antibody (Alomone). While this antibody detected the 49-kDa SK2 protein from SK2-transfected COS cells, it was unable to detect SK2 in brain membrane preparations (Fig. 1). Although three bands were detected with this antibody, the presence of all three bands in the membrane preparations from SK2-null mice indicated that they did not correspond to SK2. Therefore a new polyclonal antibody, α-SK2-C, was raised against a synthetic peptide epitope from the distal C-terminal domain of mSK2. With this affinity-purified antibody, a single 49-kDa protein was detected from SK2-transfected COS cells but not from cells transfected with mouse SK1 or rat SK3 (Fig. 2A). Similarly, a 49-kDa protein was detected on Western blots of brain membrane preparations from wild type, but not SK2-null mice (Fig. 2B). Closer inspection of the Western blots from brain revealed that in addition to the 49-kDa SK2 protein, a second larger protein of ∼78 kDa was present in wild-type, but not SK2-null mice.Fig. 2Analysis of SK2. A, Western blot of membranes prepared from COS cells transfected with SK1, SK2, or SK3. The α-SK2-C antibody recognizes a single 49-kDa band only from SK2-transfected cells. B, membranes prepared from control SK2-transfected COS cells, sucrose gradient-purified membranes from wild type (wt), and SK2Δ/Δ mouse brains. The α-SK2-C antibody recognizes a 49-kDa species from control and wild type membranes and a 78-kDa band only from wild type membranes. C, schematic of the 5′-region of the SK2 gene. Boxes indicate exons with size in bp above each. Intron sizes (not to scale) are indicated in parentheses in kbp. Vertical lines within the boxes representing the exons indicate the approximate positions of methionine codons, the right-hand-most being the start of SK2-S. A bold line below exon 1 indicates the position of the α-SK2-L epitope. The amino acid sequence of the extended SK2-L N terminus is shown below, aligned with the N terminus of mSK3; the Met residues are in bold, and the α-SK2-L epitope is underlined. MSSCRY is the beginning of SK2-S.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mouse sequence database was searched to determine the identity of the larger SK2 protein, SK2-L. A single entry from embryonic mouse testis (GenBank™ accession number AK033158.1) was found that contained an extended N-terminal coding region relative to cloned SK2. If the most 5′-translational initiation codon is used, this domain extends the coding sequence by 275 amino acids. Expression of a longer SK2 transcript in brain was confirmed by cloning the SK2-L cDNA from mouse brain. Four in-frame methionine codons are present in this extended transcript, three in the contiguous open reading frame on exon 1, with the most 5′ being located on upstream exon C (Fig. 2C). It is not yet clear which of these codons serves for initiation of SK2-L translation. However, the Mr of heterologously expressed SK2-L utilizing the most 3′ start codon is most similar to the Mr of SK2-L from brain. A polyclonal antibody was generated using a peptide antigen representing an epitope in the unique N-terminal domain of SK2-L (see Fig. 2C). On Western blots of brain membrane proteins the affinity-purified antibody recognized an ∼80-kDa protein from wild type mice that is absent from SK2-null mice (Fig. 3A). The apparent Mr of SK2 on SDS-PAGE increases with increasing the percentage of acrylamide; the pan-SK2 antibody α-SK2-C also recognizes an 80-kDa band on 15% gels (data not shown). The striking number of cysteine residues within the extended N-terminal domain of SK2-L suggests that SK2-L might form disulfide linkages either with itself or with heterologous protein partners. Indeed, SK2-L was detected in a very high molecular weight complex on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 3B). The migration of SK2-S, which lacks this cysteine-rich extension is unchanged in non-reducing conditions. Interestingly, the migration pattern of SK2-L expressed in COS cells was unaffected on non-reducing SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The expression profile of SK2-S and SK2-L in mouse brain was examined by immunohistochemistry. Two antibodies were used for these studies, α-SK2-C, directed toward the C terminus that recognizes both SK2 isoforms, and α-SK2-L, specific for the extended N terminus of SK2-L. These two antibodies produced almost identical patterns of immunoreactivity (see Sailer et al. (8Sailer C.A. Kaufmann W.A. Marksteiner J. Knaus H.G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)). The notable exception was the lack of SK2-L staining in layer V of the cortex, where the pan SK2 antibody detected robust expression (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, SK2-L and SK2-S are likely expressed in many of the same cells throughout the brain. To examine the ability of SK2-L to form functional channels in a heterologous system, CHO cells were transfected with either SK2-S or SK2-L and examined for Ca2+-activated K+ currents. Twenty four hours after transfection with 1 μg of SK expression plasmid DNA plus 4 μg of blank vector DNA, whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were performed. Dialyzing the cells with an internal solution containing 10 μm Ca2+ evoked currents in response to voltage ramp commands with the predicted potassium reversal potential of –39 mV. The evoked K+ currents were reversibly blocked by the SK channel antagonist d-tubocurarine (100 μm) in cells expressing either SK2-S or SK2-L; these currents were not detected in control-transfected cells. The amplitudes from cells expressing SK2-L were not significantly different from those expressing SK2-S (0.84 ± 0.16 nA, n = 9 for SK2-L; 1.55 ± 0.86 nA, n = 6 for SK2-S; p = 0.4; Fig. 5A). Additionally, cells were co-transfected with 4 μg of SK2-L DNA plus 1 μg of SK2-S DNA. The whole-cell current amplitudes were consistent with an additive, non-inhibitory effect (3.82 ± 0.71 nA, n = 6) suggesting the formation of either heteromeric channels or separate homomeric populations of SK2-L and SK2-S channels. The Ca2+ sensitivity of SK2-L channels was examined in inside-out patches. Although approximately equivalent whole-cell current amplitudes were observed for SK2-S and SK2-L, in excised patches the current amplitudes for SK2-L were much smaller than for SK2-S. Ca2+ dose responses were measured in symmetrical K+ solutions. Due to the small amplitudes of the Ca2+-dependent currents, the background current contributed significantly and slightly shifted the reversal potential. Therefore, the current recorded in 0 Ca2+ was subtracted from the currents measured in Ca2+-containing solutions. The results showed that SK2-L channels have a Ca2+ sensitivity similar to that of SK2-S (KD = 0.64 ± 0.09 μm, Hill coefficient = 1.35 ± 0.03, n = 3; Fig. 5B). The Hill coefficient for SK2-L is less than for SK2-S (>4 (21Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), but this likely reflects the difficulties presented by the very small currents. The inconsistency between whole-cell and patch current amplitudes suggested that SK2-L might be non-uniformly distributed in the membrane, different from SK2-S (18Lee W.S. Ngo-Anh T.J. Bruening-Wright A. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25940-25946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, COS cells expressing either form of SK2 harboring an external myc epitope tag (18Lee W.S. Ngo-Anh T.J. Bruening-Wright A. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25940-25946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were examined for surface expression by α-myc immunohistochemical staining of live cells. The results showed that in contrast to the more uniform and diffuse distribution of SK2-S, SK2-L surface staining was strikingly punctate (Fig. 6). The heterologous co-expression results presented above did not distinguish between heteromeric or separate homomeric channel populations. To determine whether SK2-L co-assembles with the other SK subunits, α-SK2-L immunoprecipitations were performed. SK2-L was co-expressed in COS cells with SK1, SK2-S, or SK3, each harboring an N-terminal C8 epitope tag. Control experiments were performed by individually transfecting the C8-tagged SK1, SK2-S, and SK3 into COS cells. Prior to α-SK2-L immunoprecipitation, the lysates from these individually transfected cells were combined with an equal amount of lysate from cells transfected with only SK2-L. The Western blot presented in Fig. 7A shows equivalent expression levels of the C8-tagged channels in lysates from co-transfected (lanes 1–3) or individually transfected (lanes 4–6) cells. A monoclonal antibody directed to the C8 tag was used to assess co-immunoprecipitation. SK1, SK2-S, and SK3 were co-immunoprecipitated with the α-SK2-L antibody only in the co-transfected cells and not in the control conditions (Fig. 7B). Taken together, the results suggest that SK2-L subunits co-assemble into heteromeric channels with the other SK subunits. To address whether SK2-L exists in heteromeric channels in brain, immunoprecipitations were performed with the α-SK2-L antibody. Brain extracts from SK2-null mice served as controls. The results showed that SK2-S and SK3, as well as calmodulin, co-immunoprecipitate with SK2-L from wild type brain membranes but not from membranes prepared from SK2-null mice (Fig. 8). SK2 appears to form aggregates under denaturing conditions; note the high molecular weight species in the eluate from wild type but not SK2Δ/Δ mouse brains. Therefore, the intensity of the SK2-S monomer may represent an underestimate of the amount of SK2-S that co-precipitates with SK2-L. The interaction between SK2-L and SK1 in brain could not be assessed, as SK1-specific antisera capable of detecting SK1 in brain membrane preparations are not yet available. Immunoprecipitations from brain membranes using the pan α-SK2-C also showed co-immunoprecipitation of SK3 and CaM (data not shown). The results show that the SK2 gene gives rise to two proteins that differ in the intracellular N-terminal domain. SK2-L maximally extends the open reading frame by 275 amino acids. It is not yet clear how the two proteins are generated from the SK2 gene. Two SK2 transcript species of ∼2.5 kb are detected on Northern blots prepared from mouse brain RNA (6Köhler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Even if the most 3′ of the additional start codons is used (indicated in Fig. 2C) for translational initiation of SK2-L, the SK2-L mRNA must be longer than the species so far detected by Northern blots. Probing Northern blots prepared with mouse brain total or poly(A)+ RNA with the exon C (see Fig. 2C) sequence failed to detect specific transcripts; the same blots probed with exon 8 sequences that encode the distal portion of the SK2 protein, present in both SK2-S and SK2-L, detected only the ∼2.5-kb bands. Therefore, SK2-L mRNA is expressed at significantly lower levels than SK2-S mRNA. It is also possible that SK2-L mRNA undergoes rapid turnover, reflected as low steady-state levels. Further analysis will determine the contributions of distinct SK2 promoters or alternative splicing to the genesis of the different mRNA forms. The extended sequence unique to SK2-L contains an SH3-binding site as well as a potential MAP kinase substrate and several serine and threonine residues that may also serve as targets for phosphorylation. It also contains a motif with a core sequence of CXXC that has homology to regions in enzymes that transfer sulfur-containing moieties to metabolites, MoeZ and MoeB. The N-terminal extension of SK2-L described here is similar in length and shows some sequence homology with the N-terminal domain of SK3 (Fig. 2C; Ref. 22.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Although SK2-L and SK3 share homology in this N-terminal region, an isoform of SK3 analogous to SK2-S is not detected in brain by an antibody directed to the C terminus of SK3 (8Sailer C.A. Kaufmann W.A. Marksteiner J. Knaus H.G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 23Bond C.T. Sprengel R. Bissonnette J.M. Kaufmann W.A. Pribnow D.

As shown above, an SK2 antibody directed to the intracellular C-terminal domain recognizes two SK2 species in mouse brain. Taken together the results suggest that the SK2 and SK3 genes give rise to analogous long forms of the proteins, but expression of a shorter form appears to be unique to SK2. In these studies, the comparison of immunoblots from wild type and SK2 null mice probed with a commercially available α-SK2 antibody revealed that this antibody recognizes three nonspecific bands in mouse brain extracts. In several other studies this antibody has been used to analyze the distribution and regulation of SK2 (24Jager H. Adelman J.P. Grissmer S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Kramar E.A. Lin B. Lin C.Y. Arai A.C. Gall C.M. Lynch G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5151-5161Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and the conclusions may, therefore, have to be re-evaluated. The distinct roles of the two SK2 isoforms in the central nervous system have yet to be determined. The distribution of immunoreactivity in brain slices using antibodies that detect either both forms or only SK2-L reveal only subtle differences in expression profile. Although limited by the inability to generate an antibody that specifically recognizes the short form of SK2, it appears that SK2-L is widely expressed in the brain. The relative abundance of SK2-L versus SK2-S is difficult to assess, although the results indicate qualitatively lower abundance for SK2-L. SK2-L subunits co-assemble in brain with SK2-S and SK3 subunits. The lack of SK1-specific antibodies capable of detecting native SK1 protein in brain membrane preparations precludes an analysis of interaction between SK2-L and SK1 in vivo, but results from heterologous co-expression experiments suggest that native SK2-L and SK1 may also co-assemble. The migration of SK2-L under non-reducing denaturing conditions further suggests that SK2-L exists in a macromolecular complex held together by disulfide bonds. Alternatively, the altered migration may be due to disulfide bond formation that occurs during membrane preparation, which argues for the close proximity of other free cysteine residues on adjacent subunits or on tightly associated heterologous proteins. Indeed, the extended N-terminal domain of SK2-L contains two cysteine-rich islands. The cysteine residues in these regions may contribute to subunit-subunit interactions or mediate interactions with heterologous components of SK2 channel-containing complexes. In heterologous expression studies, there was a trend suggesting that SK2-L whole-cell current amplitudes were smaller than those for SK2-S, although the differences did not reach significance. In contrast, SK2-L currents in excised patches were much smaller than those recorded for SK2-S. The small current amplitudes compromised the ability to obtain a detailed comparison of Ca2+ sensitivity with SK2-S. However, there did not appear to be significant differences, as expected from the complete conservation of the core and intracellular domains of the two subunits. The low levels of patch currents were reflected by a marked difference in the surface distribution of SK2-L and SK2-S, as SK2-L was distributed to distinct puncta, while SK2-S had a diffuse surface distribution. The punctate distribution is likely due to functions endowed by the unique extended N-terminal domain that may cause aggregation and partitioning for homomeric SK2-L as well as affect trafficking. Immunoprecipitations from co-expressing COS cells and from brain show that SK2-L can co-assemble with other SK subunits. In this regard, the majority of SK2-L expressed in COS cells is, unlike native SK2-L, unaffected by oxidation/reduction conditions on SDS-PAGE which might reflect the absence or low abundance of a heterologous protein partner for SK2-L. It is possible that the extended N-terminal domain of SK2-L may direct subcellular distribution and incorporation of SK channels into heteromeric complexes."

To study signaling pathways affecting GADD45β expression and to examine systematically in vivo the GADD45β expression in tissues following various toxic stresses, we created a transgenic mouse by fusing the GADD45β promoter to firefly luciferase (Gadd45β-luc). In vivo GADD45β expression was assessed by measuring the luciferase activity in the Gadd45β-luc transgenic mouse using a non-invasive imaging system (IVIS® Imaging System, Xenogen Corporation). We found that a number of agents that induce oxidative stress, such as sodium arsenite, CCl4, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or tumor necrosis factor-α, are able to induce luciferase expression throughout the entire animal. In liver, spleen, lung, intestine, kidney, and heart, we observed an induction of luciferase activity after LPS treatment, which correlates with an increase of GADD45β mRNA in these tissues. Processes that induce DNA damage activate the NF-κB signaling pathway. Several inhibitors of the NF-κB signaling pathway, including dexamethasone, thalidomide, and a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, showed inhibitory effects on LPS-induced GADD45β expression as indicated by a decrease of the luciferase activity. Northern blot analysis confirmed a broad inhibitory effect of bortezomib on LPS-induced GADD45β mRNA expression in spleen, lung, and intestine. In liver of bortezomib-treated mice, we observed a reverse correlation between the luciferase activity and the GADD45β mRNA level. We speculate that such a discrepancy could be due to severe liver toxicity caused by bortezomib and LPS co-treatment. MAPK inhibitors had transient and inconsistent effects on LPS-induced luciferase expression. Our data are consistent with the notion that NF-κB, but not the MAPK signaling pathways, is involved in the in vivo regulation of GADD45β expression. Thus, NF-κB signaling involves induction of GADD45β expression, which supports the proposed role of GADD45β in protecting cells against DNA damaged under various stress conditions.

In addition, GADD45 family proteins associate with CDK1 (Cdc2-p34) and inhibit the kinase activity of the CDK1-cyclinB1 complex, which mediate the G2/M cell cycle arrest in response to genotoxic stress (5Zhan Q.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In non-stimulated cells, NF-κB proteins are present in the cytoplasm in association with NF-κB-specific inhibitors, such as IκBs (10Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5551) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by extracellular inducers, such as TNF-α or interleukin-1β, the IκBs become phosphorylated by IκB kinase complexes and degraded by the proteasome. IκB degradation allows NF-κB to translocate into nuclei and activate the transcription of target genes (11Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 975Crossref Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB antagonizes apoptosis or programmed cell death by numerous triggers. Analysis of the GADD45 gene suggests that NF-κB may play a role in regulating GADD45 expression (12Balliet A.G. Hattonm K.S. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A.

This was later confirmed in a study showing that κB elements of the GADD45β promoter are required for optimal transactivation of GADD45β promoter activity by NF-κB complexes in vitro (13Jin R.

To investigate the regulation of GADD45β gene expression in vivo, we developed a transgenic mouse line using the murine GADD45β promoter to direct the expression of a firefly luciferase gene. In conjunction with a highly sensitive IVIS Imaging System, we have applied this model to monitor GADD45β expression non-invasively. The results suggest that the Gadd45β-luc transgenic mouse provides a convenient and sensitive in vivo assay for studying GADD45β expression in different tissues and for studying the involvement of various signaling pathways in the regulation of GADD45β expression after treatments that lead to inflammatory and toxic stresses. Construction of pGadd45β-luc Vector and Generation of Gadd45β-luc Transgenic Mice—A mouse BAC clone containing the mouse GADD45β gene was isolated from a CT7 mouse BAC library (Invitrogen). A 10.5-kb promoter fragment containing sequences 5′ to the first ATG for mouse GADD45β gene was obtained by the recombineering cloning method (22Lee E.C. Yu D. Martinez de Velasco J. Tessarollo L. Swing D.A. Court D.L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genomics. 2001; 73: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar) and cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). A 0.8-kb human β-globin intron 2 was placed between the GADD45β promoter and the luciferase gene to optimize the luciferase expression in transgenic mice. The transgene cassette was separated from the vector backbone sequences and used for pronuclear injection into CD-1 mouse strain embryos. The transgenic model described in this paper is named CD1-Tg-(Gadd45β-luc)Xen. Reagents—We purchased bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, from Salmonella abortus equi) dexamethasone, thalidomide, PD098580, sodium arsenite, and carbon tetrachloride from Sigma, recombinant TNF-α from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), Bortezomib (VALCADE, PS-341) from Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Cambridge, MA), SB203580 from EMD Biosciences, Inc (La Jolla, CA), and SP600125 from A.G. Scientific, Inc (San Diego, CA). In Vivo Imaging of Luciferase Activity—In vivo imaging was performed using an IVIS Imaging System 100 Series as previously described (23Contag P.R. Olomu I.N. Stevenson D.K. Contag C.H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Gadd45β-luc transgenic mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and injected intraperitoneally with 150 mg/kg luciferin (Biosynth, A.G., Switzerland). 10 min after the luciferin injection, mice were imaged for 1–60 s. Photons emitted from specific regions were quantified using Living Image® software (Xenogen Corporation). In vivo luciferase activity is expressed as photons/second/cm2. Study of in Vivo GADD45β Gene Regulation Using Gadd45β-luc Transgenic Animals—Gadd45β-luc transgenic mice of 3–6 months of age were intraperitoneally injected with sodium arsenite (1 mg/kg), carbon tetrachloride (0.5 ml/kg), LPS (1 mg/kg), or TNF-α (2 μg/mouse). Control mice were injected with saline. At selected time points after the treatment, mice were intraperitoneally injected with luciferin and imaged 10 min later with the IVIS Imaging System as described above. To test the effect of various compounds on LPS-triggered Gadd45β-luc expression, mice were pretreated with bortezomib (1 mg/kg, intravenous), dexamethasone (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), thalidomide (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), PD098059 (10 mg/kg, intravenous), SP600125 (20 mg/kg, intravenous), or SB203580 (5 mg/kg, intravenous) 1 h prior to the LPS injection (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and the luciferase activity was monitored through imaging at various time points over a 24-h period. For analysis of MAPK activity, a total of 50 μg of liver lysate was loaded onto SDS/PAGE gels. After transfer, the membrane was probed with one of several anti-MAPK antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocols. The MAPK antibodies used in this study include anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) antibody, anti-p38 MAPK antibody, anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody, anti-p44/42 MAPK antibody, anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) antibody, and anti-SAPK/JNK antibody. All of the MAPK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). The liver lysate was prepared from untreated control mice or LPS-treated mice sacrificed at 4 h after LPS injection (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or LPS-treated mice that were pretreated with one of the MAPK inhibitors (dosed as above) and sacrificed at 4 h after the LPS injection. Tissue Luciferase Activity—Selected mouse organs were removed and homogenized in 3 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected. Luciferase activity was assayed using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Design, Sunnyvale, CA). Protein concentration was estimated with Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). Western Blot Analysis of IκBα Protein Expression—A total of 10 μg of protein was loaded onto SDS/PAGE gels. After transfer, the membrane was probed with a specific anti-IκBα antibody (mouse monoclonal IgG1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The blots were developed using the ECL+ Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA were isolated from mouse tissue using RNAwiz (Ambion, Austin, TX) and further purified using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). A total of 2 μg of RNA was analyzed by Northern blot using a NorthernMax system (Ambion). A 332-nucleotide GADD45β cDNA fragment was amplified (forward primer: 5′-GCTCTAGACCCTCATCCCCCAGAACAATC-3′; reverse primer: 5′-CGGAATTCGCCCTCCGCTGACTTATG-3′) and cloned into the pBlueScript SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that was linearized with XbaI and EcoRI. Single strand antisense GADD45β RNA probe was prepared by transcription with T7 polymerase using a Strip-EZ kit (Ambion). After hybridization, the signal was detected using a Bright-Star BioDetect kit (Ambion). Statistics—Non-parametric tests for significance were used to test whether changes in luciferase signal from base line were significantly greater than zero (sign test) and whether the changes from base line were significantly different between treatment groups (Mann-Whitney test). Values are presented as means ± 1 S.E. in the graphs and text unless otherwise noted. For some statistical tests, genders were combined to increase sample number in each group. All significance levels are two-sided. Induction of GADD45β Expression by DNA-damaging Agents—We generated Gadd45β-luc transgenic founder lines whose progeny were screened for the luciferase signal in response to LPS as described under “Materials and Methods.” All of the founder lines showed inducible luciferase expression throughout the entire body. One transgenic line, Gadd45β-luc line 81, was selected for studies described in this report. There was high basal activity of the luciferase reporter throughout the body (Fig. 1A). Treatment of the Gadd45β-luc transgenic mice with sodium arsenite or carbon tetrachloride induced luciferase expression, as demonstrated by bioluminescent images (Fig. 1A). Induction of luciferase expression by sodium arsenite occurred transiently in the whole body. The luciferase induction was evident at 7 h and declined rapidly to base-line value by 24 h. Treatment with carbon tetrachloride, however, caused a more prolonged induction of the luciferase signal, predominantly in the hepatic and abdominal regions. Quantification of the luciferase signal is shown in Fig. 1B. Luciferase signals from the hepatic region and the entire body were induced 2–3-fold by sodium arsenite and carbon tetrachloride. The increase in signal expression was greater with sodium arsenite than carbon tetrachloride after 7 h for both total body and hepatic region signal, whereas the signal was greater in mice treated with carbon tetrachloride than sodium arsenite at 24 and 72 h. Induction of GADD45β Expression by LPS and TNF-α—Gadd45β-luc mice were treated with either LPS or TNF-α. Measurement of the luciferase signal by imaging revealed luciferase signal induction following both treatments (Fig. 2A). The induction occurred in the whole body with high induction in the hepatic region. Luciferase induction peaked 4–7 h after the treatment and was detectable as early as 2 h after the LPS treatment. The signal was reduced sharply by 24 h. Control mice that were injected with saline did not show any induction (results not shown). Another Gadd45β-luc transgenic line (line 96) showed similar basal luciferase expression and response to LPS treatment (Fig. 2B). Luciferase signal from the hepatic region of the LPS-treated mice was quantified using the IVIS software to produce the data shown in Fig. 3A (upper panel). Female mice had higher mean luciferase signals at base line than males. Both male and female mice showed significant luciferase induction (p < 0.05) at 2, 4, 7, and 24 h after LPS treatment as compared with base line (t = 0 h). Between the sexes, the fold increase in the luciferase signal after LPS treatment was similar, with a peak of induction observed at 4–7 h (Fig. 3A, right top panel). At the peak, the luciferase signal was induced ∼15-fold over base-line levels in both sexes. By 24 h, the luciferase signal declined to 3-fold above the base line. Fig. 3A, bottom panels, displays the kinetics of Gadd45β-luc induction in the hepatic region in mice treated with TNF-α. The luciferase signal was readily detectable at 4 h after TNF-α injection, and the signal remained steady until 7 h. By 24 h, the signal declined to the base line. In both sexes, the luciferase signal was induced 8–11-fold at 4–7 h after the TNF-α injection, which represented a significant increase (p < 0.05) from the base line (t = 0 h). In separate experiments, we found that mice ranging in age from 2 to 7 months responded in a similar fashion to LPS (data not shown). A similar result was obtained with Gadd45β-luc line 96. As shown in Fig. 3B, mice treated with LPS showed a transient luciferase induction at 4–7 h with a calculated fold of induction between 12- and 16-fold compared with base line (t = 0 h). Dexamethasone and Thalidomide Inhibited GADD45β Induction by LPS—We studied the effects of dexamethasone (DEX) and thalidomide on the GADD45β induction by LPS. Gadd45β-luc mice were pretreated with DEX (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or thalidomide (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) 1 h before LPS injection. In comparison to the Gadd45β-luc mice that were treated with LPS alone, mice co-treated with either DEX or thalidomide showed significant less luciferase induction (Fig. 4). The inhibition was evident in the hepatic region only. Quantification of the luciferase induction over 24 h after the treatment is shown in Fig. 5. Pretreatment with either DEX or thalidomide caused approximate a 50% inhibition of the hepatic luciferase signal in both males and females when compared with the LPS-treated positive control mice.Fig. 5Luciferase activity over time is expressed as photons/second/cm2 (left panel) and as multiples of the base-line activity (right panel). Values are mean ± S.E. or fold increase ± S.E. In the top panels of the figure, saline (control) or DEX-pretreated male (n = 3) and female (n = 6) Gadd45β-luc mice were injected with LPS and luciferase signals were measured at 0, 4, 7, and 24 h after LPS injection. In the lower panel of the figure, Me2SO (DMSO) (control) or thalidomide-pretreated male (n = 3) and female (n = 6) Gadd45β-luc mice were injected with LPS and luciferase signals were measured at 0, 4, 7, and 24 h after LPS injection. Significance at each time point reflects the difference between control (LPS) and drug treatment (DEX + LPS or thalidomide + LPS) groups.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of the MAPK Inhibitors on GADD45β Induction by LPS—We studied the effect of three MAPK inhibitors, PD098059, SB203580, and SP600125, on LPS-induced GADD45β expression. These inhibitors have been shown to inhibit ERK, p38, and JNK MAPK signaling pathways, respectively. The bioluminescent imaging data and the quantification of the luciferase signal from the hepatic region are shown in Fig. 6, A and B, respectively. PD098059 did not have any significant affect on LPS-induced luciferase expression in the hepatic region. Both SP600125 and SB203580 showed significant inhibitory effects at 4 h (p = 0.05), but not at 2 or 7 h, on luciferase induction when compared with LPS-treated control mice (Fig. 6, A and B). Ex vivo measurement of the luciferase activity from the liver lysate failed to show any significant effect by SB203580 (p = 0.13) or PD098059 (p = 0.28) or SP600125 (p = 0.51) on LPS-induced luciferase activity in the liver tissue harvested 4 h after LPS treatment (Fig. 6C). We next analyzed the MAPK activation using specific antibodies against phosphorylated p38, ERK (p44/42), or SAPK/JNK MAPK. As shown in Fig. 6D, p38 MAPK was already activated in the liver tissue of the control mice. This activity was not regulated by either LPS or SB203580 treatment (top panel). The ERK MAPK activity is also present in the liver tissue of control mice at variable levels. There was no consistent induction of ERK protein phosphorylation by LPS or inhibition by the specific inhibitor PD098059 (middle panel). The SAPK/JNK MAPK activity was not detectable in the control liver tissue. This activity was induced by LPS, and the induction was totally inhibited by the inhibitor SP600125. Bortezomib Inhibited LPS-induced GADD45β Expression— Using the Gadd45β-luc model, we tested the effect of a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, on LPS-induced GADD45β expression in vivo. Bortezomib suppressed IκB degradation by the proteasome, thus inhibiting NF-κB transcriptional activity. Gadd45β-luc mice were pretreated with bortezomib (1 mg/kg, intravenous) 1 h before LPS treatment, and the bioluminescent images are presented in Fig. 7A. In both males and females, we observed a significant inhibition of LPS-induced luciferase expression by bortezomib in the whole body. The most dramatic inhibition occurred in the hepatic region. Quantification of the signal from the hepatic region is shown in Fig. 7B. Inhibition of LPS-induced luciferase activity by bortezomib was observed at 2 (p = 0.02), 4, and 7 h (p = 0.004 in males; p = 0.02 in females at all time points). The calculated fold of increase from the base line is shown in Fig. 7C. At the peak induction of 4–7 h, the LPS-treated mice had 14–17-fold increase of luciferase signal from the base line, whereas the bortezomib co-treated mice had 0.2–2-fold induction. Bortezomib-treated mice of both genders appeared ill within 24 h following LPS treatment. All of the female mice and most of the male mice did not survive by 24 h after bortezomib and LPS co-treatment. Analysis of Tissue Luciferase Activity and GADD45β mRNA Expression—Table I displays the luciferase activity in selected organs in Gadd45β-luc mice. In saline-treated control mice, ex vivo luciferase activity was detected in the all of the dissected organs. Both male and female controls showed a similar pattern of luciferase expression in these tissues. The luciferase activity of controls was the highest in brain, spleen, and lung and lowest in intestine and intermediate in liver, heart, and kidney. 4 h following LPS injection, luciferase activity was induced in all of the examined organs, except in the brain. In the LPS-treated mice, the luciferase activity was the highest in liver, spleen, and lung, lowest in the brain, and intermediate in intestine, heart, and kidney. With the exception of the brain, LPS-treatment significantly increased luciferase expression in all of the tissues in both male (p = 0.006) and female (p = 0.05) mice. Again, male and female LPS-treated mice showed a similar pattern of increased luciferase expression across all of the organs examined. As calculated from the mean ± S.D. of the saline-injected mice, LPS treatment in male and female mice caused luciferase induction of 60- and 29-fold, respectively, in the liver, 20- and 15-fold in the spleen, 45- and 66-fold in the small intestines, 7- and 6-fold in the heart, 15- and 15-fold in the kidney, and 9- and 10-fold in the lung.Table IEx vivo luciferase expression (unit/μg protein) in selected organs from Gadd45β-luc mice All of the mice were sacrificed at 4 h post-intraperitoneal injection with either saline (control) or LPS (1 mg/kg). The effect of bortezomib on LPS-induced Gadd45β-luc expression was analyzed after pretreating the mice with bortezomib (1 mg/kg, intravenous) 1 h prior to the LPS treatment.Mean ± S.E.ControlLPSBortezomibMaleFemaleMaleFemaleMaleFemaleLiver19.0 ± 5.527.2 ± 1.51139.2 ± 103.5aSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.006803.0 ± 60.1bSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.05242.1 ± 51.6aSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.006,cSignificantly difference from LPS-treated mice at p = 0.004135.3 ± 24.9bSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.05,dSignificantly difference from LPS-treated mice at p = 0.05Brain106.9 ± 25.365.9 ± 3.6108.0 ± 20.281.0 ± 25.5125.7 ± 20.4108.0 ± 6.8bSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.05Spleen61.9 ± 12.160.9 ± 3.21255.0 ± 300.5aSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.006885.8 ± 133.4bSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.05546.6 ± 74.9aSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.006,dSignificantly difference from LPS-treated mice at p = 0.05419.6 ± 87.6bSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.05,dSignificantly difference from LPS-treated mice at p = 0.05Small intestine8.7 ± 4.12.3 ± 0.7394.5 ± 149.2aSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.006149.0 ± 21.5bSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.05127.6 ± 39.2eSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.00994.7 ± 9.5bSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.05Heart21.8 ± 6.721.6 ± 1.8160.3 ± 35.6aSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.006129.0 ± 7.1bSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.0591.4 ± 12.0aSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.00677.7 ± 11.0bSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.05,dSignificantly difference from LPS-treated mice at p = 0.05Kidney15.1 ± 2.022.7 ± 1.4234.1 ± 29.8aSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.006343.2 ± 26.1bSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.05113.8 ± 21.6aSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.006,fSignificantly difference from LPS-treated mice at p = 0.01248.0 ± 45.7bSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.05Lung85.8 ± 30.845.9 ± 3.5753.4 ± 121.0aSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.006480.1 ± 101.3bSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.05220.7 ± 15.8cSignificantly difference from LPS-treated mice at p = 0.004,gSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.03201.8 ± 15.6bSignificantly difference from controls at p = 0.05,dSignificantly difference from LPS-treated mice at p = 0.05a Significantly difference from controls at p = 0.006b Significantly difference from controls at p = 0.05c Significantly difference from LPS-treated mice at p = 0.004d Significantly difference from LPS-treated mice at p = 0.05e Significantly difference from controls at p = 0.009f Significantly difference from LPS-treated mice at p = 0.01g Significantly difference from controls at p = 0.03 Open table in a new tab We examined the effect of bortezomib on the LPS-induced GADD45β expression in selected tissues. Gadd45β-luc mice were pretreated with bortezomib (1 mg/kg, intravenous) 1 h before LPS treatment. Selected organs were removed at 4 h after the LPS treatment and processed for luciferase activity. The data are presented in Table I. In comparison with LPS-treated mice, mice pretreated with bortezomib showed significant inhibition of luciferase induction in liver, spleen, and lung in both males and females (p < 0.05). In kidney and heart, the inhibition was observed in both genders but this was statistically significant in heart only in females (p = 0.05) and in kidney in males (p = 0.01). In intestine and brain, bortezomib did not significantly affect the LPS-induced luciferase activity. When compared with luciferase activity in the organs of the LPS-treated mice, bortezomib treatment caused an 80% inhibition of luciferase activity in the liver and a 30–70% inhibition of luciferase activity in all of the rest of the non-brain tissues. We further attempted to establish the correlation between the luciferase activity and the GADD45β mRNA expression in selected tissues harvested from female Gadd45β-luc mice (Fig. 7D). In untreated control mice, GADD45β mRNA expression was detectable in lung and brain only, which are also among the organs that expressed the highest luciferase activity. Following LPS treatment, we observed an induction of GADD45β mRNA expression in all of the tissues examined. Lung, kidney, and spleen had the highest GADD45β mRNA expression compared with other tissues that correlated with the luciferase activity in these tissues. However, in the liver, LPS only slightly increased GADD45β mRNA level. Pretreatment with bortezomib inhibited the induction of GADD45β mRNA by LPS in spleen, intestine, and lung. Bortezomib did not affect LPS-induced GADD45β mRNA expression in kidney. These results are in agreement with the luciferase activity measurements shown in Table I. Unexpectedly, we observed an increase of GADD45β mRNA level in the bortezomib pretreated liver in comparison with LPS-treated liver, even though the luciferase activity was inhibited by bortezomib. The Regulation of GADD45β Expression by LPS and Bortezomib Correlates with Change of IκBα Protein Level in Multiple Tissues—To provide further evidence that the NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of GADD45β expression, we analyzed the IκBα protein level by Western blot analysis in various tissues of control and LPS-treated mice with and without bortezomib pretreatment. Basal levels of IκBα protein were observed in all of the tissues examined (Fig. 8). After LPS treatment, IκBα protein level was decreased in all of the tissues, which corresponds with previous reports that LPS treatment causes degradation of IκBα protein. Pretreatment with bortezomib increased IκBα protein in spleen, liver, lung, intestine, and brain compared with the tissues of LPS-treated mice; supporting the hypothesis that bortezomib suppressed GADD45β expression by inhibiting IκB degradation and NF-κB activation. In kidney and heart, bortezomib did not inhibit LPS-induced IκBα protein degradation. The effect of LPS and bortezomib on IκBα protein level is largely matched with the regulation of GADD45β-mediated luciferase activity in all of the tissues examined. The regulation of IκBα protein level and GADD45β-luc expression by LPS and bortezomib support the involvement of the NF-κB signaling pathway in the regulation of GADD45β expression. In this study, we used a Gadd45β-luc transgenic mouse model to study the expression and regulation of the GADD45β gene in vivo under a variety of stress conditions. The luciferase activity was the highest in lung and brain of untreated mice, which matches the higher level of GADD45β mRNA expression in these tissues. After LPS treatment, we observed an induction of GADD45β mRNA expression in all of the tissues examined, which is indicated by an increase of luciferase activity in all of the tissues, except the brain. Our data support the involvement of NK-κB signaling in the regulation of GADD45β induction by LPS. This conclusion is supported by the observation that LPS-treated mice had less IκBα protein in various tissues compared with the control tissues. In addition, compounds that have been demonstrated to inhibit NF-κB including dexamethasone (24Spiecker M. Darius H. Liao J.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3316-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and thalidomide (25Keifer J.A. Guttridge D.C. Ashburner B.P. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22382-22387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) suppressed the luciferase induction by LPS. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that suppresses the degradation of IκB and the transcriptional activity by the NF-κB complex (26Tan C. Waldmann T.A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1083-1086PubMed Google Scholar). Bortezomib has efficacy against a broad range of tumors, including myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colon cancer (27Adams J. Kauffman M. Cancer Investig. 2004; 22: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In the analysis of GADD45β mRNA expression in various tissues from bortezomib and LPS co-treated mice, we observed a divergent effect of bortezomib on LPS-induced GADD45β mRNA expression. LPS-induced GADD45β mRNA expression was inhibited in spleen, lung, and intestine, increased in liver, and unaffected in kidney and brain by bortezomib. These differences could be due to the variation in the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib in these tissues. The inhibition of LPS-induced GADD45β mRNA expression in spleen, lung, and intestine by bortezomib certainly correlated with a decrease of luciferase activity in these tissues. The increase of IκBα protein level in spleen, lung, and intestine of bortezomib-pretreated mice compared with mice treated with LPS alone support that the suppression of GADD45β expression is mediated through inhibition of NF-κB activity. In addition, bortezomib did not inhibit LPS-induced GADD45β mRNA expression in kidney, which is consistent with both the lack of inhibition of the luciferase activity as well as the lack of regulation of IκBα protein level by bortezomib. In the liver tissue, we observed an increase of GADD45β mRNA level in the bortezomib pretreated mice compared with mice treated with LPS alone. This contradicts the observation that bortezomib inhibits LPS-induced luciferase activity in the liver. This discrepancy could be due to severe liver toxicity caused by bortezomib and LPS co-treatment. In fact, all of the female mice and more than half of the male mice did not survive for 24 h after bortezomib and LPS co-treatment. Under such a severe toxic condition, the luciferase reporter failed to represent the endogenous gene expression. Furthermore, the increase of GADD45β mRNA level in the liver of bortezomib pretreated mice suggested that an NF-κB-independent mechanism might exist for the induction, because the liver IκBα protein level was higher in these mice compared with the liver tissue of the LPS-treated mice. Involvement of the MAPK signaling pathway is implicated for the regulation of GADD45α expression (21Tong T. Fan W. Zhao H. Jin S. Fan F. Blanck P. Alomo I. Rajasekaran B. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Zhan Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 269: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, whether the MAPK signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of GADD45β expression has not been extensively studied. Using the Gadd45β-luc mice, we demonstrated that LPS treatment that induced GADD45β expression and luciferase expression in the liver did not affect ERK (p44/p42) or p38 phosphorylation. Treatment of the mice with specific inhibitor PD098059 did not affect the basal ERK (p44/p42) activity or the LPS-induced luciferase activity, indicating that the ERK (p44/p42) MAPK was not involved in the regulation of GADD45β expression. Treatment of the mice with the specific inhibitor SB203580 failed to demonstrate any consistent effect on LPS-induced luciferase activity. Further analysis showed that SB203580-treated mouse liver tissue had a similar level of p38 kinase activity compared with the control or LPS-treated mouse liver tissues. Thus, p38 was not involved in the regulation of GADD45β expression either. The SAPK/JNK activity in the liver tissue of control mice was undetectable. After LPS treatment, we detected an induction of the SAPK/JNK activity, which was totally blocked by the specific inhibitor SP600125. The regulation of SAPK/JNK activity did not consistently affect GADD45β promoter-mediated luciferase expression, thus ruling out the involvement of the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway in the regulation of the GADD45β expression. Our data do not support a significant role of the any of the MAPK signaling pathways in the regulation of GADD45β induction by LPS. Arsenic and CCl4 have been commonly used as stress-inducing agents in animal models. Exposing animals to these chemicals induces carcinogenicity in various organs due to the genotoxic effect of these compounds (28Gebel T. Toxicology. 2000; 144: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 29Weber L.W. Boll M. Stampfl A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2003; 33: 105-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). In the Gadd45β-luc mice, the toxicity caused by these compounds, as well as by other inflammatory stress-inducing agents such as LPS and TNFα, can be monitored through the induction of luciferase activity. Induction of luciferase activity in the whole body by these agents suggests that toxicity occurred systemically after treatment. Thus, Gadd45β-luc mice may be a useful toxicity model. The utility of this model could be expanded to chronic disease conditions, such as tumor development. In summary, we have established a Gadd45β-luc transgenic mouse model and successfully applied it to study in vivo expression and regulation of the GADD45β gene. Luciferase expression in the Gadd45β-luc mice may serve as a sensor for non-invasively detecting oxidative stress and DNA damage in live animals. Further validation of toxicology applications may enable the Gadd45β-luc mice to become a convenient tool for accessing in vivo risk to xenobiotic exposure and for predicting development of disease.

The protein consists of the basic helix-loop-helix domain and two heme-containing PAS domains (PAS-A and PAS-B). In this study, we prepared wild type and mutants of the isolated PAS-A domain and measured resonance Raman spectra of these proteins. Upon excitation of the Raman spectrum at 363.8 nm, a band assignable to Fe3+-S stretching was observed at 334 cm–1 for the ferric wild type protein; in contrast, this band was drastically weaker in the spectrum of C170A, suggesting that Cys170 is an axial ligand of the ferric heme. The Raman spectrum of the reduced form of wild type was mainly of six-coordinate low spin, and the ν11 band, which is sensitive to the donor strength of the axial ligand, was lower than that of reduced cytochrome c3, suggesting coordination of a strong ligand and thus a deprotonated His. In the reduced forms of H119A and H171A, the five-coordinate species became more prevalent, whereas no such changes were observed for C170A, indicating that His119 and His171, but not Cys170, are axial ligands in the ferrous heme. This means that ligand replacement from Cys to His occurs upon heme reduction. The νFe-CO versus νC-O correlation indicates that a neutral His is a trans ligand of CO. Our results support a mechanism in which CO binding disrupts the hydrogen bonding of His171 with surrounding amino acids, which induces conformational changes in the His171-Cys170 moiety, leading to physiological signaling.

In recent years, a variety of heme-containing gas sensor proteins have been discovered in different species, from bacteria to mammals (1Rodgers K.R. Curr. Opin. Chem.

In these proteins, a change in the concentration of gas molecules such as NO, O2, or CO is detected by a heme group and transduced to the functional domain as a signal, leading to modulation of protein activity. The heme-based gas sensor proteins discovered so far are listed in Table I. NO is a signaling molecule involved in vasodilation and neuronal transmission (4Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 5Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H.

Upon binding of NO to sGC, the iron-histidine bond in the N-terminal region, the sole covalent linkage between the heme and protein, is cleaved. The bond cleavage induces conformational changes, resulting in a 400-fold increase in GC activity in the C-terminal region (6Stone J.R.

Heme-regulated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase (HRI) also forms a five-coordinated NO-heme complex via Fe-His bond cleavage, resulting in activation by NO (7Igarashi J. Sato A. Kitagawa T.

FixL is a heme-based oxygen sensor involved in the regulation of expression of nitrogen fixation genes in response to O2 concentration (8Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R.

Under low O2 concentrations, FixL is autophosphorylated at a histidine residue and transfers it to FixJ, whereas a high concentration of O2 suppresses kinase activity (8Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Ditta G.S.

Ec DOS is also an O2 (and/or redox) sensor protein identified in Escherichia coli that exhibits phosphodiesterase activity in an O2-dependent (and/or redox-dependent) manner (9Delgado-Nixon V.M.

CooA was the first CO sensor protein identified from a purple nonsulfur photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodospirillum rubrum (15Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

As illustrated schematically in Fig. 1, the protein consists of the N-terminal bHLH domain and two PAS domains (PAS-A and PAS-B), structural modules that are present in widespread components of signal transduction proteins from organisms in all kingdoms of life (20Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Johnson M.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 103-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Both PAS-A and PAS-B bind one heme, although the protein can work as a transcriptional activator without heme (18Dioum E.M. Rutter J. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 2002; 298: 2385-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The PAS domains of NPSA2 display significant sequence similarity to Clock. The bHLH, PAS-A, and PAS-B domains are 84, 69, and 90% identical, respectively, to the corresponding domains of Clock sequence (21King D.P. Zhao Y. Sangoram A.M. Wilsbacher L.D. Tanaka M. Antoch M.P.

Both NPAS2 and Clock form heterodimers with BMAL1 and activate the expression of per and cry genes, which are negative regulatory components of the circadian clock. NPAS2 performs the same function as Clock but is expressed in a different region of the body. Specifically, NPAS2 is expressed primarily in the forebrain (22Garcia J.A. Zhang D. Estill S.J.

Science. 2001; 293: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). DNA binding of NPAS2-BMAL1 is modulated by the concentration ratio of oxidized and reduced NAD. NAD(P)H enhances the DNA binding ability of NPAS2-BMAL1 by interacting with the bHLH domain, whereas NAD(P)+ inhibits DNA binding (26Rutter J. Reick M. Wu L.C. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 293: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CO molecules produced by heme oxygenase-2 also modulate DNA binding of NPAS2-BMAL1 in the presence of a heme bound to the PAS domains, as reported by Gilles-Gonzalez and Mc-Knight (18Dioum E.M. Rutter J. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 2002; 298: 2385-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). At low micromolar levels of CO, heme forms a complex with CO, resulting in inhibition of DNA binding of NPAS2. In this study, we perform a resonance Raman (RR) investigation of the PAS-A domain of mouse NPAS2 to elucidate the signal transduction mechanism induced by CO binding. Although CO binds to both the PAS-A and PAS-B domains, the CO association rate constant for the PAS-A domain is about 10-fold higher than that for the PAS-B domain (18Dioum E.M. Rutter J. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 2002; 298: 2385-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This indicates that CO initially binds to the PAS-A domain. Our data show that the heme in the PAS-A domain exists as a mixture of penta- and hexacoordinate forms in both ferric and ferrous states, consistent with absorption spectra (18Dioum E.M. Rutter J. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 2002; 298: 2385-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), and that axial ligand switching of heme between Cys170 and His171 occurs in a redox-dependent manner. Furthermore, our data indicated that the hydrogen bonding of the proximal histidine to surrounding amino acids is disrupted by CO binding. We discuss the CO-dependent signal transduction mechanism of NPAS2 in comparison with those of other heme-PAS sensor proteins. Materials—Mouse livers were obtained from C57BL/6 mice. The mRNA purification and reverse transcription-PCR kits were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at Nihon Gene Research Laboratory (Sendai, Japan). The cloning vector, pBluescript SK II(+), and an expression vector, pET28a(+), were purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan) and Novagen (Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. E. coli competent cells, XL1-blue (for cloning) and BL21 (for protein expression), were purchased from Novagen and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), respectively. Restriction and modifying enzymes for DNA recombination were obtained from Takara Bio Inc., Toyobo, New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA), and Nippon Roche (Tokyo, Japan). 13C18O and 13CO were acquired from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA). 54Fe-labeled heme was purchased from Frontier Scientific, Inc. (Logan, UT). Other chemicals were from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Construction of the Isolated PAS-A Domain of NPAS2—His-tagged expression plasmids of the isolated PAS-A domain of NPAS2 (containing amino acid residues 78–240) were generated by subcloning into the pET28a(+) expression vector. cDNA encoding the PAS-A domain was generated by reverse transcription-PCR using RNA isolated from mouse livers. The primers employed for reverse transcription-PCR are 5′-CGGGATCCCATATGTCATTCCTCAGTAACG-3′ and 5′-GCAAGCTTGTCGACTTATTCCTTTAAGAACTGC-3′. Primers for the 5′-ends contained BamHI and NdeI restriction sites, and those for 3′ ends contained SalI restriction sites for subcloning. PCR products were digested with BamHI and SalI and inserted in the corresponding sites of the cloning vector, pBluescript SK II(+). The clones obtained were confirmed by determination of the nucleotide sequence by Sanger's method using an automatic sequencer, DSQ-2000L (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). The pBluescript-PASA plasmid was digested with NdeI and SacI and subcloned into the E. coli expression vector, pET28a(+), which introduces a His6 tag at the N terminus of expressed proteins. To create mutants of the PAS-A domain, PCR-based mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene with pET28 containing wild type PAS-A as a template. The desired mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—The His-tagged PAS-A domain was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus harboring each expression vector. Protein expression was induced at A600 = 0.6 by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration of 50 μm). Cells were further incubated for 20–24 h after the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. E. coli cells expressing the PAS-A domain were suspended in buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Cells were crushed by pulsed sonication for 2 min (3 times with 2-min intervals) on ice using the ULTRASONIC DISRUPTOR UD-201 (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 35 min at 4 °C. Purification of the PAS-A domain using buffer without hemin resulted in a mixture of apo- and heme-bound proteins. To reconstitute PAS-A with hemin, a final concentration of 100 μm hemin was added to the crude cell extract after sonication and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Ammonium sulfate was added to the resulting mixture up to 70% saturation. The precipitate was collected and dissolved in buffer A. Next, the solution was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (4 × 20 cm) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The eluted solution was applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) pre-equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The column was washed sequentially with buffer B containing 20 mm and 50 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted with buffer B containing 100 mm imidazole. Protein fractions were pooled and concentrated. After concentration, purified proteins were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. To eliminate His tags, PAS-A was treated with thrombin. Undigested His tag protein was removed by passing through an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. Before analysis, the protein buffer was altered to 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) using a Sephadex G-25 column or a Bio-Gel P-6 column (Bio-Rad). Concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye binding method for protein (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and the pyridine hemochromogen method for heme. Resonance Raman Measurements—Static RR spectra were obtained with a single polychromator (SPEX750M; Jobin Yvon) equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector (Spec10:400BLN; Roper Scientific). The excitation wavelengths employed were 413.1 and 568.2 nm from a krypton ion laser (BeamLok 2060; Spectra Physics) and 363.8 nm from an argon ion laser (BeamLok 2080; Spectra Physics). The laser power at the sample point was adjusted to ∼5 milliwatts for air-oxidized and dithionite-reduced forms and to 0.1 milliwatts for the CO-bound form to prevent photodissociation. Raman shifts were calibrated with indene, CCl4, acetone, and an aqueous solution of ferrocyanide. The accuracy of the peak positions of well defined Raman bands was ±1 cm–1. Enzyme concentrations for RR experiments were about 20–50 μm in 100 mm Tris containing 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Time-resolved RR spectra were measured with two 7-ns pulsed lasers operating at 30 Hz. The light pulse (1064 nm) obtained from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (GCR-150; Spectra Physics) was converted to 435.7 nm by a 1.0-m-long Raman shifter containing 3.5 MPa H2 gas as a probe pulse. Raman-scattered light was dispersed with a 0.5-m Spex polychromator (SPEX500M; Jobin Yvon) and detected with a CCD (LN-1340PB-400LB; Roper Scientific). The pump beam (532 nm) was the second harmonic of an Nd:YAG laser (GCR-150; Spectra Physics). The delay time (Δt) between the probe pulse and pump pulse was controlled by a pulse generator (DG-535; Stanford Research). Soret-excited Resonance Raman Spectra of the PAS-A Domain—Fig. 2 depicts the RR spectra of ferric (A and D), ferrous (B and E), and CO-bound (C and F) PAS-A domains of NPAS2 at pH 8.0 in the low (left) and high (right) frequency regions. It is well established that the Raman spectra of heme proteins in the high frequency region comprise porphyrin in-plane modes, which are sensitive to oxidation, spin, and coordination states of the heme iron (27Abe M. Kitagawa T. Kyogoku Y. J. Chem. Phys. 1978; 69: 4526-4534Crossref Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 28Spiro T.G. Stong J.D. Stein P. J. Am. Chem.

The oxidation state marker band, ν4, of the oxidized protein appeared at 1373 cm–1, typical of the ferric state of heme proteins (Fig. 2, spectrum D). The spin and coordination marker band, ν3, is composed of an intense 1504-cm–1 peak with a small shoulder at 1490 cm–1 and a weak 1471-cm–1 peak, suggesting the co-existence of six-coordinate low spin (6cLS), five-coordinate high spin (5cHS), and six-coordinate high spin (6cHS) hemes in the ferric form. The 6cLS species (1504 cm–1) is dominant at neutral pH. A mixture of five- and six-coordinate species is also observed in the ferrous form (Fig. 2, spectrum E), for which ν3 bands observed at 1471 and 1493 cm–1 correspond to the 5cHS and 6cLS species, respectively. The addition of CO to the ferrous protein shifts the ν4 band from 1360 to 1372 cm–1, indicating the formation of CO-bound heme.

Open table in a new tab Low frequency RR spectra of the PAS-A domain are additionally illustrated in Fig. 2 (left panel). Spectra in this region are very useful for identifying a ligand, since metal-ligand vibrations directly demonstrate the presence of a particular ligand and the nature of its interactions in the heme pocket. Fe3+-OH stretching (νFe-OH) bands have been observed for alkaline ferric myoglobin (Mb), hemoglobin, and horseradish peroxide in the 450–555-cm–1 region, which shift upon isotope substitution of solvent (D2O and H 182O) (30Asher S.A.

https://openalex.org/W2076443806,"Taurine chloramine (TN-Cl) is one of the most abundant compounds generated by activated neutrophils. In contrast to HOCl, which causes necrosis, TN-Cl is a potent inducer of apoptosis in tumor cells. Here we show that the apoptosis induced by TN-Cl in human B lymphoma cells is dependent upon oxidant-mediated mitochondrial damage, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-9 activation. Further, we show that TN-Cl is taken up into the cells and is concentrated in the mitochondria, where it induces opening of the permeability transition pore and mitochondrial swelling. Identical activity is seen upon treatment of isolated mitochondria with TN-Cl and is blocked by the permeability transition pore inhibitors bongkrekic acid and cyclosporin A, as well as by the sulfhydryl-reducing agent tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine. The data suggest that TN-Cl causes apoptosis through direct damage to the mitochondria. Taurine chloramine (TN-Cl) is one of the most abundant compounds generated by activated neutrophils.

The data suggest that TN-Cl causes apoptosis through direct damage to the mitochondria. Neutrophils play an important role in defense against bacterial infections as well as other inflammatory responses. When recruited into the site of inflammation, these cells generate a variety of highly reactive oxidants. Key among these is hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is produced by the myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of Cl– by H2O2 (1Pullar J.M. Vissers M.C. Winterbourn C.C. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Hypochlorous acid is a major neutrophil microbicidal and anti-cancer agent, but when produced in excess, it leads to oxidative tissue damage and contributes to the development or progression of disease (2Shacter E. Weitzman S.A. Oncology (Huntingt.). 2002; 16 (229; 230–212): 217-226PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kontny E. Maslinski W. Marcinkiewicz J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2003; 526: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Taurine, a sulfur-containing β-amino acid that is not incorporated into proteins, is the most abundant intracellular amino acid in humans, reaching concentrations of 20–50 mm in leukocytes (4Fukuda K. Hirai Y. Yoshida H. Nakajima T. Usui T. Clin. Chem. 1982; 28: 1758-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Stimulated neutrophils release large quantities of taurine that are rapidly chlorinated by the reaction with HOCl, generating taurine chloramine (TN-Cl 1The abbreviations used are: TN-Cl, taurine chloramine; PTP, permeability transition pore; MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; PI, propidium iodide; CsA, cyclosporin A; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine; Nbs, 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid; JC-1, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide; BL, Burkitt lymphoma; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone.;–SO3(CH2)2NHCl) (5Grisham M.B.

Investig. 1982; 70: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the presence of taurine and the formation of TN-Cl at inflammatory sites provide a detoxification mechanism for HOCl, providing protection against neutrophil-induced cytotoxicity. TN-Cl is more stable and less toxic than HOCl, but it still retains oxidative potential. Our previous research demonstrated that treatment of human Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells with HOCl in PBS caused rapid necrotic death. In contrast, HOCl treatment in complete cell culture medium led to cell death by apoptosis (7Englert R.P. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20518-20526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These differences were attributed to the formation of long-lived aminoacyl chloramines formed by the reaction of HOCl with amino acids present in the medium. The results could be mimicked by treatment of the cells with taurine chloramine. Thus, conversion of HOCl to TN-Cl may minimize the detrimental effects of an uncontrolled inflammatory response to the necrotic death that would be caused by HOCl alone (2Shacter E. Weitzman S.A. Oncology (Huntingt.). 2002; 16 (229; 230–212): 217-226PubMed Google Scholar, 7Englert R.P. Shacter E. J. Biol.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a complex process that requires the integration of different intracellular signals. It is characterized by a number of well defined features that include condensation and fragmentation of the chromatin, internucleosomal DNA cleavage, membrane blebbing, caspase activation, translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, and the ultimate formation of so called “apoptotic bodies” (10Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cell death, in contrast to necrotic cell death, is thought to be physiologically advantageous, because the dying cells are cleared by phagocytosis prior to cell lysis and release of potentially inflammatory mediators (11Shacter E. Williams J.A. Hinson R.M. Senturker S. Lee Y.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 307-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Anderson H.A. Englert R. Gursel I. Shacter E.

Cell. 2004; 14: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Apoptosis occurs through at least two overlapping pathways referred to as extrinsic and intrinsic. The extrinsic pathway is activated through ligand binding to death receptors (members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily) at the cell surface and activation of initiator caspase-8. In the intrinsic pathway, mitochondria play a pivotal early role by releasing cell death signals into the cytosol and activating caspase-9 (16Fulda S. Meyer E. Friesen C. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Debatin K.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1063-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A common feature of the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is a sudden increase in the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), leading to a decrease in membrane potential (Δψm) and causing mitochondrial swelling (17Halestrap A.P. McStay G.P. Clarke S.J. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 18Green D.R. Kroemer G.

Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Both pathways converge and activate executioner caspase-3, which then cleaves intracellular protein substrates and causes cell death (21Korsmeyer S.J. Wei M.C. Saito M. Weiler S. Oh K.J. Schlesinger P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). It is well recognized that oxidants (e.g. superoxide anion, H2O2, nitric oxide) regulate cell death, but the mechanisms whereby oxidants activate the apoptotic machinery are not well understood, and the molecular targets for oxidative modification are not known. The aim of these studies was to better elucidate the pathway involved in TN-Cl-induced apoptosis. Cell Culture and Treatments—The Burkitt lymphoma cell line JLP-119 was grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-Gln, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air as described previously (22Lee Y. Shacter E. Blood. 1997; 89: 4480-4492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh medium to achieve a culture density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. TN-Cl toxicity studies were carried out by mixing taurine (Sigma) (2 mm in PBS on ice) with NaOCl (Aldrich) (500 μm) and then adding the mixture (1 ml) to cell pellets to get a final cell density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, 1 ml of complete medium was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for an additional 5 h. TN-Cl preparations were made fresh daily and monitored by ultraviolet absorption spectra (200–300 nm) to confirm the production of the monochloramine as well as the absence of a dichloramine or unreacted NaOCl. Concentrations of stock reagents were based on molar extinction coefficients of 350 m–1 cm–1 for NaOCl at 292 nm, and 429 m–1 cm–1 for TN-Cl at 252 nm (6Weiss S.J. Klein R. Slivka A. Wei M. J. Clin. Investig. 1982; 70: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Permeable caspase inhibitors (Z-VAD-fmk, Z-IETD-fmk, Z-LEDH-fmk) (B & D Systems), or bongkrekic acid (Sigma) were pre-incubated with the cells for 1 h. In experiments using thiol-reducing agents, cells were pre-incubated with dithiothreitol (Sigma) or tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP) (Pierce) for 1 h, washed with PBS and then treated with TN-Cl. None of the inhibitors used in this study had any effect on JLP-119 cell viability at the concentrations used. Morphological Assessment of Cell Death Using Hoechst 33342/Propidium Iodide (PI)—Treated cells (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with Hoechst 33342 dye (5 μg/ml in PBS), centrifuged, washed once in PBS, and then resuspended at ∼2.5 × 107 cells/ml. PI (Sigma) (50 μg/ml from a 1 mg/ml stock in PBS) was added just before microscopy. The cells were visualized using fluorescence microscopy and a minimum of 200 cells was counted. Cell morphology was classified as follows: (i) live cells (normal nuclei, blue chromatin with organized structure); (ii) apoptotic cells (early apoptotic, bright blue chromatin, which is highly condensed, or fragmented; late apoptotic, bright red chromatin, highly condensed or fragmented); (iii) necrotic (red, enlarged nuclei with normal structure) and pyknotic cells (dense, red, slightly condensed nuclei with no fragmentation), as shown in Fig. 1, and described previously (23Lee Y.J. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19792-19798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Cellular Uptake, Distribution, and Detection of TN-Cl—Treated cells were washed, gently homogenized with a glass homogenizer in buffer A (220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) and subfractionated by differential centrifugation into supernatant (cytosol plus membranes) and mitochondria-enriched fractions, as described below and previously (24Narita M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14681-14686Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Unbroken cells and nuclei were discarded. TN-Cl concentrations were determined by reacting different subcellular fractions with 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (Nbs) and measuring absorbance at 412 nm (ϵ412 nm = 27200 m–1 cm–1), standardized with TN-Cl (ϵ252 nm = 415 m–1 cm–1) (25Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Catalase was added to the Nbs solution to ensure assay specificity. For the radiolabeled TN-Cl uptake experiments, [1,2-3H]TN-Cl was produced by incubating [1,2-3H]taurine (Sigma) with HOCl. Cells were exposed to 100 nm [1,2-3H]TN-Cl in PBS and incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated in the figure legends. Uptake was stopped by adding an excess of cold taurine on ice. Cells were washed three times with PBS + 0.5% bovine serum albumin, gently homogenized, and fractionated by differential centrifugation, and the radioactivity in the different subcellular fractions was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Unbroken cells and the nuclear fraction were discarded. The uptake of labeled TN-Cl (fmol/mg protein) was calculated based upon the known specific activity of the radiolabeled TN-Cl solution. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The total [1,2-3H]TN-Cl count added to the cell suspensions at time zero was 790,386 ± 2,915 counts/min, equivalent to 25.9 ± 0.95 pmol (103.6 ± 5.8 nm). Mitochondrial Permeability Transition—Opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) causes mitochondrial swelling that is measured by the decreased light scattering (and thus absorbance) from suspensions of swollen mitochondria (26Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To isolate the mitochondria, cells were gently homogenized using a glass homogenizer in buffer A and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 0 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. Approximately three-quarters of the supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 0 °C in a new tube. The supernatant of this step is the crude cytosolic fraction, which also contains intracellular and plasma membranes. The fluffy layer of the pellet was removed by gently shaking with buffer A, and the firmly packed portion of the pellet was suspended in the same buffer without EGTA and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 0 °C. The pellet of this centrifugation is the crude mitochondrial fraction. This procedure yielded ∼0.7 mg of mitochondrial protein/1 × 108 cells. Mitochondrial protein was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Isolated mitochondria (0.25 mg of protein/ml) were suspended in cuvettes in buffer B (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 4.2 mm succinate, 0.5 mm KH2PO4, and 4 μg/ml rotenone). After a 2-min equilibration period, different concentrations of TN-Cl were added, and mitochondrial swelling was followed spectrophotometrically as the decrease in absorbance at 540 nm at 25 °C for 10 min. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψm)—Cells (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with the lipophilic cationic probe 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenz imidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) (Molecular Probes) (5 μg/ml in complete cell culture medium), centrifuged, washed once with medium, transferred to a 96-well plate (100,000 cells/well), and assayed using a fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices) with the following settings: excitation at 485 nm, emission at 540 and 590 nm, and cutoff at 530 nm. In some experiments, emission spectra between 530–620 nm were obtained. Δψm was calculated using the ratio of 590 nm (J-aggregates)/540 nm (monomeric form) (27Garg T.K. Chang J.Y. BMC Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 6-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy for Δψm—Cells (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were loaded with JC-1 (5 μg/ml in complete cell culture medium), centrifuged, washed once with medium, transferred to microscope slides, and examined immediately (28Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The samples were viewed at room temperature in a darkened room with a Zeiss LSM Pascal 5 confocal microscope, using a 40×/Plan-NeoFluor objective lens. Probes were excited with 488 nm of a 25-mW multiline argon-krypton laser. JC-1 green fluorescence was visualized with a NFT 545 and BP505–530 emission filter combination. Red fluorescence from JC-1 aggregates was detected using an LP530 emission filter. Photomultiplier settings were the same for all acquisitions. Apoptosis Mediated by TN-Cl Involves Intracellular Oxidation and Activation of Caspase-9—To determine whether TN-Cl activates the extrinsic or intrinsic pathways of apoptosis, human JLP-119 Burkitt lymphoma cells were exposed to 0.5 mm TN-Cl for 6 h. This resulted in 50–60% cell death that was almost entirely early apoptotic, as assessed by nuclear morphology and plasma membrane permeability (Figs. 1 and 2) (23Lee Y.J. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19792-19798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, cell death induced by TN-Cl was prevented by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD. To determine which initiator caspase was activated in response to TN-Cl, cells were pre-incubated with either the cell-permeable caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD or the caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD. We found that, even at the highest concentration tested (100 μm), inhibition of caspase-8 had no effect on the amount of apoptosis induced by TN-Cl. In contrast, inhibition of caspase-9 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of apoptosis. The activity and specificity of the inhibitors were confirmed in control experiment, demonstrating that Z-LEHD inhibited apoptosis induced by staurosporine or VP-16, which are known to induce the intrinsic (caspase-9-dependent) pathway of apoptosis, and Z-IETD inhibited apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibody, which is known to act through the extrinsic (caspase-8-dependent) pathway (data not shown). Even though TN-Cl is considered to be a relatively weak oxidant (compared with HOCl), it is known to oxidize biomolecules, especially those containing sulfhydryls and methionine (29Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 30Ogino T. Packer L. Maguire J.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine whether cell death induced by TN-Cl involves an oxidative mechanism, we compared the effects of two different thiol-reducing agents, one that is cell-permeable (TCEP), and one that is cell-impermeable (dithiothreitol). Cells were pre-incubated with either reducing agent and then washed prior to TN-Cl treatment. Fig. 2B shows that only TCEP inhibited induction of apoptosis by TN-Cl. Overall, these results suggested that apoptosis induced by TN-Cl is dependent on the oxidation of an intracellular target that activates the mitochondrial cell death pathway. TN-Cl Is Taken Up by Burkitt Lymphoma Cells and Concentrates in the Mitochondria—Biological membranes are impermeable to passive transfer of hydrophilic anions such as TN-Cl, and it is thought that TN-Cl has low permeability to cells (6Weiss S.J. Klein R. Slivka A. Wei M. J. Clin. Investig. 1982; 70: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 31Midwinter R.G. Peskin A.V. Vissers M.C. Winterbourn C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32205-32211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, TN-Cl is transported into human erythrocytes by the anion-transport system (32Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Melton D.F. Jefferson M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3321-3329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown to oxidize intracellular IκBα in human T leukemia (Jurkat) cells (33Kanayama A. Inoue J. Sugita-Konishi Y. Shimizu M. Miyamoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24049-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To test whether TN-Cl is taken up into JLP-119 BL cells, we measured the uptake of radiolabeled TN-Cl, prepared by mixing [1,2-3H]taurine with HOCl. The results (Fig. 3A) show that the cells incorporated TN-Cl at a rate that was similar to the uptake of tritiated taurine ([1,2-3H]taurine). After 1 h of incubation, the BL cells had incorporated 3% of the total [1,2-3H]TN-Cl added. Subcellular fractionation experiments indicated that labeled TN-Cl and taurine were preferentially taken up into the mitochondria-enriched fraction as compared with the crude cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3B). This finding was confirmed by an orthogonal method using the colorimetric sulfhydryl compound Nbs to detect chloramines. Cells were treated with 0.5 mm TN-Cl for 1 h in PBS. Chloramines rapidly oxidize the sulfhydryl group in Nbs to form a colorless disulfide (Nbs2). Only the mitochondria-enriched fraction contained detectable chloramines (26.1 ± 8.9 μm of TN-Cl/mg of mitochondrial protein), confirming the results obtained with radiolabeled TN-Cl. TN-Cl Induces Mitochondrial Swelling That Is Dependent on Opening of the PTP Complex—In mitochondria-driven apoptosis, the mitochondria undergo a permeability transition (MPT; reviewed in Refs. 18Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar and 20van Loo G. Saelens X. van Gurp M. MacFarlane M. Martin S.J. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The MPT refers to the swelling and depolarization of the mitochondria that occurs under some conditions, most notably as a result of calcium overload and oxidative stress (34Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Studies were carried out using isolated mitochondria to determine whether TN-Cl can induce mitochondrial swelling directly. As shown in Fig. 4A, TN-Cl induced MPT in the mitochondria in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, even at the highest dose tested (800 μm), taurine did not induce mitochondrial swelling (data not shown), arguing against a nonspecific, osmotic effect of TN-Cl. The cause of MPT is the opening of a nonspecific pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane, known as the mitochondrial PTP complex. We found that the specific PTP inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and bongkrekic acid inhibited TN-Cl-induced mitochondrial swelling (Fig. 4B). The sulfhydryl-reducing reagent TCEP also inhibited the direct induction of mitochondrial swelling by TN-Cl (Fig. 4C). The data suggest that TN-Cl directly induces PTP-dependent swelling of isolated mitochondria and likely acts through thiol oxidation. To confirm the involvement of PTP opening in TN-Cl-induced cell death, we tested the effect of the PTP inhibitor bongkrekic acid on the induction of apoptosis caused by TN-Cl in intact BL cells (Fig. 5). Bongkrekic acid was effective at inhibiting apoptosis at concentrations of 10–50 μm. In contrast, CsA was ineffective at inhibiting TN-Cl-induced apoptosis (data not shown). TN-Cl Induces Loss of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψm) That Precedes Apoptosis—PTP opening results in the re-equilibration of solutes of up to ∼1.5 kDa and causes mitochondrial swelling, with a consequent decrease in Δψm and the release of apoptogenic signals into the cytosol (20van Loo G. Saelens X. van Gurp M. MacFarlane M. Martin S.J. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Confocal analysis of BL cells stained with the cationic carbocyanine dye JC-1 showed that JC-1 localized to the mitochondria of untreated cells, where it formed red fluorescent J-aggregates, typical of high mitochondrial membrane potential, and a punctate intracellular pattern (Fig. 6A). Following exposure to 200 nm valinomycin, a K+ ionophore that induces Δψm collapse, the dye formed the expected green fluorescent monomers and partitioned into the cytoplasm (Fig. 6B). A similar but less complete molecular shift was observed following treatment of the cells with 0.5 mm TN-Cl for 6 h. To determine whether the loss of Δψm was an early or late event in the apoptosis induced by TN-Cl, we performed a time course experiment and followed fluorometrically the red/green fluorescence emission intensity in JC-1-stained cells. Both valinomycin (positive control) and TN-Cl caused a green shift in the JC-1 emission spectrum, which is characteristic of dye monomerization (Fig. 7A). Valinomycin caused a total and irreversible collapse in Δψm within 5 min of treatment (time course not shown). TN-Cl acted more slowly and caused a continuous decrease in Δψm that was first detected in the first 30 min of incubation (Fig. 7B). Fig. 7C shows that the loss of Δψm preceded the appearance of the morphological markers used to quantify apoptosis (nuclear condensation and fragmentation).Fig. 7Time course of the loss of Δψm and cell death in JLP-119 cells treated with TN-Cl. Cells (0.5 × 106/ml) were treated with 0.5 mm TN-Cl, washed, and incubated with JC-1 (5 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min. A, the JC-1 emission spectra (530–620 nm) were taken on untreated, valinomycin (200 nm)-, and TN-Cl-treated cells (0.5 mm) (6 h of treatment shown). B, the ratio between the emission intensities at 590/540 nm gives a measure of Δψm at the indicated times in untreated cells (•) and TN-Cl-treated cells (○).

Cell death was assessed by nuclear morphology in cells stained with Hoechst/PI, using fluorescence microscopy. The data represent means ± S.E. for at least three independent experiments carried out in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The novel findings presented here are that TN-Cl causes direct mitochondrial oxidative damage and PTP-dependent swelling, leading to caspase-9-dependent and caspase-8-independent apoptosis. Thus, TN-Cl caused a decrease in Δψm (JC-1 monomerization) in intact cells and swelling of isolated mitochondria, both of which reflect PTP function. The swelling of isolated mitochondria was inhibited by pre-incubation with the thiol antioxidant TCEP and by two blockers of the PTP (bongkrekic acid and cyclosporin A). Induction of apoptosis by TN-Cl was also inhibited by bongkrekic acid and TCEP, as well as by an inhibitor of caspase-9 but not by an inhibitor of caspase-8. The data support the hypothesis that TN-Cl causes apoptosis by targeting the mitochondria and causing oxidant-dependent PTP opening. These results will be discussed further below. Mitochondrial (dys) function in response to oxidative stress is a central event leading to cell death (18Green D.R. Kroemer G.

Even though lymphoid cells have relatively small numbers of mitochondria (8–15/cell) compared with the thousands found in liver cells (37de Graaf A.O. van den Heuvel L.P. Dijkman H.B. de Abreu R.A. Birkenkamp K.U. de Witte T. van der Reijden B.A. Smeitink J.A. Jansen J.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), they are crucial for the production of metabolic energy in these cells and also play a key role in controlling the pathways that lead to cell death (38Tafani M. Karpinich N.O. Hurster K.A. Pastorino J.G. Schneider T. Russo M.A. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10073-10082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This was true for the mitochondrial population in JLP-119 cells as well, based on JC-1 staining and confocal microscopy. We found that TN-Cl was concentrated in the mitochondria, and treatment of isolated mitochondria with TN-Cl caused irreversible organelle swelling. Moreover, we tried, but were unable, to generate a BL cell line depleted of mitochondrial DNA (JLP-119 ρ0 cells) using a protocol described elsewhere (39King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 304-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the first 10 days in culture, all cells had died (data not shown), consistent with the importance of the mitochondria for viability in this cell type. The ability of TN-Cl to cause mitochondrial damage (swelling and depolarization) was inhibited by a thiol antioxidant, indicating that the TN-Cl acts through an oxidative mechanism. The finding that blockers of the PTP prevented TN-Cl-induced mitochondrial damage points to the PTP or associated proteins as being the target of TN-Cl activity. Protein sulfur groups (cysteine sulfhydryls and methionine thioethers) are known to be primary targets of TN-Cl oxidation (29Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thiols with a low pK and that have a high positive charge in close proximity are particularly susceptible to oxidation by TN-Cl. It is thought that the MPT is modulated by the redox status of mitochondria (i.e. glutathione, thioredoxin, and NAD(P)H levels) (34Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 36Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6746-6751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), and recent data suggest that the adenine nucleotide translocator component of the PTP is highly sensitive to oxidative stress (35Costantini P. Belzacq A.S. Vieira H.L. Larochette N. de Pablo M.A. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Brenner C. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 36Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6746-6751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), with three cysteine residues, Cys56, Cys159, and Cys256, showing differential reactivity toward thiol-oxidizing agents (17Halestrap A.P. McStay G.P. Clarke S.J. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). These cysteines all face the mitochondrial matrix and may be the thiol groups that regulate PTP opening and mitochondria swelling. Although a wide variety of antioxidants have been shown to protect the mitochondria, the finding that a thiol peroxidase protects against MPT is especially significant, because it indicates that MPT involves oxidation of pore complex-associated sulfhydryls (40Kowaltowski A.J. Netto L.E. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12766-12769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Future studies will characterize the molecular events associated with TN-Cl oxidation of the permeability transition pore complex. There is some controversy in the scientific literature over whether TN-Cl is taken up into mammalian cells. The passive membrane permeability of TN-Cl is believed to be low, but active transport of TN-Cl into cells has been described for erythrocytes (32Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Melton D.F. Jefferson M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3321-3329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and RAW 264.7 cells (41Park E. Quinn M.R. Wright C.E. Schuller-Levis G. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1993; 54: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Oxidation of intracellular IκBα by TN-Cl further supports the conclusion that TN-Cl enters cells (33Kanayama A. Inoue J. Sugita-Konishi Y. Shimizu M. Miyamoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24049-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been argued that TN-Cl is not taken up into cells and that alternative mechanisms account for TN-Cl-induced cellular effects. Peskin et al. (42Peskin A.V. Midwinter R.G. Harwood D.T. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 1622-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that TN-Cl exchanges its oxidized Cl group with other amines and amino acids (e.g. glycine) in the medium, generating chloramines that are more cell-permeable (e.g. Gly-Cl). The authors concluded that this exchange is responsible for the intracellular effects of TN-Cl. However, our experiments showing incorporation of radioactivity from tritium-labeled TN-Cl were carried out in buffer lacking other amines, thus avoiding a possible chloramine exchange mechanism. It might be argued that, because the tritium label is on the taurine moiety, what we were actually measuring was the uptake of free taurine released after interaction of TN-Cl with cell surface molecules. This mechanism has not been formally excluded, but free taurine is not toxic and does not damage the mitochondria (Fig. 4), so it cannot account for the effects of TN-Cl. Moreover, if TN-Cl were acting at the cell surface, it would be expected to require activation of caspase-8 to induce apoptosis and should have been preventable by both cell-permeable and -impermeable reducing agents, but this was not the case. Still, the molecular mechanism whereby TN-Cl is transported into the lymphoma cells is unknown and needs to be explored further. Because the BL cells incorporated TN-Cl at the same rate as taurine, we would hypothesize that both compounds employ the same cellular import machinery. Interestingly, pretreatment of the cells with CsA, a classical MPT blocker, enhanced the total amount of cell death induced by TN-Cl (data not shown), whereas it inhibited the MPT and swelling in isolated mitochondria. CsA is known to inhibit the P-glycoprotein present in the plasma membrane of tumor cells (43Illmer T. Schaich M. Platzbecker U. Freiberg-Richter J. Oelschlagel U. von Bonin M. Pursche S. Bergemann T. Ehninger G. Schleyer E. Leukemia. 2004; 18: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and thereby inhibits the active efflux of several classes of chemotherapeutic compounds. Some taurine-related compounds have been described as P-glycoprotein substrates (44Elamiri A. Perwaiz S. Tuchweber B. Yousef I.M. Pharmacol. Res. 2003; 48: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), suggesting that cyclosporin A may have inhibited the efflux of TN-Cl as well. The mechanisms by which oxidants regulate biological processes have been the subject of much research. It is clear that excess levels of free radicals can cause cell death, but the mode of death (i.e. necrotic, apoptotic, other) depends on the type, concentration, source, and environment of the oxidant(s) (7Englert R.P. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20518-20526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our research and that of others shows that TN-Cl and other aminoacyl chloramines cause apoptosis in a variety of cell types (7Englert R.P. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20518-20526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 45Schuller-Levis G.B. Park E. FEMS Microbiol.

Burns C.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 401: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and they do so at concentrations that are biologically relevant. The physiological concentrations of TN-Cl have not been determined directly, but in vitro data show that, in the presence of a physiologically relevant (∼15 mm) concentration of taurine, activation of human neutrophils (∼2 × 106 cell/ml) results in generation of ∼100 μm TN-Cl (6Weiss S.J. Klein R. Slivka A. Wei M. J. Clin. Investig. 1982; 70: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Taking into account that an inflammatory site is heavily infiltrated with neutrophils, it is conceivable that local accumulation of TN-Cl may reach the mm range. The high physiological concentrations of taurine in cells and tissues scavenge neutrophil-derived HOCl, which, by itself, causes solely necrotic cell death (7Englert R.P. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20518-20526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Hence, the formation of TN-Cl switches cell death from necrosis, which can cause more extensive tissue damage, to apoptosis, which is generally believed to be more physiologically beneficial (2Shacter E. Weitzman S.A. Oncology (Huntingt.). 2002; 16 (229; 230–212): 217-226PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar, 11Shacter E.

Previous studies have revealed a homotrimer structure for C-terminally phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3 (phospho-Smad2 or -Smad3) (8Wu J.W. Hu M. Chai J. Seoane J. Huse M. Li C. Rigotti D.J. Kyin S.

Hu M. Chai J. Seoane J. Huse M. Li C. Rigotti D.J. Kyin S. Muir T.W. Fairman R. Massagué J. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1277-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It is the heteromeric complexes of Smad2 or Smad3 with Smad4 together with other transcription factors in the nucleus that activate or repress gene expression in response to TGF-β (3Shi Y.

Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40710-40717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm independently (14Xu L. Kang Y.

Cell. 2002; 10: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The balance of nuclear import and export forces together with cytoplasmic retention mechanisms result in mostly cytoplasmic distribution of these Smad proteins (16Nicolas F.J. De Bosscher K. Schmierer B. Hill C.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4113-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Xu L. Chen Y.G. Massagué J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Upon TGF-β signaling and the ensuing phosphorylation of Smad2/3, the Smads form multimeric complexes and become exclusively concentrated in the nucleus (14Xu L. Kang Y. Col S. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 15Inman G.J. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). There has been much interest in understanding the machinery responsible for such signal-regulated nuclear enrichment of Smads. The importin β family of transport receptors mediate nuclear translocation of many macromolecules (18Weis K. Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 19Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The primary function of importin β is to bridge the association between their cargos and nucleoporins, the constituents of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (18Weis K. Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 19Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

However, previous studies have suggested an importin-independent nuclear import mechanism for unphosphorylated Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 (22Xu L. Alarcon C. Col S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42569-42577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism relies on the ability of Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 to directly interact with phenylalanineglycine (FG) repeat-containing nucleoporins including CAN/Nup214 and Nup153 (14Xu L. Kang Y. Col S. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Xu L. Alarcon C. Col S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42569-42577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In Smad2 and Smad3, the association with the nucleoporins is mediated by the C-terminal MH2 domains, whereas in Smad4, the nucleoporin-interaction domain is not yet defined (14Xu L. Kang Y. Col S. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Xu L. Alarcon C. Col S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42569-42577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Smad3 and Smad4 have also been reported to contain additional nuclear import activities in their N-terminal MH1 domains, which are mediated by importin β1 and importin α, respectively (23Kurisaki A. Kose S. Yoneda Y. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24Xiao Z. Latek R. Lodish H.F.

A. 2000; 97: 7853-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, most of these conclusions were based on studies of individual forms of Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, which pertain only to Smad movement at the basal state. The question remains whether the TGF-β-activated forms, namely the homotrimeric and heterotrimeric complexes of Smad2 or Smad3 with Smad4, are imported into the nucleus via similar or distinct pathways. Smad4 contains a typical nuclear export signal (NES) at the junction of its N-terminal MH1 domain and the linker region and is continuously exported out of the nucleus by chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM-1) (27Pierreux C.E. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 28Watanabe M. Masuyama N. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When CRM-1 is inactivated by the compound leptomycin B, Smad4 resides exclusively in the nucleus without TGF-β stimulation (27Pierreux C.E. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 28Watanabe M. Masuyama N. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This suggests that, although the nuclear entry of Smad4 is a spontaneous event not requiring TGF-β signaling, CRM-1-mediated nuclear export must be suppressed by TGF-β in order to retain Smad4 in the nucleus. The mechanism for such inactivation of CRM-1-mediated Smad4 export remained elusive. Here we studied the homotrimeric phospho-Smad3 and the heterotrimeric phospho-Smad3/Smad4 complexes, which are the active forms of Smads in response to TGF-β. We demonstrate that these complexes are imported into the nucleus through an importin-independent mechanism. Although the monomeric Smad4 and Smad4 in complex with phospho-Smad3 are imported with comparable efficiency, the two forms employ different nucleoporins in their translocation across the nuclear pore. It also appears that phospho-Smad3 in the complex plays a more dominant role in guiding the complex through the nuclear pore and excluding Smad4 from the nucleolus. Our data also suggest that the nuclear import activity in phospho-Smad3 alone may be sufficient for the Smad4/phospho-Smad3 complex to enter the nucleus. Furthermore, we found that the heterotrimer formation with phospho-Smad3, but not its binding to the target DNA, physically prevents Smad4 from binding to CRM-1 and thus enables Smad4 to accumulate in the nucleus in response to TGF-β. Indeed, Smad4 mutants defective in interaction with phospho-Smad2 or Smad3 are impaired in nuclear accumulation and therefore are unable to function as tumor suppressor. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunocytochemistry—COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml, Invitrogen). Cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following manufacturers' instructions. Immunocytochemistry was carried out as previously described (17Xu L. Chen Y.G. Massagué J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cells were examined under a Nikon TE2000-S inverted fluorescent microscope, and the images were captured by a Spot RT-KE digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Recombinant Proteins and Fluorescence Labeling—The expression vectors for His-CRM-1, His-importin β-(45–462), and His-nuclear transport factor 2 were gifts from Drs. Maarten Fornerod (the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Dirk Görlich (ZMBH, Heidelberg, Germany), and Gunter Blobel (Rockefeller University), respectively. The encoded proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads following manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Full-length Smad4 was expressed and purified as a GST fusion protein. The GST moiety was then cleaved by thrombin digestion, and the buffer was adjusted to 20 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 10 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA before being loaded onto a DEAE HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length Smad4 was eluted with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.3, and 150 mm NaCl. Purified Smad4 was labeled with fluorescein-5-maleimide following the vendor's protocol (Molecular Probe). After terminating the labeling reaction with 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, Smad4 was further purified by a Superdex 200 HR column on FPLC in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Generation of Phosphorylated Smad3 and Homotrimer—Smad3 (aa 144–419) without the C-terminal CSSVS sequence was cloned into the pTXB1 bacterial expression vector (New England BioLabs) upstream of GyrA intein and the chitin-binding domain. The protein was expressed at room temperature for 24 h, and the cells were harvested in 20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The cell lysate was loaded onto a chitin column equilibrated with the same buffer. After extensive washing, the column was incubated with 50 mm MESNA in the same harvesting buffer at 4 °C overnight to induce cleavage of Smad3 (aa 144–419) from intein-chitin-binding domain. The eluted Smad3 (aa 144–419) protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml, and 4-fold excess of the phosphorylated synthetic peptide Cys-Ser-pSer-Val-pSer was added for chemical ligation to the C terminus of Smad3 (aa 144–419) to yield the homogenously phosphorylated Smad3 (aa 144–424). The phosphorylated Smad3 (aa 144–424), which spontaneously forms a homotrimer, was further purified by a Superdex 200 size-exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) on FPLC in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Generation of the Phospho-Smad3/Smad4 Heteromeric Complex—To form the heteromeric Smad complex, Smad4 (aa 273–552), purified as previously described, was added in a 2-fold molar excess to phospho-Smad3-(144–424) (29Qin B.Y. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Lin K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1950-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Each heteromeric Smad complex was first purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE column, during which the uncomplexed Smad4 eluted in the flow-through fractions, whereas the heteromeric Smad complex eluted in a 100–300 mm NaCl gradient. The resulting Smad complex was further purified by a Superdex 200 size-exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences). To generate the phospho-Smad3/full-length Smad4 heterocomplex, the full-length Smad4 purified and labeled as described above was incubated with 3× molar excess of phospho-Smad3-(144–424) for 30 min on ice and subsequently purified by a Superdex 200 size-exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing complexed form of full-length Smad4 were pooled and concentrated before various experiments. In Vitro Nuclear Import and Export Assays—HeLa cells were permeabilized with 40 μg/ml digitonin (Calbiochem) and processed for in vitro nuclear import assays as described previously (17Xu L. Chen Y.G. Massagué J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). All of the import substrates were used at 0.1 μg/μl, and all of the import and export reactions include an ATP-regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm phosphocreatine, and 0.02 units/μl creatine phosphokinase). Where indicated, RanQ69L-GTP (5 μm), importin β-(45–462) (10 μm), and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (0.5 μg/μl) were included in the import reactions. After 20 min of import reaction at room temperature, cells were fixed and stained with anti-Smad2/3 antibody to monitor nuclear translocation of Smad3. For the detection of Smad4 in these assays, the recombinant Smad4 was directly labeled with fluorescein-5-maleimide as described above. In the in vitro nuclear export assay, proteins of interest were first allowed to enter the nucleus following the in vitro nuclear import assay protocol (17Xu L. Chen Y.G. Massagué J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). After the import reaction, the cells were washed with transport buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 110 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mm EGTA) and further incubated with the nuclear export mixture containing 1 μg of His-CRM-1, 1 μg of RanGDP, 0.2 μg of nuclear transport factor 2, 5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, 5 mm phosphocreatine, and 0.02 unit/μl creatine phosphokinase in a final volume of 20 μl. The export reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at room temperature, and then the cells were washed with the transport buffer and fixed with paraformaldehyde as described before (17Xu L. Chen Y.G. Massagué J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Protein-Protein Interaction Assays—In GST pull-down assays, hemagglutinin-CAN1600 (aa 1600–2091) was overexpressed in COS-1 cells by transient transfection and cell lysates were prepared by sonication in the immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with protease inhibitors). The lysate was mixed with 10 μg of GST-Smad4 with or without 20 μg of phospho-Smad3-(144–424) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C before adding glutathione-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma). After additional incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation, the agarose beads were washed three times in the immunoprecipitation buffer and the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation experiments, COS-1 cells were transfected with FLAG-Smad4 wild type or mutant expression plasmids as indicated. Cells were treated with 100 pm TGF-β (Peprotech) 18 h post-transfection and lysed by sonication in the immunoprecipitation buffer. Immunoprecipitation was done using anti-Smad2/3 antibody at 4 °C overnight, and the immunocomplex was precipitated by protein A beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After washing 3× with the immunoprecipitation buffer, proteins bound to the beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. For detection of the Smad4-CRM-1 interaction, 5 μg of His-CRM-1, 10 μg of GST-Smad4N (aa 1–239), or 10 μg of GST-Smad4 were incubated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 200 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol, and 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 20 min before adding glutathione-conjugated agarose beads. As indicated, 20 μg of RanQ69L-GTP and 1 mm GTP were included in the assay. After 2 h, the beads were washed in the same buffer for three times and the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-His conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Roche Applied Science). As stated in the figure legends, 30 μg of phospho-Smad3-(144–424) or 2 nmol (20:1 molar ratio to GST-Smad4) of Smad-binding element DNA element (5′-TAAGTCTAGACGGCAGTCTAGACGTAC-3′) were preincubated with GST-Smad4 prior to the addition of His-CRM-1. Nuclear Import of the Phospho-Smad3 Complexes and the Interaction with CAN/Nup214—To elucidate the nuclear import mechanisms for TGF-β-activated Smad complexes, we purified these complexes to test them in the in vitro nuclear import assay using digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells (30Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As the import substrate in this assay, the Smad3 fragment (aa 144–419, including the linker and the MH2 domain) was chemically ligated to a synthetic peptide (Cys-Ser-pSer-Val-pSer) with the indicated serine residues phosphorylated. This homogenously phosphorylated Smad3, identical to the TGF-β-activated form of Smad3, readily assembles into a homotrimer complex by itself and a heterotrimer complex at 2:1 ratio with Smad4 (aa 273–552) under physiological conditions (Fig. 1A) (10Chacko B.M. Qin B.Y. Tiwari A. Shi G. Lam S. Hayward L.J. De Caestecker M. Lin K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 813-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Resolved by Superdex 200 size-exclusion column, the homotrimer and heterotrimer phospho-Smad3 complexes were eluted in fractions corresponding to molecular mass of over 100 kDa (Fig. 1A, fractions 15–16), whereas the monomers were eluted much later (fraction 21, data not shown). This allowed us to purify the complexes for use in the nuclear import experiments. Both the homotrimeric and heterotrimeric forms of phospho-Smad3 were imported into the nucleus without cytosol in the import assay (Fig. 1B). The addition of cytosol neither enhanced nor reduced the level of phospho-Smad3 accumulating in the nucleus, suggesting that the importin molecules may not be necessary for nuclear import of the phospho-Smad3 complexes (Fig. 1B). In a GST pull-down experiment, the phospho-Smad3/Smad4 complex interacted with the FG-repeat domain of the nucleoporin CAN/Nup214 (Fig. 1C). The level of interaction was not considerably different from that exhibited by the monomeric Smad4 (Fig. 1C). This and our previous observations suggest that the complex formation between phospho-Smad2/3 and Smad4 does not affect their association with FG-containing nucleoporins such as CAN/Nup214 (14Xu L. Kang Y. Col S. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Therefore, in both the nuclear import assay and interaction with nucleoporins, the general characteristics of the phospho-Smad3 complexes are similar to those of monomeric Smads (22Xu L. Alarcon C. Col S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42569-42577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Phospho-Smad3 Harbors Sufficient Nuclear Import Activity to Drive Associated Smad4 into the Nucleus—The aa 273–552 region of Smad4 (also referred to as the AF fragment) interacts with phospho-Smad3, but it lacks intrinsic nuclear import activity as evidenced by the observation in this (Fig. 1D) and our previous studies (22Xu L. Alarcon C. Col S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42569-42577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that the GST-Smad4AF fusion (GST-S4AF) did not enter the nucleus. However a substantial amount of GST-S4AF could be imported into the nucleus upon association with phospho-Smad3 (Fig. 1D). The extra GST moiety on the Smad4 AF fragment may have contributed to the slightly lower nuclear import efficiency compared with the heterotrimer without GST used in Fig. 1B. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the nuclear import activity provided by phos-pho-Smad3 alone is sufficient to carry the bound Smad4 fragment across the NPC. Nuclear Import of the Phospho-Smad3 Complexes Is Importin-independent but Nucleoporin-dependent—We further probed the requirements for nuclear import of the phospho-Smad3 complexes. RanQ69L, a mutant form of the RanGTPase that is a potent inhibitor of all known importin β family-mediated nuclear imports (31Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 32Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), did not affect the transport of phospho-Smad3 into the nucleus (Fig. 2A). Under the same assay conditions, the efficacy of RanQ69L-GTP was confirmed by its ability to block the classic nuclear localization signal (NLS)-mediated importin/cytosol-dependent nuclear import (Fig. 2B). The N-terminally truncated importin β (aa 45–462) stably associates with and masks a subset of nucleoporins to block active nuclear import (33Kutay U. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Indeed, the nuclear import of phospho-Smad3 in either the homotrimeric or the heterotrimeric complex was largely abolished by importin β-(45–462), suggesting that contact with importin β-targeted nucleoporins is important for nuclear translocation of phospho-Smad3 homotrimers and heterotrimers (Fig. 2A). Similar observations were made with full-length importin β (Supplemental Fig. 1). Furthermore, the unphosphorylated version of the same fragment of Smad3 (GST-Smad3LMH2) was imported with similar efficiency compared with phospho-Smad3 in the complexes and was also prevented from entering the nucleus by importin β (aa 45–462) (Fig. 2C). This is consistent with the idea that the monomeric and the heteromeric Smad3 make contact with a similar group of nucleoporins in migrating across the NPC. These observations suggest that the phospho-Smad3 homotrimers and heterotrimers, assembled in response to TGF-β signal, enter the nucleus via an importin-independent mechanism that involves direct contact with nucleoporins. Some of these nucleoporins must also be engaged by importin β in its translocation across the nuclear pore. Such features in the nuclear import mechanism were also observed for unphosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 (17Xu L. Chen Y.G. Massagué J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22Xu L. Alarcon C. Col S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42569-42577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the basal state nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Smad3 and the nuclear translocation of TGF-β-activated phospho-Smad3 complexes are mediated by similar transport mechanisms. Distinction in Nuclear Import of Monomeric and Phospho-Smad3-associated Smad4—We next compared nuclear import of monomeric Smad4 and its complex with phospho-Smad3. Using Superdex 200HR gel-filtration chromatography, the monomeric Smad4 and the phospho-Smad3/Smad4 complex can be readily separated and we pooled the fractions containing the heteromeric phospho-Smad3/Smad4 complex for the nuclear import assays (Fig. 3A). Because we used excess homotrimeric phospho-Smad3 to maximize Smad4 incorporation into the complex and the gel filtration column cannot resolve the newly formed heterotrimer and the Smad3 homotrimer, the fractions we pooled also contained phospho-Smad3 homotrimer (Fig. 3A). However, because Smad4 was labeled with fluorescein maleimide prior to incubation with phospho-Smad3, we could specifically follow the movement of Smad4 in the context of the heterotrimer. Smad4, either in complex with phospho-Smad3 (120 kDa) or by itself (60 kDa), was imported into the nucleus independent of cytosol (Fig. 3B). The intensity of signal in the nucleus is similar between the monomeric and the complexed Smad4, suggesting that the association with phospho-Smad3 did not further accelerate nuclear import. RanQ69L-GTP did not affect nuclear import of either the monomeric or the complexed Smad4, arguing for importin-independent mechanisms (Fig. 3B). However, importin β-(45–462) did not significantly inhibit nuclear import of the monomeric Smad4, suggesting that, in the process of nuclear translocation, Smad4 interacts with a set of nucleoporins distinct from those recognized by importin β. This is in contrast to the Smad4 in complex with phospho-Smad3 in which the nuclear import was substantially inhibited by importin β-(45–462) (Fig. 3B). WGA, a more general blocker of the NPC, prevented both the monomeric and complexed forms of Smad4 from entering the nucleus (Fig. 3B), confirming that nuclear import of the monomeric Smad4 is indeed an active process (34Finlay D.R.

However, the role of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) in this process has not been elucidated. Thus, this study was performed to examine whether membrane depolarization can regulate the phosphorylation of GSK-3β and to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in this regulation. The depolarization by treating with 100 mm KCl for 5 min resulted in the undulating phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, in H19 –7/IGF-IR rat embryonic hippocampal cells, and in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells, but not in A172 human glioblastoma cells. Cellular β-catenin contents showed a temporal pattern similar to that of the Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β. Treatment with wortmannin or calphostin C or the expression of dominant negative Akt inhibited phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 following the KCl-induced depolarization of SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, pretreatment with okadaic acid or cyclosporin A blocked the dephosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 at 0, 15, and 30 min after KCl-induced depolarization, and the activity of protein phosphatases (PP) 2A and 2B increased at these times. Treatment with nifedipine or calcium-free medium inhibited GSK-3β dephosphorylation following membrane depolarization, and the amounts of co-immunoprecipitated GSK-3β and PP2A changed in parallel with GSK-3β dephosphorylation. Our study demonstrated that KCl-induced depolarization caused undulating GSK-3β phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, which was regulated for the most part by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt (phosphorylation) and PP2A and PP2B (dephosphorylation), respectively.

Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) 1The abbreviations used are: GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli gene product; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PD, post-depolarization; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PP2B, protein phosphatase 2B (also called calcineurin); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1The abbreviations used are: GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli gene product; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PD, post-depolarization; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PP2B, protein phosphatase 2B (also called calcineurin); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. was originally identified as an enzyme that phosphorylates glycogen synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogen biosynthesis. Subsequent studies have shown that GSK-3 phosphorylates a broad range of substrates, including several transcription factors such as c-Myc, c-Jun, and β-catenin (1Plyte S.E. Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Pulverer B.J. Woodgett J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, GSK-3 has been implicated in many fundamental biological processes, which include cell fate determination, metabolism, transcriptional control, and oncogenesis (2Woodgett J.R. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : RE12Google Scholar). GSK-3 also plays crucial roles in many major signaling processes that are involved in key brain functions and has been associated with several dysfunctions of the central nervous system. For example, the dysregulated activity of β-isoform of GSK-3 (GSK-3β) has been implicated in certain psychiatric diseases like bipolar mood disorder and in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. Moreover, several mood-stabilizing drugs such as lithium and valproate are known to inhibit GSK-3β activity, which supports the idea that GSK-3β activity modulation may have a therapeutic benefit in those with behavioral conditions in addition to its known benefits in the treatment of Alzheimer disease (3Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). GSK-3β is subject to multiple regulatory mechanisms so that it can phosphorylate diverse substrates that are involved in a myriad of cellular responses. The phosphorylation of GSK-3β is the most widely studied regulatory mechanism, but protein complex formation and intracellular localization also have important regulatory influences on GSK-3β activity (3Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). The activity of GSK-3β can be reduced by the phosphorylation of Ser-9 (1Plyte S.E. Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Pulverer B.J. Woodgett J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and several kinases have been found to be capable of mediating this modification, e.g. p70 S6 kinase, p90 Rsk (also called MAPKAP kinase-1), Akt (also called protein kinase B), certain isoforms of protein kinase C, and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A). Moreover, much research has been directed toward identifying the receptor-coupled signaling systems used by each of these kinases to control GSK-3β activity (3Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). However, in stark contrast to the many kinases known to be involved in the phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is the only known protein phosphatase that can directly dephosphorylate GSK-3β (4Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Changes in the electrical potential of the plasma membrane are accompanied by synaptic transmission and axonal conduction, and result in the rapid signaling of the nervous system by transiently inducing transmembrane ionic fluxes. These ionic fluxes also may have long term consequences as they can affect the expressions of various genes in excited cells over a period of hours or days. Moreover, these electrical activities in the nervous system influence more complex intercellular interactions, such as neural sprouting, long term potentiation and depression, and map refinement and rearrangement (5Schmidt J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 127: 251-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying such long term or adaptive changes are not clearly known. We hypothesized that membrane depolarization may regulate the phosphorylation and activation of GSK-3β. We undertook this study to determine whether membrane depolarization can regulate GSK-3β phosphorylation and, if so, to elucidate the regulatory mechanism responsible. We found that KCl-induced depolarization induced the undulating phosphorylation of GSK-3β and that the protein phosphatases PP2A and PP2B, as well as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt, are involved in the regulation of GSK-3β phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Cell Culture and Treatments—SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and H19–7/IGF-IR rat embryonal hippocampal cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), and PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells and A172 human glioblastoma cells were from the Korean Cell Line Bank. SH-SY5Y cells, PC12 cells, and A173 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (JBI, Korea) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. H19–7/IGF-IR cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml G418. Cells were washed and incubated in fresh DMEM overnight before depolarization. Membrane depolarization was induced by treating the cells with 100 mm KCl in complete medium for 5 min. This was followed by an immediate wash with fresh medium, and then fresh medium (containing drugs as indicated) was added. KCl and EDTA were purchased from Sigma, cyclosporin A, and MK801 from Tocris (UK). FK506, okadaic acid, wortmannin, LY294002, H89, PD98059, manumycin A, nifedifine, KN62, PP2, AG1478, calphostin C, and rapamycin were from Calbiochem. Transient Transfection—The expression plasmids for activated Myc-tagged Akt (N-terminal myristoylation) and dominant negative (K179M) Myc-tagged Akt were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (6Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). For the transient expression of Akt, SH-SY5Y cells were plated in 10-cm dishes 1 day prior to transfection, and the subconfluent (70–80%) cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Control cells were transfected with reagents containing pUSEamp(+) vector DNA (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Transfected cell media were replaced with fresh medium 6 h after transfection, and cells were harvested 24 h later for analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were harvested after being rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and were then lysed in suspension by incubation in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) on ice for 30 min. The lysates so obtained were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were measured using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Lysate supernatants (10 μg of protein) were boiled in Laemmli buffer, separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose paper. Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TTBS (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h and then incubated in a cold room overnight with respective antibodies. Antibodies against GSK3β, PP2A, protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B), and actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; the antibody against β-catenin was from BD Biosciences; and antibodies against phosphorylated GSK-3β (Ser-9), phosphorylated GSK-3β (Tyr-216), phosphorylated Akt (Ser-473), phosphorylated EGFR (Tyr-1068), Akt, EGFR, and Myc were from Cell Signaling. Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2000 dilution, Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature. They were then washed with TTBS and incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate mix (Pierce). Blots were then exposed to x-ray film (AGFA Curix RPI) to obtain images. The density of visualized bands were quantified using an image analyzer (Bio-Rad, model GS-700), and relative band densities were expressed as percentages of corresponding control cell densities. Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates (800 μg of protein) were incubated with 1 μg of anti-GSK-3β or anti-PP2A antibody at 4 °C overnight on a rotator. Fifty microliters of a 1:1 suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pierce) was added to the mixture and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed extensively with cell lysis buffer. Bound proteins were dissociated by boiling the beads in PAGE sample treatment buffer and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Measurement of Intracellular Calcium ([Ca2+]i) by Confocal Microscopy—For Ca2+ imaging, SH-SY5Y cells were grown on cover glasses and incubated in a solution containing 5 μm Fluo-4AM (Molecular Probes) in a 37 °C incubator for 30 min before analysis. Cover glasses containing dye-loaded cells were mounted in a chamber slide, and the cells were visualized directly at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm filtered through an emission long pass filter (LP 515, Carl Zeiss). The confocal inverted microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss) was equipped with a40× objective lens (Carl Zeiss), a helium/neon laser (543 nm, 633 nm), and a second blue-enhanced argon laser (488 nm). To determine Ca2+ concentrations, the scan speed was set to 1.08 s for a 512 × 512 pixel image, and the pinhole was set to achieve a full-width, half-maximum z resolution of ∼1 μm. Serine/Threonine Protein Phosphatase Activity Assay—The activity of serine/threonine phosphatase was determined by using a nonradioactive molybdate dye-based phosphatase assay kit (Promega). In brief, cell lysate supernatant was passed twice through a Sephadex G-25 spin column to remove free phosphate. The assays were performed in triplicate in 96-well plates, and the assay mixtures contained 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.02% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm phosphoprotein substrate (amino acid sequence: RRA[pT]VA), and 5–10 μg of sample protein. The enzyme reaction was started by adding the sample and allowed to progress for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding molybdate dye solution, and color was developed by incubating the mixture for 30 min at room temperature. The standard curve was prepared using inorganic phosphate at concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 μm. Absorbance at 630 nm was measured, and the amount of phosphate released was then calculated using the standard curve. Data Analysis—At least three independent experiments were conducted for all the analysis. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze mean values, and a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant (7Seo M. Cho C.H. Lee Y.I. Shin E.Y. Park D. Bae C.D. Lee J.W.

KCl-induced Depolarization Induced the Undulating Phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 in Neuroblastoma Cells and Rat Hippocampal Cells—We examined first whether KCl-induced depolarization could regulate GSK-3β phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells. The depolarization of SH-SY5Y cells caused by treating them with 100 mm KCl for 5 min resulted in the undulating phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9. Untreated control cells showed strong basal phosphorylation at Ser-9, which was drastically decreased at 0 min (i.e. after 5 min of depolarization). Ser-9 phosphorylation increased to reach a peak 1.5-fold that of the control at 13 min after the termination of depolarization (post-depolarization (PD)), which was followed by a dephosphorylation at 15 min PD. However, another phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle was observed between 15 and 30 min PD with maximal phosphorylation at 21 min PD (Fig. 1, A and B). The phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 at 15 min was significantly less than that at 13 and 18 min PD, respectively (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). In contrast, the phosphorylation of Tyr-216 and the total amount of GSK-3β did not show any significant change post-depolarization. This result indicates that KCl-induced depolarization can induce the undulating phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9, suggesting that membrane depolarization might regulate the activity of GSK-3β. Two bands of GSK-3β were observed in the Western blots of SH-SY5Y cells, which corresponded to the alternative spliced forms of the enzyme (8Schaffer B. Wiedau-Pazos M. Geschwind D.H. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 302: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To examine whether the undulating regulation of GSK-3β phosphorylation by membrane depolarization is specific to neurons, the effect of KCl-induced depolarization on the phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 was also analyzed in H19–7/IGF-IR rat embryonic hippocampal cells, PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells, and in A172 human glioblastoma cells. Depolarization by KCl resulted in the undulating phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 in H19–7/IGF-IR cells and in PC12 cells, without changing GSK-3β expression, and the time course of this undulating phosphorylation was similar to that observed in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the same depolarization did not change the phosphorylation status of GSK-3β at Ser-9 in A172 glioblastoma cells. This result suggests that KCl-induced depolarization can result in the undulating phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9 only in excitable neuronal cells. To examine whether the undulating phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9 can elicit corresponding cellular responses, temporal changes in β-catenin content after depolarization were compared with Ser-9 phosphorylation. This was done because β-catenin is a transcription cofactor of T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor in the Wnt pathway and is degraded via GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation (9Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar). β-Catenin contents were found to show an undulating temporal pattern similar to that of Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β. More specifically, β-catenin levels decreased at 0, 13, and 30 min PD when Ser-9 phosphorylation also decreased except at 13 min, and increased at 5 and 18 min PD when Ser-9 phosphorylation increased (Fig. 1D). These parallel changes in β-catenin content and Ser-9 phosphorylation suggest that the undulating phosphorylation of GSK-3β and the resulting undulating activation of GSK-3β might have caused the observed undulating change in β-catenin content via phosphorylation-mediated degradation. PI3K and Akt Mediated Most of the Phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 after KCl-induced Depolarization in SH-SY5Y Cells—To identify the protein kinase responsible for the phosphorylation at Ser-9 following KCl-induced depolarization, the effects of specific inhibitors of several protein kinases on Ser-9 phosphorylation were determined at 5 min PD in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Wortmannin and LY20924, PI3K inhibitors, blocked most of the Ser-9 phosphorylation, and calphostin C, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, also partly inhibited phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test) (Fig. 2A). However, the inhibitors of other protein kinases, namely protein kinase A (H89), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (PD98059), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (KN62), and S6 kinase (rapamycin) had no significant inhibitory effect on Ser-9 phosphorylation at 5 min PD. This result suggests that the depolarization-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3β might be mediated mainly by PI3K and protein kinase C. Because PI3K seemed to be the major kinase responsible for the Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β following KCl-induced membrane depolarization, the temporal pattern of Ser-9 phosphorylation was analyzed after pretreating with wortmannin, to confirm the role of PI3K. The presence of 100 nm wortmannin abolished the basal level of Ser-9 phosphorylation in undepolarized cells, and it also abolished most of the Ser-9 phosphorylation induced by depolarization (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, treatment with another PI3K inhibitor, LY20924, also produced a similar inhibition of Ser-9 phosphorylation (data not shown). This result indicates that PI3K mediates most of the Ser-9 phosphorylation observed after KCl-induced depolarization in SH-SY5Y cells. Because PI3K was identified as the major mediator of Ser-9, we investigated the temporal pattern of Akt activation; Akt is known to be activated by phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473, a process stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates (products of PI3K reactions), and after phosphorylation it phosphorylates GSK-3β. KCl-induced depolarization led to an undulating phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 in SH-SY5Y cells; moreover, the temporal pattern of this phosphorylation was similar to that of the phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9. This phosphorylation of Akt sharply reduced at 0 min PD, then increased to peak at 11 min PD, and then slightly decreased at 15 min PD. Another phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle was observed between 15 and 30 min PD with a phosphorylation peak at 21 min PD (Fig. 2C). The phosphorylation of phosphorylation of Akt at 15 min was significantly decreased from that at 13 and 18 min treatment (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). Moreover, the total amount of Akt was not changed significantly (Fig. 2C). Similar undulating phosphorylations of Akt were observed in H19 –7/IGF-IR rat embryonic hippocampal cells and in PC-12 cells, but notably not in the A172 glioblastoma cells (data not shown). To confirm the role of Akt in Ser-9 phosphorylation, a dominant negative mutant of Akt was overexpressed in SH-SY5Y cells, and its effect on Ser-9 phosphorylation was analyzed at 13 min PD, which showed previously a Ser-9 phosphorylation peak. The overexpression of dominant negative Akt reduced the phosphorylations of Akt at Ser-473 and of GSK-3β at Ser-9 almost to the undepolarized control level (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test) (Fig. 2D). Moreover, mock treatment (data not shown) or the expression of vector alone did not change these phosphorylations of GSK-3β. In addition, treatment with wortmannin attenuated the phosphorylations of both Akt and GSK-3β induced by KCl (Fig. 2B). This result indicates that PI3K and Akt represent a major signaling pathway that phosphorylates GSK-3β at Ser-9 following the KCl-induced depolarization of SH-SY5Y cells. Calcium-dependent Activation of EGFR Was Found to Be Involved in the Phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 following KCl-induced Depolarization in SH-SY5Y Cells—Next, we investigated the signaling molecules involved in the activation of PI3K that induce the phosphorylation of GSK-3β following KCl-induced depolarization. Many growth factors are known to be involved in the activation of PI3K, and membrane depolarization was reported to trigger the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR (10Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of inhibiting EGFR signaling using AG1478, a selective inhibitor of EGFR kinase, on the Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β following KCl-induced depolarization. The inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation partially blocked the phosphorylations of Akt and GSK-3β in a dose-dependent manner at 13 min PD (Fig. 3A). Pretreatment with AG1478 at 20 μm reduced the phosphorylations of Akt and GSK-3β following KCl-induced depolarization, although the inhibitory effect of AG1478 was not as complete as that of wortmannin (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, KCl-induced depolarization resulted in a temporal pattern of EGFR phosphorylation that was similar to the temporal phosphorylation patterns of Akt1 and GSK-3β (Fig. 3C). The cells treated without KCl showed slight increase in EGFR phosphorylation during the same period without similar undulation. This result suggests that the phosphorylation of EGFR is involved in the phosphorylations of Akt and GSK-3β following KCl-induced depolarization. To examine whether calcium influx induced by depolarization can cause the phosphorylation of EGFR following KCl-induced depolarization, we studied the effect of nifedipine (a voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker). Nifedipine almost completely inhibited the EGFR phosphorylation induced by depolarization (Fig. 3C), which confirmed that EGFR activation is dependent on calcium influx through calcium channels, and which suggests that the calcium-dependent activation of EGFR might mediate in part the activation of PI3K and the phosphorylations of Akt and GSK-3β following depolarization. Inhibitors of Protein Phosphatases Inhibited the Dephosphorylation of GSK-3β following KCl-induced Depolarization in SH-SY5Y Cells—The undulating phosphorylation of GSK-3β induced by depolarization seemed to require the action of protein phosphatases as well as protein kinases. Thus, in order to determine whether protein phosphatases are involved in the undulating phosphorylation of GSK-3β, the effects of inhibitors specific for protein phosphatases on the dephosphorylation of GSK-3β were followed. Pretreatment with okadaic acid (an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A) blocked the dephosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 at 0, 15, and 30 min PD (Fig. 4A). Pretreatment with cyclosporin A, a PP2B inhibitor, also blocked the dephosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 at 0, 15, and 30 min PD (Fig. 4B). Another PP2B inhibitor, FK-506, also exhibited similar inhibitory effects on the dephosphorylation of GSK-3β (data not shown). However, pretreatment with okadaic acid, cyclosporin A, or FK-506 only partially blocked the dephosphorylation of Akt at 0, 15, and 30 min PD (Fig. 4, A and B). These results suggest that PP2A and PP2B are involved in the dephosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 and that the dephosphorylation of Akt by PP2A and PP2B might be involved in the dephosphorylation of GSK-3β following depolarization. To support the role of protein phosphatases in the dephosphorylation of GSK-3β, phosphatase activity was analyzed at 0 and 13 min PD in SH-SY5Y cells. The temporal activities of PP2A and PP2B were very similar; both activities were high at 0 min PD and low at 13 min PD, and treatment with nifedipine inhibited the increase in PP2B activity observed at 0 min PD (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test) (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the activities of these protein phosphatases were inversely related to the phosphorylation status of GSK-3β at Ser-9, i.e. high phosphatase activity and low Ser-9 phosphorylation at 0 min PD, and low phosphatase activity and high Ser-9 phosphorylation at 13 min PD. This result suggests that KCl-induced depolarization induces the activations of PP2A and PP2B and that these protein phosphatases are involved in the dephosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 following membrane depolarization. PP2B Activated by Calcium Influx through Voltage-gated Calcium Channels Mediated the Dephosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 following KCl Depolarization in SH-SY5Y Cells— PP2B was identified to play a role in the dephosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 following KCl-induced depolarization; moreover, it is known that PP2B is activated by Ca2+/calmodulin (11Klee C.B. Crouch T.H. Krinks M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6270-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 12Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism of PP2B activation following depolarization, changes in cytosolic free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) were assessed by confocal microscopy using Fluo-4AM dye after KCl-induced depolarization. [Ca2+]i increased gradually to peak at 0 min PD, reduced to a basal level at 5 min PD, and then re-peaked at 15 min PD (Fig. 5, A and B). The cells treated without KCl showed a slight but continuous decrease in [Ca2+]i with a transient drop at 3 min PD that might be caused by media replacement. Moreover, this pattern shown by [Ca2+]i agreed well with PP2B activity and with the dephosphorylation status of GSK-3β at Ser-9 following KCl-induced depolarization, and thus supported the role of PP2B in the dephosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9. This result suggests that a undulating change in [Ca2+]i caused the observed undulating activation of PP2B, which then dephosphorylated GSK-3β following membrane depolarization. To confirm the source of elevated [Ca2+]i following depolarization, we analyzed the effect of calcium-free media, EDTA, and nifedipine on the phosphorylation of GSK-3β. When SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with calcium-free media, the dephosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 at 0, 15, and 30 min PD was inhibited (Fig. 5C). The pretreatment of these cells with EDTA-containing medium also inhibited the dephosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 (data not shown). Moreover, treatment with nifedipine also exhibited a similar inhibitory effect GSK-3β (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that free calcium ion influx through voltage-gated calcium channels activates PP2B, which in turn is involved in the dephosphorylation of GSK-3β following KCl-induced depolarization. Membrane Depolarization Induced a Change in Complex Formation between GSK-3β and PP2A in Parallel with the Dephosphorylation Status of GSK-3β in SH-SY5Y Cells— GSK-3β is known to form a complex with PP2A together with axin, APC, and β-catenin.

Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) immunoreactive inclusions have been found in the spinal cord of ALS animal models and patients, implicating the close involvement of SOD1 aggregates in ALS pathogenesis. Here we examined the molecular mechanism of aggregate formation of ALS-related SOD1 mutants in vitro. We found that long-chain unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) promoted aggregate formation of SOD1 mutants in both dose- and time-dependent manners. Metal-deficient SOD1s, wild-type, and mutants were highly oligomerized compared with holo-SOD1s by incubation in the presence of unsaturated FAs. Oligomerization of SOD1 is closely associated with its structural instability. Heat-treated holo-SOD1 mutants were readily oligomerized by the addition of unsaturated FAs, whereas wild-type SOD1 was not. The monounsaturated FA, oleic acid, directly bound to SOD1 and was characterized by a solid-phase FA binding assay using oleate-Sepharose. The FA binding characteristics were closely correlated with the oligomerization propensity of SOD1 proteins, which indicates that FA binding may change SOD1 conformation in a way that favors the formation of aggregates. High molecular mass aggregates of SOD1 induced by FAs have a granular morphology and show significant cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that SOD1 mutants gain FA binding abilities based on their structural instability and form cytotoxic granular aggregates.

Approximately 10% of ALS patients are familial cases, with autosomal dominant inheritance. More than 90 different mutations in the gene coding for superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) have been identified in about 20% of familial ALS (FALS) families (1Deng H.X. Hentati A. Tainer J.A. Iqbal Z.

Although the molecular mechanisms of selective motor neuron degeneration by SOD1 mutants in FALS remain largely unknown, common pathological features of conformational diseases, as evidenced by SOD1 immunoreactive inclusions, are found in the spinal cord of ALS patients and in the SOD1 mutant FALS mouse model (3Shibata N.

The characteristics of FALS resemble those of many other neurodegenerative diseases in which a causative protein undergoes a conformational rearrangement, which endows it with a tendency to aggregate and form deposits within affected tissues.SOD1 is a 32-kDa homodimeric enzyme that decreases the intracellular concentration of superoxide radicals by catalyzing their dismutation to O2 and H2O2. ALS-linked mutations of SOD1 are distributed throughout the primary and tertiary structures, and most mutations appear unrelated to the dismutase activity. Many biochemical and biophysical studies have reported that SOD1 mutants are structurally unstable compared with wild-type forms (10Stathopulos P.B. Rumfeldt J.A. Scholz G.A. Irani R.A. Frey H.E.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16607-16612Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the mutations primarily affect the structural stability of SOD1 rather than the enzyme activity.The half-life of SOD1 mutants is shorter than that of wild-type forms in cultured cells (14Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). SOD1 mutants form a complex with Hsp70 and CHIP, which promotes degradation of SOD1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (15Urushitani M. Kurisu J. Tateno M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kato S. Takahashi R. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Hsp70 directly binds metal-deficient wild-type SOD1 as well as SOD1 mutants, suggesting that destabilized SOD1 is targeted by the molecular chaperone system (15Urushitani M. Kurisu J. Tateno M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kato S. Takahashi R. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 16Shinder G.A. Lacourse M.C. Minotti S. Durham H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12791-12796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These observations imply that structural stability of SOD1 may also be strongly involved in refolding by the chaperone or in degradation of SOD1 by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. On the other hand, aggregates of mutant SOD1 are observed to have aggresome-like morphology when cells are treated with a proteasome inhibitor (14Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). This aggresome-like morphology resembles pathological inclusions of neurodegenerative diseases in affected tissues. These findings suggest that in disease states, misfolded proteins overwhelm the protein handling systems, including chaperones and proteasomes. Therefore, the formation of cellular inclusions may be required for other factors to act as modulators to promote protein aggregates. In fact, lipid molecules, including unsaturated fatty acids (FAs), phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol, promote amyloidogenesis of amyloid β-peptides, tau (17Wilson D.M. Binder L.I. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 2181-2195PubMed Google Scholar), and α-synuclein (18Sharon R. Goldberg M.S. Bar-Josef I. Betensky R.A. Shen J. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These molecules are biologically significant as mediators for signaling and inflammation during disease progression of neurodegeneration.Here we investigated in vitro SOD1 aggregation affected by FAs to create an aggregation model system for FALS. We demonstrated that unsaturated FAs promote self-assembly and cytotoxic aggregate formation of SOD1. Aggregation by FAs is strongly correlated with structural instability and FA binding activity of SOD1, which may have significant implications in FALS.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression, Purification, and Characterization of Recombinant SOD1 Proteins—pcDNA3-SOD1 (20Urushitani M. Kurisu J. Tsukita K. Takahashi R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1030-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRV and XhoI and subcloned into blunted NcoI and XhoI sites of pET-15(b) (Novagen) to construct the expression plasmid. Expression of recombinant SOD1 proteins was induced in BL21(DE3)pLysS by adding 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 0.1 mm CuCl2, and 0.1 mm ZnCl2 until cells were grown to 0.6 absorbance unit at 600 nm, and then bacterial cells were further cultured at 23 °C for 6 h. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were then disrupted by sonication. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant was collected for further purification. Purification was performed according to Hayward et al. (11Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, ammonium sulfate powder was added to the supernatant to 65% saturation with gentle stirring on ice. The supernatant, after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, was directly loaded for phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column chromatography. The column was thoroughly washed with TNE buffer containing 2 m ammonium sulfate. Proteins were eluted using a linearly decreasing salt gradient. SOD1 activity measurement using a xanthine/xanthine oxidase-based method (21Fried R. Biochimie (Paris). 1975; 57: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) identified fractions containing SOD1. Activity fractions were desalted by ultrafiltration using a centricon filter (Millipore). SOD1 was re-metallated as described previously (22Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The proteins were then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) anion exchange column and eluted using a linearly increasing salt gradient toward a buffer containing 200 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing SOD1 were pooled and concentrated. Homogeneity of SOD1 was >95%, as verified by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Specific activity of the purified enzymes was assayed and calculated by bovine SOD1 (Cayman) or human SOD1 purified from erythrocytes (Sigma-Aldrich) as standards. Fully metallated SOD1 was delipidated using hydroxyalkoxypropyl dextran type III (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (19Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M. Hamilton J.A. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2003; 37: 583-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) before de-metallation. Metal-deficient apo-enzymes were prepared as described previously (23Boissinot M. Karnas S. Lepock J.R. Cabelli D.E. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Hallewell R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2171-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and loss of enzyme activity was confirmed after de-metallation. The metal content of purified enzymes was estimated as described previously (22Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar).Oligomerization of SOD1—A stock solution of 25 mm FAs was prepared in 0.01 m NaOH containing 25 μm butylated hydroxytoluene. SOD1 proteins were filtered through Microcon YM-100 (100-kDa cutoff) filters (Millipore) to remove high molecular mass SOD1 before oligomerization. FAs were added directly to preincubated SOD1 at 37 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm EDTA and further incubated at the same temperature.SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—For detection of SOD1 oligomers, SDS-PAGE was performed under non-reducing conditions using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. After oligomerization of SOD1, protein samples were prepared in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 5% glycerol, and 0.007% bromphenol blue) in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol and then boiled at 95 °C for 3 min before loading. Western blotting was performed as described previously (24Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), followed by UV cross-linking, boiling membranes in 2% SDS and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, for 10 min, and extensive washing in Tris-buffered saline. For detection of SOD1, rabbit anti-SOD1 antibody (Stressgen) was used.Glycerol Density Gradient Centrifugation and Densitometric Analysis—A glycerol linear gradient of 10–40% was prepared in a centrifuge tube. Formation of the SOD1 oligomer was performed as described above. Approximately 200 μl of incubated SOD1 was layered onto a glycerol cushion and separated by centrifugation with a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman) at 35,000 rpm for 15 h. In a parallel experiment, protein standards (Amersham Biosciences) were separated simultaneously in order to calibrate fractions. Fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, and then Western blotting was performed. Western blot images were analyzed using image analysis software (Scion Image Beta 4.02; Scion Corp.).Solid-phase Oleic Acid Binding—Sodium salt of oleic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was coupled to EAH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (Pierce) to prepare oleate-Sepharose according to Peters et al. (25Peters Jr., T. Taniuchi H. Anfinsen Jr., C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2447-2451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oleic acid coupling was verified by binding bovine serum albumin and recombinant α-synuclein protein. Mock-Sepharose was prepared from EAH-Sepharose by blocking coupling ligand with 1 m acetic acid. For the binding assay, 200 ng of Microcon-filtered protein was incubated with oleate-Sepharose or mock-Sepharose in 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 30 min with agitation. Protein bound to Sepharose was settled on a spun column and washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. The bound protein was then eluted with 50% ethanol. Eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.Transmission Electron Microscopy—SOD1 proteins (40 μm) were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm EDTA supplemented with 100 μm arachidonic acid. The samples were absorbed to a glow-charged supporting membrane on 400-mesh grids and fixed by floating on 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 5 min. After three washes with distilled water, samples were negatively stained by 2% sodium phosphotungstic acid and dried. Specimens were observed in a LEO 912AB electron microscope (LEO Electron Microscopy), operated at 100 kV.Toxicity Assay—Cytotoxicity of protein aggregates was measured as described previously (26Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2131) Google Scholar, 27Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3403) Google Scholar). In brief, neuro2a mouse neuroblastoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were differentiated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.3 mm dibutylyl cAMP before use. Cells were plated at 30,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and differentiated overnight. The medium was removed, and prepared SOD1 aggregates were added in new medium without phenol red. After incubation for 18 h at 37 °C, the cells were assayed using an MTS reduction assay kit (Promega). Another plate also treated as described above was stained for 1 min with trypan blue, and stained cells were counted as dead cells.RESULTSUnsaturated Fatty Acids Promote Self-assembly of SOD1s— We expressed and homogeneously purified recombinant human SOD1s from the bacterial expression system (Fig. 1A). The purified wild-type and G93A enzymes showed comparable specific activity; however, A4V mutant showed ∼56% activity compared with that of wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1B). The zinc ion content of the purified enzymes showed almost full occupancy; however, copper ion content of A4V was 54.5% of the wild-type level (Fig. 1C). Specific activity was correlated with copper ion occupancy of purified enzyme, indicating proper metal loading in the active site.We next examined the effect of long-chain FAs on oligomerization of SOD1 proteins. Wild-type and mutant (A4V and G93A) SOD1 were incubated with various concentrations of arachidonic acid (AA) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After incubation, oligomerized SOD1 was subjected to SDS-PAGE and then detected by Western blotting. Under reducing conditions, mainly bands of ∼16 and 38 kDa, corresponding to monomer and dimmer sizes of SOD1, respectively, were detected (Fig. 2A). In contrast, under non-reducing conditions, smeared patterns of >50 kDa in size were supposed to be SOD1 oligomers (Fig. 2A). These observations suggest that disulfide bonds maintained SOD1 oligomers. Thus, non-reducing SDS-PAGE was thought to be an efficient method to detect SOD1 oligomers and aggregates. Among the holo-enzymes, wild-type and G93A were not oligomerized; instead, they segregated as monomer and dimer size bands (Fig. 2B, top panel). After incubation with >100 μm AA, holo-A4V showed a faint smear pattern that was seen from 50 kDa to near the stacking gel range beside monomer- and dimer-size bands (Fig. 2B, top panel). In contrast, all metal-deficient enzymes, regardless of mutations, were oligomerized in the presence of >30 μm AA (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). Apo-enzymes demonstrated higher oligomerization propensity than holo-enzymes depending on AA concentration (Fig. 2B). Thus, AA efficiently promoted oligomerization of SOD1s.Fig. 2Arachidonic acid promotes SOD1 oligomerization. A, FA-inducing oligomers of SOD1 were separated using SDS-PAGE with or without β-mercaptoethanol. B, apo-enzymes of SOD1 mutants (2.5 μm) were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μm AA. At each time point, aliquots were placed on ice to stop the reaction. C, purified holo- or apo-SOD1 proteins (2.5 μm) were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min in the presence of the indicated AA concentration. Incubated proteins were mixed directly with SDS-PAGE treatment buffer without reducing agents and boiled. SDS-PAGE was performed under non-reducing conditions. Proteins were detected by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Arrows indicate the position of stacking gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we performed a time-course analysis of SOD1 oligomerization in the presence of AA. Metal-deficient G93A and A4V were oligomerized in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Maximum oligomerization was reached within 60 min of incubation in the presence of AA (Fig. 2C).We then examined the effect that various FAs, including stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and AA, have on SOD1 oligomerization. Unsaturated FAs, including oleic acid, linoleic acid, and AA, promoted SOD1 oligomerization (Fig. 3). However, saturated FAs and stearic acid had little effect on SOD1 oligomerization (Fig. 3). SOD1 oligomerization induced by FAs required at least monounsaturated FAs. This result may reflect the difference of solubility between unsaturated and saturated FAs in the buffer.Fig. 3Unsaturated fatty acids affect oligomerization of SOD1. Apo-enzymes of SOD1 mutants were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min in the presence of FAs at concentrations of 100 μm: 18:0, stearic acid; 18:1, oleic acid; 18:2, linoleic acid; and 20:4, arachidonic acid. Arrows indicate the position of stacking gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We verified the formation of SOD1 oligomers using a 10–40% glycerol density gradient centrifugation because presumable artifacts after detection of SOD1 oligomers using non-reducing SDS-PAGE may have remained. After fractionation, we could not observe high molecular mass SOD1 oligomers from the incubated sample in the absence of AA; fractions were <67 kDa and potentially represented monomer and dimer states (Fig. 4A, top panel). In contrast, we detected high molecular mass oligomers in fractions of >440 kDa from the incubated sample in the presence of AA (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). Under these conditions, SOD1 with molecular mass of <67 kDa was dramatically decreased compared with the sample incubated in the absence of AA (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). Although oligomers of >440 kDa were fractionated by the glycerol density gradient centrifugation, these were detected as monomer, dimer, and smeared high molecular mass bands that reached stacking gels under non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). This indicates oligomers are partly disrupted during the boiling of the SDS-PAGE loading buffer. We next performed densitometric analysis from Western blotting images to estimate the amount of oligomerized SOD1 (Fig. 4B). The resulting image analysis found that immunoreactivity for oligomers was ∼80% of the total immunoreactivity.Fig. 4Glycerol density gradient centrifugation and densitometric analysis of SOD1 oligomers. A, apo-A4V (2.5 μm) was incubated at 37 °C for 90 min in the absence or presence of 100 μm AA before loading on the glycerol cushion. After centrifugation, fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes and then subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. SOD1 proteins were detected by Western blotting. B, for densitometric analysis, we measured mean density per lane after background subtraction. Total mean density was similar under each condition, by calculating the mean density of visible lanes (lanes 1–8 for oligomers and lanes 21–25 for dimer or monomer). Arrows indicate the position of stacking gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Structural Instability of SOD1 Is Correlated to Oligomerization Propensity and FA Binding—We showed the FA-induced oligomerization propensity of apo-SOD1s was higher than that of holo-SOD1. This implies that protein stability might be strongly associated with FA-induced oligomerization propensity. Among the holo-enzymes, wild-type and G93A were not oligomerized under our experimental conditions (Fig. 2B, top panel). To examine the correlation between oligomerization propensity and protein stability of holo-enzymes, holo-SOD1 was heated and then oligomerized by AA. In the absence of AA, only heat-treated A4V was oligomerized (Fig. 5, left panel). In the presence of AA, heat-treated G93A and A4V were highly aggregated, but under the same conditions, wild-type SOD1 was not (Fig. 5, right panel). Oligomerization was observed above 58 °C for G93A and above 48 °C for A4V (Fig. 5, right panel). In the previous study, A4V was more unstable than G93A for heat treatment analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (12Rodriguez J.A. Valentine J.S. Eggers D.K. Roe J.A. Tiwari A. Brown Jr., R.H. Hayward L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15932-15937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This result suggests that structural instability is strongly correlated with oligomerization propensity induced by FAs.Fig. 5Thermally destabilized SOD1 mutants show a high oligomerization propensity. Holo-enzymes were heat-treated at the indicated temperatures for 30 min before addition of 100 μm AA and then further incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. SDS-PAGE was performed under non-reducing conditions. Proteins were detected by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Arrows indicate the position of stacking gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although we showed that FAs promoted SOD1 oligomerization, the mechanism is not perfectly understood. Similarly, unsaturated FAs oligomerize α-synuclein and tau. In the case of α-synuclein and tau, FAs were bound to proteins, which suggested that oligomerization mechanisms underlie the FA binding characteristics of protein. To examine whether SOD1 binds to FAs, we carried out a solid-phase oleic acid binding assay. Among the holo-enzymes, very small amounts of holo-A4V were bound to the oleate-Sepharose column, whereas wild-type and G93A were not (Fig. 6A). All of the apo-enzymes were bound to oleate-Sepharose, regardless of their mutations (Fig. 6A). In contrast, bound proteins were not observed in mock-Sepharose (Fig. 6A). Nearly all of the input amounts of metal-deficient proteins were bound, which was estimated by 50% input. This finding suggests that metal-deficient SOD1 proteins strongly bind to FAs. We next examined whether heat-treated holo-enzymes bind to FAs. Apo-enzymes were used as control binding. Heat-treated SOD1 mutant (G93A) at 58 °C and 68 °C was bound to FAs, whereas wild-type was not (Fig. 6B). The results of the FA binding assay were strongly correlated with the oligomerization propensity of SOD1. These findings suggest that FA binding alters the conformation of SOD1 to form oligomers.Fig. 6Solid-phase oleic acid binding assay shows apo-SOD1 or thermally destabilized SOD1 bound to oleate-Sepharose. A, solid-phase binding assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Approximately 50% input (100 ng of proteins) was electrophoresed to estimate the quantity of FA binding SOD1. B, holo-SOD1s (wild-type and G93A) were thermally destabilized at the indicated temperatures for 30 min and then directly loaded on oleate-Sepharose. Apo-enzymes were used as positive controls for oleic acid binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FA-induced SOD1 Aggregates Result in Granular Morphology and"

In Alzheimer disease, amyloid-β (Aβ) is thought to play a central role in the neuronal death occurring in brains of patients. In the present study, we evaluate the ability of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) to protect neurons against the toxicity induced by aggregated Aβ. We showed that in primary cultures of cortical neurons, NT-3 reduces Aβ-induced apoptosis by limiting caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 cleavage. This neuroprotective effect of NT-3 was concomitant to an increased level of Akt phosphorylation and was abolished by an inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K), LY294002. In parallel, NT-3 treatment reduced Aβ induced caspase-3 processing to control levels. In an attempt to link PI-3K/Akt to caspase inhibition, we evaluated the influence of the PI-3K/Akt axis on the expression of a member of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein-1. We demonstrated that NT-3 induces an up-regulation of neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein-1 expression in neurons that promotes the inhibition of Aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis. Together, these findings demonstrate that NT-3 signaling counters Aβ-dependent neuronal cell death and may represent an innovative therapeutic intervention to limit neuronal death in Alzheimer disease.

Aβ is thought to play a central role in the neuronal death occurring in brains of AD patients. The importance of Aβ is notably supported by the effects of genetic mutations that cause familial AD (4Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar), all of which predispose to amyloid deposition. Moreover, fibrillar Aβ is specifically neurotoxic in primary cortical neurons, whereas soluble monomeric Aβ is not (5Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A.

Neuronal death induced by fibrillar Aβ exposure displays characteristic features of apoptosis including plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation (7Loo D.T. Copani A.

Caspases are cysteine aspartate proteases regulating the entry of the cell into programmed cell death by two principal pathways: the Fas/TNF receptor-mediated pathway associated with caspase-8 and the mitochondria-dependent pathway linked with caspase-9 (8Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar). The caspases 8 and 9, also called initiator caspases, trigger the activation of the effector caspases. Following Aβ treatment, activation of several caspases has been identified in dying neurons (9Ivins K.J. Thornton P.L. Rohn T.T. Cotman C.W. Neurobiol.

Brain Res. 1999; 842: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), highlighting the contribution of apoptosis to Aβ-induced toxicity. During brain development, where apoptosis plays a fundamental role in regulating cell fate (16Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), neurotrophins (NTs) antagonize naturally occurring programmed cell death and thus promote neuronal survival in many mammalian species (17Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Four related members of the neurotrophin growth factor family have been identified: nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5). They act on a set of high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors (18Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar) (i.e. TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC). When activated, Trk receptors are autophosphorylated within tyrosine residues located at the cytoplasmic tail of Trk receptors, which serve as docking sites for kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K). Because of their survival promoting properties during development, a widely held concept has emerged: neurotrophins may represent a potential candidate for therapeutic treatment of neurobiological disorders (19Smith D.E. Roberts J. Gage F.H. Tuszynski M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10893-10898Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Indeed, experimentally NTs have been shown to attenuate the neuronal death induced by various types of insults (20Koh J.Y. Gwag B.J. Lobner D. Choi D.W. Science. 1995; 268: 573-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 21Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Recently, a clinical trial with nerve growth factor for the treatment of early onset Alzheimer disease began in 2001 at the University of California (22Tuszynski M.H. Lancet Neurol. 2002; 1: 51-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Among these growth factors, NT 3 has raised a particular interest as a potential therapeutic tool for limiting neuronal death during AD. Opposite to brain-derived neurotrophic factor, whose expression is up-regulated in the brains of AD patients, NT-3 expression decreases during adult life (16Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), and treatment with recombinant NT-3 might offer protection to neurons from the proapoptotic environment observed in AD. In the present study, we investigate how and by which mechanism recombinant NT-3 may protect neurons against Aβ-induced apoptotic cell death. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, poly-d-lysine, cytosine β-d-arabinoside (AraC), horse and fetal calf sera, propidium iodine, hydrochloride (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride) (LY294002), anti-MAP-2, and anti-actin antibodies were obtained from Sigma. N-Methyl-d-aspartate, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, kainate, and (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,b)cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate were from Tocris (Bristol, UK). Laminin was from Invitrogen. Mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor U0126 was from Promega France (Charbonnieres, France), and recombinant human neurotrophin-3 was obtained from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Primary Cell Cultures—Mouse cortical cultures of neurons were prepared from 14–15-day-old embryos as previously described (23Rose K. Goldberg M.P. Choi D.W. Tyson C.A. Frazier J.M. Methods in toxicology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 46-60Google Scholar), plated in 2-cm3 dishes previously coated with poly-d-lysine and 0.5 mg/ml laminin. Cultures were performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm of glutamine in the presence of 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. After 3 days in vitro, neurons were treated with 10 μm AraC to inhibit proliferation of nonneuronal cells. Experiments were realized on pure neuronal cultures (>98% microtubule-associated protein-2 immunoreactive cells) after 12–14 days in vitro. Aβ Exposures—Amyloid-β peptides (Aβ-(25–35) and Aβ-(1–42)) (Sigma) were dissolved in sterile deionized water to obtain a stock solution of 2 mm. Aβs were kept at 37 °C for 48 h and stored at 4 °C until use. The presence of fibrillar Aβ was estimated by SDS-PAGE prior to application onto cultured neurons. Aβ-induced apoptosis was performed in the presence of (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,b)cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (10 μm) to prevent excitotoxic cell death. Estimation of Neuronal Cell Death—Toxicity was determined by estimating the activity of lactate dehydrogenase released in the media by dying neurons and by counting of apoptotic neurons eliciting either nuclear DNA condensation or DNA fragmentation by stained by 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (1 μg/ml). Application of DAPI was realized onto paraformaldehyde-fixed neurons for 30 min, and then neuronal cultures were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. Apoptotic and total neurons were blind counted, and the ratio between neurons displaying morphological nuclear changes and total neurons stained was performed to assess apoptotis-induced toxicity. DNA-Agarose Electrophoresis—Genomic DNA was harvested by using the Wizard® Genomic DNA kit (Promega, Charbonnières, France) as described by the manufacturer. DNA amounts were estimated by spectrometry and loaded into 3% agarose electrophoresis gels containing 0.1% ethidium bromide. Gels were visualized by UV illumination and acquired with a CCD camera. Western Blotting—Cells were harvested in a lysis solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm, supernatants were isolated, and the corresponding pellet was resuspended with the protease inhibitor-containing lysis buffer to extract membrane-bound proteins. Plasma membranes were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in the presence of protease inhibitors (Sigma). Once resuspended, membrane lysates were subjected to centrifugation, and the soluble fraction was removed for electrophoresis analysis. Protein amounts were determined by the Bradford protein assay (BCA protein assay; Pierce) and normalized to 20–30 μg of protein/sample. Electrophoreses were done on 12.5–20% SDS-polyacrylamide Tris/glycine gels. Thereafter, gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Polyscreen® membrane; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), membranes were blocked in nonfat milk containing 4% bovine serum albumin and probed with appropriate antibodies. Blots were finally developed with an ECL Western blotting detection system (Western Lightning™ Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (Enhanced Luminol); PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitations—Aliquots (30 μg) of cell extracts were diluted to 100 μl with dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) and incubated with 1 μl of 22C11 antibody or the R7 antiserum. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C and mixed with 20 μl of Protein G-Sepharose, Fast Flow® (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The beads were washed twice in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) and twice with Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), and then proteins were eluted in 50 μl of loading SDS-PAGE buffer by boiling. Fluorescent Immunocytochemistry—Primary cortical neurons cultures were fixed with paraformadehyde and washed, and nonspecific sites were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) for 30 min and incubated overnight with the primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline plus 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20. Cells were then washed and incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary biotin-conjugated antibody, secondary Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated antibodies (Molecular Probes Europe, Leiden, The Netherlands). Antibodies—The following primary antibodies were used: Asp175 (1:500) against cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technologies, Ozyme, Montigny Le Bretonneux, France), anti-caspase-8 (1:5000) (Calbiochem), anti-caspase-9 (1:1000) (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada), phospho-Akt (Ser473) and Akt antibodies (1:1000 and 1:50) (Cell Signaling Technologies), sc-11067 (1:200) against NAIP-1, sc-7383 (1:200) and sc-93 [1:200] against phospho-ERKs and ERKs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Heidelberg, Germany), and antibodies raised against MAP-2 (1:200) and actin (1:250), respectively (Sigma). Densitometric Analysis—Agarose gels or blots from three independent experiments were acquired by a CCD camera and saved in a resolution of 600 dpi for software analysis. PCR products and Western blot signals were quantified by two-dimensional densitometry analysis with OptiQuant® software (Packard Instrument Co.). Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis were performed with StatView (Abacus, Berkeley, CA) by one-way variance analysis (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni-Dunn's test or Student's t test. NT-3 Protects Neurons against Aβ-induced Toxicity—To study the potential activity of NT-3 against neuronal death mediated by Aβ, we exposed primary cultures of mouse cortical neurons (14 days in vitro) to Aβ-(25–35) for 24 h. The Aβ-(25–35) peptide is a fragment of Aβ previously described to reproduce neurotoxicity of full-length Aβ peptides (5Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). Aβ-induced neuronal death was estimated by measurement of the lactate dehydrogenase activity in the extracellular media and by counting in a blind manner neurons stained by DAPI displaying nuclear DNA alterations (i.e. condensation and internucleosomal fragmentation). A 24-h exposure to Aβ-(25–35) induced approximately 40% of neuronal death (Fig. 1) which displayed the characteristic feature of apoptosis (i.e. cell body shrinkage; nuclear condensation). This neuronal death was prevented by the co-application of the inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide (CHX), a compound that has been shown to protect against several apoptotic paradigms in neurons (20Koh J.Y. Gwag B.J. Lobner D. Choi D.W. Science. 1995; 268: 573-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To test the influence of NT-3 on Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, we applied NT-3 at 0.1, 1, and 10 ng/ml in the presence of Aβ-(25–35) for 24 h (Fig. 1B). We found that NT-3 elicits a neuroprotective activity in a dose-dependant manner with a maximum effect at 10 ng/ml. Next, we studied the action of NT-3 (at 10 ng/ml) against Aβ-induced apoptosis at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h (Fig. 2A). Neuronal death could be observed at 6 h following application of aggregated Aβ-(25–35). NT-3 rescued ∼50% (46.92 ± 9.47) and 33% (33.57 ± 11.21) of neurons after 12 or 24 h of incubation of aggregated Aβ-(25–35), respectively. NT-3 Attenuates Aβ-induced Caspase Cleavage—As previously described (9Ivins K.J. Thornton P.L. Rohn T.T. Cotman C.W. Neurobiol. Dis. 1999; 6: 440-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 10LeBlanc A. Liu H. Goodyer C. Bergeron C. Hammond J. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7551-7560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Aβ exposure in neurons led to the processing of inactive procaspase-8 and -9 into their active forms. Similarly a 3–4-fold increase of activated caspase-3 (p20) was also detected following Aβ treatment. CHX, a protein synthase inhibitor characterized for its antiapoptotic activity abolished caspase activation induced by Aβ (Fig. 2B). Similarly, NT-3 treatment at 10 ng/ml reduced both Aβ-induced neuronal cell death and the activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 (Fig. 2C). Next we investigated which survival-promoting pathways activated by NT-3 are responsible for the observed neuroprotection. The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, including extracellular-signal regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and ERK5, has been identified as one of the survival-promoting pathways used by NTs in the central nervous system (18Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 24Berhow M.T. Hiroi N. Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4707-4715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hu Y.Q. Koo P.H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 26Cavanaugh J.E. Ham J. Hetman M. Poser S. Yan C. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 434-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Watson F.L. Heerssen H.M. Bhattacharyya A. Klesse L. Lin M.Z. Segal R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of the ERK family members to NT-3-induced neuroprotection against Aβ neurotoxicity, we used the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (at 10 μm), which also inhibits ERK5 activation (26Cavanaugh J.E. Ham J. Hetman M. Poser S. Yan C. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 434-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The co-treatment of NT-3 with U0126 did not abolish the neuroprotective effect of the neurotrophin, indicating that ERKs do not contribute to this process (Fig. 3A). To confirm these pharmacological data, we estimated ERK1/2 activation by performing a Western blotting of the proteins recovered from neurons exposed to Aβ at 15 min, 1 h, 12 h, and 24 h in the presence of NT-3. As previously reported, NT-3 alone induced a transient phosphorylation of ERKs 15 min and 1 h after its incubation (Fig. 3, B and C). Aβ treatment alone led to an activation of ERKs, which was slightly enhanced by co-application of NT-3 without, however, being significant. Whereas phospho-ERKs were markedly detected during the first 1 h of treatment, they declined to basal levels at either 12 or 24 h (Fig. 3C). NTs have also been described as a putative activator of the PI-3K/Akt pathway. This pathway has been the subject of emerging interest over the past years for its ability to reduce Aβ-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells or in neuroblastoma cell lines (28Martin D. Salinas M. Lopez-Valdaliso R. Serrano E. Recuero M. Cuadrado A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1000-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Wei W. Wang X. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17649-17656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To determine whether NT-3 mediates its protective effect against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in primary cultured cortical neurons through the activation of the PI-3K/Akt pathway, we first tested the influence of the PI-3K pathway inhibitor, LY294002. Because several studies have shown that the LY294002 alone induces apoptosis in primary neuronal culture, we chose a concentration of LY294002 that did not show any proapoptotic activity on its own (at 10 μm). The co-application of LY294002 reversed the neuroprotection promoted by NT-3, whereas LY294002 alone did not exert any detrimental effect (Fig. 3D). Accordingly, Western blotting revealed that Akt is rapidly phosphorylated and remained activated under NT-3 exposure alone or in the presence of Aβ for 12 or 24 h (Fig. 4A). The addition of LY294002 (pretreatment plus co-treatment) prevented NT-3-induced phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 4B). Finally, neurons exposed to Aβ and LY294002 did not exhibit phospho-Akt levels different from controls. Under the same experimental conditions, active caspase-3 levels (p20) were reduced in the conditions when phospho-Akt was detected (Fig. 4B). Conversely, immunocytological studies reveal that neurons eliciting phospho-Akt473 immunoreactivity did not exhibit characteristic apoptotic nuclear alterations (Fig. 4C), suggesting that NT-3-mediated Akt activation rescued cortical neurons from Aβ-induced apoptosis. In addition, we determined by immunoblotting the level of activated initiator caspases in neurons exposed to Aβ in the presence of NT-3 and LY294002 (Fig. 5). NT-3 treatment (at 10 ng/ml) lowered both levels of activated caspase-8 and -9, whereas co-application of LY294002 restored levels of the proapoptotic forms of caspases to those observed in neurons exposed to Aβ alone. Activation of the PI-3K/Akt Pathway Induces NAIP-1 Expression—PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway has been described as a putative activator of proteins involved in regulating cell survival in various cell systems (30Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Among these potential targets of the PI-3K/Akt pathway, members of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), a family of proteins that directly inhibit caspase function (i.e. XIAP and HIAP (human IAP), and NAIP (neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein)) have raised particular interest as a potential target for antiapoptotic drug treatment (31Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown in different cell systems that Akt activates the expression of survival IAP genes (32Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 33Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

First, we performed double immunochemistry experiments in primary cortical neurons exposed to Aβ that revealed a co-localization of NAIP-1 with phospho-Akt-immunoreactive neurons when treated NT-3 (Fig. 6A). To confirm this link between the PI-3K/Akt pathway and NAIP up-regulation, we estimated the level of expression of NAIP-1 by Western blotting (Fig. 6B). We observed a ∼2–2.5-fold increase in NAIP-1 expression induced by NT-3 alone. This up-regulation of NAIP-1 expression induced by NT-3 was also observable when experiments were performed in the presence of Aβ. This effect was abolished by the co-application of LY294002, an inhibitor of the PI-3K pathway. Because the antiapoptotic activity of IAP proteins is inhibited by a mitochodria-derived activator of caspase, the protein SMAC (also called Diablo), we performed immunoprecipitations with an antibody raised against NAIP-1, and we revealed the blots with an antibody raised against SMAC to determine whether NT-3 influences its interaction with SMAC (Fig. 6C). We found that Aβ application resulted in the formation of a Smac-NAIP-1 complex in the cytosol, whereas SMAC was nearly undetectable in controls. Co-treatment of NT-3 prevented formation of such a complex. Of note, NT-3-induced NAIP-1 up-regulation was confirmed in these conditions. In addition, co-incubation with LY294002 restored the formation of the deleterious assembly of NAIP-1-SMAC. To resume, these results suggest that the antiapoptotic effect of NT-3 on Aβ-induced neurotoxicity could be due to both an increased expression of NAIP-1 and a reduced interaction between NAIP-1 and SMAC by a mechanism dependent on PI-3K/Akt activation. NT-3 Protects Neurons from Aβ-(1–42)-induced Neurotoxicity—In the brain of AD patients, Aβ-(1–42) has been identified as a potential source of neuronal dysfunction and toxicity. To test whether the NT-3 induced neuroprotective effect against the toxicity induced by the artificial peptide Aβ-(25–35) was also present in neurons exposed to Aβ-(1–42), we evaluated by Western blotting levels of active caspase-3 (Fig. 7, A and B) and nuclear morphology (Fig. 7B), following the incubation of aggregated Aβ-(1–42) (at 20 μm) in the presence of 10 ng/ml NT-3. Both methods confirmed that NT-3 application reduced the neurotoxicity of Aβ-(1–42). Indeed, incubation of NT-3 lowered the level of active caspase-3 and the presence of neuronal nuclear DNA alterations. As previously described with Aβ-(25–35), treatment with LY294002 abolished the neuroprotective activity of NT-3, whereas the application of U0126 was not able to reverse NT-3 neuroprotective effects (Fig. 7C). AD is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the abnormal accumulation of small aggregative peptides (Aβs) in brain tissue that leads to severe cortical dystrophy (4Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). To determine the biochemical pathways involved on the neurotoxic action of aggregated Aβ, studies on primary cell culture systems have been extensively used. Various deleterious mechanisms have been identified to support Aβ-induced cell toxicity, and there is now a large consensus in the scientific community that application of aggregated Aβ induces neuronal apoptosis in primary neuronal cultures (37Cotman C.W. Anderson A.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 10: 19-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 38Hugon J. Terro F. Esclaire F. Yardin C. J. Neural. Transm.

However, no valid therapeutic approaches have emerged from these studies. Here, we describe that a growth factor, NT-3, is able to reduce the proapoptotic action of aggregated Aβ on primary cortical neurons. This effect is mediated by the activation of PI-3K/Akt pathway and results in the reduction of Aβ-induced caspases activation. In addition, we identified the mechanism by which NT-3 limits caspase activation; NT-3 induces both an increased expression of NAIP-1, a neuronal form of IAPs that can directly inhibit caspases, and a reduced interaction between NAIP and its endogenous inhibitor SMAC. Because IAPs has been shown to reduce activation of caspase-3 and -9 in many systems, it is likely that the effect of NT-3 is downstream of caspase-8 activation. Significant progress has been made in identifying the molecular mechanisms causing neuronal cell death in AD. Rare genetic cases of AD that develop an early onset have provided mechanistic insights relevant to most common sporadic cases. This has led to the hypothesis that familial and probably sporadic AD is initially caused by an abnormal accumulation of Aβ. Although the role of oligomeric forms of Aβ has been recently reappraised (40Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J.

Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar), it is generally believed that aggregated forms of Aβ are responsible for the neurotoxic actions observed in AD. Here we showed that aggregated Aβ triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis in primary cortical neurons. Similar results were obtained by others in primary culture systems (9Ivins K.J. Thornton P.L.

More recently, analyses from post-mortem tissue from patient, transgenic animal and cell culture system experiments have confirmed the putative implication apoptosis in the pathophysiology of AD. A possible therapeutic approach of AD is to develop strategies to block the apoptotic trigger or to develop antiapoptotic strategies. Because neurotrophins have been identified as one of the most powerful antiapoptotic agents in the CNS, it was tempting to test the influence of NT-3 against Aβ-induced apoptosis. We report that NT-3-induced neuroprotection against Aβ-driven apoptosis requires the activation of the PI-3K/Akt pathway, which induces an up-regulation of the expression of NAIP-1, a protein that directly inhibits caspase-3 and -7 (42Maier J.K. Lahoua Z. Gendron N.H. Fetni R. Johnston A. Davoodi J. Rasper D. Roy S. Slack R.S. Nicholson D.W. MacKenzie A.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2035-2043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PI-3K/Akt has already been identified as second messenger system providing antiapoptotic signal to various cell types (30Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Upon activation of this signaling pathway, the induction of the IAP family members, including XIAP and HIAP (also called ITA) by PI-3K/Akt, has been reported in different cell types (32Chu Z.L.

Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Goodyer C.G. LeBlanc A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7385-7394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that p75NTR-induced neuroprotection against extracellular Aβ toxicity was dependent on PI-3K but not Akt in primary human neurons. Their data and ours strengthen the importance of the PI-3K/Akt pathway in Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in primary neuronal cultures. Finally, we reported that whereas Aβ application promotes the formation of a Smac-NAIP-1 complex enhancing caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways, NT-3 prevents this association. Thus, by enhancing NAIP-1 expression, NT-3 treatment decreases caspase activation and reduces Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. The NAIP gene encodes for a protein of 156 kDa with a strong homology to the other inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (42Maier J.K. Lahoua Z. Gendron N.H. Fetni R. Johnston A. Davoodi J. Rasper D. Roy S. Slack R.S. Nicholson D.W. MacKenzie A.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2035-2043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An antiapoptotic effect of NAIP and other members of the human IAP family has been shown in many cell culture systems. However, the mode of action of NAIP is not as well understood as its family homologues. MacKenzie's group (46Davoodi J. Lin L. Kelly J. Liston P. MacKenzie A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40622-40628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) recently pointed out that NAIP overexpressed in HeLa cells was able to bind to caspase-9 in the presence of ATP in an SMAC-independent manner. Although we do not know whether NT-3-induced up-regulation of NAIP-1 led to a binding with caspase-9, under our conditions, we report that endogenous NAIP-1 is able to complex with SMAC in primary cortical neurons subjected to Aβ fibrils. To summarize, our results provide a strong support for a model in which NAIP is playing a critical role in regulation of Aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis by directly inhibiting effector caspases. In addition to the regulation of NAIP-1 expression by the PI-3K/Akt axis, this same signaling pathway can also affect other proteins that are able to inhibit apoptosis, including the FOXO family of Forkhead transcription factors (47Weigel D. Jurgens G. Kuttner F. Seifert E. Jackle H. Cell. 1989; 57: 645-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 48Weigel D. Jackle H. Cell. 1990; 63: 455-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Indeed, once activated, Akt can directly phosphorylate all three of FOXO members and trigger their translocation out of the nucleus, preventing these factors from inducing the transcription of proapoptotic genes (49Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar, 50Tran H. Brunet A. Griffith E.C. Greenberg M.E. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the links of both apoptosis-inhibitory pathways to Akt activation could converge and potentially be additive in preventing Aβ-induced neuronal death. Nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression are increased in brains of AD patients (51Narisawa-Saito M. Nawa H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 52Hock C. Heese K. Hulette C. Rosenberg C. Otten U. Arch.

Neurosci. 2000; 18: 807-813Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Such up-regulation may be related to physiopathology of AD and may correspond to a stress response from brain cells. The recent discovery that a neurotrophin precursor protein and its proteolytically processed products may activate pro- and antiapoptotic cellular responses questioned the beneficial consequences of such increased expression (54Chao M.V. Bothwell M. Neuron. 2002; 33: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Opposite to nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NT-3 is mainly expressed during development and is not present in the adult (51Narisawa-Saito M. Nawa H. J.

In the present study, we reduced neuronal vulnerability to aggregated Aβ by activating NT-3 signaling through a molecular mechanism involving NAIP increased expression. Thus, we postulate that the stimulation of NAIP expression into neuronal cell exposed to proapoptotic stimuli may represent an innovative therapeutic strategy to limit the extent of neuronal lesion occurring in the brain of an AD patient.

https://openalex.org/W2091875431,"Kennedy disease, a degenerative disorder caused by an expanded glutamine tract, is mediated by misfolding of the mutant androgen receptor (AR) protein, a process that may disrupt proteasome function. We hypothesized that this might lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a complex physiologic pathway that regulates cell survival. To test this hypothesis, we used aminoterminal fragments of wild type (AR16Q) or mutant (AR112Q) AR that triggered glutamine length-dependent cell death and activated an ER stress-inducible promoter. To evaluate the role of the UPR, we examined the contributions of three proximal sensors of ER stress: activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), inositol requiring 1 (IRE1), and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). AR112Q toxicity was significantly increased by a dominant negative ATF6 mutant and significantly decreased by a constitutively active ATF6 mutant, indicating that ATF6 promoted cell survival. In contrast, co-transfection with three separate IRE1α dominant negative mutants failed to alter glutamine length-dependent toxicity, suggesting that this arm of the UPR did not significantly affect AR112Q induced cell death. Activation of PERK, an ER transmembrane protein that functions as the third proximal UPR sensor, promoted glutamine length-dependent toxicity. Although nuclear localization sequence- and nuclear export sequence-targeted proteins both activated the UPR, this pathway more potently influenced toxicity when proteins were targeted to the cytoplasm. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the UPR is activated in cells expressing long glutamine tracts and that this pathway modulates polyglutamine toxicity.

A diverse group of neurodegenerative diseases is characterized by the presence of aggregated or misfolded proteins that accumulate either within neurons or in the neuropil. Among these disorders are ones caused by expansions of CAG/glutamine tracts (1Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Kennedy disease, a member of this group, is a chronic, progressive neuromuscular disease characterized by proximal muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations (2Lieberman A.P. Fischbeck K.H. Muscle Nerve. 2000; 23: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cause of this disorder is the expansion of a CAG repeat in the first exon of the androgen receptor (AR) 1The abbreviations used are: AR, androgen receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein response; ATF6, activating transcription factor 6; IRE1, inositol requiring 1; PERK, PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α; BiP, binding immunoglobulin protein; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; UPRE, unfolded protein response element; DN, dominant negative; CA, constitutively active; NES, nuclear export sequence; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. gene (3La Spada A.R.

The mutant AR protein misfolds and aggregates, leading to both a toxic gain-of-function and a partial loss of normal function (2Lieberman A.P. Fischbeck K.H.

Studies in cell-based and animal models have suggested that the misfolded, mutant AR, like other proteins with expanded glutamine tracts, may exert toxic affects by disrupting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, by sequestering other factors such as transcriptional co-regulators or by impairing synaptic function and axonal transport (5Orr H.T.

Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and death by disrupting signaling pathways and by limiting the capacity of cells to degrade misfolded or damaged proteins.

Among the targets for degradation by the proteasome are those generated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during the processing of soluble and membrane-bound proteins (17McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 868-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These misfolded products are retrotransported to the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome through a process known as ER-associated degradation. That ER-derived proteins may contribute to neuronal loss has been suggested by studies in a Drosophila model of polyglutamine disease (18Kanuka H. Kuranaga E. Hiratou T. Igaki T. Nelson B. Okano H. Miura M. Sawamoto K. Ichijo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11723-11728Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER through a variety of mechanisms including proteasome inhibition can activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), a complex network of physiologic responses that may either relieve ER stress or activate apoptosis (19Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar, 20Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar, 21Ron D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). UPR activation is mediated by three ER transmembrane proteins that function as proximal sensors, designated activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), IRE1, and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase(PERK) (22Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Two mammalian orthologs of yeast inositol requiring 1 have been characterized and are designated IRE1α and IRE1β (23Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 24Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Although most cell types express IRE1α, epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract are the primary sites of IRE1β expression. In the presence of ER stress, IRE1 dimerizes, autophosphorylates, and activates intrinsic RNase activity (25Tirasophon W. Lee K. Callaghan B. Welihinda A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Activated IRE1 in turn splices X-box-binding protein 1 mRNA to generate a potent transcriptional activator. Like IRE1, ATF6 is an ER transmembrane protein that functions as a proximal sensor for the UPR. In the presence of ER stress, ATF6 transits to the Golgi, where it is cleaved to generate a cytosolic fragment that migrates to the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional activator (26Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Both of these pathways lead to activation of DNA-binding proteins that recognize promoter elements in ER stress-activated genes (27Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar–30). Like IRE1 and ATF6, PERK is an ER transmembrane protein that functions as a proximal UPR sensor. PERK activation leads to its autophosphorylation and to the downstream phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 α (eIF2α). This modification of eIF2α reduces the frequency of AUG codon recognition and attenuates translation of many, but not all, proteins (31Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Prior studies have suggested that expression of proteins with expanded glutamine tracts results in ER stress as marked by cleavage of caspase 12 (32Kouroku Y. Fujita E. Jimbo A. Kikuchi T. Yamagata T. Momoi M.Y. Kominami E. Kuida K. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Momoi T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1505-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of IRE1 (33Nishitoh H. Matsuzawa A. Tobiume K. Saegusa K. Takeda K. Inoue K. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Ichijo H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Although these observations suggest that proteins with expanded glutamine tracts activate the UPR, the consequences of this activation are not well characterized. Here we have used amino-terminal fragments of the androgen receptor containing either normal or expanded glutamine tracts to explore the role of the UPR as a modulator of glutamine length-dependent toxicity. We demonstrate glutamine length-dependent activation of the UPR as detected by induction of an ER stress-responsive promoter and by phosphorylation of endogenous PERK. We further demonstrate that ATF6, IRE1, and PERK, three proximal sensors of ER stress, have varied effects on the survival of cells expressing the mutant AR. These data identify the UPR as an important physiologic pathway that modulates glutamine length-dependent toxicity, and suggest that this pathway may offer therapeutic targets for the treatment of the polyglutamine diseases.

Nuclear Export Sequence (NES)-targeted AR Constructs—A nuclear export sequence encoding amino acids LALKLAGLDI (34Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar) was added in-frame to the 5′-end of non-targeted AR16Q and AR112Q. This sequence was preceded by an initiation methionine and was inserted into EcoRI and EagI sites of the original vectors after annealing oligonucleotides 5′-AATTCACCATGTTAGCCTTGAAATTAGCAGGATTAGACATCC and 5′-GGCCGGATGTCTAATCCTGCTAATTTCAAGGCTAACATGGTG. This cloning strategy resulted in the substitution of the first 11 amino acids of AR with the NES sequence. Cell Transfection—HeLa cells grown in minimum essential medium α supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine were transfected using 3 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and 1 μg of DNA/well of a 6-well dish according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Protein samples were electrophoresed through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes using a semidry transfer apparatus. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells cultured on chambered slides were fixed with methanol at –20 °C and stained. Images were captured using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope under a 63× water immersion objective or using a Zeiss Axiopan 2 imaging system under a 40× objective. For quantification, triplicate experiments were scored in a blind manner, with >100 cells examined per treatment group in each experiment. Luciferase Assay—HeLa cells were transfected by calcium phosphate using ProFection mammalian transfection system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plates and co-transfected with vectors encoding Renilla (10 ng) and firefly luciferase (0.5 μg) plus the indicated plasmids, using a constant amount of DNA in each transfection. After 24 h incubation at 35 °C in 3% CO2, cells were given fresh media and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. At the indicated times posttransfection, cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and luciferase activity in 20 μl of lysate was determined using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a microplate luminometer (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA). Cell Viability and Caspase Assay—Cell viability was assessed 48 h posttransfection using the Live/Dead Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR). Following staining, >100 cells were scored using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging system. Caspase 3 activity was determined at the indicated times posttransfection by measuring cleavage of the fluorescent substrate DEVD-AFC using the ApoTarget caspase 3/CPP 32 fluorometric protease assay kit (BIOSOURCE) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence intensity was measured using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL fluorometer (Thermo Electron Corp.). RNA Preparation—24 or 48 h posttransfection, cells were lysed in TRIzol, and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each sample consisted of a pool of 3–6 independent transfections. Replicate wells were simultaneously co-transfected with a green fluorescent protein expression vector and were analyzed using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer to assure consistent transfection efficiency. The integrity of total RNA was judged by denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis. Microarray Analysis—cDNA was generated from 40 μg of total RNA isolated from transfected cells. Inclusion of amino allyl-UTP during cDNA synthesis allowed for subsequent fluorescent labeling using NHS ester dyes. Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA probes were prepared from three sets of transfections with NLS- or NES-targeted AR16Q or AR112Q. Labeled probes were hybridized to 20,000 human cDNA microarrays at 65 °C overnight. Fluorescent images were captured using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Primary data analysis was done using the GenePix software package (Axon Instruments). Cy3:Cy5 ratios were determined for individual genes along with various other quality control parameters (e.g. intensity over local background), and the average ratio value for all spots was normalized to 1.0. cDNA sequences were annotated using UniGene build 160. Significance analysis of microarrays (35Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9775) Google Scholar) was performed on the microarray data from cells transfected with NES-targeted AR16Q or AR112Q versus cells transfected with NLS-targeted AR16Q or AR112Q. Average linkage hierarchical clustering was applied using the program Cluster, and the results were visualized with the program TreeView, as described (36Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13235) Google Scholar). The UPR Is Activated by AR112Q and Effects Toxicity—We first confirmed that exogenously expressed amino-terminal AR fragments trigger cell death in a glutamine length-dependent manner. These truncated AR constructs encode ∼50 amino acids flanking glutamine tracts of either 16 or 112 residues, and include a carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin tag (AR16Q or AR112Q, respectively) (37Merry D.E. Kobayashi Y. Bailey C.K. Taye A.A. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). When transiently expressed in HeLa cells, these proteins induced glutamine length-dependent cell death as detected by activation of caspase 3 that peaked 48 h posttransfection (Fig. 1A) and by directly counting dead cells as identified by staining with the live/dead assay (Fig. 1B). We used this cell culture model to test the hypothesis that the UPR is activated by proteins with expanded glutamine tracts and modulates their toxicity. We initially sought to determine whether amino-terminal AR fragments activated an ER stress-responsive promoter element in a glutamine length-dependent manner. To accomplish this, we used a UPR element (UPRE)-luciferase construct (38Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this element was initially characterized as an ATF6 binding site, it was subsequently shown to bind X-box-binding protein 1 (28Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2982) Google Scholar, 29Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar, 30Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were co-transfected with AR16Q or AR112Q plus a UPRE-luciferase reporter construct containing five multimerized consensus binding sites (38Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed time and glutamine length-dependent luciferase activation (Fig. 1C). Luciferase activity was first detected 72 h posttransfection and continued to increase at 96 h posttransfection, suggesting that the UPR was induced in glutamine length-dependent manner in transfected cells. We next determined the specific effects of proximal UPR sensors on glutamine length-dependent toxicity. To assess AFT6 activation, NIH 3T3 cells transfected with AR16Q or AR112Q were co-stained with antibodies specific for AR and ATF6. Immunofluorescence and quantification revealed that fewer than 5% of cells expressing AR16Q had nuclear ATF6 staining whereas ∼20% of AR112Q-expressing cells exhibited AFT6 nuclear staining (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained using HEK 293 cells (not shown). These data indicated that ATF6 was activated in a glutamine length-dependent manner. To determine the influence of ATF6 on AR112Q toxicity, we used previously characterized dominant negative (DN) and constitutively active (CA) ATF6 mutants (39Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Expression of AR112Q plus AFT6 DN significantly increased toxicity compared with expression of AR112Q alone as measured by caspase 3 activation (Fig. 2B) and by live/dead assay (Fig. 2C). In contrast, expression of ATF6 CA significantly decreased AR112Q-mediated caspase 3 activation (Fig. 2D). These data indicated that signaling through ATF6 primarily protected cells from glutamine length-dependent toxicity. The transcriptional activator generated by ATF6 cleavage is known to modulate expression of several genes including the ER chaperone BiP, or binding Ig protein. BiP plays an important regulatory role for the UPR by binding to the luminal domains of IRE1, ATF6, and PERK, thereby preventing their activation (22Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). As unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen, BiP may be sequestered away from these proximal sensors to allow for UPR induction. Because the ATF6 CA mutant up-regulated the expression of endogenous BiP (Fig. 2E), we sought to determine whether increased expression of BiP was sufficient to mediate the protective effects of ATF6 on AR112Q toxicity. Although overexpression of BiP significantly decreased the low level of caspase 3 activation by AR16Q, it did not significantly alter caspase 3 activation by AR112Q (Fig. 2F). Similar results were obtained following transfection with a wide range of plasmid concentrations (data not shown). These data suggested that BiP up-regulation was not sufficient to mediate the protective effects of ATF6 and that other factors were also required to promote the survival of cells expressing AR112Q. The observed glutamine length-dependent induction of UPRE-luciferase (Fig. 1C) indicated that IRE1 is also activated in cells expressing AR112Q. Therefore, we next evaluated whether IRE1 impacts glutamine length-dependent activation of caspase 3. To accomplish this we used three previously characterized IRE1α DN mutants (38Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K509A and K907A point mutants abolish IRE1α kinase and RNase activities, respectively, whereas the δC mutant contains a carboxyl-terminal truncation and lacks both of these functional domains. All three mutants acted as expected in our system and inhibited UPRE activation by tunicamycin, a known inducer of ER stress (Fig. 3A). To determine whether IRE1 was necessary for glutamine length-dependent activation of caspase 3, HeLa cells were co-transfected with AR16Q or AR112Q plus one of three IRE1α DN mutants or empty vector (Fig. 3B). No significant change in caspase 3 activity was detected in cells co-transfected with these IRE1α mutants. Similarly, no statistically significant change in AR112Q toxicity was detected by directly counting dead cells identified by the live/dead assay (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrated that IRE1 did not significantly impact AR112Q toxicity. We next sought to evaluate the activation of PERK, the third proximal UPR sensor. To assess PERK activation, HeLa cells transfected with AR16Q or AR112Q were co-stained with AR and phosphoPERK-specific antibodies. Immunofluorescence and quantification revealed that fewer than 7% of AR16Q-positive cells expressed phosphoPERK, whereas ∼25% of AR112Q-positive cells expressed phosphoPERK (Fig. 4, A and B). Co-expression of a PERK DN mutant (40Wu S. Hu Y. Wang J.L. Chatterjee M. Shi Y. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18077-18083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) significantly decreased AR112Q toxicity as measured by caspase 3 activation and by live/dead assay (Fig. 4, C and D), indicating that this arm of the UPR triggered a proapoptotic response. This effect of the PERK DN mutant was not mediated by altering expression of the truncated AR proteins (Fig. 4E), suggesting that other downstream effectors induced by PERK promoted cell death. The above experiments indicated that modulating activity of the proximal UPR sensors ATF6 and PERK influenced the toxicity of AR112Q. As a complementary approach, we determined whether a block of AR112Q toxicity would accentuate UPR activation. Cells expressing AR16Q or AR112Q were treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK at a concentration that prevented glutamine length-dependent toxicity as measured by caspase 3 activation (supplemental Fig. 1). Treatment of AR112Q-expressing cells with Z-VAD-FMK led to the marked accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2α and the modest accumulation of BiP (Fig. 5), markers of UPR activation. Intracellular Localization and UPR Activation—We were next interested in evaluating whether intracellular localization of the expanded glutamine tract effects UPR activation or the ability of the UPR to modulate toxicity. To accomplish this we used previously characterized constructs containing the same truncated AR fragments with the addition of a NLS (41McCampbell A. Taye A.A. Whitty L. Penney E. Steffan J.S. Fischbeck K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15179-15184Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In addition, we generated a similar set of constructs containing a NES at the amino terminus. The presence of these targeting sequences resulted in the localization of the encoded proteins to the expected subcellular compartments (Fig. 6A). Both the NES- and NLS-targeted constructs triggered glutamine length-dependent caspase 3 activation that peaked 48 h posttransfection (Fig. 6B). Although both the NES- and NLS-targeted AR112Q proteins were toxic, intracellular localization of the mutant protein did differentially affect other cellular responses as detected by gene expression analysis. Significance analysis of microarrays (35Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9775) Google Scholar) identified 83 genes that were differentially expressed in a glutamine length-dependent manner by cells transfected with the NES versus NLS constructs (with predicted false discovery of 1.5 genes on microarrays containing 20,000 genes) (supplemental Fig. 2). To evaluate whether the UPR was similarly activated by NES- and NLS-targeted proteins, HeLa cells were co-transfected with UPRE-luciferase, and reporter gene activation was monitored at several time points posttransfection (Fig. 6C). This analysis revealed time- and glutamine length-dependent luciferase activation in cells transfected with proteins targeted to either the nucleus or cytoplasm. The effects of UPR activation on glutamine length-dependent toxicity were examined by co-transfection with ATF6 and PERK mutants. Significant changes in caspase 3 activity induced by NES AR112Q were observed following co-transfection with the ATF6 DN, ATF6 CA, and PERK DN mutants (Fig. 6D). Although similar trends were observed with NLS AR112Q, a significant change in toxicity was only observed following co-transfection with ATF6 DN (data not shown). These data suggested that the UPR was a more potent modulator of glutamine length-dependent toxicity when the mutant proteins were localized to the cytoplasm. We describe the role of the UPR as a modulator of polyglutamine toxicity in cell culture. Our model uses amino-terminal fragments of AR that others and we have shown trigger cell death in a time- and glutamine length-dependent manner. Using this system, we demonstrate glutamine length-dependent UPR activation by increased UPRE-luciferase activity, by phosphorylation of endogenous PERK and nuclear translocation of ATF6. The effects of UPR activation on toxicity were examined by using mutants of the three ER transmembrane proteins that function as proximal sensors of ER stress, ATF6, IRE1, and PERK. Caspase 3 activity was chosen as one measure of toxicity, because UPR-induced cell death is apoptotic, and because an orthologue of mouse caspase 12, an ER stress-induced caspase, has not been identified in humans (22Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). As a confirmatory, caspase 3-independent cell death assay, dead cells identified with the live/dead assay were visualized and directly counted. Although prior studies have indicated that proteins with long glutamine tracts activate the UPR (32Kouroku Y. Fujita E. Jimbo A. Kikuchi T. Yamagata T. Momoi M.Y. Kominami E. Kuida K. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Momoi T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1505-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 33Nishitoh H. Matsuzawa A. Tobiume K. Saegusa K. Takeda K. Inoue K. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Ichijo H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar), the consequences of this activation were not fully characterized. Our data highlight the complex effects this pathway exerts on the survival of cells expressing long glutamine tracts. Although PERK activation promotes death of cells expressing AR112Q, ATF6 activation promotes cell survival. The interdependence of multiple factors leading to cell death often results in only modest effects from single gene loss- or gain-of-function mutations. In this context, the observed effects of the ATF6 and PERK mutants on AR112Q-induced cell death are compatible with a significant biologic role for the UPR as a modulator of polyglutamine toxicity. An important downstream target of ATF6 is BiP, an ER chaperone that binds to the luminal domains of AFT6, PERK, and IRE1, thereby preventing their activation (22Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that BiP could mediate the prosurvival effects of ATF6, perhaps through the down-regulation of PERK. However, BiP overexpression does not significantly decrease caspase 3 activation by AR112Q, suggesting that other factors contribute to this prosurvival effect. We did not observe a significant role for IRE1 as a modulator of AR112Q toxicity. Prior studies have implicated IRE1 as a mediator of the toxicity of a SCA3 fragment containing an expanded glutamine tract through the induction of ASK1 and JNK (33Nishitoh H. Matsuzawa A. Tobiume K. Saegusa K. Takeda K. Inoue K. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Ichijo H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Here we found that expression of three different IRE1α DN mutants failed to alter AR112Q toxicity. These negative results were obtained despite evidence of IRE1 activation, derived from glutamine length-dependent induction of UPRE-luciferase. Our data suggest that the proapoptotic effects of pathways other than IRE1-ASK1-JNK, including the PERK arm of the UPR, are sufficient to mediate AR112Q toxicity. Although AR112Q robustly induced the UPR, we also observed a low level UPRE-luciferase activation and toxicity in cells expressing AR16Q. Similarly, other investigators have detected a low level toxicity in cells expressing AR16Q (42Taylor J.P. Tanaka F. Robitschek J. Sandoval C.M. Taye A. Markovic-Plese S. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was not surprising that transient overexpression of AR16Q led to low level ER stress and UPR activation. The fact that both UPR activation and toxicity were more evident in cells expressing AR112Q than AR16Q argues that these responses occur in a glutamine length-dependent manner and are because of the pathogenic repeat expansion. Complex effects of UPR activation on cell death and survival are not unique to our system and have been observed by others as well. For instance, the induction of apoptosis by free cholesterol in macrophages is mediated by the UPR (43Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Although disruption of PERK signaling in macrophages promotes cholesterol-induced apoptosis, disruption of CHOP, a transcription factor up-regulated in response to PERK activation, attenuates cell death. These findings demonstrate that activation of even a single arm of the UPR may have varied consequences on cell survival. The dominant cellular response may depend on both the stressor and the duration of UPR activation. Among neurological disorders, UPR activation plays an important role as a modulator of disease severity in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, an X-linked leukodsytrophy caused by mutations in the gene encoding proteolipid protein (44Southwood C.M. Garbern J. Jiang W. Gow A. Neuron. 2002; 36: 585-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Some pathogenic mutations cause an accumulation of misfolded mutant proteolipid protein in the ER lumen, leading to UPR activation. The UPR has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of several adult onset neurodegenerative disorders associated with protein misfolding and aggregation, including Alzheimer and Parkinson disease as well as the polyglutamine expansion disorders (45Forman M.S. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 407-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The UPR may similarly impact neurodegeneration in patients with neuroserpin mutations, a disease in which the mutant protein accumulates in the ER lumen (46Davis R.L. Shrimpton A.E. Holohan P.D.

Although these mutant proteins are not known to traffic into the ER lumen, the UPR may be activated in response to proteasome inhibition mediated by their misfolding. Our findings suggest that this pathway may modulate disease severity and may serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of these disorders.

Most molecular studies of spider silk have focused on fibroins from dragline silk and capture silk, two important silk types involved in the survival of the spider. In our studies we have focused on the characterization of egg case silk, a third silk fiber produced by the black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus. Analysis of the physical structure of egg case silk using scanning electron microscopy demonstrates the presence of small and large diameter fibers. By using the strong protein denaturant 8 m guanidine hydrochloride to solubilize the fibers, we demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and protein silver staining that an abundant component of egg case silk is a 100-kDa protein doublet. Combining matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry and reverse genetics, we have isolated a novel gene called ecp-1, which encodes for one of the protein components of the 100-kDa species. BLAST searches of the NCBInr protein data base using the primary sequence of ECP-1 revealed similarity to fibroins from spiders and silkworms, which mapped to two distinct regions within the ECP-1. These regions contained the conserved repetitive fibroin motifs poly(Ala) and poly(Gly-Ala), but surprisingly, no larger ensemble repeats could be identified within the primary sequence of ECP-1. Consistent with silk gland-restricted patterns of expression for fibroins, ECP-1 was demonstrated to be predominantly produced in the tubuliform gland, with lower levels detected in the major and minor ampullate glands. ECP-1 monomeric units were also shown to assemble into higher aggregate structures through the formation of disulfide bonds via a unique cysteine-rich N-terminal region. Collectively, our findings provide new insight into the components of egg case silk and identify a new class of silk proteins with distinctive molecular features relative to traditional members of the spider silk gene family.

Araneoid spiders contain specialized glands that produce up to seven different silk fibers and glues that have been shown to have distinct physical and chemical properties (1Forlix R.F. Biology of Spiders,2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1996: 1-336Google Scholar). Experimental evidence has demonstrated that these secretions are likely encoded by different members that belong to the silk gene family (2Guerette P.A. Ginzinger D.G. Weber B.H. Gosline J.M.

Science. 1996; 272: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). No fibroin cDNAs, genes, or protein sequences have been described for aggregate (sticky glue) and piriform (attachment disc silks) tissues. The published cDNAs of all the araneoid silks display similar structural characteristics. The fibroin mRNAs are long relative to typical transcripts (ranging from ∼4–16 kb) (13Hayashi C.Y. Shipley N.H. Lewis R.V. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1999; 24: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), which code for fibroins with relatively high molecular masses ranging from 275 to 320 kDa (14Candelas G. Candelas T. Ortiz A. Rodriguez O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Mello C.M. Senecal K. Yeung B. Vouros P. Kaplan D. Kaplan D. Wade W.W. Farmer B. Viney Silk Polymers: Materials Science and Biotechnology. 544. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1994: 67-79Google Scholar). The fibroin mRNAs code for highly internally repetitive modules as well as for a conserved, non-repetitive C-terminal region. Although the repetitive regions of different silk gene paralogues have been shown to be quite divergent, sequence similarities in the 3′ C-terminal region have been one of the hallmarks of fibroin identification and classification (2Guerette P.A. Ginzinger D.G. Weber B.H. Gosline J.M. Science. 1996; 272: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 3Gatesy J. Hayashi C. Motriuk D. Woods J. Lewis R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6661-6663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The divergence of the internal repetitive sequences that characterize each fibroin has been suggested to be responsible in part for the differing mechanical properties of the spun silk fibers produced by the different glands (16Gosline J.M. Guerette P.A. Ortlepp C.S. Savage K.N. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 3295-3303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the divergence within the repetitive regions of the paralogues, some common molecular features exist within the silk proteins, including four amino acid motifs that are found in various combination and numbers (3Gatesy J. Hayashi C. Motriuk D. Woods J. Lewis R. Science. 2001; 291: 2603-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 13Hayashi C.Y. Shipley N.H. Lewis R.V. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1999; 24: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The four motifs include the following: 1) polyalanine (An) stretches; 2) alternating glycine and alanine couplets (GA)n; 3) three amino acids composed of two glycines followed by a variable amino acid (GGX)n; and 4) glycine-proline-glycine modules (GPGXn). These modules described above are assembled in different numbers and combinations to form larger ensemble repeats that are iterated many times throughout the internal region of the fibroins. In a few instances some fibroins have been reported to contain only certain motifs (12Hayashi C.Y. Blackledge T.A. Lewis R.V. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1950-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although much emphasis has been placed on understanding the components of dragline and capture silk, little information has been reported regarding the molecular and biochemical features of egg case silk. Compared with other araneoid silks, tubuliform silks display different mechanical properties. The difference in mechanical properties may be explained in part by different amino acid compositions of the constituent proteins, with tubuliform silks containing substantially higher levels of serine relative to the silk from the minor ampullate, major ampullate; and flagelliform glands (17Vollrath F. Knight D.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Because tubuliform silks have different chemical compositions and mechanical properties relative to other araneoid silks, we hypothesized that tubuliform silks contain unique proteins assembled into the egg case silk fiber. In our search for genes encoding egg case silk proteins, we have isolated a novel cDNA that codes for a tubuliform-restricted protein. Based upon the pattern of expression and the abundance of the protein in egg case fibers, we have named this gene product ECP-1 (egg case protein-1). The primary sequence of ECP-1 represents the only completed sequence for egg case silk proteins. Analysis of the predicted primary sequence of ECP-1 reveals similarity to published fibroin proteins from spiders and silkmoths. By SDS-PAGE analysis of egg case silk protein samples, we also demonstrate ECP-1 monomers are assembled into higher ordered structures and comprise abundant components of egg case silk. Our findings suggest that ECP-1 represents a new class of silk proteins belonging to the spider gene silk family. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Egg case silk was coated to a thickness of ∼14–20 nm with gold alloy in a Pelco SC-7 auto-sputter coater with an FTM-2 film thickness monitor. Samples were examined on a Hitachi S-2600 S.E. operated with an accelerator voltage of 3 kV. The diameter of both strands was measured to the nearest 0.01 μm at three distant places along the S.E. sample. Tests were done at ambient temperature and humidity, which ranged from 22 to 25 °C and 30–36%, respectively. Characterization of Egg Case Proteins by Differential Solubilization—Individual egg cases from female black widow spiders were cut open using sterilized scissors to remove the eggs. The egg case was discarded if any eggs were broken during the isolation procedure. Silk from each egg case was extracted with 8 m GdnHCl 1The abbreviations used are: GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-offlight; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; ECP, egg case protein; RT-qPCR, real time quantitative PCR; CAD, collision-activated dissociation; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. (3 ml of solution per mg of silk) for 10 min with agitation. The viscous supernatant solution obtained was removed and conserved for dialysis. The solid residue was then extracted with 1 ml of water, which left the solid white core fiber. The water extract solution was also conserved for dialysis. A second, fresh 8 m GdnHCl solution (same volume to weight ratio as the initial solution) was then added to the silk residue, and the mixture was agitated continuously with a vertical shaker. Samples of this supernatant were collected after 10 min and after 5, 15, 25, and 40 h. Each of the silk protein solutions (solutions obtained from initial GdnHCl and water extracts, and multiple samples from the second GdnHCl extraction) was dialyzed against three changes of 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) for 4 h each, using 1000 molecular weight cut-off dialysis tubing (Sigma). The proteins from the dialyzed samples were separated on SDS-PAGE with a 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Bio-Rad). Separated proteins were visualized by silver staining (ProteoSilver™ Plus silver stain kit, Sigma). The results are shown in Fig. 2, lanes 2–8. Broad range molecular weight markers were used to determine protein sizes (Bio-Rad). Tryptic Digestions of Egg Case Protein and Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Sequencing grade trypsin (trypsin gold, Promega) was dissolved in 50 mm acetic acid at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. This solution was then diluted with 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8) to give a 20 μg/ml stock solution of trypsin. In-solution digests of the 40-h extract of egg case silk were prepared by mixing 100 μl of the ECP protein solution with 10 μl of trypsin solution and incubating at 37 °C overnight. The digest was then completely dried using a vacuum centrifuge and redissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were extracted and desalted with a C18 Zip-Tip (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In order to test whether any ECP species were also included with the peripheral proteins from the first GdnHCl extraction, we prepared an in-gel tryptic digest of the 100-kDa bands from this extract following a published protocol (18Jiménez C.R. Huang L. Qiu Y. Burlingame A.L. Current Protocols in Protein Science: In-gel Digestion of Proteins for MALDI-MS. Fingerprint Mapping. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 16.4.1-16.4.5Google Scholar). Briefly, the 100-kDa bands in Fig. 2, lane 2, were excised from the gel. After destaining, the pieces were minced into fine particles with sealed pipette tips, washed with 25 mm NH4HCO3, 50% acetonitrile, and then dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The dried pieces were rehydrated and reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol, alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide, dried again, and then rehydrated and digested overnight with 250 ng of trypsin. Peptides were extracted with two changes of 30 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid solution. The extracts were combined and then reduced in volume to about 10 μl to concentrate the sample, after which the solutions were desalted with C18 Zip-Tips. In-gel digestion was also carried out for the ECPs in the 40-h extracts (100-kDa bands in Fig. 2, lane 8). In order to enhance peptide sequence coverage, 300 μl of the 40-h extracts were concentrated to 40 μl using PAGE Prep™ Protein Clean-up and Enrichment kit (Pierce), 20 μl of which were loaded on a separate 4–20% gradient gel. The 100-kDa bands were excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. The three digests (the in-solution and in-gel digests of ECPs and the in-gel digest of the 100-kDa bands from the first GdnHCl wash) were analyzed with a MALDI tandem TOF mass spectrometer (4700 Proteomics Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). One-half microliter of each desalted digest solution was mixed with an equal volume of a 10 mg/ml solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50/50 acetonitrile, 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and spotted on the MALDI target. For the in-solution digest, two negative controls were used as follows: a mixture of 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 10 μl of trypsin solution, and a mixture of 100 μl of ECP sample and 10 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 (no trypsin) were treated in the same way as the actual digests. For the in-gel digests, a piece of blank gel was digested as described above. Monoisotopic masses of all significant peptides generated from the tryptic digests were measured in positive mode. Several peptides were selected for analysis by MS/MS following high energy CAD (1 keV lab frame). De novo peptide sequences were derived from the MS/MS spectra by manual interpretation. cDNA Library Construction—Fifteen black widow spiders were dissected, and their silk-producing glands were isolated. The isolated glands included the major ampullate, minor ampullate, tubuliform, flagelliform, aciniform, and pyriform glands. Total RNA was isolated from the glands using an RNeasy maxi kit (Qiagen). Poly(A) RNA was purified using the PolyATtract mRNA isolation system (Promega) as described previously (9Lawrence B.A. Vierra C.A. Moore A.M. Biomacromolecules. 2004; 5: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). cDNAs were generated using a HybriZAP 2.1 cDNA synthesis kit and the cDNA library created using the HybriZAP 2.1 XR library construction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Cloning of the ecp-1 Gene—The peptide sequences LLESDGFGPIIR and QGQQGFSETLSQSDSR were used to synthesize degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to the underlined regions. PCRs containing the forward primer 5′-CAAGGWCAACAAGGWTTY-3′ (encodes for QGQQGF; Y = T or C; W = A or T) and the reverse primer 5′-NGGNCCRAANCCRTC-3′ (specifies DGFGP; R = AorG; N = A, G, T, or C) successfully amplified a 525-bp fragment of ECP-1 from a cDNA library produced from black widow silk glands (corresponded to amino acids 353–527 Fig. 4). The 525-bp fragment was sequenced as described previously (19Mitchell B. Mugiya M. Youngblom J. Funes-Duran M. Miller R. Ezpeleta J. Rigby N. Vierra C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To amplify the 5′ end of the ECP-1 cDNA, the forward primer (anchor) from the pGAL4-AD library vector (5′-CGATGATGAAGATACCCCACC-3′) was used with the gene-specific reverse primer 5′-CGTATTGTAATCCAGAGGAACC-3′ (nucleotides 1506–1527, corresponding to amino acids 497–503). The product from the pGAL4-AD forward and reverse primer resulted in an ∼1.4-kb product. A similar approach was used to obtain the 3′ end of the cDNA. The reverse primer from the pGAL4-AD library vector 5′-GCACAGTTGAAGTGAACTTGC-3′ and the forward primer 5′-GAGGAAGAGGATTCGGTGTTACA-3′ (nucleotides 1405–1427, corresponding to residues 464–470) amplified a product that was ∼1.7 kb. Both 5′- and 3′-RACE products were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen) and sequenced as described above. Amino Acid Composition of the Core Silk Filament—The core silk fibers were subjected to amino acid analysis at the Protein Chemistry Laboratory of Texas A & M University as described previously (20Casem M.L. Turner D. Houchin K. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1999; 24: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, vapor phase hydrolysis of the core proteins by 6 m HCl was employed to generate the constituent amino acids. Amino acids obtained were derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde and 9-fluoromethylchloroformate. The derivatized amino acids were separated by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. Real Time PCR Analysis with SYBR Green Detection—Reverse transcription reactions were carried out as described previously (21Nguyen L. Round J. O'Connell R. Geurts P. Funes-Duran M. Wong J. Jongeward G. Vierra C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4423-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Typically, 2 μl of a reverse transcription reaction were used for real time PCR analysis using the DyNAmo SYBR Green qPCR kit (MJ Research). Real time PCR fluorescence detection was performed in 96-well plates using an Opticon II instrument (MJ Research). Amplification products were monitored by SYBR Green detection and routinely checked using dissociation curve software and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Reactions were performed in triplicate. Oligonucleotides used for the analysis of ECP-1 were the forward and reverse primers 5′-GAATCCAGTAGTGCCTCCCAATT-3′ (nucleotides 1110–1132) and 5′-TTGTGAACTCTCCTCCTTGACT-3′ (nucleotides 1293–1314), respectively. Primers were selected using the Beacon Designer 2.0 software (PREMIER Biosoft International). Physical Structure of Black Widow Egg Case Fibers—To understand more regarding the physical structure of egg case silk (Fig. 1A), we used a scanning electron microscope to examine the physical structure of egg cases collected from black widow spiders (Fig. 1B). The scanning electron micrograph shows that egg case silk is composed of fibers of two different diameters (Fig. 1C). The larger diameter fibers, which represent the major component of egg case silk, are produced by the tubuliform gland (22Sekiguchi K. Sci. Rep. Tokyo Kyoiku Daigaku Sect. B. 1955; 8: 23-32Google Scholar). The diameter of the large fibers was 4–5 μm, whereas the diameters the smaller fibers were on the order of 500 nm. The smaller diameter fibers, which constitute a minor component, are likely synthesized by the aciniform gland (23Foradori M.J. Kovoor J. Moon M.J. Tillinghast E.K. J. Morphol. 2002; 252: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Identification of Egg Case Proteins—To examine the biochemical features and the number of proteins assembled into egg case silk, we dissolved egg cases collected from black widow spiders in 8 m GdnHCl. Analysis of the egg case extracts by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining revealed a broad distribution of molecular masses, ranging from ∼10 to >300 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 2). Analysis of egg cases taken from six different black widow spiders generated similar protein patterns (data not shown). The broad distribution of molecular weight proteins is likely a result of translational pausing of fibroin mRNAs (14Candelas G. Candelas T. Ortiz A. Rodriguez O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), protein degradation, and/or the presence of glue proteins. To identify major structural proteins in the silk fiber, we performed a solubilization time course assay with GdnHCl. Egg case silk was repeatedly extracted with 8 m GdnHCl over a 40-h time period. Many egg case proteins dissolved immediately upon the first exposure to the GdnHCl solution (Fig. 2, lane 2). A distinct color change was observed after the first GdnHCl extraction and water wash, with the egg case changing from a yellowish hue to white. The treatment of silk with GdnHCl or other types of chaotropic agents has been reported to solubilize efficiently the hydrophobic proteins. SDS-PAGE analysis of the water wash following the first GdnHCl extraction of the silk produced a protein doublet with an apparent molecular mass of ∼100 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 3). This protein doublet had the same apparent size as the strong 100-kDa species observed in the initial GdnHCl extract (compare Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3). No other proteins were detected in the water wash (Fig. 2, lane 3). Because silk fibroins are not water-soluble, it is very probable that these species represent the diluted sample from the initial treatment because the 100-kDa doublet was the strongest band in the initial GdnHCl extraction. When the residue after the water wash (about 70% of the silk mass) was extracted with 8 m GdnHCl for a second time, the remaining core fibroins and associated proteins displayed reduced solubility. Samples extracted for less than 15 h failed to generate sufficient proteins for detection by silver staining following SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lanes 4–6). However, after 25 h, a faint protein doublet was detected (Fig. 2, lane 7). This protein doublet became relatively stronger at 40 h (Fig. 2, lane 8), and these species were named egg case proteins or ECPs. No higher molecular weight proteins were detected by the SDS-PAGE at this point. Trypsin Digestion of ECPs and Mass Spectrometric Sequence Analysis—We then performed in-solution tryptic digestions of the protein doublet described in the secondary 40-h GdnHCl extract fraction (Fig. 2, lane 8). This digest was found to contain numerous peptides whose molecular masses were determined by MALDI-MS analysis (Fig. 3A). Seven peptides were sequenced using high energy collision-activated dissociation (CAD), those with precursor ion masses (MH+, monisotopic) of 855.4, 1316.7, 1502.7, 1613.8, 1623.8, 1754.8, and 3424.5. The product ion spectra from the peptides of MH+ 1316.7, 1613.8, and 3424.5 are shown in Fig. 3, D–F, respectively. The N termini of the 1613.8 and 3424.5 peptides could not be determined, but a significant amount of sequence information was derived. The primary sequences of the remaining peptides were also determined (Table I). The sequences of the peptides at m/z 1613.8 and 1623.8 were nearly identical, having only a single amino acid difference (Table I). The selection of ions for sequence analysis was deliberately biased toward peptide masses that were repeatedly observed from different black widow spiders (data not shown). Analysis of the derived peptide sequences using the algorithm BLAST revealed no significant similarity to any polypeptides in the NCBInr protein data base.Fig. 3MALDI-TOF and MALDI tandem TOF analyses of tryptic fragments generated from the 100-kDa protein species.

https://openalex.org/W1986154815,"Mutational analyses of the secreted recombinant insulin receptor extracellular domain have identified a ligand binding site composed of residues located in the L1 domain (amino acids 1–470) and at the C terminus of the α subunit (amino acids 705–715). To evaluate the physiological significance of this ligand binding site, we have transiently expressed cDNAs encoding full-length receptors with alanine mutations of the residues forming the functional epitopes of this binding site and determined their insulin binding properties. Insulin bound to wild-type receptors with complex kinetics, which were fitted to a two-component sequential model; the Kd of the high affinity component was 0.03 nm and that of the low affinity component was 0.4 nm. Mutations of Arg14, Phe64, Phe705, Glu706, Tyr708, Asn711, and Val715 inactivated the receptor. Alanine mutation of Asn15 resulted in a 20-fold decrease in affinity, whereas mutations of Asp12, Gln34, Leu36, Leu37, Leu87, Phe89, Tyr91, Lys121, Leu709, and Phe714 all resulted in 4–10-fold decreases. When the effects of the mutations were compared with those of the same mutations of the secreted recombinant receptor, significant differences were observed for Asn15, Leu37, Asp707, Leu709, Tyr708, Asn711, Phe714, and Val715, suggesting that the molecular basis for the interaction of each form of the receptor with insulin differs. We also examined the effects of alanine mutations of Asn15, Gln34, and Phe89 on insulin-induced receptor autophosphorylation. They had no effect on the maximal response to insulin but produced an increase in the EC50 commensurate with their effect on the affinity of the receptor for insulin.

They had no effect on the maximal response to insulin but produced an increase in the EC50 commensurate with their effect on the affinity of the receptor for insulin. The initiating event in the insulin-signaling cascade is the binding of insulin to a specific plasma membrane receptor. This interaction has been studied extensively and was found to be extremely complex (see Ref. 1De Meyts P. Whittaker J. Nat. Rev.

These properties and high affinity interactions with insulin are dependent on the dimeric structure of the receptor; insulin binds non-cooperatively to a single population of binding sites in the monomeric receptor (3Boni-Schnetzler M.

The stoichiometry of binding to the native receptor appears to be one insulin molecule to one receptor dimer (6Markussen J. Halstrom J. Wiberg F.C. Schaffer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18814-18818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secreted recombinant extracellular domain of the receptor exhibits properties similar to those of the receptor monomer and has a stoichiometry of two insulin molecules to one receptor dimer (6Markussen J. Halstrom J. Wiberg F.C. Schaffer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18814-18818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Schaffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A number of hypothetical models of insulin-receptor interactions have been proposed to explain these findings (7Schaffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 8De Meyts P. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S135-S148Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 9Lee J. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C319-C334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The model that best explains the experimental findings is that of De Meyts (1De Meyts P. Whittaker J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 769-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). This proposes that insulin has two topographically distinct receptor binding sites and that the receptor has two topographically distinct insulin binding sites/monomer. In this model, insulin binds asymmetrically to the insulin dimer, with each of its binding sites contacting its cognate receptor site on a separate monomer. Although the detailed structural basis of this model has yet to be elucidated, the structure-function relationships of the insulin molecule and the receptor have been studied extensively and provide support for the essentials of the model. Insulin is a 6-kDa globular protein with disulfide-linked A and B chains (see Ref. 10Baker E.N. Blundell T.L. Cutfield J.F. Cutfield S.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Hodgkin D.M. Hubbard R.E. Isaacs N.W. Reynolds C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1988; 319: 369-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar for review). The consensus of published studies is that it has a receptor binding site composed of GlyA1, IleA2, ValA3, GlnA5, TyrA19, ValB12, TyrB16, GlyB23, PheB24, PheB25, and TyrB26 (1De Meyts P. Whittaker J.

Isaacs N.W. Reynolds C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1988; 319: 369-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). However, hagfish insulin, in which these residues and the tertiary structure of the molecule are conserved (11Cutfield J.F. Cutfield S.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Emdin S.F. Reynolds C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 132: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), displays anomalous receptor binding behavior (11Cutfield J.F. Cutfield S.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Emdin S.F. Reynolds C.D. J.

Diabetes. 1980; 29: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting that other residues outside this region might also be involved in receptor interactions. This is supported by the finding that two recombinant insulin analogues with substitutions in residues located on the opposite side of the molecule, LeuA13 to Ser and LeuB17 to Gln, exhibited similar receptor binding behavior to hagfish insulin (7Schaffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 8De Meyts P. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S135-S148Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The structure and structure-function relationships of the insulin receptor are not as well documented. It is a dimeric transmembrane protein (see Ref. 1De Meyts P. Whittaker J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 769-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar for review). Each monomer consists of disulfide-linked α and β subunits. The α subunits are wholly extracellular and contain the ligand binding site(s), and the β subunit has an extracellular component, a single transmembrane helix, and an intracellular component with tyrosine kinase catalytic activity. The structure of the N terminus of the homologous insulin-like growth factor I receptor has been determined (13Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); amino acids 1–460 in insulin-like growth factor receptor correspond to amino acids 1–470 of the insulin receptor. The structure consists of two globular β-helical domains (L1 and L2) flanking a cysteine-rich domain. Comparative homology modeling suggests the remainder of the extracellular domain to be composed of three type 3 fibronectin repeats, FnIII0, FnIII1, and FnIII2 (14Marino-Buslje C. Mizuguchi K. Siddle K. Blundell T.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Schaefer E.M. Erickson H.P. Federwisch M. Wollmer A. Ellis L. J. Biol.

FnIII1 is atypical because it contains a 120-amino acid insert domain of indeterminate structure (15Schaefer E.M. Erickson H.P. Federwisch M. Wollmer A. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23393-23402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity labeling studies, studies with chimeric receptors, and the epitopes of anti-receptor antibodies, which strongly inhibit insulin binding, suggest that each receptor monomer contains two topologically discrete ligand binding sites (17Andersen A.S.

This is composed of two functional epitopes, one located on the base of the L1 domain and the other at the C terminus of the α subunit. As discussed above, the secreted recombinant receptor exhibits anomalous binding properties, suggesting monovalent insulin binding (7Schaffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To evaluate the function of this binding site in the holoreceptor, i.e. where there is bivalent binding, we have expressed alanine mutants of the residues that comprise this functional epitope as full-length proteins. We found that all mutations, with the exception of two residues, which were minor contributors to the epitope of the secreted receptor, impaired binding. All hot spot residues were conserved, but an additional residue was present in the holoreceptor hot spot. In addition, a number of residues, which we had shown previously to vary in their contributions to the free energy of binding of the two isoforms of the secreted receptor, also differed in their contribution to the free energy of binding of the holoreceptor. In three selected mutants, the effects of the mutations on the sensitivity of insulin-regulated receptor autophosphorylation were commensurate with their effects on affinity for insulin. General Procedures—All molecular biological procedures, including agarose gel electrophoresis, restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, bacterial transformation, and DNA sequencing, were performed by standard methods (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Restriction and modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Recombinant human insulin was from NovoNordisk A/S. High pressure liquid chromatography-purified mono-iodinated [125I-TyrA14]insulin was from Amersham Biosciences. Protease inhibitors were from Roche Applied Science. PEAK rapid cells were purchased from Edge Biosystems (Gaithersburg, MD). Medium and serum for tissue culture were from Cellgro. The mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.Zeo+ was from Invitrogen. Coding sequences for a triple repeat of the AU5 epitope tag (TDFYLK) were introduced between the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pcDNA3.Zeo+ polylinker by cassette mutagenesis. The cDNA for the insulin receptor was as described previously (27Whittaker J. Okamoto A.K. Thys R. Bell G.I. Steiner D.F. Hofmann C.A. Imura H. Bell G.I. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was modified for subcloning into the epitope tag expression vector by elimination of the existing BamHI site by a silent mutation and introduction of an in-frame BamHI site encoding a Gly-Ser linker at the 3′ end of the coding sequence by site-directed mutagenesis. Monoclonal anti-AU5 IgG was purchased from Covance. Construction of Receptor Mutants—Alanine mutations of the cDNA encoding the recombinant secreted receptor extracellular domain have been described previously (23Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J.

These were used to generate full-length epitope-tagged mutants of the full-length receptor by standard subcloning techniques. Expression of Receptor cDNAs—Plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared as described previously (28Whittaker J. Groth A.V. Mynarcik D.C. Pluzek L. Gadsboll V.L. Whittaker L.J. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43980-43986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The receptor cDNAs were expressed transiently in PEAK rapid cells using Transit 293 (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's directions. Cells were harvested by lysis in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8, containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture 72 h post-transfection, and an enriched glycoprotein fraction was obtained by wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography (29Hedo J.A. Harrison L.C. Roth J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3385-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These fractions were stored at –80 °C until assay. Receptor Binding Assays—Insulin-competitive receptor binding assays were performed by a modification of the microtiter plate antibody capture assay that we have described previously (24Whittaker J. Sorensen H. Gadsboll V.L. Hinrichsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47380-47384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Microtiter strip plates (Nunc Maxisorb) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with AU5 IgG (100 μl/well of 40 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). Washing, blocking, receptor binding, and competitive binding assays with labeled and unlabeled peptides were performed as described. Binding data were analyzed by a two-site sequential model (8De Meyts P. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S135-S148Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 30Christoffersen C.T. Bornfeldt K.E. Rotella C.M.

Receptor Autophosphorylation—Insulin-stimulated receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation was evaluated with a modification of a time-resolved fluorescence assay of insulin-like growth factor receptor autophosphorylation (31Chen J.W. Ledet T. Orskov H. Jessen N. Lund S. Whittaker J. De Meyts P. Larsen M.B. Christiansen J.S. Frystyk J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E1149-E1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Denley A.

Concentrations of mutant and wild-type receptors in enriched glycoprotein fractions from transfected cell lysates were determined by receptor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (24Whittaker J. Sorensen H. Gadsboll V.L. Hinrichsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47380-47384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Equal concentrations of mutant and wild-type receptors were incubated with varying concentrations of insulin in 0.1 ml of 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2,25mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.05% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 2 h at 25 °C. Autophosphorylation was initiated by addition of Na2VO4 and MgCl2 to final concentrations of 2 mm and 10 mm, respectively. The reaction was stopped after 20 min by the addition of EDTA and EGTA to final concentrations of 25 mm. The reaction mixture was then transferred to Delfia microtiter assay plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) coated with anti-AU5 IgG and incubated overnight at 4 °C to immobilize the insulin receptor. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline 0.02% Tween 20, receptors were incubated with europium-labeled PY20 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. After washing, the phosphotyrosine-containing receptor was quantitated by time-resolved fluorescence using a Victor 3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) plate reader. EC50 values (concentrations of insulin producing half-maximal response) were obtained from the dose-response data by nonlinear least squares analysis using Prism (GraphPad software). Insulin Binding—We have previously characterized the functional epitopes of the secreted recombinant insulin receptor extracellular domain by alanine-scanning mutagenesis (23Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2439-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Whittaker J. Sorensen H. Gadsboll V.L. Hinrichsen J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To determine significance of these epitopes for insulin binding in a physiological context, we subcloned the alanine mutations used to characterize them into the full-length B isoform receptor cDNA-tagged at its 3′ end with the coding sequence for a triple repeat of the AU5 epitope tag. The mutated cDNAs were transiently transfected in PEAK 293 cells. We then confirmed expression of the transfected cDNAs by determining tracer [125I-TyrA14]insulin I binding to detergent lysates of the transfected cells immobilized in microtiter plates coated with anti-AU5 IgG; no insulin binding was observed with lysates from mock transfected cells (data not shown). Detectable insulin binding was observed for all mutant cDNAs except those with alanine mutations of Arg14, Phe64, Phe705, Glu706, Tyr708, His710, Asn711, and Val715 (data not shown). Expression of these receptor mutants was subsequently confirmed and shown to be comparable of that of the wild-type receptor by Western blotting with anti-AU5 antibody (data not shown). We have shown previously that these mutants are also expressed normally as the recombinant secreted extracellular domain of the receptor (23Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2439-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Whittaker J. Sorensen H. Gadsboll V.L. Hinrichsen J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To characterize the equilibrium binding properties of the mutant receptors, detergent lysates of transfected cells were depleted of receptor precursor by wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography (29Hedo J.A. Harrison L.C. Roth J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3385-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Insulin equilibrium binding assays were then performed on the receptor isolated from the resulting glycoprotein fractions, and dissociation constants and IC50 were determined by computerized curve fitting using a two-site sequential model as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For the wild-type insulin receptor, Kd1, the dissociation constant of the high affinity component of binding, was 0.03 ± 0.001 nm; Kd2, the dissociation constant of the low affinity component of binding, was 0.4 ± 0.01 nm, and the IC50 was 0.09 ± 0.01 nm (mean ± S.E., n = 8, Table I). These binding properties differ significantly from those of the secreted recombinant insulin receptor determined under similar experimental conditions. With this form of the receptor, insulin binds to a single population of binding sites with a lower affinity, Kd = 2.1 nm (24Whittaker J. Sorensen H. Gadsboll V.L. Hinrichsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47380-47384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the findings reported in other studies (7Schaffer L. Eur. J.

In the L1 domain, alanine mutations of Arg14 and Phe64 appear to produce receptors that are devoid of insulin binding activity. No significant tracer binding was detected for these mutants, even after a 20-fold increase in concentration by wheat germ agglutinin chromatography (29Hedo J.A. Harrison L.C. Roth J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3385-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), despite expression comparable with the wild-type receptor in transiently transfected cells. Alanine mutation of Asn15 resulted in a >20-fold decrease in affinity for insulin. Alanine mutations of Asp12, Gln34, Leu36, Leu37, Leu87, Phe89, Asn90, Tyr91, and Lys121 all resulted in 4–10-fold decreases. Mutations of Glu97 and Glu120 were without significant effect. In the C terminus of the α subunit, alanine mutations of Phe705, Glu706, Tyr708, His710, Asn711, and Val715 had detrimental effects on insulin binding that were similar to those described for alanine mutants of Arg14 and Phe64 in the L1 domain. Alanine mutants of Leu709 and Phe714 both produced a 4–5-fold decrease in affinity for insulin. Alanine mutations of Asp707, Val712, and Val713 had no significant impact. In those mutations for which we have been able to provide a quantitative analysis of effects on insulin affinity, there is impairment of both the high (Kd1) and low affinity (Kd2) components of binding. Further, the magnitude of impairment of both components is similar. Insulin Receptor Autophosphorylation—To evaluate the role of this functional epitope in insulin receptor signaling, we evaluated insulin-regulated receptor autophosphorylation of alanine mutants of Asn15, Gln34, and Phe89; as discussed above, these mutations result in a 4–24-fold reduction in affinity for insulin. Wheat germ agglutinin-enriched glycoprotein fractions of transfected cell lysates were incubated with varying concentrations of insulin and then autophosphorylated. Tyrosine phosphorylation was quantitated by isolating receptor in microtiter plates coated with anti-AU5 antibody and quantitating phosphotyrosine content of the immobilized receptors with europium-labeled anti-PY20 antibody. For all receptors studied, the dose-response curve for autophosphorylation was bell-shaped (Fig. 1). Insulin produced a maximal 4.4 to 6.5 stimulation of autophosphorylation, and there were no significant differences between receptors (data not shown). The mutant receptors produced right shifts in the dose-response curve (Fig. 1), and the EC50 values for receptor autophosphorylation corresponded reasonably well with the IC50 values for insulin binding (Table II).Table IIComparison of EC50s for receptor autophosphorylation and IC50s for insulin of mutant receptorsReceptorEC50EC50 relative to WTIC50 relative to WTnmWT0.7 ± 0.2100100N15A14.7 ± 0.320.120.4Q34A2.0 ± 0.22.86.5F89A3.7 ± 0.45.49.6 Open table in a new tab To compare the relative impact of the alanine mutations on the affinities of the full-length receptor with the secreted recombinant receptor extracellular domain, the ratios of the IC50 of the mutant to the wild-type IC50 for each mutation were compared for each type of receptor (Fig. 2). Alanine mutations Arg14, Phe64, Phe705, Glu706, Tyr708, His710, and Asn711, which appear to inactivate the insulin binding function of the secreted recombinant receptor, also do so for the full-length receptor. However, because of the technical limitations of the assays, it is impossible to assess whether this is because of quantitatively similar disruption of insulin affinity. Rather surprisingly, alanine mutation of Val715, which has no impact on the affinity of the secreted receptor, inactivates the full-length receptor. Quantitatively similar changes in affinity in both forms of the receptor (4–10-fold) result from alanine mutations of Gln34, Leu36, Leu87, Asn90, and Tyr91 in the L1 domain. Mutations of Asp12, Leu37, Glu97, and Glu120 in the L1 domain had a 2–3-fold greater effect on the affinity of the secreted extracellular domain for insulin than on the full-length receptor. In contrast, alanine mutation of Phe89 had a slightly larger effect on the affinity of the full-length receptor (10-fold versus 6-fold). In the C terminus of the α subunit, alanine mutations of Leu709 and Phe714 had significantly greater effects on the affinity of the secreted receptor than the full-length receptor (80- and 40-fold versus 5- and 6-fold, respectively). Alanine mutations of Asp707, Val712, and Val713 had no significant effect on affinity of either form of the receptor. Thus, consistent with previous findings, we found that the affinity of the native insulin receptor for insulin is higher than that of the secreted recombinant receptor, and its binding kinetics are more complex (7Schaffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 17Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Vissing H. Schaffer L. Rasmussen J.S. De Meyts P. Moller N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13681-13686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the functional epitopes of the equivalent ligand binding site of both forms of the receptor are similar, certain amino acids appear to make significantly different contributions to the free energy of binding of each form of the receptor. It is worth considering these findings in the context of current models of insulin/receptor interactions. Both De Meyts (8De Meyts P. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S135-S148Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and Schaffer (7Schaffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) have proposed similar bivalent mechanisms of insulin binding to the receptor. Both propose that there are two distinct receptor binding sites on the insulin molecule and that there are two distinct insulin binding sites on each α subunit (1De Meyts P. Whittaker J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 769-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 7Schaffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Insulin first binds to one site on one α subunit and then cross-links the two heterodimers by binding to the non-equivalent site on the second subunit, generating the high affinity component of the receptor interaction. Binding of a second insulin molecule in this manner disrupts the cross-linking of the first and accelerates its dissociation (negative cooperation), giving rise to the complex binding behavior exhibited by insulin interactions with the full-length receptor. In contrast, in the recombinant secreted receptor and the isolated heterodimer, it is postulated that insulin only binds to the site with higher affinity, and hence this interaction displays a lower affinity than that of the native receptor and simple binding kinetics. From the data presented by Schaffer (7Schaffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), it is apparent that the affinity of this site is much greater than that of the other. Thus it would be expected that mutations producing changes in the affinity of this binding site for insulin would also, in the recombinant secreted receptor, produce comparable changes in affinity of the holoreceptor. In general, this appears to be the case. Further, this model would also suggest that alanine mutations compromising the higher affinity site, i.e. the binding site of the secreted recombinant receptor, would have similar effects on the high and low affinity components of insulin binding in the full-length receptor, as was generally observed in the present study. The sequential binding mechanism may also provide an explanation for the differences in the functional epitopes observed for the two forms of the receptor. Insulin has been observed to have varying conformations in different crystallographic and NMR solution structures (33Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Dodson G.G. Hodgkin D.C. Nature. 1983; 302: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 34Hua Q.X. Shoelson S.E. Kochoyan M. Weiss M.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that the initial binding event in the full-length receptor may lead to a change in its conformation from that in solution, thus producing the differences in effects of the alanine mutations from those observed with the secreted receptor. Further previous studies from this laboratory comparing the functional epitopes of the A and B isoforms of the receptor have provided evidence for plasticity in the conformation of the ligand binding site of the receptor (24Whittaker J. Sorensen H. Gadsboll V.L. Hinrichsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47380-47384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is perhaps significant that the mutations that produce the most divergent effects in the full-length and secreted receptor involve those residues that are most divergent in the functional epitopes of the A and B isoforms of the secreted receptor (24Whittaker J. Sorensen H. Gadsboll V.L. Hinrichsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47380-47384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We also compared the effects of mutations of Asn15, Gln34, and Phe89 on insulin-induced receptor autophosphorylation. The dose-response curve for autophosphorylation was bell-shaped for all receptors. Such bell-shaped curves are indicative of bivalent binding mechanisms involving ligand cross-linking of binding sites (1De Meyts P. Whittaker J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 769-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). There were no significant differences in the maximal response to insulin, indicating that the coupling between ligand binding and the conformational changes resulting in activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase catalytic activity is intact in these mutants. This further confirms the structural integrity of the mutants. However these mutations did result in shifts of the concentration dependence of insulin-regulated receptor autophosphorylation, which correlated reasonably well with the changes in affinity for insulin. This correlation is consistent with the results of studies of the biological activities of insulin analogues that bind to this site, in which it was found that changes in potency correlated with changes in affinity for the receptor (35Volund A. Brange J. Drejer K. Jensen I. Markussen J. Ribel U. Sorensen A.R. Schlichtkrull J. Diabet. Med. 1991; 8: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In summary, we have demonstrated that alanine mutations of amino acids in the functional epitope of the secreted recombinant receptor largely have similar effects on the affinity of the full-length receptor for insulin. Further, we have shown that selected mutations cause changes in the insulin sensitivity of the receptor kinase proportional to their effects on affinity for insulin."

Presenilin-1 (PS-1) is one of the critical integral membrane protein components of the γ-secretase complex and is processed endoproteolytically, generating N- and C-terminal fragments (NTF and CTF, respectively). PS-1 is also known to incorporate into a high molecular weight complex by binding to other γ-secretase components such as Nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2. Mutations on PS-1 can alter the effects of γ-secretase on its many substrates to different extents. Here, we showed that PS-1 mutants have a different activity for Notch cleavage, which depended on the PS-1 mutation site. We demonstrated that defective PS-1 mutants located in CTF, i.e. D385A and C410Y, could restore their γ-secretase activities with the compensatory overexpression of wild type CTF or of minimal deleted CTF (amino acids 349–467). However, the defective PS-1 D257A mutant could not restore their γ-secretase activities with the compensatory overexpression of wild type NTF. In comparison, both D257A NTF and D385A CTF could abolish the γ-secretase activity of wild type and pathogenic PS-1 mutants. We also showed that PS-1 NTF but not CTF forms strong high molecular weight aggregates in SDS-PAGE. Taken together, results have shown that NTF and CTF integrate differently into high molecular weight aggregates and that PS-1 Asp-257 and Asp-385 have different accessibilities in their unendoproteolyzed conformation.

AD is observed in more than 10% of individuals over the age of 65, but its exact pathogenic mechanism is elusive. AD is associated with massive accumulation of fibrillary aggregates in various cortical and subcortical regions of the brain, which include intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid plaques (1Rubinsztein D.C.

Familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) accounts for 5–10% of AD cases, and ∼50% of these have been definitely linked to mutations in the three genes that encode the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 (PS-1), and presenilin 2 (PS-2). To date, more than 150 different FAD-linked PS-1 mutations have been identified and account for the vast majority of FAD-related mutations (2Czech C. Tremp G. Pradier L. Prog.

Studies with artificial and spontaneously occurring PS-1 mutants reveal that the activity of γ-secretase is critically dependent on the presence of two intact aspartate residues, Asp-257 and Asp-385, and on the endoproteolysis of PS-1.

Among these, Notch is the receptor for Jagged and Delta, which are critically required for a variety of signaling events both during embryogenesis and in adulthood (35Fortini M.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). PSs are involved in the proteolytic processing (S3 cleavage) of Notch, which results in the release of its intracellular domain (NICD), which in turn acts as a transcription factor in the nucleus after associating with either a member of the CSL family of DNA-binding proteins or with LEF-1 (36De Strooper B.

The Notch ligands, Delta1 and Jagged, are sequentially cleaved by an ADAM protease and γ-secretase, indicating that γ-secretase plays a pivotal role in the Delta1-Notch signaling pathway (38Six E.

However, the exact role of Notch 1 in the progression of AD remains to be demonstrated. More than 150 FAD-linked PS-1 mutations have been identified to date and are suggested to affect γ-secretase activity to different extents according to substrate levels. In this report, we used four different mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines with different PS-1 and -2 levels, as well as several PS-1 mutants to investigate the effect of exogenous PS-1 on the cleavage of Notch. Because the presence of endogenous PS-1 or -2 was sufficient to cleave Notch, PS-1/2-/- MEFs were used. We demonstrated that the cleavage of Notch depends on the mutation site in PS-1. With the use of NTF and CTF fragments, we clearly showed that the defects in PS-1 D257A and D385A are caused by changes in their catalytic domains rather than by the lack of endoproteolysis. The defects in PS-1 D385A mutants could be restored by the compensatory overexpression of its normal counterpart, wild type (wt) CTF. In contrast to D385A, defects in PS-1 D257A could not be restored by wt NTF. The minimal domain of wt CTF required to maintain γ-secretase activity is located between residues 349 and 467. Our results indicate that NTF and CTF showed different HMW aggregate compositions and displayed different restoring effects on PS-1 D257A and D385A, as well as on different PS-1 mutants, suggesting that their regulation or function can be different.

Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted at 95 °C for 2 min with 50 μl of 2 sample buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.2 m dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 1.43 m β-mercaptoethanol) and analyzed by immunoblotting as described below. Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture). Cell lysates were quantified using the BCA assay kit (Pierce) and electrophoresed using 8% Tris-glycine gels (Novex). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) that was subsequently probed with antibodies. Bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by visualization with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Even loadings on each lane were confirmed using direct blue 71 staining kits (EZBiopaQ, Co., Ltd.). For the NICD/PS-1 and NICD/tubulin ratio, a quantification of the protein bands was performed with a HP scanjet 3570c scanner (Hewlett-Packard) interfaced to an IBM computer, and image analysis was performed using the TINA 2.09 software program (Raytest). Notch Cleavage Depends on the Presence of Endogenous PS-1 and PS-2 and on the Type of PS-1 Mutants—Small amounts of endogenous PS-1 and PS-2 can interfere with the estimation of exogenously expressed PS-1. We used four different cell lines to investigate the effects of endogenous PS-1 and PS-2 on the cleavage of Notch. In the PS-1/2+/+ MEFs that express both endogenous PS-1 and PS-2 and in the PS-1-/- and PS-2-/- MEFs that express only endogenous PS-2 and PS-1, respectively, Notch cleavage occurred regardless of the presence of exogenous PS-1 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, NICD, the cleaved form of Notch, was still generated in PS-1/2+/+ cell lines even after the overexpression of PS-1 D385A, the catalytically inactive form of PS-1 (data not shown). However, in PS-1/2-/- MEFs having no endogenous PS-1 and PS-2, Notch cleavage occurred only when exogenous PS-1 was overexpressed (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we concluded that PS-1/2-/- MEF cell lines having no endogenous PSs should be employed to investigate the effect of exogenously overexpressed PS-1. Using PS-1/2-/- cell lines and various mutant PS-1 constructs tagged with GFP, we observed different Notch cleavage patterns (top panel, Fig. 1B). The overexpressed wild types and mutant PS-1s were localized mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi but were also found throughout the cytoplasm (data not shown). We analyzed the expression levels of different PS variants (middle panel, Fig. 1B), which were quantified and related to the amounts of NICD formed (bottom panel, Fig. 1B). Each of four spontaneous PS-1 mutants cleaved Notch to a different extent. As shown in Fig. 1B, PS-1 with a point mutation at M146V cleaved Notch slightly more than wt PS-1 did, whereas PS-1 with a mutation at Y115H and L286V cleaved Notch to a lesser extent than did wt PS-1. Interestingly, the spontaneous PS-1 C410Y mutant had defects in Notch cleavage. When the PS-1 putative catalytic site residues, Asp-257 and Asp-385, were artificially point mutated to Ala, the resulting PS-1 mutants could not cleave Notch. Likewise, M146V/D257A double mutated PS-1 did not cleave Notch, indicating that the presence of both Asp-257 and Asp-385 is required for Notch cleavage. When this set of experiments was performed in PS-1/2+/+ cells, all PS-1 mutants that were defective in cleaving Notch in PS-1/2-/- MEFs generated NICD regardless of the PS-1 mutant type (data not shown), supporting the notion that PS-1/2-/- MEFs should be used to investigate the effect of exogenous PS-1 constructs. Both PS-1 D257A and D385A Mutants Fail to Cleave Notch in Their Endoproteolyzed Forms, but the PS-1 D385A Mutant Can Restore Its γ-Secretase Activity with the Compensatory Overexpression of Normal CTF—Both aspartate residues, Asp-257 and Asp-385, are required for γ-secretase activity. There are controversial reports debating whether the defects of D257A and D385A mutants are the result of a change in their catalytic domains or a lack of endoproteolytic activity (12Yu G. Chen F.

To demonstrate directly that the defects of PS-1 D257A and D385A mutants are caused by changes in their catalytic sites and also to analyze the different effects of the PS-1 NTF and CTF, we constructed normal and mutant NTFs and CTFs tagged with GFP at the N terminus as follows: wt NTF (1–298 amino acids), wt CTF (299–467 amino acids), D257A NTF (1–298 amino acids in which the aspartate in residue 257 is point mutated to alanine), D385A CTF (299–467 amino acids in which the aspartate in residue 385 is point mutated to alanine). The overexpression of either wt NTF or wt CTF alone (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5, respectively) was not sufficient to cleave Notch, but overexpression of wt NTF and wt CTF together (Fig. 2A, lane 6) cleaved Notch to the same extent as full-length PS-1 (Fig. 2A, lane 3), indicating that the NTF and CTF constructs functioned as expected. When we combined D257A NTF and D385A CTF with their normal counterparts, wt CTF and wt NTF, respectively (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8), Notch was not cleaved, indicating that the defects of full-length PS-1 D257A and D385A are caused by changes in their catalytic domains rather than the lack of endoproteolysis. Interestingly, the defects of full-length PS-1 D385A could be restored by overexpressing its normal counterpart, wt CTF (Fig. 2A, lane 10), whereas the defect of D257A could not be restored by wt NTF (Fig. 2A, lane 9). Along the same line, it is worth noting that the defects in cleaving Notch by the C410Y mutant was also restored by overexpressing wt CTF but not wt NTF (Fig. 2A, lanes 13 and 12, respectively). Our results suggest that the defects of NTF and CTF regional mutations can be restored differentially by overexpressing their normal PS-1 fragments. Endoproteolysis of PS-1 D257A and D385A Mutants Depends on the Presence of Endogenous PS-1/2—To measure the level of endoproteolysis of D257A and D385A mutants, we transiently transfected both mutants to PS-1/2-/- MEF cell lines that had neither endogenous PS-1 nor PS-2. In PS-1/2-/- cell lines, a generated endoproteolyzed form of PS-1 was detected with a specific antibody against their CTF. The endoproteolyzed form of PS-1 D257A and D385A was barely detectable compared with that of wt PS-1 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 2, and 5). The compensatory overexpression of NTF or CTF did not induce any significant increase in the endoproteolysis of PS-1 D257A and D385A (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 4, 6, and 7). Therefore, the restoration of γ-secretase activity in PS-1 D385A by the compensatory overexpression of normal CTF may result from the direct binding to the Asp-257 NTF portion of uncleaved PS-1 D385A rather than from increased endoproteolysis. The weak endoproteolysis of PS-1 D257A and D385A mutants in PS-1/2-/- MEF cells was more apparent in PS-1/2+/+ cells, suggesting that the degree of endoproteolysis of PS-1 D257A and D385A mutants might be affected by the presence of functional γ-secretase (Fig. 2C). The Minimal Domain of Wild Type CTF Maintaining the γ-Secretase Activity Is Located between Residues 349 and 467, and Notch Cleavage Can Be Abolished with D385A CTF and Its 349–467 Fragment in a Dose-dependent Manner—As shown above, PS-1 is processed endoproteolytically, generating NTF and CTF. Laudon and co-workers (42Laudon H. Mathews P.M. Karlstrom H. Bergman A. Farmery M.R. Nixon R.A. Winblad B. Gandy S.E. Lendahl U. Lundkvist J. Naslund J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have reported that the overexpression of both wt NTF and CTF, but not necessarily full-length PS-1, is sufficient to cleave Notch, which is in agreement with our current observations. To understand the roles of NTF and CTF more precisely and map the minimal regions responsible for γ-secretase activity, we constructed several deleted NTFs and CTFs tagged with GFP at their N termini, as illustrated in Fig. 3A. We confirmed the expression of each construct by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). Wild type CTF and deleted NTF and CTF fragments migrated as we expected, but wt NTF was incorporated mainly into HMW aggregates. Fragments B and E as well as CTF fragment A were slightly heavier than we expected, possibly because of the phosphorylation of residue 346, a known target site of protein kinase C (43Fluhrer R. Friedlein A. Haass C. Walter J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1585-1593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When we coexpressed one of the deleted NTFs with wt CTF in PS-1/2-/- MEFs, none of the deleted NTFs showed Notch cleavage, suggesting that an almost full conformation of wt NTF is required for γ-secretase activity (Fig. 3C). Nevertheless, we found that the minimal domain of wt CTF responsible for generating γ-secretase activity is located between residues 349 and 467 of PS-1 (Fig. 3D, F fragment). Neither fragment E (residues 299–417) nor fragment D (residues 418–467) was sufficient to cleave Notch. To define the factors affecting the PS-1/γ-secretase activity in CTF, especially fragments E and F, we transfected wt NTF and a different CTF fragment in PS-1/2-/- MEFs and performed immunoblot analysis as shown in Fig. 4. Noticeable decreases in Nicastrin and Notch binding to PS-1 were observed in cells transfected with wt NTF and fragment E (residues 299–417), whereas no decrease in binding in cells transfected with wt NTF and fragment F (residues 349–467) was seen, indicating that the C terminus of PS-1 (amino acids 418–467) might be important for Nicastrin and/or Notch binding (Fig. 4A). The binding of Nicastrin and Notch in wt NTF and D385A CTF-transfected cells was observed (second lane), indicating once more that the defects of PS-1 D385"

In this study, we used the degeneration of transected axons, termed “Wallerian degeneration,” as a model to examine the possible involvement of Rho. Nogo-66, a myelin-derived inhibitor of axon regeneration, significantly accelerated axon degeneration of the dorsal root ganglion explant in vitro, whereas inhibiting Rho-kinase activity abolished the effect. Rho activation was observed in the distal part of the injured axons after spinal cord injury. We demonstrate that degeneration of the injured cortico-spinal axons was significantly retarded by a Rho-kinase inhibitor in vivo.

Our findings suggest that inhibiting the signaling pathway may retard axon degeneration in pathological conditions. Axon degeneration occurs frequently in many types of chronic neurodegenerative diseases and in injuries to axons caused by toxic, ischemic, or traumatic insults (1Raff M.C. Whitmore A.V. Finn J.T. Science. 2002; 296: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 2Coleman M.P. Perry V.H. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). It may lead to separation of the neurons from their targets, resulting in the loss of neuronal function. Effort has focused on understanding the nature of neuronal cell death in these diseases (3Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar); however, strategies designed to prevent neuronal cell death have resulted in only limited success in preventing or delaying neurodegeneration. Interfering with the process of axon degeneration may represent an additional and complementary therapeutic avenue for these diseases.The simplest model of axon degeneration known to date is the self-destructive process observed at the distal portion of a transected axon upon injury, termed “Wallerian degeneration.” In vertebrates, the distal part of an axon can remain viable and conduct action potentials in vivo for up to a few days, after which they undergo rapid structural destruction in which the axolemma and axonal cytoskeleton are dismantled. Interestingly, the axons undergoing Wallerian degeneration do not seem to possess detectable activation of the caspase family cysteine proteases (4Finn J.T. Weil M. Archer F. Siman R. Srinivasan A. Raff M.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Wallerian degeneration and apoptosis may represent two distinct self-destruct programs. In Wallerian degeneration slow (Wlds) mice, Wallerian degeneration in response to axonal injury is delayed because of a mutation that results in the overexpression of a chimeric protein (Wlds) composed of the ubiquitin assembly protein, Ufd2a, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthetic enzyme, Nmnat1. Increased Nmnat activity was recently shown to be responsible for the axon-sparing activity of Wlds protein (5Araki T. Sasaki Y. Milbrandt Y. Science. 2004; 305: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Downstream of Nmnat, Sirt1, a mammalian ortholog of Sir2, contributes to axonal protection. This discovery is a major step for understanding the molecular mechanism of Wallerian degeneration; however, the precise mechanism remains unknown.Given that Wallerian degeneration is an active process, we hypothesized that the self-destruction process of injured axons might be a type of cytoskeletal reorganization. Rho GTPases are a family of highly related proteins best known for their effects on the actin cytoskeleton. Here we report that Rho, a small GTPase, is involved in Wallerian degeneration in vitro and in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSSurgical Procedure—Anesthetized (sodium pentobarbital, 40 mg kg–1) female Wistar rats (200–250 g) received a laminectomy at vertebral level T9/10, and the spinal cord was exposed. A number 11 blade was used for total section of the spinal cord, and a part of the spinal cord of 5 mm in length was removed. A small piece of gel foam, soaked in 10 μl of 30 mm Y-27632 (Calbiochem) dissolved in PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RBD, Rho GTPase-binding domain; PB, phosphate buffer; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; CST, corticospinal tract; BDA, biotin dextran amine. or PBS, was implanted into the wound cavity, and the muscle and skin layers were sutured. Histologic examination has revealed that these lesions sever all fibers in the spinal cord. The bladder was expressed by manual abdominal pressure at least twice a day.In Situ Rho GTPase Activity Assay—The construct consisting of the Rho GTPase-binding domain of Rhotekin (nucleotides 609–857) fused with GST in the pGEX vector (RBD-GST) was kindly provided by Dr. M. A. Schwartz. In situ Rho GTPase activity assay using recombinant RBD-GST was performed as described previously (6Li Z. Aizenman C.D. Cline H.T. Neuron. 2002; 33: 741-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Animals were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (PB) (pH 7.4) at room temperature, and the spinal cords were then dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PB at 4 °C overnight, rinsed in PB, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. Cryostat sections (20 μm) taken from the caudal stump 10–15 mm from the transection site were incubated with blocking solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation with RBD-GST (2 μg/ml) at room temperature. After rinsing, sections were fixed again in 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PB for 10 min at room temperature and were incubated with an anti-GST monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:400 in blocking solution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, Vector) was used as the secondary antibody.For quantitative analysis, we analyzed at least three sections per rat, six rats for each experimental condition. The area of corticospinal tract in the caudall stump, ∼3–6 mm caudally from the injury site, was studied. Using Macsope analysis software (Mitani Corp.), we measured intensity of fibers. Double immunohistochemical analysis showed that the fibers shorter than 15 μm were negative for neuron-specific β-tubulin III, demonstrating that they were not neurons, whereas the fibers longer than 15 μm were positive for neuron-specific β-tubulin III. As the focus of our study is to analyze the activity of RhoA in the neurons, we selected a subset of fibers longer than 15 μm. The statistical analysis was done by t test.In Vitro Degeneration Assay—DRGs from P8 rats were removed and desheathed in cold sterile PBS and transferred to 6-well tissue culture dishes (Greiner) coated with polyethylenimine (Sigma). Each well contained 1 ml of culture medium consisting of neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml nerve growth factor, and 1 μm Ara C. After 3 days of incubation at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air/5% CO2 incubator, the extended neurites from explant cultures of the ganglia were transected using a microscalpel.A portion of Nogo-A encoding the 66-residue lumenal/extracellular fragment of Nogo-A was amplified by PCR and ligated into the pGEX-2T plasmid to yield a prokaryotic expression vector for the GST-Nogo fusion protein (7GrandPre T. Nakamura F. Vartanian T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain BL21 transformed with the vectors was treated overnight at 20 °C with 0.1 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside to induce the protein expression. The protein was purified through a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of the protein was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting using monoclonal anti-GST antibody.Immediately after the neurites of the explants were cut, Nogo-66-GST (100 nm) or GST as a control was added to the medium. Where indicated, Y-27632 was added after the transection. The explants were fixed and incubated with blocking solution containing 5% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h, followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with anti-β-tubulin III antibody (diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution; Covance) Fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as the secondary antibody.Quantitative analysis of axonal degeneration was performed, and the cultures were examined using phase-contrast as well as fluorescence microscopy. Axons with a fragmented, non-refractile appearance were designated as “degenerated.” At least 200 individually distinguishable axons were blindly scored from several random images of each culture. Each condition was tested in triplicate explants in each experiment. Results were obtained from three to four independent experiments for each condition. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test.Growth Cone Collapse Assay—Explants of DRG were transected using a microscalpel, incubated for 2 h on the dishes, and were treated for 30 min with the GST-Nogo fusion protein at 100 nm. Explants were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and were stained with fluorescence-labeled phalloidin (Sigma). For each experiment, we assessed at least 100 growth cones and repeated the same experiments three times.Immunohistochemistry—The transected spinal cords were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PB for 1 h at room temperature, and cryostat sections were prepared. They were incubated with blocking solution containing 5% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h, followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with anti-β-tubulin III antibody (diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution; Covance) or anti-neurofilament antibody (diluted 1:200 in blocking solution, Chemicon). Fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100; Molecular Probes) was used as the secondary antibody.Anterograde Labeling of the Corticospinal Tract (CST)—Descending CST fibers were labeled with biotin dextran amine (BDA; 10% in saline, 3.5 μl per cortex, Mr 10,000; Molecular Probes) injected under anesthesia at the left and the right motor cortices (coordinates: 2 mm posterior to bregma, 2 mm lateral to bregma, 1.5 mm depth). For each injection, 0.25 μl of BDA was delivered over 30 s via a 15–20-μm inner diameter glass capillary attached to a microliter syringe (ITO). We examined five control and five Rho-kinase inhibitor-treated rats with the spinal cord injury. Fourteen days after BDA injection, the animals received the spinal cord injury (total section of the spinal cord) and were treated with or without Rho-kinase inhibitor. Five days after surgery, the rats were killed by perfusion with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The spinal cords were dissected, post-fixed overnight in the same fixatives, and cryopreserved in 30% sucrose in PBS. The spinal cord 5 mm rostral and 5 mm caudal to the lesion site (10 mm long) was embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT. These blocks were sectioned in the sagittal plane (50 μm), retaining each section. Transverse sections were also collected from the spinal cord rostral and caudal to the injury site. Sections were blocked in PBS with 0.5% BSA for 1 h and then incubated for 1 day with Alxa Fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin (1:400; Molecular Probes) in PBS with 0.15% BSA.For quantification, BDA-labeled axons were counted on every fifth section, and the total number of counted fibers was multiplied by five to generate an estimated total number of labeled axons caudal or rostral to the injury site. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test.Affinity Precipitation of GTP-RhoA—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2, with leupeptin and aprotinin, each at 10 μg/ml. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatants were incubated with 20 μg of RBD-GST beads at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed four times with a washing buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). Bound Rho proteins were detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).RESULTSRho Activation in Injured Axons—It has been reported that RhoA is activated in neurons and glial cells around the injury site following spinal cord injury (8Dubreuil C.I. Winton M.J. McKerracher L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 9Madura T. Yamashita T. Kubo T. Fujitani M. Hosokawa K. Tohyama M. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This activation is dependent on the p75 receptor, which transduces the signal from several myelin-derived inhibitors of axon regeneration, during the early stages. As these myelin-derived proteins are present around the injured axons, we were interested in changes in Rho activity in the injured fibers that lead to Wallerian degeneration. The rat spinal cord was injured at the thoracic level by transecting the spinal cord. The animals were sacrificed 8 or 24 h after surgery, and the tissues caudal to the injury site were removed. To examine the Rho activity after spinal cord injury, the in situ pull-down method was employed (6Li Z. Aizenman C.D. Cline H.T. Neuron. 2002; 33: 741-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We incubated sections with a recombinant Rho GTPase-binding domain of Rhotekin fused with GST (GST-RBD), and cells that bound high levels of RBD were detected with an anti-GST antibody. In sham-operated animals, no significant signal for Rho activation was observed (Fig. 1a); however, we observed intensively stained fibers in the white matter where descending projections were localized 8 (Fig. 1b) or 24 h (Fig. 1c) after spinal cord injury. The signal was significantly more intensive in the injured animals than in the sham-operated animals by quantitating the signal intensity in the corticospinal tract caudal to the injury site (Fig. 1d). Thus, Rho is activated extensively in injured axons distal from the lesion site.Myelin-derived Proteins Accelerate Axon Degeneration by Activating Rho/Rho-kinase in Vitro—Rho activation after spinal cord injury is partly mediated by growth-inhibitory proteins from myelin, including Nogo-A, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (10McKerracher L. Winton M.J. Neuron. 2002; 36: 345-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These proteins are believed to inhibit the regeneration of injured axons in the central nervous system. These growth-inhibitory proteins may contribute to the degeneration of axons by activating RhoA. To test this hypothesis, we employed an in vitro degeneration model of transected axons from cultured primary neurons. Degeneration of the distal part of neurites was assessed after transection in P8 rat DRG explants cultured for 3 days. The distal part of neurites was separated from the body of the explant using a microscalpel and followed for up to 24 h after transection. The severed axons began to develop signs of early degeneration such as focal swelling and beading ∼8 h after the axons had been separated from their cell bodies (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2Rho-kinase is involved in Wallerian degeneration in vitro. a–d, DRG explants were cultured for 3 days and then cut. Note the degeneration of neurites distal from the cut site 8 h after separation (a). After transection of the neurites, the cultures were incubated with Nogo-66-GST (100 nm) or GST as a control for 8 h. Degeneration was facilitated by Nogo-66-GST (100 nm) (b), and the effect of Nogo-66-GST was inhibited by Y-27632 (3 μm)(c, d). e, quantitative analysis of the number of remaining neuritis relative to pretransection.

The effects of Nogo-66-GST on neuronal growth cones were assessed. Bath applications of Nogo-66-GST (100 nm) for 30 min exhibited significant growth cone collapsing activity (Fig. 2f). We then measured RhoA activity in the neurons. Using the RhoA-binding domain of the effector protein Rhotekin, the GTP-bound form of RhoA can be affinity-precipitated. The assay revealed that RhoA was activated 30 min following the addition of Nogo-66-GST to the culture (Fig. 2g). Thus, these neurites are responsive to Nogo-66 after separation from the cell bodies.We next tested to see if these proteins play a role in the degeneration of severed distal axons. In the presence of 100 nm Nogo-66-GST, the axons completely degenerated and detached 8 h post-axotomy (Fig. 2b). The relative number of remaining neurites was significantly decreased by the Nogo-66 treatment compared with the control (Fig. 2e). To test whether the effect of Nogo-66-GST is dependent on the activation of Rho and its downstream effector, Rho-kinase, in neurites, the explants were treated with a Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632. Although Y-27632 itself had no effect on the degeneration of the distal part of neurites (Fig. 2, c and e), it completely abolished the effect of Nogo-66-GST (Fig. 2, d and e). As Y-27632 had no significant effect on basal axonal degeneration, RhoA may be inactive in the control DRG, which is also suggested by the affinity precipitation data (Fig. 2g). The same result was achieved with the soluble form of myelin-associated glycoprotein (data not shown). These results suggest that myelin-derived proteins facilitate axonal degeneration following axotomy by activating Rho/Rho-kinase in vitro.Rho-kinase Inhbition Suppresses Wallerian Degeneration in Vivo—To assess whether the observations from in vitro culture experiments were valid in vivo, we first performed immunostaining experiments to examine the alterations of microtubules or neurofilaments in the injured spinal cords. An early step of Wallerian degeneration is the granular disintegration of the cytoskeleton, in which the normal cytoskeletal proteins of the axon are abruptly degraded to granular and amorphous debris. Three days after the spinal cord lesion, sections from one segment above and below the lesion site displayed clear signs of Wallerian degeneration. Staining for neuron-specific β-tubulin III protein demonstrated a massive loss of nerve fibers (Fig. 3a and supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). Furthermore, many pathological profiles were visible with a swollen and irregular appearance. To examine whether the Rho-kinase inhibitor retards Wallerian degeneration in vivo, we applied gel foams, pre-soaked with the vehicle (PBS) or Y-27632, to the lesion sites and examined the spinal cords 3 days post-axotomy by immunostaining. As expected, Y-27632 significantly abolished the breakdown of microtubules (Fig. 3, a and b, and supplemental Figs. 1 and 2) and neurofilaments (Fig. 3, c and d) as well as axolemma in transected spinal cords. These results suggest that the inhibition of Rho-kinase activity can delay Wallerian degeneration both in vitro and in vivo.Fig. 3Inhibiting Rho-kinase delays the Wallerian degeneration of severed spinal cords in vivo. Representative figures for transverse sections of injured spinal cord of rats with (b, d) or without (a, c) Y-27632 treatment. Samples were taken from the caudal stump 15 mm from the transection site, and the sections were immunostained with anti-β-tubulin III (TuJ-1) antibody (a, b) or anti-neurofilament antibody (c, d). The massive loss of nerve fibers, observed 3 days after injury, was inhibited by Y-27632 treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally, the integrity of the dorsal CST in rats with spinal cord injury was visualized by injecting BDA into the sensorymotor cortex to demonstrate Wallerian degeneration more clearly. The spinal cord was injured 14 days after the injection of BDA, and the rats were sacrificed and morphologically assessed 5 days after the injury. Labeled CST fibers rostral to the lesion site in longitudinal sections showed numerous intact fibers (Fig. 4a). However, very few labeled fibers with a dot-like appearance were seen caudal to the injury site, demonstrating extensive degeneration of the axons (Fig. 4, b and d). However, we observed that samples from injured rats treated with the Rho-kinase inhibitor exhibited an entirely different pattern of labeling (Fig. 4, c and d), clearly showing that fiber degeneration was significantly inhibited by the Rho-kinase inhibitor.Fig. 4Inhibiting Rho-kinase blocks the degeneration of the cortico-spinal tract. a–c, representative pictures of BDA-labeled CST fibers caudal or rostral to the injury site; rostral side is on the left.

Stewart C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the ubiquitin proteosome system delays axon degeneration both in vitro and in vivo (12Zhai Q. Wang J. Kim A. Liu Q. Watts R. Hoopfer E. Mitchison T. Luo L. He Z. Neuron. 2003; 39: 217-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), although the molecular target of ubiquitin proteosome system-mediated proteolysis is unknown. In contrast, a recent surprising study showed that increased NAD biosynthesis or enhanced activity of the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 protects mouse neurons from Wallerian degeneration using mice carrying a spontaneous dominant Wlds mutation (5Araki T. Sasaki Y. Milbrandt Y. Science. 2004; 305: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). It is possible that the target of SIRT1 protective activity may be a transcriptional factor up-regulating the expression of neuroprotective proteins.We started current study by hypothesizing that degeneration of the axons is a process of cellular cytoskeleton alteration. Our study adds a new participant in Wallerian degeneration, although the link to previous findings remains unknown. As Rho plays a key role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, our data support the notion that local axon destruction is the process of cytoskeletal reorganization. However, it is noted that the Rho-kinase inhibitor only partially prevented Wallerian degeneration. Therefore, other molecular events should play important roles in the phenomenon. In addition, we used the spinal cord injury model to assess it in the current study. As Wallerian degeneration is robust in the peripheral neurons, it is important to assess if Rho-kinase inhibitors slow down degeneration of the peripheral neurons. However, we failed in detecting activation of RhoA in the injured axons following sciatic nerve transection (data not shown), suggesting that other molecular events are important for Wallerian degeneration in the peripheral nervous system. Rho/Rho-kinase pathway may be one of the factors that accelerate Wallerian degeneration.Rho/Rho-kinase has been shown to associate with inability of the central nervous system neurons to regenerate. Inactivation of Rho-kinase by Y-27632 significantly facilitates locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury (13Dergham P. Ellezam B. Essagian C. Avedissian H. Lubell W.D. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6570-6577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fournier A.E. Takizawa B.T. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1416-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tanaka H. Yamashita T. Yachi K. Fujiwara T. Yoshikawa H. Tohyama M. Neuroscience. 2004; 127: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Treatment with Y-27632 after spinal cord injury promotes regeneration of the cortico-spinal tract neurons. In addition, the neuroprotective, tissue-preserving activities of Rho or Rho-kinase inhibitors were also reported (8Dubreuil C.I. Winton M.J. McKerracher L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 13Dergham P. Ellezam B. Essagian C. Avedissian H. Lubell W.D. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6570-6577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Rho/Rho-kinase has important roles in the pathogenesis of spinal cord injury.The morphological features of Wallerian degeneration are common to a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, axonal degeneration also occurs during normal development (1Raff M.C. Whitmore A.V. Finn J.T. Science. 2002; 296: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Neurons in the brain initially extend axonal branches to inappropriate regions, and these branches are later lost by a process called pruning. It was reported very recently that cell-specific ablation of the murine gene Ptk2, encoding focal adhesion kinases, increases the number of axonal terminals and synapses formed by neurons in vivo (16Rico B. Beggs H.E. Schahin-Reed D. Kimes N. Schmidt A. Reichardt L.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Focal adhesion kinases seem to contribute to the negative regulation of axonal branching through the activation of Rho by p190 Rho guanine nucleotide-exchange factor. Therefore, molecular events underlying the process of axon destruction in developmental and pathological states might be at least partly common. Possible cross-talk between the activation of the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway and NAD-SIRT1 or ubiquitin proteosome system should be assessed in the future. Manipulating the process of axon degeneration may represent a therapeutic avenue for neurodegenerative diseases with axon destruction. Axon degeneration occurs frequently in many types of chronic neurodegenerative diseases and in injuries to axons caused by toxic, ischemic, or traumatic insults (1Raff M.C. Whitmore A.V. Finn J.T. Science. 2002; 296: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 2Coleman M.P. Perry V.H. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). It may lead to separation of the neurons from their targets, resulting in the loss of neuronal function. Effort has focused on understanding the nature of neuronal cell death in these diseases (3Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar); however, strategies designed to prevent neuronal cell death have resulted in only limited success in preventing or delaying neurodegeneration. Interfering with the process of axon degeneration may represent an additional and complementary therapeutic avenue for these diseases. The simplest model of axon degeneration known to date is the self-destructive process observed at the distal portion of a transected axon upon injury, termed “Wallerian degeneration.” In vertebrates, the distal part of an axon can remain viable and conduct action potentials in vivo for up to a few days, after which they undergo rapid structu"

The human genome contains five KCNQ genes that encode a family of K+ channel α-subunits possessing six transmembrane domains and a single pore loop. Functional channels are assembled from four α subunits, and may be either homo- or heterotetramers, depending on cell type. These channels serve a wide range of physiological roles. In the heart, KCNQ1 (originally designated KvLTQ1) is co-assembled with the product of the KCNE1 gene (variously designated minK, IsK, and MiRP) to form the cardiac IKs delayed rectifier-like K+ current (1Barhanin J.

The KCNQ4 gene may encode the molecular correlate of I(K,n) in outer hair cells of the cochlea, and I(K,L) in Type I hair cells of the vestibular apparatus, mutations that lead to a form of inherited progressive adult deafness (Autosomal Dominant Non-syndromic Deafness, DfnA2) (15Kubisch C.

The recently identified KCNQ5 gene is expressed in brain and skeletal muscle and can co-assemble with KCNQ3, suggesting it may contribute to M-current heterogeneity (16Lerche C. Scherer C.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24089-24095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), although no linkage to a hereditary disease has yet been reported. Thus, mutations in four of the five human KCNQ genes are associated with hereditary diseases, suggesting a uniquely important role for this class of channels in a variety of physiological functions. In this article we show that a three-gene family of KCNQ-like channels is also present in the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, which we call KQT channels. Many aspects of their functional properties, tissue distribution, and modulation have striking parallels with their mammalian orthologues. For example, C. elegans pharyngeal muscles possess many cardiac-like properties including electrical coupling and rhythmic myogenic contractions generated by prolonged action potentials (18Avery L. Thomas J.H. Riddle D. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Preiss J.R. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 679-716Google Scholar). We show that kqt-1 is expressed in pharyngeal muscles, where it may serve a role analogous to IKs in mammalian cardiac muscle. Additional kqt expression was found in nematode mechanosensory neurons, chemosensory neurons, and intestinal cells that may mediate cellular functions analogous to those in vertebrate species. We also show, that like all mammalian KCNQ channels, C. elegans KQT channels are modulated by the M1 muscarinic receptor that utilizes a Gαq signaling pathway. We address one potential signaling pathway of receptor-stimulated inhibition of M-currents using kqt and KCNQ genes from both C. elegans and vertebrates. We find that a subset of these kqt/KCNQ genes encode channels that are potently suppressed by submicromolar concentrations of the water soluble diacylglycerol analog, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), implicating DAG as a signaling intermediary. By analysis of chimeric subunit constructs, we find that this OAG 1The abbreviations used are: OAG, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol; DAG, diacylglycerol; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; PKC, protein kinase C; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: OAG, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol; DAG, diacylglycerol; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; PKC, protein kinase C; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate. suppression is mediated through the carboxyl-terminal “tail” domains of OAG-sensitive channel subunits. We observe that OAG-mediated suppression is mimicked by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent pharmacological activator of protein kinase C (PKC). Pretreatment with staurosporine, a PKC-specific inhibitor effectively blocks OAG inhibition. These results suggest that DAG-stimulated PKC may mediate receptor-coupled inhibition of a subset of M-currents through a mechanism involving the carboxyl-terminal tails of OAG-sensitive channel subunits. This mechanism is conserved for a subset of KCNQ/KQT channels in both C. elegans and vertebrates. Molecular Biology and C. elegans Transformed Strains—Full-length cDNAs of kqt-1, kqt-2, and kqt-3 were generated by a combination of hydridization screens with 32P-labeled DNA probes, PCR from a commercial C. elegans cDNA library (number 937007, Stratagene, San Diego, CA), and reverse transcriptase-PCR from mRNA extracted from mixed staged wild-type animals, using oligonucleotide primer sequences based on predicted cDNAs from cosmid sequences C25B8 (kqt-1; GenBank™ accession number U41556), M60 (kqt-2; GenBank accession number U39995), and YAC sequence Y54G9a (kqt-3; GenBank accession number AL032648). PCR-generated cDNAs were sequenced and compared with GenBank entries, as well as independently sequenced wild-type genomic fragments in some instances, to resolve sequence discrepancies with GenBank predictions. These cDNA sequences can be accessed with GenBank accession numbers AY572974 (kqt-1) and AY572975 (kqt-3). A full-length kqt-2 cDNA was contained within an EST (yk25b9) kindly provided by Yuji Kohara (National Institutes of Genetics, Mishima, Japan). C. elegans kqt cDNAs were modified by introduction of a Kozak initiation consensus sequence to each initiation methionine, and deletion of all 5′ non-coding sequences. Full-length KCNQ4 was reconstructed from a partial cDNA (AK074957, obtained from the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation, Department of Biotechnology, Biological Resource Center, Chiba, Japan), with additional 5′ fragments generated by PCR from cDNAs derived from human brain RNA and genomic DNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), using primers based on GenBank accession number AF105202. Additional cDNAs used in this study were generously provided by Jacques Barhanin (KCNQ1; Institut de Pharmacologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Valbonne, France), David McKinnon (KCNQ2, rat KCNQ3; State University of New York at Stony Brook), Klaus Steinmeyer, Christian Lerche, Guiscard Seebohm and Andreas Busch (KCNQ5; Aventis, Frankfurt, Germany), and Narasimhan Gautam (human M1 muscarinc receptor; Washington University School of Medicine). Chimeric KQT/KCNQ constructs were generated by the overlap-extension PCR technique (19Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar). All cDNAs were subcloned into pOX (20Wei A. Solaro C. Lingle C. Salkoff L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 671-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) for Xenopus oocyte expression studies. To promote efficient heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes, pOX incorporates 5′ and 3′ untranslated sequences from the Xenopus β-globin gene into transcribed cRNAs. All constructs were completely verified by sequencing. C. elegans translational GFP fusion constructs for each kqt gene were generated using subclones of genomic cosmid (C25B8, M60) and YAC (Y54G9a) clones provided by the C. elegans Sequencing Consortium (Genome Sequencing Center, Washington University School of Medicine, and Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK). Subclones were designed to encompass most or all exons for each kqt gene, and substantial lengths of 5′ and 3′ non-coding sequences. The kqt-1::GFP construct was created by first subcloning an 11.6-kb NruI fragment of C25B8, which includes the entire kqt-1 gene and ∼9.0 kb of 5′ untranslated and ∼2.1 kb of 3′ untranslated sequences, into pBluescriptII KS+ (Stratagene, San Diego). This genomic subclone was then modified by the insertion of a GFP cDNA sequence in-frame at a unique SpeI site within exon 16 (immediately 3′ of the codon corresponding to T672), preserving the native 3′ splice site of exon 16. The kqt-2::GFP construct was created by subcloning a 11.9-kb NsiI fragment from Cosmid M-60, encompassing the first 12 exons of kqt-2 and ∼9.0 kb of 5′ non-coding sequence, into pPD95.81 (gift of Andy Fire, Carnegie Institution of Washington), linearized with PstI. This construct thus produces a 3′ translational fusion of KQT-2 at Ala-605 with GFP, lacking the last 70 predicted carboxyl-terminal amino acids encoded in exon 13. The kqt-3::GFP construct was created by subcloning a ∼5.0-kb NsiI/NheI fragment amplified from Y54G9a by PCR, into pPD95.75 (gift of Andy Fire, Carnegie Institution of Washington). This construct encompasses all kqt-3 exons and ∼1.5 kb of the non-coding sequence 5′ of the initiation methionine, and creates a translational fusion of GFP with the C terminus of KQT-3. Two additional overlapping PCR-generated genomic fragments were made, encompassing sequences ∼6.2 kb further 5′ of the initial subcloned kqt-3 fragment. Coinjection of these PCR-generated fragments with the 5′ linearized kqt-3::GFP construct yielded lines with stable labeling of chemosensory neurons, because of transgenes presumably generated by efficient in vivo recombination (21Yuan A. Dourado M. Butler A. Walton N. Wei A. Salkoff L. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Transformed C. elegans strains were created by the standard germline injection technique (22Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar), using ∼20 –50 ng/μl of each construct and rol-6(+) as a selectable marker. GFP-positive chemosensory neurons were identified in L1 staged larvae, assisted by co-labeling amphid sensory neurons (ASK, ADL, ASI, AWB, ASH, and ASJ) with DiI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), as landmark cells (23Hedgecock E.M. Culotti J.G. Thomson J.N. Perkins L.A. Dev. Biol. 1985; 111: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—Two-electrode voltage-clamp and patch clamp recordings were made from Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNAs, as previously described (20Wei A. Solaro C. Lingle C. Salkoff L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 671-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Dose-response series were obtained with a recording chamber with a volume of ∼150 μl, and solution changes with ∼3 times the recording chamber volume, applied manually without plastic tubing to minimize potential error because of retention of lipophilic reagents to tubing. Two-electrode voltage-clamp measurements were made at steady-state, typically 2–3 min after drug application. Between drug series, all recording surfaces were flushed with 70% ethanol to remove residual drug samples, then with ND96 recording solution. Stock solutions of drugs were dissolved in Me2SO, stored at –20 °C, and diluted in ND96 for each experimental series. In all instances, final Me2SO concentrations never exceeded 1% (v/v). Control experiments showed that 1% Me2SO had no effect on either endogenous or heterologously expressed currents in Xenopus oocytes. All measurements were made with 1.0 mm DIDS (Sigma) to block endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl– currents present in Xenopus oocytes. Composition of ND96 (in mm) was: 96 NaCl, 2.0 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 5.0 HEPES (pH 7.2). Excised inside-out patch-clamp recordings were made under symmetric 160 mm K+ recording conditions, with zero Ca2+ and nearly Cl– free solutions. Recordings were obtained and low-pass filtered at 2.0 KHz, with either an Axopatch 200A (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) or a model 2400 (A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA) patch-clamp amplifier. Composition of pipette solution (in mm) was: 160 K-gluconate, 2.0 MgCl2, 5.0 HEPES (pH 7.2). Composition of cytoplasmic bath/perfusion solution (in mm) was: 160 K-gluconate, 5.0 EGTA, 5.0 HEPES (pH 7.2). Linopirdine was a gift from Barry Brown (DuPont Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE). OAG, phorbol 12-mystristate 13-acetate (PMA), and poly-lysine HCl (15–30,000 Mr) were purchased from Sigma. Staurosporine and oxotremorine were purchased from Tocris Cookson (Ellisville, MO). A KCNQ-like Multigene Family in C. elegans—As in humans, KCNQ-like genes are represented in C. elegans as a multigene family. The C. elegans genome encodes 71 potassium channel genes (24Wei A. Jegla T. Salkoff L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 805-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), of which three have similarity to KCNQ genes, forming a family of genes we call kqt for “K+ channel related to QT interval.” The three members of this family are kqt-1 (C25B8.1, Wormbase notation), kqt-2 (M60.2), and kqt-3 (Y54G9a.3). Primary sequence alignments revealed two domains of high conservation (∼70% identity), defining the “core” transmembrane segments S1–S6, and an additional region of ∼115 residues within the putative cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail, implicated in subunit multimerization (25Maljevic S. Lerche C. Seebohm G. Alekov A.K. Busch A.E. Lerche H. J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 353-360PubMed Google Scholar, 26Schwake M. Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (Supplemental Materials Fig. S1). Phylogenetic comparison of all C. elegans KQT and human KCNQ primary sequences identified two conserved subfamilies: C. elegans KQT-1 defining one subfamily with KCNQ2–5, whereas C. elegans KQT-3 defined a second subfamily with KCNQ1. KQT-2 did not group with either subfamily, nor did it possess a human ortholog. However, BLAST similarity searches clearly showed higher KQT-2 similarity in the vertebrate KCNQ gene family than to any other vertebrate potassium channel gene family (Fig. 1A). Translational fusions of kqt genes with GFP revealed prominent expression in a variety of C. elegans tissues including pharyngeal muscles (kqt-1), intestinal cells (kqt-2, kqt-3), mechanosensory neurons (kqt-1, kqt-3), chemosensory neurons (kqt-3), and other head neurons (kqt-1, kqt-3) (Fig. 1, B–D). Some individual GFP-positive neurons were identified based on unique morphology and location, or double labeling with the lipophilic tracer DiI, which reproducibly labels a set of chemosensory amphid and phasmid neurons (23Hedgecock E.M. Culotti J.G. Thomson J.N. Perkins L.A. Dev. Biol. 1985; 111: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The mechanosensitive touch neurons PLM and ALM were clearly labeled by both kqt-1::GFP and kqt-3::GFP (Fig. 1E). In addition, a large subset of DiI-positive chemosensory amphid and phasmid neurons consistently labeled with kqt-3::GFP. These identified kqt-3::GFP positive neurons included the amphid neurons ADL, ASI, AWB, and ASH located in the head, and the phasmid neurons PHA and PHB in the tail (Fig. 1F). An additional DiI-negative neuron in the head labeled consistently with kqt-3::GFP, which we tentatively identified as the chemosensory neuron AWC. Additional unidentified head neurons were labeled by kqt-1::GFP and kqt-3::GFP, although expression was not reliably observed in neurons of the ventral or dorsal cord. Conserved Functional Properties and Muscarinic Modulation of C. elegans KQT Channels—Potassium currents with functional properties resembling vertebrate M-currents were expressed by full-length kqt-1 or kqt-3 cDNAs in Xenopus oocytes. Functional expression of kqt-2 was not observed. KQT-1 and KQT-3 potassium currents displayed unusually slow activation and deactivation kinetics, under two-electrode voltage-clamp (Fig. 2, A and B). Normalized conductance-voltage plots revealed voltages for half-maximal conductance similar to vertebrate KCNQ orthologs (Fig. 2C) (KQT-1, V50 = –16 mV; KQT-3, V50 = –13 mV, versus –19 to –8 mV reported for vertebrate KCNQ channels (27Selyanko A.A. Hadley J.K. Wood I.C. Abogadie F.C. Jentsch T.J. Brown D.A. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); but others report –40 to –20 mV (28Jentsch T.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar)). Both KQT-1 and KQT-3 potassium currents were reversibly blocked by the KCNQ-specific compound linopridine (KQT-1 IC50 = 44 μm; KQT-3, IC50 = 79 μm), with ∼4–8-fold lower sensitivity compared with vertebrate KCNQ channels (Fig. 2D). All vertebrate KCNQ channels can be modulated through the M1 muscarinic receptor (17Schroeder B.C. Hechenberger M. Weinreich F. Kubisch C. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24089-24095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 27Selyanko A.A. Hadley J.K. Wood I.C. Abogadie F.C. Jentsch T.J. Brown D.A. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Significantly, we observed that this mode of regulation was conserved with C. elegans subunits, by coexpressing KQT-1 or KQT-3 with the human M1 muscarinic receptor in Xenopus oocytes. KQT-1 or KQT-3 currents expressed in these experiments were rapidly suppressed by bath application of the muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine (10 μm) (Fig. 2, E and F). M1 mediated suppression was more effective for KQT-1 (∼90% inhibition) than for KQT-3 (∼16% inhibition) (Fig. 2G). These experiments demonstrate that C. elegans KQT channels encode M-currents, which are functionally similar to M-currents encoded by vertebrate KCNQ channels. A Subset of C. elegans KQT and Vertebrate KCNQ Channels Are Suppressed by Submicromolar OAG—The lipid metabolite diacylglycerol generated by phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) has been described as a potential signaling intermediary for receptor-coupled inhibition of native M-currents in gastric smooth muscles (29Sims S.M. Singer J.J. Walsh Jr., J.V. Science. 1988; 239: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and perhaps other tissues (30Stemkowski P.L. Tse F.W. Peuckmann V. Ford C.P. Colmers W.F. Smith P.A. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To test if DAG may mediate inhibition of cloned KQT channels, we applied the water soluble DAG analog, OAG, to oocytes expressing KQT-1 or KQT-3 channels. Potent suppression of KQT-1 currents was observed with submicromolar concentrations of OAG (IC50 = 0.2 μm), resulting in ∼80% maximal inhibition at saturating concentrations, within 2 min (Fig. 3, A and B). KQT-3 currents were also suppressed by OAG, but with ∼1000-fold lower sensitivity (IC50 = 201 μm) (Fig. 3B). To test whether OAG-mediated inhibition observed with C. elegans KQT channels is conserved with vertebrate KCNQ channels, we examined the OAG sensitivity of currents carried by all the vertebrate KCNQ channels (KCNQ1–5) expressed as homomeric channels in Xenopus oocytes. Of these vertebrate channels, KCNQ5 currents were uniquely sensitive to inhibition by OAG at submicromolar concentrations (IC50 = 0.1 μm), similar to C. elegans KQT-1 (Fig. 3C). Other KCNQ currents examined were far less sensitive to OAG inhibition, similar to C. elegans KQT-3, requiring ∼1000-fold greater OAG concentrations for inhibition (KCNQ1, IC50 = ∼717 μm; KCNQ3, IC50 =∼1.1 mm; (Fig. 3C) (KCNQ2 and KCNQ4 were similarly uninhibited by 125 μm OAG (data not shown)). Because KCNQ5 forms heteromeric channels with KCNQ3 in heterologous expression systems (16Lerche C. Scherer C.R. Seebohm G. Derst C. Wei A.D. Busch A.E. Steinmeyer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22395-22400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 17Schroeder B.C. Hechenberger M. Weinreich F. Kubisch C. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24089-24095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and most likely in vivo (31Hadley J.K. Passmore G.M. Tatulian L. Al-Qatari M. Ye F. Wickenden A.D. Brown D.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5012-5019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the OAG sensitivity of currents produced by co-expression of KCNQ5 and KCNQ3 cRNAs. In agreement with these previous reports, we observed that KCNQ3/5 coinjected oocytes produced currents with amplitudes 5–8 times greater than that predicted by the linear sum of individually injected KCNQ3 and KCNQ5 oocytes, consistent with efficient heteromeric channel formation. Moreover, heteromeric KCNQ3/5 currents, like homomeric KCNQ5 currents, were effectively suppressed by OAG at submicromolar concentrations (IC50 = 0.6 μm) (Fig. 3D). Vertebrate KCNQ5 and C. elegans KQT-1 subunits thus define a conserved molecular subclass of M-channels with high sensitivity to OAG. Furthermore, KCNQ5 confers high OAG sensitivity to heteromeric channels formed with KCNQ3 subunits. Suppression by OAG Is Mediated Through the COOH-terminal Tail of OAG-sensitive KQT/KCNQ Subunits—To investigate the structural regions necessary for OAG-mediated inhibition of channels formed by KCNQ and KQT subunits, we generated a series of chimeric constructs between subunits with high and low sensitivity. Other functional classes of potassium and non-selective cation channels gated by cytosolic ligands (Slo, SK, and CNG) are encoded by subunits that appear to be modularly composed of a core voltage-sensing and pore-forming domain (S1–S6), linked to unique carboxyl-terminal tail structures that modify gating (20Wei A. Solaro C. Lingle C. Salkoff L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 671-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 32Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 1994; 371: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 33Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). By analogy, we reasoned that OAG may exert its effects through carboxyl-terminal domains conserved in OAG-sensitive KCNQ and KQT subunits. We first examined chimeric channels formed by exchanging carboxyl-terminal tail domains between C. elegans KQT-1 and KQT-3 subunits. Attaching the tail from the OAG-sensitive KQT-1 subunit to the core of KQT-3 created a functional chimeric subunit (K3CR/K1TL) with high OAG sensitivity, essentially identical to wild-type KQT-1 channels (Fig. 3E). To address if this structural requirement for inhibition by OAG may employ an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, an analogous chimeric subunit was generated attaching the tail from the vertebrate OAG-sensitive subunit, KCNQ5, to the core of C. elegans KQT-3 (K3CR/Q5TL). As with K3CR/K1TL, the interspecies K3CR/Q5TL chimeric subunit also produced channels with high OAG sensitivity, and an OAG dose-response profile essentially identical to wild-type KCNQ5 (Fig. 3F). High OAG sensitivity could thus be conferred to C. elegans KQT-3 by substituting the tail from the OAG-sensitive channel subunits from either vertebrate or C. elegans species. Conversely, low OAG sensitivity was also conferred by attaching the tail from vertebrate KCNQ1 to the core of C. elegans KQT-1 (K1CR/Q1TL) (Fig. 3G), although the analogous intraspecies chimera K1CR/K3TL failed to express (see construct 1.1, Fig. 4). Results from additional interspecies core and tail chimeric combinations were consistent with a determinative role of the tail in OAG sensitivity. Thus, chimeric subunits with the core of C. elegans KQT-1 and tail of vertebrate KCNQ5 (K1CR/Q5TL) exhibited high OAG sensitivity (IC50 = 0.032 μm), whereas chimera with the core of C. elegans KQT-3 and tail of vertebrate KCNQ1 (K3CR/Q1TL) exhibited low OAG sensitivity (IC50 = 200 μm) (data not shown). Taken together, these results are consistent with OAG sensitivity being determined by the carboxyl-terminal tails of KCNQ/KQT subunits. Although we determined that the full-length carboxyl-terminal tails fully confer either high or low OAG sensitivities, attempts to localize OAG sensitivities to a smaller domain within the tails were unsuccessful (Fig. 4). No single tail subregion was able to confer complete OAG sensitivity. Our results suggest that the structural requirements for OAG sensitivity are possibly complex and not mediated through a single subregion of the carboxyl-terminal tail, despite the apparent functional modularity of the entire tail domain. Suppression Is Not Mediated by Direct Binding of OAG to the Channel Protein—Because DAG directly interacts to alter the gating of cyclic-GMP gated cation channels (34Gordon S.E. Downing-Park J.

https://openalex.org/W2077514227,"Previous studies implicate cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in cell adhesion and migration of epithelial cells of the cornea and lens. To explore molecular interactions underlying these functions, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening of an embryonic rat lens library for proteins that interact with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and its regulators, p35 and p39. This screen identified a specific interaction between p39 and muskelin, an intracellular protein known to affect cytoskeletal organization in adherent cells. Immunohistochemistry detected muskelin in the developing lens and in other tissues, including brain and muscle. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments and co-immunoprecipitations confirmed the specificity of the p39-muskelin interaction. Deletion analysis of p39 showed that muskelin binds to the p39 C terminus, which contains a short insertion (amino acids 329–366) absent from p35. Similar analysis of muskelin mapped the interaction with p39 to the fifth kelch repeat. Co-expression of p39 and muskelin in COS1 cells or lens epithelial cells altered the intracellular localization of muskelin, recruiting it to the cell periphery. These findings demonstrate a novel interaction between muskelin and the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activator p39 and suggest that p39 may regulate the subcellular localization of muskelin.

Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; EGFP (ECFP, EYFP), enhanced green (cyan, yellow) fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; KREP, kelch repeat; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LisH, Lissencephaly homology; CTLH, C-terminal to Lissencephaly homology; E18, embryonic day 18; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; EGFP (ECFP, EYFP), enhanced green (cyan, yellow) fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; KREP, kelch repeat; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LisH, Lissencephaly homology; CTLH, C-terminal to Lissencephaly homology; E18, embryonic day 18; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. is a unique member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family. Unlike other cyclin-dependent kinases, its cellular functions are not related to the regulation of cell cycle progression (1Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its activation requires a regulatory protein (either p35 or p39) that is not a member of the cyclin family. Cdk5 expression is widespread, but its kinase activity is found predominantly in the central nervous system where its activators, p35 and p39, are most abundant (2Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Nonetheless expression of these activating proteins and low levels of Cdk5 kinase activity have been demonstrated in a wide variety of other cell types, including lens (3Gao C.Y. Zakeri Z. Zhu Y. He H.Y. Zelenka P.S. Dev. Genet. 1997; 20: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), embryonic limb buds (4Zhang Q. Ahuja H.S. Zakeri Z.F. Wolgemuth D.J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), monocytes (5Chen F. Studzinski G.P. Blood. 2001; 97: 3763-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and osteosarcomas and breast carcinomas (6Alexander K. Yang H.S. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2808-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A number of observations suggest that cytoskeletal regulation may be a major function of Cdk5 in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. For example, p39 is known to associate with the actin cytoskeleton (7Humbert S. Dhavan R. Tsai L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 975-983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The known substrates of Cdk5/p35 include cytoskeletal proteins such as neurofilament proteins (8Lew J. Winkfein R.J. Paudel H.K. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25922-25926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the microtubule-associated protein tau (9Ishiguro K.S. Kobayashi S. Omore A. Takamatsu S. Yonekura K. Anzai K. Imahori K. Uchida T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) as well as enzymes that regulate cytoskeletal organization such as Pak-1 (10Rashid T. Banerjee M. Nikolic M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49043-49052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and c-Src (12Kato G. Maeda S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, the Cdk5 activators p35 and p39 have been shown to interact with α-actinin and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (13Dhavan R. Greer P.L. Morabito M.A. Orlando L.R. Tsai L.H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7879-7891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both of which have important roles in cytoskeletal organization. Finally several studies have reported that changes in Cdk5 activity affect cytoskeletal functions such as cell motility and adhesion. For example, loss of Cdk5 activity inhibits neurite extension (14Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and blocks neuronal migration during embryogenesis (15Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.G. Longenecker G. Veeranna Pant H.C.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 550-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas increases in Cdk5 activity increase substrate adhesion and retard migration in the epithelial cells of the cornea (19Gao C. Negash S. Guo H.T. Ledee D. Wang H.S. Zelenka P.S. Mol. Cancer Res. 2002; 1: 12-24PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gao C.Y. Stepp M.A. Fariss R. Zelenka P.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4089-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and lens (21Negash S. Wang H.S. Gao C. Ledee D. Zelenka P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2109-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear at present whether the same molecular mechanisms are responsible for the effects of Cdk5 in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. The wide variety of Cdk5 substrates and the likelihood that different subsets are expressed in different cell types raises the possibility that Cdk5 may exert its effects on adhesion and movement in various ways. To explore this possibility, we searched for novel interacting partners of Cdk5, p35, and/or p39 by yeast two-hybrid screening of an embryonic rat lens library. The results demonstrated that p39 interacts specifically with the kelch domain protein muskelin. Kelch domains are structural repeats first observed in the Drosophila actin cross-linking protein Kelch that permit proteins to fold into a cylindrical, “β-propeller structure” (22Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Although several kelch domain proteins are also actin-binding proteins (22Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), muskelin does not bind directly to either actin or tubulin (23Prag S. Collett G.D.M. Adams J.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is, however, associated with the actin cytoskeleton and has multiple effects on cell adhesion and cytoskeletal structure in adherent cells (24Adams J.C. Seed B. Lawler J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4964-4974Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Bait and Library Construction—The entire p39 cDNA was cloned into pBD-GAL4 Cam phagemid vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The embryonic (E18) rat lens cDNA library was constructed using 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA cloned into hybriZAP-2.1 vector following the manufacturer's instruction (HybriZAP-2.1 XR library construction kit and HybriZAP-2.1 XR cDNA synthesis kit; Stratagene). The primary library contained 2 × 107 plaque-forming units with an average insert length of 1 kb. Excision and amplification of the library was performed as detailed by Stratagene. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—YRG2 competent yeast cells were transfected with p39 bait to create a stable cell line. The YRG2/p39 yeast cells were transfected with 40 μg of library cDNA, and selection was performed on His-/Leu-/Trp- medium. All positive clones were further analyzed via filter lift assay screening for lacZ expression. Filter lift assays were performed by transferring colonies growing on His-/Leu-/Trp- SD plates (2.67% Difco™ yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), 1 m sorbitol, 2% agar) to nitrocellulose filters, lysing cells by repetitive freeze-thaw cycles, and incubating with the β-galactosidase substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). Plasmids from positive yeast colonies were isolated by mechanical lysis. Briefly a single yeast colony was grown overnight in 2 ml of YAPD medium (2% Difco™ peptone (BD Biosciences), 1% yeast extract, 2% agar, 0.1 mm adenine sulfate, pH 5.8) at 30 °C. The yeast was centrifuged and lysed in 0.2 ml of yeast lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA), 0.2 ml phenolchloroform-isoamyl alcohol, and 0.3 g of acid-washed glass beads. The plasmid was precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol and transformed into XLI-Blue MRF′ competent cells. Target or bait plasmids were selected on LB-ampicillin or LB-chloramphenicol agar plates, respectively. The resulting bacterial clones were screened by restriction digest analysis and sequencing. Sequencing was performed using the CEQ dye terminator cycle sequencing (DTCS) quick start kit (Beckman Coulter). Cell Culture and Transfection—The rabbit lens epithelial cell line (N/N1003A) and COS1 monkey kidney epithelial cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 8% rabbit serum, 50 μg/m gentamicin for N/N1003 cells or 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) for COS1 cells. N/N1003 cells were transiently transfected with Myc-muskelin and EGFP-p39 using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen); COS1 cells were transiently transfected with ECFP-muskelin and EYFP-p39 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). Both cell lines were harvested 72 h following transfection. Stable lines of COS1 cells overexpressing p35 or p39 were obtained by calcium phosphate precipitation (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2.

The PCR products were then cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), pET-28a (Novagen), and pECFP-C1 and pCMV-Myc (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) at the EcoRI and XhoI sites. The GST-muskelin truncation clones were generated by PCR using pET28a-muskelin as the template followed by cloning of the PCR products into pGEX-4T-1 at the EcoRI and XhoI sites. The oligonucleotides used to generate the truncations were: Δ6 KREP, 5′-GGCGCC(CTCGAG)TCAAACCTTGTGTAATTCATCATA-3′ (nucleotides 1771–1791); Δ5–6 KREP, 5′-GGCGCC(CTCGAG)TCATTCATTCAGTTCTGGATCAA-3 (nucleotides 1558–1578); Δ4–6 KREP, 5′-GGCGCC(CTCGAG)TCAACAACGGTTTTTCGAGTGGAACAG-3′ (nucleotides 1384–1407); Δ3–6 KREP, 5′-GGCGCC(CTCGAG)TCACATATGCTTTTCTGAGTCCA-3′ (nucleotides 1181–1200); Δ2–6 KREP, 5′-GGCGCC(CTCGAG)TCAGATTTGTCTCCGCTGAATATC-3′ (nucleotides 999–1020); Δ1–6 KREP, 5′-GGCGCC(CTCGAG)TCAAGTCTCTGTCTGAACATCAA-3′ (nucleotides 833–852); ΔLis. 5′-CCCGGG(GAATTC)CATCCAATGTTGACAGATATG-3′ (nucleotides 616–636). Numbers in parentheses are nucleotide positions taken from the GenBank entry for rat muskelin (NM_031359). To generate the construct containing two kelch 6 regions we substituted the intrablade loop between the β2 and β3 blades of the fifth kelch repeat with the intrablade loop of the sixth kelch repeat as predicted by the kelch repeat folding pattern (22Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 26Prag S. Adams J.C. BMC Bioinformatics. 2003; 4: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used were: KREP5–6 (upstream), 5′-AGAGCAAGACTTTCCTGGATTTCCGGATAAAACATGTATTTCATT-3′; KREP5–6 (downstream), 5′-CCAAAGATGAGACTAGATGACTTCTGGATTTATGACATTGTGAGG-3′. The construct was made using the ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To make the histidine-tagged p39, the p39 reading frame (XhoI/XbaI) fragment was PCR-amplified from a p39 clone (27Xiong W. Pestell R. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6585-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PCR primers were: upstream, 5′-ACGCGTCTCGAGGGCACAGTGCTGTCTCTTTCGCCTGCCTCC-3′; downstream, 5′-AGCATTTCTAGACCCCTGGGTATCCCTAGCGGTCCAGGTTCATAGTCC-3′. The p39 PCR fragment and pcDNA3.1/His (C) vector (Invitrogen) were then digested with XhoI and XbaI. The digested p39 fragment was ligated into the pcDNA3.1/His (C) vector C-terminal to the histidine tag and in the reading frame (confirmed by PCR sequencing). The p39 truncated clone was cloned into pET15b at the NdeI and XhoI sites. The primers used were 5′-ATTCCCGGG(CATATG)GGCACAGTGCTGTCTCTTTCGCCTGCCTCC-3′ and 5′-CCGGCC(CTCGAG)CATCTCGTTCTTGAGGTCTTGAAAG-3′. To generate EGFP-p39 and EYFP-p39 fusion proteins, the full-length p39 cDNA was cloned into EcoRI/SalI sites of the pEGFP-C1 or pEYFP-C1 vectors starting at the second codon of p39 using the pCDNA3.1-p39 clone as the template. The primers used were: upstream, GGCTTC(GAATTC)TGGCACAGTGCTGTCTCTTTCGCCTGCCTCC (EcoRI); downstream, CGGCGG(GTCGAC)CCCCTGGGTATCCCTAGCGGTCCAGGTTCA (SalI). Antibodies—Peptides corresponding to the C terminus of muskelin (GNLVDLITL) and the N terminus of p39 (KGRRPGGLPEE) were used for polyclonal antibody production in rabbits (Harlan). The IgG fraction was purified from the resulting antisera using protein A-agarose beads (Pierce), and the p39 antibody was further purified by affinity chromatography against the antigenic peptide covalently coupled to agarose beads as a secondary amine using the AminoLink™ kit and AminoLink coupling gel (Pierce). Anti-Cdk5 polyclonal antibody and agarose-conjugated anti-histidine monoclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Myc polyclonal antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For analysis of endogenous expression of muskelin protein cells were lysed in PBSTDS buffer (1× PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and one Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture tablet/50 ml of buffer (Roche Diagnostics). For the detection of p39, the cells were lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 15 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete™ protease inhibitor), and the remaining pellet, the insoluble fraction, was resuspended in PBSTDS. Both fractions were immunoprecipitated using the Cdk5 monoclonal antibody (J-3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Intracellular interactions were shown by transiently transfecting Myc-muskelin into COS1 cells or COS1 cells that stably expressed Cdk5, p39, or p35. Seventy-two hours post-transfection cells were lysed with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 15 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus Complete™ protease inhibitor. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated anti-histidine monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and resolved on a NuPage 4–12% BisTris gel (Novex). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (3Gao C.Y. Zakeri Z. Zhu Y. He H.Y. Zelenka P.S. Dev. Genet. 1997; 20: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous p39 and muskelin, lens and brain tissues were lysed in PBSTDS containing Complete™ protease inhibitor. 200 μg of each cell lysate were incubated with anti-p39 antibody (1:25 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature, and then 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Control samples were treated identically except that anti-p39 antibody was omitted. Beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed extensively in PBSTDS, and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling 5 min in 1× SDS sample buffer containing 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Eluted proteins were resolved on a NuPage 4–12% BisTris gel and immunoblotted with anti-muskelin antibody as described previously (3Gao C.Y. Zakeri Z. Zhu Y. He H.Y. Zelenka P.S. Dev. Genet. 1997; 20: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GST Fusion Proteins and Affinity Purification Pull-down Assay—To express the various pGEX-4T-1 muskelin clones a 100-ml culture was inoculated and incubated at 30 °C overnight. The following day the culture was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h and centrifuged at 5000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of 1× PBS plus protease inhibitors and lysozyme to 0.1 volume. Samples were kept on ice for 30 min, adjusted to 5 mm dithiothreitol, and sonicated. The sonicate was adjusted to 1% Triton X-100, incubated at room temperature on a rotary wheel for 30 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm. The supernatant was added to glutathione-coupled beads and processed according to the manufacture's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). 1 μg of GST-muskelin was used per experiment. To generate 35S-labeled p39, p35, Cdk5, and muskelin, the corresponding cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3.1 (for p39, p35, and Cdk5) (Invitrogen) or pET28a (for muskelin) (Novagen, San Diego, CA) and translated in vitro using the TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). The GST-muskelin and 35S-labeled proteins were incubated overnight in the immunoprecipitation buffer (above) containing 1 mg of BL21 soluble protein extract. The following day the beads were washed extensively in immunoprecipitation buffer. The proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer (Invitrogen) and resolved on a NuPage 4–12% BisTris gel. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, soaked in Amplify™ (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to film. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions for RNAqueous™-4PCR kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) or TRIzol (Invitrogen). The RNA was further treated with DNase I (Ambion or Roche Diagnostics). RT-PCR was performed in a two-step procedure. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed (Superscript II; Invitrogen) with random hexamers (PerkinElmer Life the manufacturer's instructions (Platinum Pfx; Invitrogen). The following oligonucleotides were used: p39 Upstream, 5′-GGCCGTCCGTGCTCATCTCGGCGCTCA-3′ (nucleotides 165–186); p39 Downstream, 5′-CGGCCCTTGCGGAGAAGGTTCTCGCGGTTGCG-3′ (nucleotides 284–324); Muskelin Upstream, 5′-GAACCACAATTCAGTGGGCT-3′ (nucleotides 1264–1284); Muskelin Downstream, 5′-TTGCTCTCTGTGTGAATCCG-3′ (nucleotides 1555–1574). Immunohistochemistry—Heads of E18 rat embryos and adult mouse eyes were embedded in paraffin and sectioned. Paraffin sections (10 μm) were placed on silanated slides (Digene Corp., Gaithersburg, MD). Sections were deparaffinized in xylenes and rehydrated in a series of decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Antigen unmasking was performed by heat treatment with 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0. To remove endogenous peroxidase activity, samples were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 30 min. Following several washes in PBS and blocking in 5% normal goat serum in PBS, sections were incubated with anti-muskelin rabbit polyclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing in PBS, the eye sections were incubated with an anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary, whereas the head sections were incubated with secondary biotinylated antibodies (ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min. Finally the head section slides were developed with Vector NovaRED and hydrogen peroxide substrate (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were then washed in distilled water, mounted with Aqua Poly mount (Polysciences, Warrington, PA), and examined with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 photomicroscope. Images were captured with a charge-coupled device camera (Opelco, Sterling, VA). For controls, the antigenic peptide was included during incubation with primary antibodies. For co-localization of the Myc-muskelin and EGFP-p39 transiently transfected N/N1003A cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, rinsed with PBS, blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h, incubated with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h, rinsed with PBS, incubated with a goat anti-mouse Alexa568- or Alexa350-conjugated secondary antibody, rinsed, and coverslipped. In some experiments, the cells were further stained with rhodamine phalloidin before coverslipping. Fluorescence Microscopy—A Leica TCS-SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) was used for fluorescence microscopy of ECFP-muskelin (excitation, 458 nm), Alexa568-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (excitation, 568 nm), or Alexa350-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (excitation, 350 nm) (to detect Myc-muskelin); EGFP-p39 (excitation, 488); EYFP-p39 (excitation, 514 nm); and rhodamine-phalloidin (excitation, 568 nm). Expression of p39 RNA and Protein in the Lens—Although previous studies from this laboratory have demonstrated expression of Cdk5 and p35 in lenses of embryonic chickens (28Gao C.Y. Bassnett S. Zelenka P.S. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and newborn rat lens (3Gao C.Y. Zakeri Z. Zhu Y. He H.Y. Zelenka P.S. Dev. Genet. 1997; 20: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), those studies did not examine expression of p39. Therefore, we performed both RT-PCR and immunoblotting to determine whether this Cdk5 activator is also expressed in the lens. RT-PCR detected a specific transcript that when sequenced corresponded to p39 mRNA (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting of newborn rat lens proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with Cdk5 showed an immunoreactive band of the proper molecular weight that comigrated with p39 from rat brain and was blocked in the presence of the antigenic peptide (Fig. 1B). Separating the lysate into detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions prior to immunoprecipitation indicated that Cdk5/p39 is primarily in the soluble fraction of the brain but primarily in the detergent-insoluble fraction of the lens (Fig. 1C). Identification of a Novel p39-interacting Protein—To identify lens proteins that interact with Cdk5, p35, and p39, the respective coding sequences were cloned downstream of the GAL4 DNA binding domain and used as baits for yeast two-hybrid screening of an E18 embryonic rat lens cDNA library. With the GAL4 DNA binding domain/p39 (pBD-p39) fusion plasmid as bait we isolated several prey sequences that supported growth on medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan and had significant β-galactosidase activity. Sequence analysis of ∼57 such plasmids after rescue in Escherichia coli yielded α-crystallins (4Zhang Q. Ahuja H.S. Zakeri Z.F. Wolgemuth D.J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), β-crystallins (12Kato G. Maeda S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), γ-crystallins (17Gilmore E.C. Ohshima T. Goffinet A.M. Kulkarni A.B. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6370-6377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a cytoskeletal protein (1Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a hypothetical poxvirus and zinc finger (POZ) domain protein (1Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the nearly complete sequence of muskelin cDNA (pAD-muskelin), lacking only the first nine bases. Muskelin encodes a polypeptide of 735 amino acids containing six kelch motifs, a discoidin domain (23Prag S. Collett G.D.M. Adams J.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a LisH motif, and a CTLH domain (24Adams J.C. Seed B. Lawler J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4964-4974Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The specificity of the interaction between pAD-muskelin and p39 was examined by co-transforming yeast with this clone in conjunction with pBD-p39, pBD-p35, pBD-Cdk5, or the BD fusion of an unrelated protein, human lamin C. Only the muskelin/p39 co-transformants grew in the absence of leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (Fig. 2B) and activated LacZ transcription in a filter lift assay (not shown). In Vitro Interaction between Muskelin and p39 —To confirm the interaction between muskelin and p39 detected by the yeast two-hybrid analysis, a complete muskelin cDNA was constructed by PCR and cloned into a pGEX-4T-1 vector to generate a fusion protein with a GST tag at the N terminus. GST-muskelin was immobilized on a glutathione-agarose matrix and incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled p39, p35, or Cdk5 (Fig. 3, A and B). The proteins retained on the matrix were eluted, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, dried, and exposed to film. Consistent with the yeast data, the GST-muskelin fusion protein interacted with p39 but not with p35 or Cdk5 (Fig. 3, A and B). To determine which region of p39 was recognized by muskelin, we performed a similar GST pull-down experiment with a chimeric fusion protein that links the N terminus of p35 with the C terminus of p39, the isolated p39 C terminus (amino acids 110–367), and a p39 truncation lacking the C terminus (amino acids 1–328) (Fig. 3A). GST-muskelin bound to the p39 C terminus and the p35/p39 chimera but not to the p39 truncation, thus localizing the muskelin binding site to the C-terminal end of the p39 protein (amino acids 329–367) (Fig. 3B). This region includes a 24-amino acid insertion not present in p35. Intracellular Interaction between Muskelin and p39 —We next examined the ability of muskelin and p39 to interact in mammalian cells. Myc-tagged muskelin cDNA was transiently transfected into COS1 cells or COS1 cells that were stably transfected with His-tagged p39, p35, or Cdk5 constructs. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-histidine monoclonal antibody and then blotted with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody. Immunoblotting demonstrated that Myc-muskelin co-immunoprecipitated with histidine-tagged proteins from His-p39-transfected cells but not from cells transfected with His-p35 or His-Cdk5 (Fig. 3C). Thus, muskelin appears to interact specifically with p39 both in vitro and in an intracellular environment. Mapping of Interaction Sites in Muskelin—To establish which domain of muskelin was important for binding to p39, we generated a series of GST-muskelin deletions, which sequentially removed each of the six kelch domains (Fig. 4, A and B). Each GST-muskelin construct was then incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled p39 (Fig. 4C). Deletion of the C terminus and sixth kelch domain had little effect on the ability of muskelin to bind p39. In contrast, loss of the fifth kelch domain caused a significant loss of the muskelin-p39 binding, sugg"
https://openalex.org/W2090472570,"We have identified a family of ancillary subunits of K+ channels in Caenorhabditis elegans. MPS-1 and its related members MPS-2, MPS-3, and MPS-4 are detected in the nervous system of the nematode. Electrophysiological analysis in ASE neurons and mammalian cells and epigenetic inactivation by double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) in vivo show that each MPS can associate with and functionally endow the voltage-gated K+ channel KVS-1. In the chemosensory neuron ADF, three different MPS subunits combine with KVS-1 to form both binary (MPS-1·KVS-1) and ternary (MPS-2·MPS-3·KVS-1) complexes. RNAi of mps-2, mps-3, or both, enhance the taste of the animal for sodium without altering the susceptibility to other attractants. When sodium is introduced in the test plate as background or as antagonist attractant, the nematode loses the ability to recognize a second attractant. Thus, it appears that the chemosensory apparatus of C. elegans uses sensory thresholds and that a voltage-gated K+ channel is specifically required for this mechanism.

Thus, it appears that the chemosensory apparatus of C. elegans uses sensory thresholds and that a voltage-gated K+ channel is specifically required for this mechanism. Chemosensory function plays a crucial role in the life of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The animal lives in the soil, feeds on bacteria, and adapts to the environment based on chemical cues (1Bargmann C. Mori I. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. C. elegans II. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 717-737Google Scholar). C. elegans can detect several classes of attractants including salts, amino acids, cyclic nucleotides, and vitamins (2Ward S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Chemotaxis to water-soluble attractants is mediated by a group of five bilateral amphid neurons, ASE, ADF, ASG, ASI, and ASK, which are located in the head of the animal (3Bargmann C.I. Horvitz H.R. Neuron. 1991; 7: 729-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Individual amphid neurons can detect multiple cues that are distinguished by the animal (2Ward S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, how the sensory neuron integrates signals corresponding to different attractants to produce a specific output signal and what the role of K+ currents is in this process. In a previous paper (4Bianchi L. Kwok S.M. Driscoll M. Sesti F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12415-12424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) we reported the identification of a voltage-gated A-type K+ channel, KVS-1, that is expressed and operates in C. elegans chemosensory neurons. We further found that KVS-1 can be functionally differentiated by assembly with a beta subunit, a KCNE-related peptide termed MPS-1. Amphid neurons have been reported to exhibit a large variety of A-type K+ currents (5Goodman M. Hall D. Avery L. Lockery S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 763-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Hence, we speculated that single-transmembrane subunits such as MPS-1 might represent a way to generate functional diversity, and we hypothesized that, by analogy with other species (6Abbott G. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M. Lehman M. Timothy K. Keating M. Goldstein S. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 7Anantharam A. Lewis A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 11739-11745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), MPS-1-related proteins might exist and operate in C. elegans. This effort led us to discover three novel mps members that establish, together with MPS-1, the C. elegans family of KCNE ancillary subunits of K+ channels. MPS-2, -3, and -4 are shown to associate with and to modulate the A-type K+ current mediated by KVS-1 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover we show that one of these complexes, resulting from the assembly of MPS-2 and MPS-3 with KVS-1, is specifically involved in tuning the responsiveness of the animal for sodium. Cloning of MPS-2.a, MPS-2.b, MPS-3, and MPS-4 —Cloning was performed with a Smart Race kit (Clontech) using poly(A)+ mRNA extracted from total C. elegans RNA with a Oligotex kit (Quiagen). cDNA was amplified by PCR and inserted in pCI-neo vector (Promega) for functional expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescent protein; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; ASER neuron, ASE right neuron; CI, chemotaxis index. cells. All sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Transcripts were quantified with spectroscopy and compared with control samples that were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. The novel genes have been assigned the following accession numbers by the Genome Database Nomenclature Committee: AY255667 (mps-2.a), AY255666 (mps-2.b), AY255668 (mps-3), and AY255665 (mps-4). Construction of Tagged Reporter Fusions to GFP—To obtain transgenic nematodes expressing GFP-tagged MPS-2, MPS-3, and MPS-4, the last ∼1 kb of these genes was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and joined in-frame to the GFP reporter gene in the pPD 95.75 vector (Fire Vector Kit). The reporter constructs and the cosmids were linearized, annealed at 65 °C for 5 min, and co-injected with the transformation marker lin-15(+) into the syncitial gonad of adult hermaphrodite lin-15(–) nematodes at a concentration of 25, 100, and 50 ng/μl, respectively. Five transgenic lines carrying extrachromosomal arrays were identified for each construct. Because the constructs intentionally lack the promoter and the initial methionine, they are not translated without recombination with the cosmid (which contains the entire gene and its promoter). Worms were analyzed and photographed with an Olympus BX61 microscope equipped with a digital camera. Dye-filling Experiments—To identify amphid neurons, transgenic worms were picked to a plate containing 1,1′-dioctodecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-chlorobenzinesulfonate (Molecular Probes) diluted in M9 buffer (0.01 mg/ml), and allowed to stain for 2–3 h at room temperature. Worms were then transferred to an agar plate and allowed to crawl on the bacterial lawn for about 15 min to destain. RNA Interference—For double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) production, ∼0.5-kb regions of mps-2, mps-3, and mps-4 genomic DNA were amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides that added 5′ T7 promoter sequence. dsRNA in vitro synthesis was with MEGAscript kit (Ambion) using the PCR products as templates. The reactions were annealed at 37 °C for 30 min after denaturation (68 °C for 10 min). RNA was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to verify that it was double stranded. Approximately 100 pl of dsRNA (1.5 μg/μl in H2O) was injected into both gonads of young adults. Worms were allowed to lay the eggs contained in the uterus for 2–3 h and then transferred separately onto fresh plates. F1 progeny of injected worms were analyzed. Embryonic Cultured Cells—Cultured ASE right (ASER) neurons were prepared from gyc-5 strains using a method developed by Christensen et al. (8Christensen M. Estevez A. Yin X. Fox R. Morrison R. McDonnell M. Gleason C. Miller III, D.M. Strange K. Neuron. 2002; 33: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Gravid adult worms were lysed using 0.5 m NaOH and 1% NaOCl. Released eggs were washed three times with sterile egg buffer containing 118 mm NaCl, 48 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.3, 340 mosm), and adult carcasses were separated from washed eggs by centrifugation in sterile 30% sucrose. Eggshells were removed by resuspending pelleted eggs in a sterile egg buffer containing 1 unit/ml chitinase at room temperature for 20 min. Embryos were resuspended in L-15 cell culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) and dissociated by gentle pipetting. The osmolarity of the culture medium was adjusted to 340 mosm with sucrose and filter-sterilized. Intact embryos, clumps of cells, and larvae were removed from the cell suspension by filtration. Dissociated cells were plated on glass coverslips previously coated with peanut lectin (0.1 mg/ml) dissolved in water. Electrophysiology—CHO cells were transiently transfected with cDNA ligated into pCI-neo using Superfect kit (Qiagen) and studied after 24–36 h. Data were recorded with an Axopatch 200B (Axon), a personal computer (Dell), and Clampex software (Axon); filtered at 1 kHz; and sampled at 2.5 kHz. Bath solution was (in mm) 4 KCl, 100 NaCl, 10 Hepes (pH 7.5 with NaOH), 1.8 CaCl, and 1.0 MgCl. Pipette solution was (in mm) 100 KCl, 10 Hepes (pH 7.5 with KOH), 1.0 MgCl, 1.0 CaCl, and 10 EGTA (pH 7.5 with KOH). For recording from embryonic cultured cells, bath solution was (in mm) 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 5 MgCl2, 10 Hepes/NaOH, and 20 d-glucose. Pipette solution was (in mm) 125 potassium gluconate, 18 KCl, 0.7 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 EGTA/KOH, and 10 Hepes/KOH. Phenotypic Analysis—Behavioral tests were performed without knowledge of the genotypes of the worms. A 0.5-cm diameter chunk of agar was removed from 10-cm plates and soaked in the attractant for 2 h. Attractant concentrations were 0.2 m cAMP or biotin-NH4, 0.5 m NH4Cl or lysine acetate (Sigma). Sodium acetate concentrations varied from 0.2 to 1.0 m. If not otherwise stated test plates (in mm, 5.0 KPO4, pH 6.0, 1.0 MgSO4, 1.0 CaCl2, 2% agar) were devoid of Na+. Chunks were put back in the plate overnight to allow equilibration and formation of a gradient. Twenty worms were placed between this spot and a control spot on the opposite side of the plate. After 1 h of chemotaxis, animals on the two different sides of the plate (the one with the attractant and the one with the control) were counted, and a chemotaxis index (CI) was calculated as CI=Ntest−Ncont.Ntot(Eq. 1) where Ntest, Ncont., and Ntot indicated the number of animals at the test spot and in the control spot and the total number of animals, respectively. A positive CI indicated an attraction to the attractant. Cloning the Family of MPS Proteins—We blasted MPS-1 sequence against the C. elegans genome, and we identified four new MPS-1-related proteins, MPS-2.a and MPS-2.b (K01A2.8.a,.b), MPS-3 (T06A4.2), and MPS-4 (F09G8.9), and confirmed their expression and primary sequences by analysis of reverse transcription-PCR products (Fig. 1A). All sequences, with the exception of K01A2.8b, turned out to be as predicted, although a third putative K01A2.8 isoform, K01A2,8.c, was not present in our libraries. Like other KCNE proteins, C. elegans members exhibit the strongest conservation in the transmembrane spanning domain. Overall, however, the C. elegans genes appeared to be more related to each other than to genes of other species. MPS Proteins Are Expressed in the Nervous System of the Nematode—To determine the cellular expression patterns of the novel genes we constructed transgenic nematodes harboring translational GFP reporter fusions (9Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2446) Google Scholar). We detected strong MPS-2 signals in the ADF amphid sensory neurons (Fig. 1B). MPS-2 was expressed in the enteric muscle (Fig. 1E), albeit signals were fainter compared with those of ADF cells. MPS-3 was also intensely expressed in ADF neurons (Fig. 1C) and, in addition, in two neurons of the pharynx anterior bulb (Fig. 1F), in PVC and PVN neurons (not shown). MPS-4 was present in the neurons that we tentatively identified as AIA (Fig. 1D) and AUA. The latter have been shown to regulate social feeding behavior (10De Bono M. Tobin D. Davis M. Avery L. Bargmann C. Nature. 2002; 419: 899-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Less intense but perceptible MPS-4 signals were also detected in enteric muscle (Fig. 1G) and PVC neurons (not shown). Each MPS Can Interact with K+ Channel KVS-1 in Mammalian Cells—Some cells, including the ADF neurons and the enteric muscle, express the voltage-gated K+ channel KVS-1, a previously identified partner for MPS-1 (4Bianchi L. Kwok S.M. Driscoll M. Sesti F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12415-12424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This suggests that in addition to MPS-1 the other members of the family might also interact with this channel. To test whether the novel MPS proteins could work as ion channel subunits we co-expressed them with KVS-1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells and used the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp to characterize currents. Each MPS altered the characteristics of the current, suggesting interaction (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows the peak current density at +120 mV of KVS-1 alone and with each of the four MPS subunits (MPS-2.b gave results similar to the “a” isoforms, not shown). MPS-1 and MPS-4 inhibited the current roughly 3–5-fold, and MPS-3 increased this quantity significantly (3-fold). Inactivation, a physiologically relevant characteristic of A-type channels, was also affected by the MPS proteins (Fig. 2C). The time course of inactivation at +120 mV, fitted to a single exponential, varied from τ = 50 ms for channels formed with MPS-3 to τ = 7 ms with MPS-4, a 7-fold change. Recovery from inactivation was quantified by using a 1.2-s and a 0.2-s depolarizing pulse at +60 mV spaced out by progressively longer periods at –80 mV. Recovery was slowed down by MPS-3 and speeded up by the other members (Fig. 2D). Moreover, MPS-1 and MPS-3 co-immunoprecipitated with KVS-1 (not-shown), suggesting the formation of stable complexes between the pore-forming subunit and the MPS accessory proteins. KVS-1 Forms Functional Complexes with the MPS Proteins in Native Cells—To corroborate the notion that KVS-1 and the MPS proteins form functional complexes in native cells we recorded currents from cultured C. elegans ASE neurons (8Christensen M. Estevez A. Yin X. Fox R. Morrison R. McDonnell M. Gleason C. Miller III, D.M. Strange K. Neuron. 2002; 33: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) that express KVS-1 and MPS-1 (4Bianchi L. Kwok S.M. Driscoll M. Sesti F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12415-12424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cells were obtained from Pgyc-5::gfp nematodes that express GFP in the ASE right neuron under the guanylyl cyclase gene gcy-5 promoter (11Yu S. Avery L. Baude E. Garbers D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3384-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, specific markers for other cells expressing KVS-1 and the MPS proteins such as ADF neurons are not currently available, and further, the GFP fluorescence of cells cultured from mps-2::gfp or mps-3::gfp transformants was not sufficiently intense to allow reliable identification using our patch clamp microscope. Voltage pulses from –80 mV to +80 mV evoked robust outward currents (Fig. 3A) that reversed at –44.3 ± 9.1 mV. Unlike untreated neurons, cells created by kvs-1 RNAi (Fig. 3B) or mps-1 RNAi (Fig. 3C) were characterized by slow activation and lack of inactivation (Fig. 3D). Treatment by RNAi (Fig. 3E) or application of 10 mm 4-aminopyridine (not shown) led to an ∼35% decrease of the peak current suggesting, first, that a MPS-1/KVS-1 channel complex is functional in ASER neurons, and second, that knockdown of each subunit is sufficient to destabilize the entire channel. We showed previously (4Bianchi L. Kwok S.M. Driscoll M. Sesti F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12415-12424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), that mps-1 RNAi in kvs-1::gfp animals (that express full KVS-1 proteins fused to GFP) suppressed KVS-1 signals only in the neurons in which the two subunits co-localized, and similar effects were observed with kvs-1 RNAi in mps-1::gfp strains (see also Fig. 4, B and C). Moreover RNAi had no effect on transgenic strains expressing transcriptional reporters (Pkvs-1::gfp, and Pmps-1::gfp) that express GFP protein driven by kvs-1 or mps-1 promoter sequences (not shown), indicating that RNAi does not interfere with gene transcription. Probably, if two subunits are assembled in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, disruption of one subunit is sufficient to interrupt the biosynthesis of the complex. Because it is reasonable to assume that the assembly of KVS-1 with the other MPS subunits follows a route similar to that of MPS-1 we used the RNAi method to detect subunit-subunit interactions in native neurons. Thus, kvs-1 RNAi suppressed mps-2::gfp and mps-3::gfp fluorescence in ADF neurons (Fig. 4, A, D, and E), and mps-2 and mps-3 RNAi also affected kvs-1::gfp signals in the same neurons albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 4B). Moreover, kvs-1 RNAi was very effective against mps-4::gfp signals in AUA and vice versa (not shown). Thus, each MPS appears to be capable of forming a complex with KVS-1 in native neurons, consistent with the previous finding (Fig. 2) that in CHO cells each MPS modulates KVS-1.Fig. 4KVS-1, MPS-1, MPS-2, and MPS-3 form ternary complexes in ADF amphid neurons. A, representative pictures of mps-3::gfp transgenic nematodes. These transformants display GFP fluorescence in ADF neurons (arrow). When the same animals are given injections of kvs-1 or mps-2 dsRNA, fluorescence becomes very faint and cannot be appreciated by eye (a fluorescence ratio (FR) of ∼0.3 is background), suggesting that all three subunits contribute to form a unique complex. B–E, normalized fluorescence ratios in ADF neurons of kvs-1::gfp (B), mps-1::gfp (C), mps-2::gfp (D), and mps-3::gfp (E) nematodes treated with RNAi against the indicated genes. Fluorescence was quantified by ImageJ software (available at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Fluorescence ratio was normalized to control nematodes. Data are from groups of 20 or more worms. Statistically significant differences from control animals are indicated with **, p ≤ 0.01 (unpaired t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MPS-2 and MPS-3 Form a Ternary Channel Complex with KVS-1 in ADF Neurons—Some cells co-express multiple MPS subunits, suggesting the possibility that they might form mixed complexes with KVS-1, that is, complexes containing more than one MPS member. In particular, in ADF neurons we detected KVS-1 and three MPS proteins (MPS-1, MPS-2, and MPS-3). Therefore, these sensory cells represented an optimal system to investigate the interactions between the MPS and KVS-1. Thus, mps-2 RNAi suppressed mps-3::gfp fluorescence only in ADF neurons, and a similar effect was observed with mps-3 RNAi in mps-2::gfp animals (Fig. 4, D and E). In contrast, mps-1 RNAi failed to affect either MPS-2 or MPS-3 fluorescence (Fig. 4, D and E). These data lead us to suggest that KVS-1 can form binary and ternary complexes with the MPS subunits in ADF neurons. Functional Properties of a Ternary Complex in CHO Cells—To test whether MPS-2, MPS-3, and KVS-1 could form a functional ternary complex we transfected the cDNA encoding these subunits in CHO cells and used the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp to study the currents as done before. The magnitude of the current density of MPS-2/MPS-3/KVS-1 channels was similar to that of binary complexes formed by MPS-3 and KVS-1 (Fig. 5A), whereas inactivation kinetics were like those of complexes formed with MPS-2 (Fig. 5, B and C). Despite the fact that these currents probably have contributions from populations of binary complexes, their mixed characteristics suggest the formation of functional MPS-2·MPS-3·KVS-1 ternary complexes. A MPS-2·MPS-3·KVS-1 K+ Channel Complex Tunes the Responsiveness to Sensory Cues—The current model for chemotaxis to water-soluble attractants predicts that this sensory function is controlled by a network of five amphid neurons organized hierarchically (1Bargmann C. Mori I. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. C. elegans II. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 717-737Google Scholar, 12Pierce-Shimomura J. Faumont S. Gaston M. Pearson B. Lockery S. Nature. 2001; 410: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus a single pair of neurons, the ASEs, determine the primary response, and the group composed by the remaining four pairs, ADF ASG, ASI, and ASK, mediate a residual response (3Bargmann C.I. Horvitz H.R. Neuron. 1991; 7: 729-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). To elucidate the physiological role of K+ channels formed by the assembly of MPS-1, MPS-2, MPS-3, and KVS-1 in ADF neurons we evaluated the ability of animals treated by RNAi to recognize classic attractants such as Na+, Cl–, cAMP, biotin, and lysine. Inactivation of kvs-1 or mps-1, which is expressed in several neurons of the network including the ASE pair, leads to defective chemotaxis to these cues (4Bianchi L. Kwok S.M. Driscoll M. Sesti F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12415-12424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, mps-2, mps-3, or mps-2+mps-3 RNAi did not alter susceptibility to Cl–, cAMP biotin, and lysine (Fig. 6A). These nematodes exhibited an unexpected behavior, however, in that their taste for Na+ was enhanced (Fig. 6B). Co-injection of dsRNAs encoding mps-2 and mps-3 did not further augment Na+ sensibility, suggesting that the two subunits contribute similarly to this behavior probably as parts of the same channel complex. Moreover, when mps-2 was co-injected with mps-1 the nematodes retained the phenotype of mps-1 animals. We explain the dominant effect of mps-1 by the fact that this gene is expressed in several neurons of the network including the ASE pair (4Bianchi L. Kwok S.M. Driscoll M. Sesti F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12415-12424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The broad MPS-1 expression pattern also limited our ability to further dissect the specific role of this complex in ADF neurons. Fig. 6C shows that mps-2 nematodes were more responsive to lower Na+ gradients than were wild-type animals. When the concentration was increased, however, both groups exhibited the same phenotype. Thus, the chemosensory apparatus of C. elegans is such that it can detect few sodium ions (2Ward S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) (∼700,000 ions/mm2 in a 1.0 μm sodium acetate agar medium), but a behavioral response is triggered only above a certain threshold. We next sought to evaluate the impact of lowering the sodium threshold on the other sensory activities. In a first group of experiments we introduced a Na+ background in the test plate. As expected, chemotaxis to cAMP of wild-type animals was not significantly hindered (Fig. 6D) (2Ward S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Conversely, nematodes treated with mps-2 RNAi exhibited a striking loss of attraction for cAMP at Na+ backgrounds as low as 0.1 mm (Fig. 6D). Untreated animals require sodium concentrations as high as 100 mm to show detectable loss of attraction (12Pierce-Shimomura J. Faumont S. Gaston M. Pearson B. Lockery S. Nature. 2001; 410: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which represents a loss of sensitivity of 4 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, attraction to biotin was also hindered under the same conditions (not shown). In a second set of experiments, the nematodes were exposed to a fixed cAMP gradient and to sodium gradients of various intensities (Fig. 6E). Wild-type animals migrated more favorably toward the spot containing cAMP when the sodium gradient was low (this effect corresponds to a negative CI in Fig. 6E). In contrast, mps-2 animals displayed a significant preference for Na+. Taking into account that knockdown of mps-2 or mps-3 had no apparent effect on chemotaxis to other attractants in the absence of Na+ (Fig. 6A), these results suggest that when the threshold for Na+ is lowered the signal becomes intense and overwhelms the other signals. KCNE proteins are an emerging family of accessory subunits of K+ channels. The ubiquity of their expression together with the ability to assemble with multiple K+ channels (13McCrossan Z.A. Abbott G.W. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 787-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) underscores a potentially very important role of these proteins in human physiology. In fact, mutations in KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNE3, and KCNE5 genes have been linked to congenital and acquired disease (6Abbott G. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M. Lehman M. Timothy K. Keating M. Goldstein S.

Like human KCNE proteins that individually assemble with the voltage-gated K+ channel KCNQ1 (18Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G.

We suggest that this class of ancillary subunits is an integral part of K+ channels and that these subunits probably operate through conserved mechanisms. C. elegans MPS proteins can form ternary complexes with KVS-1, that is, complexes containing more than one MPS member. It is interesting to note that the subunit composition of ternary complexes appears to be tightly regulated because combinations such as MPS-1/MPS-2 and MPS-1/MPS-3 are apparently forbidden. The existence of these complexes is an observation relevant to mammalian physiology because it raises the possibility that the KCNE proteins that have been shown to associate individually with KCNQ1 might also form ternary complexes in human tissues (18Barhanin J.

Cell Cardiol. 2005; 38: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) recently speculated that in human heart, a balance of KCNE accessory subunits may be important for cardiac K(V) channel function. Taken together these data provide insights into the mechanisms determining chemotaxis in C. elegans. Our findings imply that the net of interactions between the five neurons of the sensory network is very complex and that neurons thought to be marginal instead have an important role. The use of sensory thresholds controlled by secondary neurons might be an efficient strategy to filter and to balance inputs coming from the diverse sources present in the natural environment of the animal. This mechanism would increase fidelity, and it may be seen as a means to lower the background noise because it is likely that traces of sodium and other attractants are always present in the environment of the animal. Interestingly, a molecular component of the ADF neuronal K+ current is linked to a particular sensory function and apparently is not related to other activities. Because K+ currents dampen cell excitability, it is reasonable to assume that destabilization of the MPS-2·MPS-3·KVS-1 complex would make ADF cells more excitable with the result of lowering the threshold for sodium. In fact, we observe this phenotype only at low Na+ concentrations. We conclude that sensory pathways require specific genes not only at the level of the receptor molecule but also at the end of the sensory cascade. The remarkable variety of K+ channel genes in mammalian neurons has led to the working hypothesis that the electrical properties of those cells are dynamic and constantly subjected to fine-tuning. In C. elegans a voltage-gated pore-forming subunit is functionally differentiated by assembly with small accessory subunits. These findings disclose an unexpected complexity in C. elegans neurons and underscore a similarity to mammals. We thank Dr. Lenard for helpful comments and Drs. Monica Driscoll and Martha Soto for advice. Cinzia Sesti helped with the graphics, and Suk-Mei Kwok was involved in the cloning effort. The gyc-5::gfp strain was a gift of Dr. Cornelia Bargmann."

Potassium (K+) channels are a very diverse group of proteins that are key elements for a variety of different physiological functions including the electrical excitability of cells (1Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., 2001Google Scholar). During evolution a great variability of peptide toxins targeting different K+ channels have been evolved by several venomous organisms including snakes, spiders, and scorpions. The venoms of the marine cone snails are known to contain different families of peptides, the so-called conotoxins, which target ligand-gated and voltage-gated ion channels with great specificity. Meanwhile several conotoxins have been identified that have been shown to interact with voltage-activated K+ channels. This includes the κ-conotoxins and the κM-conotoxins (2Terlau H. Olivera B.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 41-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar).

Despite the entirely different pharmacological specificity, a high structural similarity has been observed between this peptide and μ-conotoxin GIIIA, which specifically blocks Na+ channels, or ψ-conotoxin PIIIE, which is a non-competitive blocker of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Structurally and phylogenetically unrelated toxins that interact with voltage-activated K+ channels usually share a dyad motif composed of a lysine and a hydrophobic amino acid residue (Tyr or Phe). In particular, there is evidence that the lysine residue of this functional dyad occludes the K+ channel pore (6Miller C.

A systematic mutational analysis conducted for all non-cysteine residues of κM-RIIIK showed that κM-RIIIK does not contain a functional dyad (3Al-Sabi A. Lennartz D. Ferber M. Gulyas J. Rivier J.E.F. Olivera B.M. Carlomagno T. Terlau H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8625-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), in contrast to most K+ channel-targeting peptidic neurotoxins. In κM-RIIIK all the residues that are most relevant for function contain a positive charge; these residues define a basic ring separating two peptide surfaces. The peptide residues that are moderately relevant for binding cluster on one of the two surfaces, whereas those that are irrelevant for binding occupy the other surface. Based on the lack of the dyad and on the observation that all the functionally relevant residues are clustered on one surface of the peptide delimited by a ring of positive charges, a novel pharmacophore model was hypothesized for the κM-RIIIK-TSha1 complex. In this model the ring of positive charges is used as an anchor to residues of the K+ channel loops, and κM-RIIIK blocks the channel by covering the pore as a lid (3Al-Sabi A. Lennartz D. Ferber M. Gulyas J. Rivier J.E.F. Olivera B.M. Carlomagno T. Terlau H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8625-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Additionally, no positively charged side chain penetrates the channel pore. The importance of a ring of basic residues for potassium channel binding was also proposed for the scorpion toxin Pi1 by Mouhat et al. (13Mouhat S. Mosbah A. Visan V. Wulff H. Delpierre M. Darbon H. Grissmer S. De Waard M. Sabatier J.-M. Biochem.

In this study we investigate the interaction of κM-RIIIK with the pore of the TSha1 K+ channel. We use the data from an extensive mutant cycle analysis to calculate the orientation of the peptide within the pore of the TSha1 channel, whose structure was derived by homology to the known KcsA structure (14Doyle D.A.

Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) has demonstrated the validity of a computational approach based on intermolecular distance restraints, which can be derived by mutant cycle data, for obtaining models of the atomic interactions in bimolecular complexes. In this study the solution structure of κM-RIIIK is docked to the TSha1 channel, allowing full flexibility of the side chains of both the peptide and the protein and using 17 intermolecular distance restraints derived from experimental mutant cycle data. The resulting model for the κM-RIIIK-TSha1 complex indicates that κM-RIIIK indeed occludes the permeation pathway as a lid, which is anchored by the electrostatic interaction of a ring of basic residues on the peptide surface with the outer vestibule of the ion channel pore. All functionally relevant residues belong to the interaction surface with the channel, whereas functionally irrelevant side chains are mostly projected toward solution. Specific electrostatic interactions between the positively charged side chains of the toxin and channel residues of the loop and outer helix regions are likely to be responsible for the selectivity of κM-RIIIK for the TSha1 channel. Furthermore, our model suggests that the trans-hydroxyproline 15 of κM-RIIIK, which is the homologous residue of Arg-13 of μ-conotoxins GIIIA, interacts with the carbonyl groups within the selectivity filter of the channel, thereby occupying the permeation pathway. Arg-13 of μ-conotoxins has been demonstrated to be essential for blocking the pore of Na+ channels (2Terlau H. Olivera B.M. Physiol.

The IC50 values for the block of TSha1 channels were calculated from the peak currents at a test potential of 0 mV according to IC50 = fc/(1 – fc) × [Tx], where fc is the fractional current, and [Tx] is the toxin concentration.

Docking Calculations—The model of the TSha1 channel was obtained by homology to the crystal structure of the KcsA channel (14Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A.L. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L.

A large number of spatial restraints, extracted from the KcsA PDB file (1BL8), were optimized using the program MODELLER Version 6.2 to generate similarity-based models of TSha1 (21Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10565) Google Scholar). The ideal 4-fold symmetry of the tetrameric channel was imposed on all the models. Of the 100 generated models, the one with the lowest MODELLER restraint energy was kept and refined by energy minimization with the program CNS solve 1.1 (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

The docking protocol was based on a similar procedure as that used by Eriksson and Roux (7Eriksson M.A.L. Roux B. Biophys.

In the thermodynamic double mutant cycle analysis, two interacting molecules A and B are mutated at specific sites a and b to give two molecules A* and B*. The binding free energies ΔG for the wild type and single and double mutant complexes A-B, A*-B, A-B*, and A*-B* are combined to obtain the interaction free energy, ΔΔGint = [ΔG(A*-B*) – ΔG(A*-B)] – [ΔG(A-B*) – ΔG(A-B)]. The ΔΔGint is a measure of the non-additivity of the mutations a*onAand b* on B and reveals a direct interaction of the sites a and b (23Ranganathan R. Lewis J.H. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 24Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). In these studies the ΔΔG values of Fig. 3 were translated into intermolecular distances as follows: (a) 2 kJ/mol < ΔΔG ≤ 3 kJ/mol corresponds to a very weak intermolecular distance (d) restraint between sites a and b (4 Å < d < 6 Å); (b) 3 kJ/mol < ΔΔG ≤ 4 kJ/mol corresponds to a weak intermolecular distance restraint (3.5 Å < d < 5.5 Å); (c) 4 kJ/mol < ΔΔG ≤ 5.5 kJ/mol corresponds to a medium distance restraint (2.5 Å < d < 4.5 Å); ΔΔG > 5.5 kJ/mol corresponds to a strong distance restraint (1.5 Å < d < 3.5 Å). If a and b are polar or charged residues, the minimum distance between the heavy atoms of the polar or charged groups has to fulfill the intermolecular distance restraint; for non-polar residue pairs the minimum distance between all heavy atoms of the side chains is used. Because of the 4-fold symmetry of the TSha1 channel we used ambiguous distance restraints; the distance dij between a residue of the toxin (i) and a residue of the channel (j) is described as, dij = Min(∥ri – r Aj∥, ∥ ri – r Bj∥, ∥ ri – r Cj∥, ∥ ri – r Dj∥), where A, B, C, and D are the four identical subunits of TSha1. To avoid redundant identical complexes, all distances from the residue Arg-10 of κM-RIIIK were assigned to the subunit A of the channel. The NMR structure of κM-conotoxin RIIIK shows that Arg-10 and Lys-18 are on opposite sides of the peptide; to ensure that the toxin is stretched over the pore, we impose that Lys-18 is close to the extracellular loop of the channel unit opposite to that in contact with Arg-10 (unit C). A total of 16 distance restraints were used: three very weak (Val-376–Leu-1, Met-375–Hyp-15, Glu-348–Arg-19), three weak (Glu-348–Leu-1, Met-375–Leu-1, Glu-348–Arg-10, five medium (Glu-354–Leu-1, Pro-349–Leu-1, Glu-348–Lys-18, Glu-354–Arg-19, Ser-351–Arg-19), and five strong (Glu-354–Arg-10, Pro-349–Arg-10, Ser-351–Arg-10, Glu-354–Lys-18, Pro-349–Arg-19). An additional distance restraint was added between the N terminus NH+3 of the toxin and any electronic acceptor of the channel, following the dramatic decrease in the toxin affinity upon acetylation of the terminal amine (3Al-Sabi A. Lennartz D. Ferber M. Gulyas J. Rivier J.E.F. Olivera B.M. Carlomagno T. Terlau H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8625-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All distances were restrained with a harmonic potential. The docking protocol consisted of a series of short torsion angle Molecular Dynamics trajectories. In the first step of the simulated annealing protocol the temperature was increased to 1000 K (500 steps of 10 fs for a total of 5 ps); during this phase the van der Waals radius of the atoms was decreased from 1 to 0.1. In the second step the temperature was slowly lowered to 300 K (1000 steps of 15 fs for a total of 15 ps), and the van der Waals radius was increased from 0.1 to 1. At the beginning of the trajectories, the toxin was positioned randomly at a distance of 15 Å from the channel. All docking trajectories were started with different initial conditions by changing the initial velocities and the initial orientation of the toxin with respect to the channel pore axis. During the simulated annealing the electrostatic energy was turned on toward the end of the dynamics. A continuum solvent model was used with a dielectric constant ϵ = 12 (7Eriksson M.A.L. Roux B. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2595-2609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The distance restraint force was fixed to 300 kcal mol–1Å–2 during the dynamics. Flexibility was allowed for the conformation of the toxin backbone of the amino acids 1–3 and of all the toxin side chains. The N terminus backbone of the peptide was allowed to change conformation with respect to the NMR structure following the observation that this region is highly flexible in solution (3Al-Sabi A. Lennartz D. Ferber M. Gulyas J. Rivier J.E.F. Olivera B.M. Carlomagno T. Terlau H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8625-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The peptide backbone of residues 4–24 was restrained with an harmonic potential based on the root mean square deviation from the NMR structure with a force of 500 kcal mol–1Å–2. This allows rotation and translation of the toxin with respect to the channel while keeping the overall folding close to that experimentally determined. The conformation of the trans-membrane helices of the channel was kept fixed, the backbone of residues 336–386 was restrained to that of the initial model with an harmonic potential and a force of 300 kcal mol–1Å–2, whereas the side chains of residues 336–386 were allowed full flexibility. The MD were followed by 6 cycles of 500 steps of energy minimizations where the backbone restraint function was turned off and the distance restraints were decreased to 75 kcal mol–1Å–2. During the minimization the electrostatic potential was turned on. The trajectories were analyzed using the g_cluster module of the GROMACS 3.1 program (25Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Drunen R. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 43-56Crossref Scopus (7262) Google Scholar, 26Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). The clusters were generated using distances r.m.s.d. with the GROMOS method (27Daura X. Gademann K. Jaun B. Seebach D. van Gunsteren W.F. Mark A.E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 236-240Crossref Google Scholar) and a cutoff of 0.2 nm. The r.m.s.d. used to define the clusters is an intermolecular r.m.s.d. containing distances between toxin residues Leu-1, Ser-6, Arg-10, Hyp-13, Hyp-15, Lys-18, and Arg-19 and amino acids Glu-348, Pro-349, Glu-354, Gly-371, and Val-376 of the turret and pore helix region of the four units of the channel. We have performed a mutant cycling analysis to identify which amino acids of κM-RIIIK interact with specific residues in the vestibule of the ion channel pore of TSha1. For this purpose we have generated several mutants of TSha1 with single amino acids changes in the pore region of the channel, where κM-RIIIK is likely to interact (4Ferber M. Sporning A. Jeserich G. DelaCruz R. Watkins M. Olivera B.M. Terlau H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2177-2183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the alignment of the amino acid sequences of the pore region of TSha1 and Shaker together with the one of KcsA, for which a high resolution structure is available (14Doyle D.A.

Several mutations within this area have been constructed and functionally assayed using the Xenopus expression system and two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments. The addition of 1 μm of κM-RIIIK leads to different reductions of the measured currents at a test potential of 0 mV for wild type and mutated ion channels (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that the affinity of the peptide for the mutated channels is reduced. For M375K channels, hardly any block can be observed at this toxin concentration. This indicates a very low affinity of the toxin for the mutated channel, which was estimated to be about 10 μm (kD ≈ 76 nm for the wild type channel). The changes in the affinity for the different channel mutants are summarized in Table I and confirm that κM-RIIIK indeed interacts with the pore region of the channel. The relative changes induced by the different mutations are summarized in Fig. 2. The mutations E348S, P349K, S351K, M375L, and V376T led to a 2-fold reduction in the affinity of κM-RIIIK. Interestingly the mutation E348K did not have a significant effect despite the drastic change in the electrostatic properties of the side chain. The mutations E354K and E354Q resulted in a decrease of the affinity of 6- and 4-fold, respectively. The mutation M375I resulted in a much stronger affinity change than M375L (12-versus 2-fold), whereas the most dramatic effect was observed for M375K (>100-fold).Table IIC50 Values for TSha1 mutant K+ block of κM-RIIIK WTkM-RIIIKIC50 (0 mV)nmnWT76 ± 109E348S110 ± 304E348K50 ± 103P349K130 ± 203S351K160 ± 104E354K490 ± 1103E354Q270 ± 304S366TNFM375K10730 ± 24603M375L140 ± 403M375I1360 ± 705V376T120 ± 203V376HLEV376SNFV376ENFV376KNF Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Influence of single point mutations in the pore region of TSha1 on κM-RIIIK binding.

In this analysis we concentrated on the amino acid residues of the toxin that had been shown to be functionally relevant (Leu-1, Arg-10; Lys-18, Arg-19) (3Al-Sabi A. Lennartz D. Ferber M. Gulyas J.

The IC50 values for the different combinations of channel and toxin mutations are summarized in Table II, whereas Fig. 3 shows the corresponding changes in binding energy (ΔΔG) values. Assuming that a ΔΔG value of 2 kJ/mol indicates that the distance between the two mutated residues is less than 6 Å (24Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8625-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) we proposed a new pharmacophore model for the κM-RIIIK-TSha1 complex based on the fact that the toxin lacks the dyad motif composed of a lysine and a hydrophobic amino acid residue and on the observation that all the functionally relevant residues are clustered on one surface of the peptide delimited by a ring of positive charges. In our model the ring of positive charges is used as an anchor to residues of the K+ channel loops, and κM-RIIIK blocks the channel by covering the pore as a lid. Additionally, no positively charged side chain penetrates the channel pore. The new pharmacophore is fully supported by the mutant cycling analysis data. Arg-10, Lys-18, and Arg-19 have the largest interactions with residues Glu-348, Pro-349, Ser-351, and Glu-354 of the turret and pore helix regions of the K+ channel, thus excluding that any of the positively charged side chains penetrates the channel pore. Instead, the positively charged residues interact with the loops of the four channel units, anchoring the peptide to the channel. The mutant cycling data have been used as intermolecular distance restraints in docking calculations with the aim of obtaining a model for the complex of κM-RIIIK with the TSha1 channel. The structure of κM-conotoxin RIIIK, determined in aqueous solution by NMR, was docked to the model structure of the TSha1 channel using the distance restraints derived from the mutant cycle analysis, as described under “Materials and Methods.” According to what observed by Eriksson and Roux (7Eriksson M.A.L. Roux B. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2595-2609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) for the Ag2Tx-Shaker complex, we find that one or two distance restraints are insufficient to achieve a selection among the different orientations of the toxin with respect to the channel pore. Therefore, we chose to use all the available distance restraints in the docking calculations. The 875 generated models can be subdivided into 4 clusters, which have been numbered from I to IV according to increasing total energy (Fig. 4).

Hepatocytes were labeled with [3H]cholesterol (delivered with LDL or methyl-β-cyclodextrin), [3H]mevalonate, or [3H]choline. ABCA1 deficiency decreased apoA-I phospholipidation by 80%, but acquisition of de novo synthesized and exogenous cholesterol only decreased by 40–60%. The transfer of de novo synthesized cholesterol to apoA-I was decreased at all time points, but that of exogenously delivered cholesterol was independent of ABCA1 activity at the early time points. Progesterone does not affect apoA-I synthesis or its lipidation but inhibited the early phase of apoA-I cholesterol lipidation in both wild type and ABCA1-null hepatocytes. Fast protein liquid chromatography analysis of medium lipoproteins confirmed that with ABCA1 deficiency, the proportion of secreted high density lipoprotein-associated apoA-I and cholesterol decreased by about 50%. The very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)/LDL size fraction also contained a significant level of cholesterol in ABCA1 deficiency, consistent with the result of immunoprecipitations showing the presence of lipoproteins with both apoA-I and murine apoB. ApoA-I lipidation with newly synthesized cholesterol in ABCA1-null hepatocytes was significantly decreased by brefeldin A and monensin. In conclusion, we demonstrate that: (i) whereas most hepatic phospholipidation of apoA-I is mediated by ABCA1, acquisition of cholesterol depends on active transfer from intracellular compartments by ABCA1-dependent and -independent pathways, both sensitive to progesterone and (ii) there is separate regulation of phospholipid and cholesterol lipidation of apoA-I in hepatocytes.

Macrophages in various tissues are profoundly affected by this disease, first suggesting that ABCA1 function in macrophages was critical for the maintenance of HDL levels in the plasma, as part of the reverse cholesterol transport.

Biochem. 1985; 54: 699-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) are both highly expressed in the liver and intestine, suggesting that ABCA1 contributes to the lipidation of newly secreted lipoproteins in those tissues. Basso et al. (15Basso F. Freeman L. Knapper C.L. Remaley A. Stonik J. Neufeld E.B. Tansey T. Amar M.J. Fruchart-Najib J. Duverger N. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 296-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) used an ABCA1 adenovirus expression system to promote liver expression of ABCA1, thereby raising plasma HDL-cholesterol and promoting cholesterol efflux from primary hepatocytes, supporting the role of the liver as a major source of HDL. As noted by Tall et al. (16Tall A.R. Wang N. Mucksavage P. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the importance of ABCA1-mediated lipidation of apoA-I in the liver challenges the concept of reverse cholesterol transport. If apoA-I secreted by hepatocytes enters the circulation in a lipidated form, the cholesterol thus exported by the liver together with apoA-I contributes to the forward cholesterol transport and must subtract from the cholesterol eventually returned to the liver and presumed to be derived from peripheral tissues. Clearly, the nature and composition of apoA-I-containing lipoproteins secreted by the hepatocytes and their quantitative contribution to the pool of circulating HDL require further studies. Earlier studies of the synthesis and secretion of apoA-I in liver and hepatocytes provided good evidence for the intracellular and pericellular lipidation of apoA-I (17Howell K.E. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Banerjee D. Redman C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Banerjee D. Redman C.M.

Acta. 1990; 1047: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the formation of lipoproteins with the density of HDL was not observed in well defined subcellular fractions (22Hamilton R.L. Moorehouse A. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 529-543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), recent studies supported the notion of intracellular lipidation (23Banerjee D. Rodriguez M. Rajasekaran A.K. Exp.

Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 36-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have overall a limited knowledge of the process and pathways of HDL assembly in hepatocytes and of the nature of lipoproteins secreted. In primary mouse hepatocytes, we demonstrated that endogenously synthesized apoA-I acquired more phospholipid in an ABCA1-dependent manner than exogenously added apoA-I, therefore indicating that intracellular lipidation of apoA-I is greater than pericellular lipidation by the efflux process (25Kiss R.S.

We also demonstrated the existence of a limited ABCA1-independent lipidation pathway for newly synthesized apoA-I (25Kiss R.S. McManus D.C. Franklin V. Tan W.L. McKenzie A. Chimini G. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10119-10127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cholesterol lipidation of exogenous apoA-I in hepatocytes was investigated by Sahoo et al. (26Sahoo D. Trischuk T.C. Chan T. Drover V.A. Ho S. Chimini G. Agellon L.B. Agnihotri R. Francis G.A. Lehner R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1122-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), who showed lipidation of the exogenous apoA-I and increased formation of lipoproteins containing endogenous murine apoA-I. However, the cholesterol lipidation of endogenously synthesized apoA-I has not been evaluated. Here, we extend our previous studies by comparing the kinetics of cholesterol and phospholipid acquisition by newly synthesized and secreted apoA-I and contrasting it with that of exogenously added apoA-I in primary hepatocytes from wild type and ABCA1-/- mice. We also compare the acquisition of cholesterol derived from exogenous sources and endogenously synthesized. The results, recently presented and published in abstract form (27Zheng H. Kiss R.S. Franklin V. Wang M.D. Haidar B. Marcel Y.L. Circulation. 2004; 110 (Abstr. 13942): 272Google Scholar), show that newly synthesized cholesterol is transferred to apoA-I during secretion in a partially ABCA1-dependent manner. A major transfer of cholesterol also occurs at the cell surface, some of which is independent of ABCA1. Surprisingly, the acquisition of cholesterol by apoA-I is less dependent on ABCA1 activity than its phospholipidation, which provides new evidence for the dissociation of phospholipid and cholesterol transfers by ABCA1. We also analyzed the cellular origin of the cholesterol transferred to apoA-I, which is mostly derived from intracellular pools and depends on active transfer. Materials—[1,2-3H]-Cholesterol, [5-3H(N)]mevalono-lactone-Rs, choline [methyl-3H]chloride were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Williams' Medium E, HepatoZYME-SFM, and antibiotic-antimycotic were purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal anti-human apoA-I antibody was purchased from Calbiochem. Monoclonal antibodies directed against human apoA-I (a combination of 4H1 (against the extreme N terminus) and 5F6 (against the central region)) were described previously (28McManus D.C. Scott B.R.

Polyclonal anti-mouse apoB antibody was purchased from Biodesign International. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and protein G-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Progesterone (4-pregnene-3, 20-dione), brefeldin A, monensin, and other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Animals and Primary Hepatocyte Cultures—Wild type C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. ABCA1-deficient mice (a kind gift from Dr. Edward M. Rubin, Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, Berkeley, CA) have been generated as follows. A 1.65-kb PCR-generated fragment containing abca1 exon 16 was inserted between the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) terminator of the PGKNeo cassette and the double PGKtk cassettes of pPN2T at EcoRI and BamHI sites. A 12-kb PCR-generated fragment from intron 22 to exon 30 was then inserted on the PGK promoter side of the PGKneo at blunted XhoI and NotI sites to generate the final targeting vector pAbc1SALA. The Stratagene TaqPlus long PCR system was used for amplification of 12-kb fragments. ESVJ ES cells from Genomesystems were electroporated with NotI-linearized pAbc1SALA and subjected to G418 and 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxy-1-β-d-arabinofuranosyl-5-iodouracil (FIAU) selection. Correctly targeted clones were screened by PCR and then confirmed by Southern blotting. Chimeric mice were generated using standard procedures. Chimeric males were bred with C57BL/6J (Charles River Laboratories) to create mice heterozygous for the targeted allele on the 129Sv/C57 mixed background. 129SV/C57 mice have higher baseline HDL levels and are less susceptible to atherosclerosis than the C57BL/6J (30Ishimori N.

All mice were maintained on a normal chow diet in a 12-h light/12-h dark schedule and used between the ages of 4 and 6 months. All experiments performed were in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Ottawa Animal Care Committee. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from these mice by liver collagenase perfusion according to the established protocols (31Thomas S.S. Plenkiewicz J. Ison E.R. Bols M. Zou W. Szarek W.A.

Briefly, the cells were plated in fibronectin precoated (25 μg/well) 6-well plates at an initial density of 1.5 × 106 cells/well in Williams' Medium E containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 units/ml), Fungizone (250 ng/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell Labeling and Adenovirus Infection—Five h following the initial seeding, the cells were washed in Williams' Medium E without serum (2 × 2 ml) and incubated with HepatoZYME-SFM containing antibiotic-antimycotic, 10 μCi/ml [3H]mevalonate, or 5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol delivered with low density lipoprotein (LDL) or [3H]choline. Mevalonate label is incorporated predominantly into cholesterol (33Johnson W.J. Fischer R.T. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol.

The following day (24 h), the labeled medium was removed, and the cells were infected for 1 h with either the recombinant adenovector expressing human apoA-I (Ad5-Ad AI) or as control, adeno-luciferase (Ad5-Ad Luc) at a multiplicity of infection of 75:1 plaque-forming units/cell in Williams' Medium E without serum (28McManus D.C.

After 1 h of infection, hepatocytes were incubated for an additional 24 h with original labeling medium as described above. To label the plasma membrane cholesterol pool, hepatocytes were cooled down to 4 °C for 1 h on the 3rd day. The medium was replaced by 5 mm methyl-β cyclodextrin (mβCD): [3H]cholesterol (5 μCi/ml) at a molar ratio 8:1 for 3 h at 4 °C (34Atger V.M. Moya M.D. Stoudt G.W. Rodrigueza W.V. Phillips M.C.

Time Course of [3H]Cholesterol and [3H]Choline-Phospholipid Efflux Assay—On the 3rd day, hepatocytes were equilibrated in non-labeled HepatoZYME-SFM for 1 h at 37 °C. Following 2 × 2 ml washes in Williams' Medium E, the cells were incubated with non-labeled HepatoZYME-SFM (1 ml/well) in the absence (endogenous apoA-I study) or presence of 5 μg of human apoA-I (hapoA-I) (exogenous-apoA-I study). The cells were returned to the 37 °C incubator (5% CO2) for the various times, and the efflux medium was subsequently collected at different time points and spun down to pellet any cell debris. All media were analyzed as described below. In some experiments, plasma membrane cholesterol was extracted by treatment with 20 mm mβCD at 4 °C for 15 min. In other experiments, 10 μg/ml progesterone, an inhibitor of cholesterol transport from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane (36Butler J.D. Blanchette-Mackie J. Goldin E. O'Neill R.R.

Distribution of Secreted ApoA-I in the Different Lipoprotein Fractions—The medium from five 6-well plates (30 wells) were pooled and concentrated down to 2 ml with Amicon 10K filter units. The sample was immediately loaded on calibrated Superdex 200 columns connected in series as described previously for isolation of lipoproteins from plasma samples (28McManus D.C. Scott B.R. Frank P.G. Franklin V. Schultz J.R. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5043-5051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)- and LDL-sized species eluted close to the void volume of the column, whereas HDL particles and smaller very high density lipoprotein (VHDL) fractions containing albumin (7.1 nm diameter) were well separated. Aliquots from each fraction were analyzed for apoA-I by immunoblot analysis following transfer to nitrocellulose with a slot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad Bio-Dot SF unit) as described previously (28McManus D.C. Scott B.R. Frank P.G. Franklin V. Schultz J.R. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5043-5051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The concentration of apoA-I in the VLDL/LDL, HDL, and VHDL pools was determined by densitometric scanning (Bio-Rad software, Quantity One, version 4.11). Analysis of medium collected from hepatocytes infected with the Ad Luc was also carried out as negative control for background signal. For comparison, the relative distribution of murine apoB (apoB48 and apoB100) was also measured using the polyclonal anti-mouse apoB antibody and visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce West Pico SuperSignal substrate, Pierce) after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Immunoprecipitation of ApoA-I-associated Cholesterol and Choline-Phospholipids—ApoA-I from hepatocyte medium was immunoprecipitated either directly from the efflux medium or from lipoprotein fractions separated by FPLC. The immunoprecipitations were carried out with a polyclonal anti-human apoA-I antiserum from sheep followed by protein G-Sepharose. An equal volume of an anti-human apoB antiserum from sheep, which does not cross-react with murine apoB, or the efflux medium from time 0 that immunoprecipitated with anti-human apoA-I antiserum from sheep was used as a background control. The immunoprecipitates were collected as described previously (25Kiss R.S. McManus D.C. Franklin V. Tan W.L. McKenzie A. Chimini G. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10119-10127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The cholesterol and phospholipid associated with hapoA-I were quantified by scintillation counting. We have previously provided evidence for the phospholipidation of apoA-I during secretion and post-secretion at the cell surface and shown that most but not all (80%) of this phospholipidation is ABCA1-dependent (25Kiss R.S. McManus D.C. Franklin V. Tan W.L. McKenzie A. Chimini G. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10119-10127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here, our first objective was to compare the kinetics of cholesterol lipidation of apoA-I during secretion in relation to that of phospholipidation. Although [3H]choline labeling allows uniform labeling of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin in cellular membranes, labeling of cholesterol pools varies with methods used to deliver the labeled cholesterol or its precursors. Therefore, we have first evaluated the distribution of label in several models of cellular cholesterol labeling. Quantification of Different Cellular Pools of [3H]Cholesterol by Accessibility of Cholesterol to mβCD Extraction at Different Temperatures—To quantify the distribution of [3H]cholesterol in the different cellular compartments as a function of the labeling method, hepatocytes were labeled with [3H]mevalonate, [3H]cholesterol delivered by LDL ([3H]cholesterol-LDL), or [3H]cholesterol delivered by mβCD ([3H]cholesterol-mβCD) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using the accessibility of [3H]cholesterol to mβCD extraction (20 mm) at 37 and 4 °C, we estimated the labeling of different pools: plasma membrane, defined by accessibility at 4 °C; recycling endosome compartment, represented by the difference between accessibility at 4 and 37 °C; and other intracellular pools, represented by [3H]cholesterol that is not accessible at 37 °C. Low concentrations of mβCD have been used as a carrier to deliver cholesterol to the cells (40Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C.J. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 41Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Table I summarized the results of this analysis of the distribution of cellular [3H]cholesterol as a function of labeling methods. mβCD preferentially labeled the plasma membrane cholesterol pool, delivering only 10 and 5% of [3H]cholesterol in the recycling compartment and other intracellular pools, respectively. In contrast, newly synthesized cholesterol derived from [3H]mevalonate preferentially predominantly labeled intracellular compartments (58% of the [3H]cholesterol). [3H]Cholesterol derived from LDL labeled 61% on the plasma membrane and 39% in the intracellular compartments.Table IQuantification of different cellular pools of [3H]cholesterol in C57B control hepatocytesPlasma membraneRecycling endosome compartmentsOther intracellular pools[3H]Mevalonate42 ± 3%aHepatocytes from C57B mice were labeled with [3H]mevalonate or [3H]cholesterol-LDL for 40 h or [3H]cholesterol-mβCD for 3 h in HepatoZYME-SFM as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were treated with 20 mm mβCD at either 37 °C for 15 min or 4 °C for 15 min following cooling down at 4 °C for 1 h.

Open table in a new tab Time Course of Acquisition of Cholesterol and Phospholipid by Newly Synthesized HapoA-I in ABCA1+/+ and ABCA1-/- Hepatocytes—To compare the kinetics of cholesterol and phospholipid acquisition by apoA-I during secretion, primary hepatocytes from ABCA1-wild type and -null mice were isolated and incubated with [3H]mevalonate or [3H]choline for labeling of endogenously synthesized cholesterol and phospholipids, respectively. hapoA-I was expressed in the cells by adenoviral-vector gene transfer for 24 h, and secretion was monitored for various times after a 1-h equilibration period in non-labeled HepatoZYME-SFM. Media collected at each time point were immunoprecipitated with anti-human apoA-I to quantify the radiolabeled lipids specifically associated with hapoA-I (Fig. 1). In ABCA1+/+ hepatocytes, the acquisition by hapoA-I of newly synthesized phospholipids (Fig. 1A) and newly synthesized cholesterol (Fig. 1B) increased in parallel with time, indicating that newly synthesized apoA-I was secreted with both lipids, although the results did not define where apoA-I acquires these lipids, intracellularly or at the cell surface. Consistent with our previous finding, ABCA1 deficiency resulted in the loss of ∼80% of phospholipid acquisition by apoA-I at both 4- and 8-h time points. In contrast, ABCA1 deficiency caused only a loss of 40 and 45% in the acquisition of newly synthesized cholesterol by apoA-I at the respective 4- and 8-h time points. The discrepancy between the rates of cholesterol and phospholipid association with apoA-I first suggested the possibility of differential access to lipid pools and second suggested the heterogeneity in labeling of cholesterol pools. The hepatocytes were then labeled with exogenously supplied cholesterol derived from LDL and mβCD as indicated previously. As we observed with de novo synthesized cholesterol, in ABCA1 wild type hepatocytes, there was a time-dependent increase of exogenously supplied cholesterol transfer to apoA-I.

Two panels of minireceptors were constructed that involved truncations of either the N- or C-terminal regions of the M6P/IGF2R encompassing deletions of various ligand binding domains. α-FLAG or α-Myc-based immunoprecipitation assays showed that all of the minireceptors tested were able to associate with a full-length, Myc-tagged M6P/IGF2R (WT-M). In the α-FLAG but not α-Myc immunoprecipitation assays, the degree of association of a series of C-terminally truncated minireceptors with WT-M showed a positive trend with length of the minireceptor. In contrast, length did not seem to affect the association of the N-terminally truncated minireceptors with WT-M, except that the 12th extracytoplasmic repeat appeared exceptionally important in dimerization in the α-FLAG assays. The presence of mutations in the ligand-binding sites of the minireceptors had no effect on their ability to associate with WT-M. Thus, association within the heterodimers was not dependent on the presence of functional ligand binding domains. Heterodimers formed between WT-M and the minireceptors demonstrated high affinity IGF-II and Man-6-P-ligand binding, suggesting a functional association.

This receptor comprises a large extracytoplasmic (EC) domain, a single membrane-spanning region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The EC domain is the principal ligand-binding region of the receptor, consisting of 15 homologous repeats of ∼145 amino acids each (1Ghosh P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Newly synthesized Man-6-P-containing ligands such as lysosomal acid hydrolases bind to the M6P/IGF2R in the trans-Golgi network through Man-6-P residues on their N-linked oligosaccharides, whereas other Man-6-P-containing ligands, such as latent transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), proliferin, and granzyme B, bind at the cell surface (1Ghosh P.

The two high affinity binding sites are not functionally equivalent with respect to ligand preference, having distinct dissociation constants for the multivalent Man-6-P-ligand β-glucuronidase (2.0 versus 4.3 nm for repeats 3 and 9, respectively) (20Marron-Terada P.G.

The pH optimum for carbohydrate binding is also more acidic for repeat 9 than repeat 3 (pH 6.4 versus pH 6.9, respectively), and the two sites differ in their ability to recognize distinctive modifications found on Dictyostelium discoideum glycoproteins, such as mannose 6-sulfate and Man-6-P methyl esters (21Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Additionally, repeat 9 alone can fold into a high affinity ligand binding domain, whereas repeat 3 depends on residues in adjacent repeats 1 and/or 2 for optimal ligand binding (22Hancock M.K.

Although it exhibits significant sequence homology with repeats 3 and 9, as well as sharing four conserved residues key for Man-6-P binding, repeat 5 has an ∼300-fold lower affinity for Man-6-P than repeat 9 or repeats 1–3, possibly due to the absence of two half-cystines that form a stabilizing disulfide bond in repeats 3 and 9 (19Reddy S.T.

Groeger G. Hassan A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23986-23991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Structural analyses of repeat 11 identified the putative IGF-II-binding site in a hydrophobic pocket at the end of a β-barrel structure (28Brown J. Esnouf R.M. Jones M.A. Linnell J. Harlos K.

Another member of this class is retinoic acid, a unique ligand for the M6P/IGF2R in that it binds the cytoplasmic region and is thought to function by altering intracellular trafficking of the M6P/IGF2R and its cargo (29Kang J.X.

The uPAR-M6P/IGF2R interaction appears to be weak, of low affinity, and confined to a small subpopulation of uPAR molecules (33Kreiling J.L. Byrd J.C. Deisz R.J. Mizukami I.F. Todd III, R.F.

Chem. 2004; 279: 34000-34009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have allowed these groups to propose different models for the overall structure of the EC domain of the M6P/IGF2R. The EC domain of the receptor shows considerable homology among repeats and the cation-dependent Man-6-P-receptor (16–38% identity) (4Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This high level of sequence identity accounts for structural similarities among domains, including conserved disulfide bond organization, random coil linker regions connecting the domains, and an overall core flattened β-barrel structure. The 1–3 triple-repeat crystal revealed a structure in which repeat 3 sits on top of repeats 1 and 2 (34Olson L.J. Yammani R.D. Dahms N.M. Kim J.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2019-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Olson et al. (34Olson L.J. Yammani R.D. Dahms N.M. Kim J.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2019-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have proposed that the M6P/IGF2R forms distinct structural units for every three repeats of the EC region, producing five tri-repeat units that stack in a back-to-front manner. In this model, the IGF-II-binding site is located on the opposite face of the structure relative to the Man-6-P-binding sites.Traditionally thought to function as a monomer (36Perdue J.F. Chan J.K. Thibault C. Radaj P. Mills B. Daughaday W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7800-7811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the M6P/IGF2R is now considered to operate optimally in the membrane as an oligomer for high affinity Man-6-P binding and efficient internalization of ligands (37York S.J.

Intermolecular cross-linking of two M6P/IGF2R partners was shown to occur upon binding of the multivalent ligand, β-glucuronidase, resulting in increased rate of ligand internalization (37York S.J. Arneson L.S. Gregory W.T. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1164-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The initial rate of internalization of β-glucuronidase was faster than for the monovalent ligand, IGF-II, which showed that multivalent ligands enhance the rate of receptor movement, likely due to clustering of the M6P/IGF2R for improved interaction with the endocytic machinery in the formation of clathrin-coated pits (37York S.J. Arneson L.S. Gregory W.T. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1164-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Further studies demonstrated that alignment of the Man-6-P binding domains of monomeric partners of a receptor dimer is responsible for bivalent, high affinity binding, also supporting the importance of receptor oligomerization (38Byrd J.C. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18638-18646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).In order to determine the interrelationship between dimer formation and the function of the ligand binding domains of the receptor, we co-expressed full-length receptors with truncated receptors from which either the N- or C-terminal EC repeats were deleted and that lacked functional ligand binding domains and/or transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. One of the main goals of this project was to map the dimerization domain(s) of the M6P/IGF2R. We hypothesized that one or more dimer interaction domains would be located at or near the ligand binding domains in the EC region of the receptor, and that these regions would contribute preferentially to receptor dimerization. A panel of M6P/IGF2R minireceptors was constructed to test for association with a full-length version of the receptor. It was observed that all of the truncated receptors were able to associate with the full-length receptor, suggesting that dimerization domains or contacts occur all along the EC region of the receptor, not just near regions of ligand interaction. However, repeat 12 seems to be particularly important to association, as N-terminally truncated minireceptors lacking this repeat gave distinctive results in the immunoprecipitation assays. We conclude that a distinct dimerization domain for the M6P/IGF2R does not exist per se, but instead, interactions between monomeric receptor partners apparently occur all along the EC region of the receptor with special contribution made by repeat 12.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsOligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) or the University of Nebraska Medical Center Molecular Biology Core Facility (Omaha, NE). d-Man-6-P, disodium salt, anti-(α)-FLAG M2 antibody, α-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel, and the bicinchoninic acid kit for protein determination were purchased from Sigma.

Other reagents and supplies were obtained from sources as indicated.Preparation, Expression, and Analysis of Epitope-tagged MinireceptorsThe truncated M6P/IGF2R minireceptors 1-8F, 1-9F, 1-9F-R/A, 1-11F, and 1-15F were tagged with the eight-residue FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) followed by a stop codon and an XbaI restriction site at the C terminus and cloned into the pCMV5 vector as described previously (Fig. 1A) (38Byrd J.C. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18638-18646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). By using the full-length M6P/IGF2R cDNA as the template, the following minireceptors, containing the EC repeats starting with the repeat indicated in the name of the receptor and ending with the 15th repeat, followed by the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of the M6P/IGF2R, were synthesized by amplification with Vent™ polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA): 10-15CF (nt 4239–7620), 11-15CF (nt 4675–7620), 12-15CF (nt 5092–7620), and 13-15CF (nt 5542–7620) (Fig. 5A). To ensure consistent translation, the signal sequence containing the N-terminal 71 residues of repeat 1 was fused to the beginning of each construct as described previously (43Garmroudi F. Devi G. Slentz D.H. Schaffer B.S. MacDonald R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 642-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these minireceptors were C-terminally tagged with the FLAG epitope followed by a stop codon and XbaI restriction site for cloning purposes.Fig. 5Ligand blot analysis of the N-terminally truncated M6P/IGF2R minireceptors. Proteins from aliquots (25 μl) of Triton X-100 extracts from 293T cells transfected with the N-terminally truncated minireceptors were treated as in the legend to Fig. 2. A, 1 × 106 cpm 125I-IGF-II; or B, 1 × 106 cpm PMP-BSA. The blots were exposed to film by autoradiography.

Park J.H. Schaffer B.S. Garmroudi F. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18647-18656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 10-15CF or 11-15CF and 1-15F-I/T cDNAs were digested with BstEII (M6P/IGF2R nt 4698) and BstBI (M6P/IGF2R nt 5507) serially, and the resulting fragments of interest (809-bp fragment for 1-15F-I/T, corresponding to the region containing the Ile → Thr mutation, and the larger fragment (>7000 bp) for 10-15CF and 11-15CF, which also encompasses the pCMV5 plasmid), were gel-purified (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purified fragments were then ligated together using T4 DNA Ligase (Invitrogen) and used to transform XL-10 Gold competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).The full-length Myc-tagged M6P/IGF2R was prepared as follows: full-length M6P/IGF2R cDNA that had been digested with EagI and re-ligated (lacking nt 162–5319) was used as template for amplification with a 5′-primer containing an XhoI restriction site preceding the sequence corresponding to nt 94–113 of the receptor cDNA and a 3′-primer with sequence complementary to nt 7602–7620 at the C-terminal end of the expressed M6P/IGF2R followed by the 36-nt sequence encoding the Myc epitope, MEQKLISEEDLN (44Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar), followed by two stop codons and an XbaI site. The products from these amplifications were digested with XbaI and XhoI and subcloned into pBKCMV (Invitrogen). These plasmids were then digested with HindIII and XbaI and subcloned into the target vector, pCMV5. Finally, wild-type EagI fragments were subcloned into the construct, reconstituting the completed M6P/IGF2R-Myc (WT-M) cDNA construct.A full-length, Myc-tagged M6P/IGF2R triple mutant (R2AxI/T-M) for residues in the repeats 3 and 9 Man-6-P binding domains (R426A and R1325A, respectively) and the repeat 11 IGF-II binding domain (I1572T) was prepared as follows: nt 100–3242 of the M6P/IGF2R cDNA served as template for amplification using a 5′-primer containing an EcoRI restriction site preceding the sequence corresponding to nt 1112–1129 of the receptor cDNA and a 3′-primer with sequence complementary to nt 2474–2487 of the M6P/IGF2R cDNA, followed by an XhoI site. The products from these amplifications were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and subcloned into pBluescript SK II+ (pBSKII+) (Stratagene). This construct was subjected to two rounds of amplification with primers designed to incorporate the R426A mutation responsible for altering the EC repeat 3 Man-6-P-binding site using the Megaprimer approach (45Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The first round of amplification involved producing the mutation, by amplifying from that site (nt 1425) to the 3′ end of the minireceptor (nt 2487). This “megaprimer” was then used in a second round of amplification with the 5′-primer used above. The repeat 3 mutant amplification product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and subcloned back into pBSKII+. An ∼1-kb BsmI-BsmI fragment (sites at M6P/IGF2R nt 1408 and 2449) containing the mutation was removed from the megaprimer and subcloned into the corresponding positions of pBSKII+/Kpn, which contained a 2.2-kb KpnI-KpnI fragment derived from M6P/IGF2R nt 100–3242, creating a pBSKII+/Kpn-R426A minireceptor with the 3rd repeat Man-6-P-binding mutation. The KpnI-KpnI fragment from this construct was then subcloned into pCMV5/R1325A-M, a full-length Myc-tagged receptor containing the 9th repeat Man-6-P-binding mutation synthesized as described previously (39Byrd J.C. Park J.H. Schaffer B.S. Garmroudi F. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18647-18656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), that had also been digested with KpnI and XmnI, creating a full-length M6P/IGF2R bearing Man-6-P-binding site mutations at both repeats 3 and 9 (R2A-M). The R2A-M cDNA was digested with AflII (M6P/IGF2R nt 4740) and MluI (pCMV5 nt 933), and this ∼5-kb fragment was subcloned into pCMV5/I1572T-M, a full-length Myc-tagged receptor containing the 11th repeat IGF-II-binding mutation at nt 4862 (24Garmroudi F. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26944-26952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which had also been digested with AflII and MluI. The final product resulted in the binding-defective triple mutant, R2AxI/T-M, in the vector pCMV5.Transient expression of the minireceptors by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection into 293T human embryonic kidney cells and immunoblot analysis of cell lysates to measure expression of the truncated and full-length receptors were performed as described previously (39Byrd J.C.

Additionally, expression was tested by the use of the α-M6P/IGF2R polyclonal antibody (40MacDonald R.G. Tepper M.A. Clairmont K.B. Perregaux S.B. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

This process is a prerequisite for PE translocation to the cytosol where it inactivates protein synthesis. Although hydrophobic helices enable membrane insertion of related bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin, the PE translocation domain is devoid of hydrophobic stretches and the structural features triggering acid-induced membrane insertion of PE are not known. Here we have identified a molecular device that enables PE membrane insertion. This process is promoted by exposure of a key tryptophan residue. At neutral pH, this Trp is buried in a hydrophobic pocket closed by the smallest α-helix of the translocation domain. Upon acidification, protonation of the Asp that is the N-cap residue of the helix leads to its destabilization, enabling Trp side chain insertion into the endosome membrane. This tryptophan-based membrane insertion system is surprisingly similar to the membrane-anchoring mechanism of human annexin-V and could be used by other proteins as well.

Exotoxin A (PE) 1The abbreviations used are: PE, Pseudomonas exotoxin A; PE-LL, PE large loop (PE-253C,364C); PE-SL, PE small loop (PE-304C,359C); SUV, small unilamellar vesicle; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is one of the major virulence factors secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This toxin is able to kill a large range of mammalian cell lines by inhibiting their protein synthesis (1Pastan I. Chaudhary V. FitzGerald D. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 331-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and it is one of the favorite toxins to prepare immunotoxins that are promising agents for the treatment of cancers (2Reiter Y. Pastan I. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 513-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PE is a single chain 66-kDa protein organized in three structural (3Allured V.S. Collier R.J. Carroll S. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and functional (4Hwang J. FitzGerald D.J. Adhya S. Pastan I. Cell. 1987; 48: 129-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) domains successively involved in the intoxication process. First, domain I binds to the α2-macroglobulin/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (5Kounnas M.Z. Morris R.E. Thompson M.R. FitzGerald D.J. Strickland D.K. Sealinger C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12420-12423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), enabling internalization via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Domain II will then mediate translocation into the cytosol of the entire toxin (6Alami M. Taupiac M.P. Reggio H. Bienvenue A. Beaumelle B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or of a carboxyl-terminal fragment generated by furin proteolysis and encompassing domain III and most of domain II (1Pastan I. Chaudhary V. FitzGerald D. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 331-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Finally, domain III will catalyze the ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis and killing the cell (1Pastan I. Chaudhary V. FitzGerald D. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 331-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Several studies using model systems demonstrated the ability of PE to insert into membranes upon acidification (7Jiang J.X. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8636-8641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rasper D.M. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12981-12989Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because cell intoxication by PE requires low endosomal pH (1Pastan I. Chaudhary V. FitzGerald D. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 331-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 6Alami M. Taupiac M.P. Reggio H. Bienvenue A. Beaumelle B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it is also clear that this membrane insertion process is an essential step of the intoxication procedure. Nevertheless, the molecular bases for acid-triggered PE membrane insertion are not known. Indeed, although the translocation domains of related toxins such as diphtheria toxin or colicins show a characteristic three-layer structure with buried hydrophobic helices likely implicated in membrane insertion, PE domain II is devoid of such helices and, more generally, of hydrophobic stretches (9Parker M.W. Pattus F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 391-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This domain has no known homolog, and sequence (BLAST) (10Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71657) Google Scholar) or structure (DALI) (11Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar) searches yielded no significant hits. Moreover, no clear low pH sensor was found by examining the PE three-dimensional structure or using theoretical computations (12Wedekind J.E. Trame C.B. Dorywalska M. Koehl P. Raschke T.M. McKee M. FitzGerald D. Collier R.J. McKay D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 823-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The PE translocation domain (domain II) that mediates translocation is small (102 residues) and constituted of six consecutive α-helices (A–F) (3Allured V.S. Collier R.J. Carroll S. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Most point mutations in domain II led to less toxic mutants (13Kasturi S. Kihara A. FitzGerald D.J. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23427-23433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jinno Y. Ogata M. Chaudhary V.K. Willingham M.C. Adhya S. FitzGerald D. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15953-15959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicated that most residues in the translocation domain are significantly involved in the overall toxicity of the molecule. Nevertheless, they did not allow identification of a critical portion of the domain implicated in membrane insertion and translocation. More recently, our group sequentially deleted the six helices of domain II. Surprisingly, although deletion of any of the first five helices abrogates both translocation activity and toxicity, excising the smallest and last helix of the domain (helix F, 5 residues) increased the translocation rate by 60–70% with a concomitant ∼4-fold rise in toxicity (15Taupiac M.P. Bebien M. Alami M. Beaumelle B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This result indicated that this region has a key role in the translocation process. In the present study, we looked for the molecular basis of the gain in translocation activity caused by helix F deletion. This work enabled us to identify the PE initial membrane insertion mechanism. Indeed, examination of the three-dimensional structure of PE (3Allured V.S. Collier R.J. Carroll S. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) suggested that one main effect of helix F removal would be increased exposure of Trp-305 to the outside of the molecule. Here we have shown that this tryptophan is a key residue for PE acid-triggered membrane insertion and translocation. We also found that Asp-358, which is the helix F N-cap residue, is the low pH sensor triggering helix F destabilization leading to Trp-305 membrane insertion and toxin translocation at low pH. Structure Analyses and Modeling—The three-dimensional structure of PE at 3 Å resolution (3Allured V.S. Collier R.J. Carroll S. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. David McKay (Stanford, CA) and used for analysis and modeling. The refined structure published later (12Wedekind J.E. Trame C.B. Dorywalska M. Koehl P. Raschke T.M. McKee M. FitzGerald D. Collier R.J. McKay D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 823-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) displays no significant differences in the structural regions discussed in this report and was only considered to check that no error was caused by the lower resolution of the structure used. The MODELLER program (16Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10649) Google Scholar) was used to built models of the DelF mutant in which the EAGAANA sequence of the 359–365 segment was replaced by the Pro-Gly sequence (15Taupiac M.P. Bebien M. Alami M. Beaumelle B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and of the PE-SL and PE-LL disulfide bonded mutants. The modeling was performed on the entire PE protein, including domains I and III, to check the possible impact of the modifications on interdomain contacts. Figures of structures were produced with the MOLMOL (17Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (29–32): 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar) and POV-Ray (www.povray.org) programs. Materials—Chemicals were obtained from Sigma except for 1,2-dibromostearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, which was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. [35S]Methionine (Trans-label) and 32P-NAD were from MP Biomedicals. Mutagenesis—pET-3d expression vector containing the PE coding sequence behind the pro-OmpA signal sequence was used as template for PCR-based mutagenesis (18Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Haln U. Gene. 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). To construct PE-E359A, PE-E359P, PE-D358G, and PE-D358G,E359A, 5′-mutagenic primers in which GACGAG coding for Asp-358 and Glu-359 was, respectively, changed to GACGCG, GACCCG, GGCGAG, and GGCGCG were used together with a 3′-primer overlapping the PE-BamHI site to prepare a downstream PCR fragment. A 3′-mutagenic primer and a 5′-primer spanning the PE-NcoI site enabled us to obtain the upstream PCR fragment. These overlapping fragments were then joined and amplified by PCR using the outer primers. The resulting NcoI-BamHI fragment was inserted into pET3d-PE for expression. Trp-305 was changed into Ala or Phe by mutating its TGG codon to GCG or TTC, respectively. To obtain PE-S304C,E359C (PE-SL) and PE-G253C,N364C (PE-LL), three mutated fragments were produced and joined using the same strategy, changing the TCT and GAG codon of Ser-304 and Glu-359 to TGT and the GGC and AAC codons of Gly-253 and Asn-364 to TGC. All PCR-amplified DNA fragments were sequenced. Protein Expression and Purification—Escherichia coli BL21 (λDE3) cells carrying the expression plasmid were grown at 37 °C in L-broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (1 mm) was added when A600 reached 0.6; bacteria were harvested 2 h later. The periplasmic fraction prepared by osmotic shock was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (buffer A), applied to a Q-Sepharose column, and eluted with a linear gradient (0–1 m) of NaCl in buffer A. If necessary, the protein was further applied to a Mono-P column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.7 m in buffer A) (19Voulhoux R. Taupiac M.P. Czjzek M. Beaumelle B. Filloux A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Toxin purity was verified on SDS-PAGE and was >90%. Conformation Controls—We performed a number of control studies on the mutants. As shown earlier for deletion mutants (15Taupiac M.P. Bebien M. Alami M. Beaumelle B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), none of the mutations generated for this study in the translocation domain significantly affected the activity of the neighbor domains. This was checked by examining endocytosis and catalytic activity for domains I and III, respectively. We also verified using circular dichroism (15Taupiac M.P. Bebien M. Alami M. Beaumelle B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and gel filtration experiments (19Voulhoux R. Taupiac M.P. Czjzek M. Beaumelle B. Filloux A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that the mutations did not modify the overall structure of the molecule. Moreover, intracellular processing of PE by furin (15Taupiac M.P. Bebien M. Alami M. Beaumelle B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was not affected by the mutations (data not shown). Altogether, these control experiments indicated that the mutations did not induce any long-distance modifications. Preparation of Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUVs)—Mixtures containing 75% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 25% 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1-rac-glycerol) in CHCl3 were dried under a stream of N2 with a TurboVap LV evaporator (Zymark). They were further desiccated under high vacuum for 1 h. The dried lipids were resuspended in 2 mm Tris, pH 7.0, at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml and then sonicated with a microtip sonicator (Branson digital sonifier) at 10% amplitude until optically clear. Brominated vesicles were prepared from mixtures containing 37.5% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 25% 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1-rac-glycerol), and 37.5% 1,2-dibromostearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—A PerkinElmer SS35 spectrofluorometer and semi-micro quartz 500-μl cuvettes were used. Slit widths were 2.5 nm for excitation and 2.5 nm for emission. Fluorescence intensity was measured at 350 nm using excitation at 280 nm. Buffer fluorescence was measured and subtracted. Experiments were performed using 10 μg/ml protein in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Mes at the indicated pH values. SUVs were used at a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. Quencher and SUV concentrations were high enough to produce minimal toxin dilution, which was taken into account for calculation (7Jiang J.X. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8636-8641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Internalization and ADP Ribosylation Assays—Mutant internalization by mouse lymphocytes was assayed as described (6Alami M. Taupiac M.P. Reggio H. Bienvenue A. Beaumelle B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The intracellular pathway of the mutants was studied by immunofluorescence (20Morlon-Guyot J. Helmy M. Lombard-Frasca S. Pignol D. Pieroni G. Beaumelle B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17006-17011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Upon endocytosis by L929 cells, PE and all mutants became concentrated with transferrin in the perinuclear recycling compartment (data not shown), as observed earlier in T-cells (6Alami M. Taupiac M.P. Reggio H. Bienvenue A. Beaumelle B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Endosome Fractionation and Cell-free Assay for PE Translocation— This assay has been described earlier (6Alami M. Taupiac M.P. Reggio H. Bienvenue A. Beaumelle B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Taupiac M.P. Bebien M. Alami M. Beaumelle B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, BW5147 mouse lymphocytes were labeled for 45 min with the 125I-toxin. Endosomes were then purified using a discontinuous sucrose gradient, concentrated, and finally resuspended in translocation buffer containing 10 mm ATP/10 mm MgCl2 and cytosol (∼1 mg of protein/ml) (21Vendeville A. Rayne F. Bonhoure A. Bettache N. Montcourrier P. Beaumelle B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2347-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). After 2 h at 37 °C, translocation was stopped by cooling on ice. Translocated toxin was then separated from endosomes by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose cushion. The supernatant/endosomes cpm ratio was plotted as a function of time. Translocation was linear with time over at least 2 h for all mutants, and the translocation rate was calculated using linear regression analysis (15Taupiac M.P. Bebien M. Alami M. Beaumelle B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity Measurements—L929 cells were seeded into 96-well plates (7,000 cells/well) before adding the toxins. After 24 h at 37 °C, [35S]methionine (500,000 cpm/well) was added, and cells were further incubated for 24 h before lysis in 0.1 m NaOH, collection of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material by filtration, and scintillation counting. Control values and background incorporation were obtained in the absence of toxin and in the presence of 1 mm cycloheximide, respectively. The results are expressed as IC50, which is the toxin concentration resulting in 50% protein synthesis inhibition. Kinetics of Protein Synthesis Inhibition—To monitor the protein synthesis inactivation kinetics, L929 cells were treated with 10 pm toxin, and a 1-h pulse incorporation of [35S]methionine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine was performed at various times after the start of intoxication (20Morlon-Guyot J. Helmy M. Lombard-Frasca S. Pignol D. Pieroni G. Beaumelle B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17006-17011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Translocation activity was calculated as the inverse of t50, which is the time required for 10 pm toxin to inhibit protein synthesis by 50%. We examined the three-dimensional structure of the translocation domain (3Allured V.S. Collier R.J. Carroll S. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) in an attempt to identify the structural basis of the gain in PE translocation activity obtained by deletion of helix F. This helix is extremely short (5 residues) and contains one Glu (Glu-359), three Ala, and one Gly. Glu-359 is hydrogen bonded with the backbone amide proton of Trp-305 (Fig. 1A), but other helix F residues did not appear to be critical for structural stability or interactions. Interestingly, Asp-358 is the N-cap residue of helix F (Fig. 1A) and, as such, likely plays a significant role in stabilizing the very short F α-helix. Molecular models of the DelF mutant were built using the MODELLER program (16Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10649) Google Scholar) and confirmed that helix F removal was unlikely to significantly upset the structure. Structural modifications in all DelF models remained very limited (<0.5 Å) except in the immediate vicinity of the deletion. Accordingly, gel filtration experiments (19Voulhoux R. Taupiac M.P. Czjzek M. Beaumelle B. Filloux A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and circular dichroism measurements (15Taupiac M.P. Bebien M. Alami M. Beaumelle B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) indicated that the PE structure is not significantly affected by excision of helix F. The main finding from the comparison between wild-type PE and the DelF mutant was a clear increase, by about 25 Å2 (Fig. 1B), in the solvent accessibility of the Trp-305 side chain in the DelF mutant and the opening of a possible channel that would allow Trp-305 to move toward the surface of the protein. Indeed, in PE, helix F partially masks the side chain of Trp-305, which is buried within a hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 1, A–C). The helix F deletion resulted in removal of the Glu-359-Trp-305 hydrogen bonding, but structural analysis clearly indicated that the main impact of helix F deletion is an increase in Trp-305 flexibility and solvent accessibility. This modification likely facilitated membrane insertion of this Trp in DelF. We therefore postulated the following scenario for PE membrane insertion. In PE, the low pH sensor that prevents Trp-305 exposure under neutral pH conditions would be Glu-359 and/or Asp-358 residues that H-bond Trp-305 and N-cap helix F, respectively (Fig. 1A). Because helix F is made of 5 residues only, most amide protons are not involved in standard (i,i+4) α-helical H-bonding, and the H-bonding of the amide proton of Gly-361 with the side chain of Asp-358 is likely essential. Because the negative charge of Asp-358 is largely involved in the N-capping stabilizing effect (22Serrano L. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1989; 342: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), its neutralization by lowering the pH would significantly destabilize helix F, in turn triggering Trp-305 side chain exposure, finally leading to insertion into the endosome membrane. This insertion would be a prerequisite for translocation. In this report, we have presented data that validate this model. Mutant Description—Mutating Trp-305 into Phe or Ala decreased PE toxicity by 3- or 13-fold, respectively. These mutants were specifically affected in their translocation activity. Hence, PE-W305F and PE-W305A translocated 30 and 55% less actively than PE, respectively (data not shown). These results demonstrated that Trp-305 is involved in PE translocation activity. Nevertheless, because Trp-305 mutants lack a Trp it was not possible to examine the PE insertion process using a comparative tryptophan fluorescence study of these mutants. Moreover, Trp-305 participates in the hydrophobic core of the molecule. This raises the possibility that the effect of the Trp-305 mutation on PE translocation and toxicity could be indirect, through structure modifications. We therefore prepared for this study mutants that still own Trp-305; to assess whether the side chain of Trp-305 might be involved in membrane interactions, we locked it within its hydrophobic pocket. To this end, we replaced the hydrogen bonding between the Trp-305 backbone and Glu-359 side chain by a disulfide bridge generated by mutating residues 304 and 359 to Cys (Fig. 2A). This PE-304C, 359C, termed PE-SL (for small loop), was used throughout this study as a negative control for membrane insertion. We also prepared a PE with a control disulfide bridge in another part of the molecule. This mutant, PE-253C,364C, termed PE-LL (for large loop), possesses an additional disulfide that links the amino and carboxyl termini of domain II (Fig. 2A). The structural analysis showed that both disulfide bridges could form with minimal modification of the protein structure. This formation was monitored by free thiol determination (not shown) and SDS-PAGE analysis. Additional disulfides generally enhance electrophoretic mobility (23Eppens E.F. Nouwen N. Tommassen J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4295-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); this was the case for both PE-SL and PE-LL under non-reducing conditions, although they migrate at the PE level after disulfide reduction (Fig. 2B). Hence, the introduced Cys generated the expected disulfide. Other mutants were made on Asp-358 and Glu-359 as indicated. We checked that the mutant conformation, endocytosis, furin-mediated processing, intracellular routing, and catalytic activity were not altered (see “Materials and Methods”). F Helix Destabilization Leads to Increased Trp-305 Accessibility at Neutral pH—We first assessed whether helix F destabilization would actually result in increased Trp-305 accessibility. To this end, we used Trp fluorescence quenching by cesium ions (24Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Although PE has 11 Trp, it proved possible to monitor Trp-305 exposure using the entire molecule. Indeed, fluorescence of DelF, and especially of the D358G and D358G,E359A mutants, was up to 50% more sensitive to quenching by Cs+ than PE and mutants with an intact helix F such as E359A (Fig. 3, A and B). Hence, mutants in which helix F was absent (DelF) or destabilized (D358G or D358G,E359A) exposed a tryptophan residue, most likely Trp-305, that is normally buried inside the wild-type toxin. Differences in tryptophan exposure among the mutants were also observed using direct fluorescence measurements and were pH dependent (Fig. 3, C and D). At neutral pH, DelF, D358G, and D358G,E359A showed higher intrinsic fluorescence compared with PE or the E359A mutant. This difference, likely due to the relief of internal quenching, was maximum at pH 7.0 and reached 17% for the most affected mutant (D358G). The gap with PE gradually decreased upon acidification, and all curves were superimposed at pH <5.5. The E359A results indicate that hydrogen binding of Glu-359 with Trp-305 is not essential for restricting solvent accessibility of Trp-305. In contrast, deletion of helix F significantly increased solvent accessibility of Trp-305 at neutral pH, in agreement with DelF molecular modeling. As expected, the D358G mutation yielded results similar to DelF, showing that removal of the helix F N-cap strongly destabilized this helix. These data also suggest that, upon acidification, Trp-305 is gradually exposed to the solvent in native PE. Trp-305 Is a Key Residue Allowing PE Membrane Insertion—To assess the role of Trp-305 in membrane insertion, we monitored the ability of the different mutants to insert into model membranes at acidic pH (pH 5.5). To this end, we used SUVs containing brominated phospholipids that enabled us to quench Trp fluorescence of any membrane-inserted PE (7Jiang J.X. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8636-8641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insertion efficiencies were monitored using the slope of the quenching curve. Consistent with previous findings (7Jiang J.X. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8636-8641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at pH 5.5 PE efficiently inserted within SUVs (Fig. 4, A and B). Mutants in which helix F was destabilized inserted ∼2-fold (DelF), ∼2.5-fold (D358G), and ∼3-fold (D358G,E359A) more quickly than PE. PE-SL inserted ∼2-fold less efficiently than PE into SUVs, whereas the control disulfide in PE-LL had no significant effect on insertion. Hence, introduction of a 304–359 disulfide in PE specifically inhibited membrane penetration, most likely by preventing membrane insertion of Trp-305. Throughout this study, the PE-E359A mutant behaved just like PE, indicating that the PE-D358G and PE-SL phenotypes do not merely result from charge modification. Mutants favoring access of Trp-305 to the outside thus inserted more actively into membranes, whereas locking the Trp-305 side chain into its hydrophobic cavity inhibited insertion. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that Trp-305 exposure is a prerequisite for low pH-induced PE insertion into model membranes and that the Trp-305 side chain is the PE initial membrane anchor. Asp-358 Is the Low pH Sensor Triggering Trp-305 Exposure and PE Membrane Insertion—Because PE penetrates into membranes upon acidification to pH 5.0–5.5 (7Jiang J.X. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8636-8641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Trp-305 insertion should be tightly regulated by pH. In several toxins, such as botulinum toxins, diphtheria toxin, and colicins whose conformation changes in response to low pH, acidic residues were identified as low pH sensors triggering structural modifications (25Lacy D.B. Stevens R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1091-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 26Ren J. Sharpe J.C. Collier R.J. London E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Musse A.A. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24491-24499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We therefore monitored the pH dependence of membrane insertion for all Asp-358/Glu-359 mutants using Trp fluorescence quenching by brominated liposomes. In agreement with previous studies (7Jiang J.X. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8636-8641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PE significantly inserted into brominated SUVs only below pH 5.7–5.5 (Fig. 4C). Nevertheless, mutants in which Asp-358 was replaced by Gly (D358G and D358G,E359A) started inserting themselves into SUVs as soon as the pH dropped to 6.8. At pH 6.6, for these mutants 20–25% of the molecules inserted relative to the maximum insertion, which was observed at pH 5.0. Hence, a low pH sensor was almost entirely lost upon the D358G mutation, which enabled significant insertion at pH <6.8 instead of pH <5.7. These values are within the pH range of the endocytic pathway (28Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and this ∼1.1-pH unit difference will have strong biological implications (see below). We concluded that Asp-358 is the low pH sensor that triggers helix F collapse at acidic pH, thereby enabling the Trp-305 exposure required to initiate PE membrane insertion.

The cognate t- and v-SNARE pair forms a stable helical complex composed of four helices (three from the t-SNARE and one from the v-SNARE). Each of the four helices comes from a different subfamily: the Syntaxins, the Bet1 group, the Bos1 group, and the R-SNAREs (6Pelham H. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 99-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Upon assembly, all membrane anchors of the helical bundle are at one end and the N-terminal domains at the other end (7Sutton R. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar, 8Antonin W. Fasshauer D. Becker S. Jahn R. Schneider T.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The largely unstructured monomers undergo a conformational change during SNARE assembly, which releases enough free energy to overcome the repulsive forces of the opposed membranes, and leads to lipid mixing (9Weber T. Zemelman B. McNew J. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Söllner T. Rothman T. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). After fusion, the ATPase NSF and α-SNAP disassemble SNARE complexes, and monomers are recycled (10Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). The finding that SNAREs constitute the core fusion machinery and are sufficient for membrane fusion raises the question of how they are regulated. Many SNAREs, in particular the Syntaxin heavy chains, possess N-terminal extensions, which can independently fold and are able to modulate SNARE activity. The neuronal Syntaxin1, as well as Sso1p (yeast homolog of Syntaxin1) and Syntaxin7 (late endocytic mammalian Syntaxin), adopt a “closed” conformation. In this case, their N-terminal domain, structured in a three-helix bundle, is able to interact with the SNARE motif, generating the so-called closed conformation. This interaction blocks the binding of the light chains and inhibits the t-SNARE complex formation (11Fernandez I. Ubach J. Dulubova I. Zhang X. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J.

McNew J.A. Westermann B. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The Syntaxin Vam3p on the other hand, uses a different mechanism. In the yeast vacuole, the three-helix bundle of Vam3p-N-terminal domain does not interact intramolecularly with the SNARE motif (17Dulubova I. Yamaguchi T. Wang Y. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the removal of this N-terminal domain influences the SNARE complex assembly (18Laage R. Ungermann C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3375-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the mechanisms differ (closed or opened Syntaxins), all heavy chain N-terminal domains tested act by reducing t-SNARE assembly (11Fernandez I. Ubach J. Dulubova I. Zhang X.

The light chains also have N-terminal domains, but their role is less clear. Neither appears to adopt a closed intra-molecular conformation nor does their N-terminal domain seem to influence the rate of the t-SNARE complex formation (15Antonin W. Dulubova I. Arac D. Pabst S.

Previously, we characterized two yeast endocytic complexes, the early endosome/trans-Golgi network complex [Tlg2p/Tlg1p,Vti1p] and the late endocytic complex [Pep12p/Tlg1p,Vti1p], both fusing with Snc2p v-SNARE although very slowly in vitro (4Paumet F.

Plasmid Constructs—The coding sequences of the mammalian SNAREs were cloned as following: hSyntaxin7 was amplified by PCR using the primers FO50 (GGGCATATCCATATGTCTTACACTCCAGGAGTTGGT) and FO51 (GCGAATTCTCAGTGGTTCAATCCCCAAA), hSyntaxin8 using FO61 (GGGCATATCCATATGGCCCCGGACCCCTGGTTC) and FO62 (GCGAATTCTCAGTTGGTCGGCCAGACTGC), mVti1b using FO58 (GGGCATATCCATATGGCCGCCTCCGCCGCCTCC) and FO59 (GCGAATTCTCAATGGTGTCGAAAGAATTT), and hVAMP8 using FO108 (GGGCATATCCATATGGAGGAAGCCAGTGAAGGT) and FO109 (TTTGAATTCTTAAGAGAAGGCACCAGTGGCAAAGAGCACAATGAAGAGGATGATGATAAAAAC). The cytosolic form of hVAMP8 (hVAMP8-ΔTMD) was amplified with FO108 and FO109 (GCGAATTCTCACTTCACGTTCTTCCACCAGAA). All PCR products were digested with NdeI and EcoRI and ligated in myc-pGEX-2T (modified from Amersham Biosciences) resulting, respectively, in FD132 (GST-myc-hSyn7), FD134 (GST-myc-hSyn8), FD120 (GST-myc-mVti1b), FD136 (GST-myc-hVAMP8), and FD196 (GST-hVAMP8-ΔTMD).

The DNA products of Tlg2*, Tlg1*, and Pep12* were digested by NdeI/BamH1 and Vti1* by EcoRI/BamHI. All of them were cloned in pET28a vector resulting in FD97 for His-Tlg2*, FD100 for His-Tlg1*, FD184 for His-Vti1*, and FD197 for His-Pep12*. The chimeric forms of the Tlg1/Syn8 SNARE motif were generated as follows: each fragment was amplified by PCR with FO38 (GGGAATTCCATATGGCTGAGAACAATGATGGT) and FO76 (CCGGAATTCATCCCCCATTGTTTGAGC) to generate N-Tlg1, FO77 (CCGGAATTCGAGAACCAGGGACAATTG) and FO78 (ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTCAAGCAATGAATGCCAA) to generate C-Tlg1, FO63 (GGGCATATCCATATGTTGGGTTTTGATGAAATCCGG) and FO79 (CCGGAATTCATTCCCAATTTCCTGCCC) to generate N-Syn8, and FO80 (CCGGAATTCGATGAACAAAATGAGATA) and FO81 (ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTCAGTTGGTCGGCCAGAC) to generate C-Syn8. These fragments were thus digested with NdeI/EcoRI or NdeI/NotI and ligated: N-Tlg1 with C-Syn8 to generate T1-S8, N-Tlg1 with C-Tlg1 to generate T1-T1, N-Syn8 with C-Tlg1 to generate S8-T1, and N-Syn8 with C-Syn8 to generate S8-S8. All of them were cloned in pGEX-2T resulting in FD161 for T1-T1, FD162 for T1-S8, FD163 for S8-T1, and FD164 for S8-S8. The coding sequence of Vti1p was obtained as described (21Fukuda R. McNew J.A.

The data were converted to rounds of fusion as described (16Parlati F. Weber T. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Note that the small decrease observed during the first 10 min of each fusion reaction is due to the temperature equilibration of the fluorophore. The N-terminal Domains of the t-SNARE Constitute a Potential Regulatory Switch—Both yeast endocytic t-SNAREs, [Tlg2p/Tlg1p,Vti1p] and [Pep12p/Tlg1p,Vti1p], must be activated to promote fusion of liposomes (4Paumet F. Brugger B. Parlati F. McNew J.A. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Paumet F. Rahimian V. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3376-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This distinguishes them from all other fusogenic SNAREs tested. In vitro, this activation is provided artificially by a peptide (Snc2-C-pept) corresponding to the C-terminal part of the v-SNARE helical motif (4Paumet F. Brugger B. Parlati F. McNew J.A. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that such peptides are able to bind and restructure t-SNARE complexes (23Melia T.J. Weber T. McNew J.A. Fisher L.E. Johnston R.J. Parlati F. Mahal L.K. Sollner T. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The heavy chain, as well as both light chains of each endocytic t-SNARE, contributes a large N-terminal domain. These N-terminal extensions are neither homologous to each other nor to other SNAREs. To study their influence on fusion, we generated t-SNARE constructs in which one or more of these N-terminal domains could be removed by thrombin cleavage. First, the individual role of each t-SNARE N-terminal extension was investigated by including only one cleavable t-SNARE subunit per t-SNARE complex. We reconstituted in acceptor liposomes all possible combinations of both endocytic complexes: [Tlg2*/Tlg1,Vti1], [Tlg2/Tlg1*,Vti1], and [Tlg2/Tlg1,Vti1*] or [Pep12*/Tlg1,Vti1], [Pep12/Tlg1*,Vti1], and [Pep12/Tlg1,Vti1*] (asterisk identifies the thrombin-cleavable protein). All combinations were systematically tested for fusion with Snc2p donor liposomes, in the presence or in the absence of the Snc2-C-pept, both before (black curves) or after (red curves) thrombin cleavage (Fig. 1). As expected, thrombin itself does not affect fusion (Fig. 1A). We observed that the presence of the N-terminal domain of both Syntaxins Tlg2p-(36–191) and Pep12p-(1–188) reduced the fusion rate (Fig. 1B). The results observed for both endocytic complexes are consistent with those previously obtained for Syntaxin 1 (16Parlati F. Weber T. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and extend the potential regulatory role of the heavy chain N-terminal domain. Interestingly, the removal of the N-terminal domain of each light chain, Tlg1p-(1–117) and Vti1p-(1–118), increases the fusion kinetic as well (Fig. 1C). However, it is still necessary to activate the t-SNARE complexes with Snc2-C-pept to promote fusion. To investigate the interplay of the three N-terminal domains, we modulated the composition of the t-SNARE complex in the acceptor liposomes by including two or three cleavable proteins, thus generating: [Tlg2*/Tlg1*,Vti1], [Tlg2*/Tlg1,Vti1*], [Tlg2/Tlg1*,Vti1*], and [Tlg2*/Tlg1*,Vti1*] or [Pep12*/Tlg1*,Vti1], [Pep12*/Tlg1,Vti1*], [Pep12/Tlg1*,Vti1*], and [Pep12*/Tlg1*,Vti1*]. We observed that the kinetic control exerted by the N-terminal domains is additive (Fig. 2). The removal of two N-terminal domains out of three increases the fusion rate compared with the removal of only one (Fig. 2A). The most dramatic effect occurs when all three N-terminal domains are cleaved off (Fig. 2B) resulting in an average of 5-fold (for Tlg2 complex) or 2.5-fold (for Pep12 complex) increase in the extent of fusion. In conclusion, the combination of the t-SNARE N-terminal domains represents a potential molecular switch for controlling the kinetic of fusion. In Yeast, the Light Chain SNARE Motif Contributes to a Second Potential Regulatory Switch—Even when the inhibition created by the combined effect of the yeast t-SNARE N-terminal domains is removed, the rate of fusion in the absence of peptide activation is still very low (Fig. 2B). Thus an additional inhibitory element may be involved. To determine whether this second element is specific for yeast or is instead a general feature of endocytic SNAREs, we investigated the fusion capacity of a corresponding mammalian late endocytic complex (8Antonin W. Fasshauer D. Becker S. Jahn R. Schneider T.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 24Antonin W. Holroyd C. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6453-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We reconstituted the t-SNARE [Syntaxin7/Syntaxin8,Vti1b] into acceptor liposomes and the v-SNARE VAMP8 into donor liposomes and tested the fusion efficiency of this complex with or without VAMP8-C-pept. As shown in Fig. 3, these liposomes now fuse efficiently without any added activator, although the peptide still increases the fusion rate. Thus mammalian and yeast complexes have different inherent fusogenicities. Combined with the results presented above, we assumed that the additional inhibition of the yeast complexes arises from an element located in the SNARE motif. Mixing experiments were conducted to locate this switch. Both the yeast [Pep12p/Tlg1p,Vti1p] and the mammalian [Syntaxin7/Syntaxin8,Vti1b] t-SNAREs are necessary for fusion at the late endosome (25Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 26Mullock B.M. Smith C.W. Ihrke G. Bright N.A. Lindsay M. Parkinson E.J. Brooks D.A. Parton R.G. James D.E. Luzio J.P. Piper R.C.

In addition, Syntaxin7 can complement yeast Pep12p mutants defective in fusion to the prevacuolar compartment (28Nakamura N. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), showing their homology. We tested whether various yeast/mammalian mixed complexes were fusogenic, the hypothesis being that if the yeast proteins carry a regulatory element in their sequence, replacing it with the mammalian homolog will release the negative regulation. We reconstituted the different t-SNARE yeast/mammal combinations into acceptor liposomes (Fig. 4) and tested their fusion capacity in the presence or absence of Snc2-C-pept. Exchanging Tlg1p with its mammalian homolog Syntaxin8 released the blockage. In this situation, the complex [Pep12p/ Syn8,Vti1p] becomes fusogenic without activation with Snc2-C-pept. When replacing both yeast light chains Tlg1p and Vti1p with their mammalian counterparts Syn8 and Vti1b, the resulting t-SNARE [Pep12p/Syn8,Vti1b] is even more fusogenic, suggesting a synergistic effect of both light chains for fusion. We also observe that Snc2p (Fig. 4A) and VAMP8 (Fig. 4B) can functionally replace each other. Altogether, these results suggest that within a given cellular pathway, variations in SNARE autoregulation may be specifically encoded within the light chains of the t-SNARE. The Autoregulation of Tlg1p Is Encoded in the N-terminal Half of Its SNARE Motif—The SNARE motif is in average 60 amino acids long and is organized in ∼16 layers based on its helical structure with the zero layer determining the center of the SNARE motif (7Sutton R. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar, 8Antonin W. Fasshauer D. Becker S. Jahn R. Schneider T.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To identify the region responsible for the slow kinetics in yeast, we created chimeric constructs between the Syntaxin8 and the Tlg1p SNARE motif. In these constructs, the Tlg1p N-terminal part of the SNARE motif (from layers –9 to 0) was joined to the Syntaxin8 C-terminal part of the SNARE motif (from layers 0 to +9) resulting in T1-S8 protein and vice versa (resulting in S8-T1 protein). Tlg1p (T1-T1) and Syntaxin8 controls (S8-S8) were constructed using the same cloning strategy. Each of these constructs is shown in Fig. 5A. These chimeras were expressed as GST-recombinant proteins and reconstituted into donor liposomes together with the truncated forms of Pep12p and Vti1p. While both controls (T1-T1 and S8-S8) retain their fusogenic properties (Fig. 5, B and C, respectively), the chimera T1-S8 requires activation by a peptide (VAMP8-C-pept) for fusion (Fig. 5D). The chimera S8-T1, on the other hand, does not require peptide activation for fusion (Fig. 5E). We note that when C-Syn8 replaces C-Tlg1p, Snc2-C-pept does not activate the complex anymore (Fig. 5D). This effect may have different causes: either Snc2-C-pept is simply unable to bind the C-terminal part of Syn8, or Snc2-C-pept can still bind but is unable to activate the complex, suggesting in this case that an adequate cognate structure on C terminus is necessary for releasing the N-terminal switch. At this point of the study, we are unable to discriminate between both possibilities. Altogether, this demonstrates that a second switch region is buried in the Tlg1p SNARE motif and is restricted to its N-terminal portion (between the layers –9 and 0). This study suggests that SNAREs possess multiple distinct autoregulatory switches situated in different regions of the t-SNARE complex. These elements can be combined in particular t-SNAREs (yeast versus mammalian endocytic complexes), providing the SNARE system with functional flexibility to answer to the specific needs of different transports pathways in different cells. The first switch is provided by the combination of the three t-SNARE N-terminal domains. While an autoregulatory role for syntaxin N-terminal domain is well known (16Parlati F. Weber T. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and now includes Tlg2p and Pep12p, the role of the light chain N-terminal domains has been unclear. The light chain N-terminal domains do not interact intramolecularly with the SNARE motif and have no influence on the t-SNARE complex formation in solution (15Antonin W. Dulubova I. Arac D. Pabst S. Plitzner J. Rizo J. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36449-36456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Misura K.M.S. Bock J.B. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9184-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that the N-terminal domains of the yeast endocytic light chains can additively control the kinetics of fusion. A second potential switch is buried in the SNARE motif of the yeast light chain Tlg1p. This regulation seems to be absent from a mammalian homolog. Possibly, the tighter autoregulation in yeast relates to the multiple roles for the endocytic v-SNARE, Snc2p. Not only do both endocytic complexes share this v-SNARE with each other, they also share it with the exocytic complex [Sso1p/Sec9p] (29Gurunathan S. Chapman-Shimshoni D. Trajkovic S. Gerst J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3629-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By contrast, in mammals there are several distinct VAMPs which are further functionally specialized (30Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that although the C-peptide binds the C-terminal part of the SNARE motif, it releases a regulatory element located within the N-terminal half. t-SNARE complexes are partially assembled across the most N-terminal portions of the SNARE domain (23Melia T.J. Weber T. McNew J.A. Fisher L.E. Johnston R.J. Parlati F. Mahal L.K. Sollner T. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 31Fiebig K.M. Rice L.M. Pollock R. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). By using a peptide homologous to snc2-C-pept, our group showed previously that VAMP2-C-pept binds and structures the C-terminal part of the t-SNARE complex (called the tc-fusion switch), consequently increasing the fusion rate (23Melia T.J. Weber T. McNew J.A. Fisher L.E. Johnston R.J. Parlati F. Mahal L.K. Sollner T. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In particular, Melia et al. (23Melia T.J. Weber T. McNew J.A. Fisher L.E. Johnston R.J. Parlati F. Mahal L.K. Sollner T. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) observed that when the v-SNARE C-peptide is bound, t-SNARE becomes as resistant to proteolysis as when the entire soluble VAMP2 is bound, suggesting that structuring the C-terminal half is sufficient to induce complete coiled-coil formation across the SNARE bundle. Although we cannot pin-point the site of regulation for the second potential switch in the endocytic complexes, it seems likely that the N-terminal region is refolded in response to Snc2-C-pept binding. When N-Syn8 replaces N-Tlg1p and therefore compensates the N-terminal switch, peptides still have an activation effect on fusion (Fig. 5E). In this case, the peptides are still acting on the tc-fusion switch. In conclusion there are multiple autoregulatory switches engulfed into t-SNAREs. These switches are presumably governed by additional cellular regulatory mechanisms, which could be protein or lipids. One candidate regulator for the yeast endocytic complex is the GARP (Golgi-associated retrograde proteins) multisubunit tethering complex. This complex, together with Vps52p and Vps53p, is required for retrograde transport to the late Golgi. It has been shown recently that two members of this complex, Vps51p and Vps54p, interact directly with the N-terminal domain of Tlg1p (32Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 33Conibear E. Cleck J.N. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1610-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). An attractive model is that the binding of Vps51p/Vps54p to Tlg1p stabilizes the N-terminal region of the SNARE motif and releases the SNARE complex to promote fusion. We thank Thomas J. Melia, Peter Antinozzi, and Thalia Becker for their comments and help as well as for the critical reading of the manuscript."

During this long-distance transport, several physical barriers must be traversed: the bacterial cell wall, the host extracellular matrix layer (e.g. plant cell wall or animal mucous layer/glycocalyx), and the host plasma membrane.

A. 2001; 98: 11638-11643Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The EspA filament is 12 nm in diameter and can be several micrometers long (13Knutton S. Rosenshine I. Pallen M.J. Nisan I.

The TTSS of plant pathogenic bacteria assembles an extracellular appendage called the Hrp pilus, which is 6–8 nm wide and several micrometers long (15Roine E. Wei W. Yuan J. Nurmiaho-Lassila E.-L.

The needle, EspA filament, and Hrp pilus are believed to be tunnels linking the type III “secreton” embedded in the bacterial cell wall and a type III “translocon” in the host plasma membrane. The secreton allows the exit of effector proteins across the bacterial cell wall, which can be studied in culture as a separate step, whereas the translocon allows the translocation of effectors into the host cell. In vivo, type III secretion/translocation likely occurs as a continuous process through the secreton, the needle/EspA filament/Hrp pilus, and the translocon.The structural subunits of Hrp pili in Pst strain DC3000 and Ralstonia solanacearum are HrpA and HrpY proteins, respectively (15Roine E. Wei W. Yuan J. Nurmiaho-Lassila E.-L. Kalkkinen N. Romantschuk M. He S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3459-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 17Van Gijsegem F. Vasse J. Camus J. Marenda M. Boucher C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The hrpA and hrpY genes are required for bacterial causation of TTSS-associated host responses: disease in susceptible plants and the hypersensitive response (HR) in resistant plants (15Roine E. Wei W. Yuan J. Nurmiaho-Lassila E.-L. Kalkkinen N. Romantschuk M. He S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3459-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 17Van Gijsegem F. Vasse J. Camus J. Marenda M. Boucher C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A comprehensive mutational study of type III secretion (hrp) genes in R. solanacearum showed a close correlation between Hrp pilus assembly, type III protein secretion, and bacterial elicitation of TTSS-associated plant responses (20Van Gijsegem F. Vasse J. De Rycke R. Castello P. Boucher C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Microscopic studies show that newly secreted effector proteins are localized near the tip of the Hrp pilus, suggesting that the Hrp pilus serves as a conduit for long-distance transport of effector proteins in the extracellular space (21Jin Q. He S.Y. Science. 2001; 294: 2556-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 22Li C.M. Brown I. Mansfield J. Stevens C. Boureau T. Romantschuk M. Taira S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1909-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Little is known about the molecular details of subunit-subunit interactions during the assembly of TTSS needle/pilus or the exact mechanisms by which these filaments function in long-distance protein transport. Dominant-negative mutants are powerful tools for understanding the structure, assembly, and function of protein complexes in biological systems. We focused this study on the identification and characterization of dominant-negative mutants of HrpA. We reasoned that identification and characterization of dominant-negative mutants of HrpA will not only improve our understanding of HrpA function in pilus assembly and type III protein transport but also create an opportunity for determination of the HrpA tertiary structure. Currently, no high-resolution x-ray crystal structure of a type III conduit protein in the final conformation has been reported. This is likely due to the technical problem that these proteins preferentially form multimeric superstructures rather than three-dimensional crystals. We reasoned that a subset of dominant-negative mutant HrpA monomers may be partially defective in assembly and may more readily crystallize.In a previous study, Taira et al. (23Taira S. Jarno T. Elina R. Eeva-Liisa N.-L. Harri S. Martin R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) created a comprehensive set of pentapeptide insertions in the Pst DC3000 HrpA protein and identified 21 nonfunctional HrpA mutants with insertions located in the C-terminal half of the HrpA protein. These mutant HrpA proteins could not complement a Pst DC3000 hrpA mutant for either production of the extracellular Hrp pilus or elicitation of plant responses. In another study, Wei et al. (24Wei W. Plovanich-Jones A. Deng W.-L. Collmer A. Huang H.-C. He S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2247-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) reported several nonfunctional HrpA proteins caused by single amino acid mutations. The biochemical defects of all these mutant HrpA proteins are not understood. In this study, we found that several pentapeptide-induced nonfunctional HrpA proteins, when expressed from a plasmid, exerted a strong dominant-negative effect on the function of the wild-type HrpA protein in vitro and in vivo. A detailed analysis of these dominant-negative HrpA mutants led to the identification of several specific regions within the HrpA protein that differentially affect the ability of wild-type Pst DC3000 to elicit TTSS-associated plant responses, assemble/stabilize the extracellular pilus, and/or secrete effector proteins across the bacterial cell wall in culture.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The Pst strain used in this research was DC3000. pHRPA derivatives carrying single amino acid mutations were reported previously (24Wei W. Plovanich-Jones A. Deng W.-L. Collmer A. Huang H.-C. He S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2247-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The hrpA plasmids carrying random 15-bp insertions were kindly provided by Dr. Suvi Taira (23Taira S. Jarno T. Elina R. Eeva-Liisa N.-L. Harri S. Martin R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The hrpA gene inserts in the latter hrpA plasmids were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides ATATAGGATCCTGCAAAGACGCTGGAACC (EcoRI is underlined) and ATATAGAATTCGGGGTACCTCCTCAAGGTAGCGGCCCCCTC (BamHI is underlined) and cloned into pUCP19 (25Schweizer H.P. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 97: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were introduced into Pst DC3000 by electroporation. The truncated avrRpt280–255 gene (26Mudgett M.B. Chesnokova O. Dahlbeck D. Clark E.T. Rossier O. Bonas U. Staskawicz B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13324-13329Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) was cloned into the XbaI-HindIII site of pUCP19. The hrpA gene was amplified by PCR using primers TGAATTCTTGCAAAGACGCTGGAACCG (EcoRI site is underlined) and AATCTAGAGTAACTGATACCTTTAGCG (XbaI site is underlined) and fused to the 5′ end of avrRpt280–255.The bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 30 °C or in hrp-inducing fructose minimal media (MM) (28Huynh T.V. Dahlbeck D. Staskawicz B.J. Science. 1989; 245: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) at 20 °C. Antibiotics used were rifampicin (50 μg/ml) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml).Hypersensitive Response and Disease Assay—Bacteria were grown to an A600 of ∼0.6 in LB media. Bacteria were pelleted and then resuspended in sterilized distilled water to an A600 of 0.2 (∼1 × 108 cfu/ml; for HR assay) or 0.002 (∼1 × 106 cfu/ml; for disease assay). Bacterial suspensions were infiltrated into fully expanded leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Samsun NN) or Arabidopsis thaliana (accession Col-0) using a sterile, needleless plastic syringe. The HR symptom in tobacco leaves, characterized by tissue collapse in the infiltrated area, was observed 20 h after inoculation. Disease necrosis in Arabidopsis leaves was monitored over a 4-day period.Assay for Secretion of Effector Proteins in Culture—Bacteria were grown in LB broth until A600 = 0.6 and collected by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in hrp-inducing MM or LB and incubated with shaking at 20 °C for 12 h. Cultures were separated into cell and supernatant fractions by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. The cell and supernatant fractions were concentrated 5 and 50 times, respectively. The proteins in these fractions were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gels (29Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205955) Google Scholar) and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.). Immunoblot was performed with primary antibodies against HrpA, AvrPto, HopPtoM, or ShcM and a secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Sigma).Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopic Analyses—The methods for both electron microscopic analyses were essentially the same as those described by Flegler et al. (30Flegler S.L. Heckman J.W. Klomparens K.L. Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy: An Introduction. Oxford Press, Oxford1993: 43-168Google Scholar), except for a few modifications. Briefly, scanning electron microscopy was performed on bacterial cells grown on carbon/formvar-coated nickel grids (300 mesh). A 10-μl droplet of bacterial suspension, adjusted to an A600 of 0.1 in hrp-inducing MM, was placed on a grid and incubated at 20 °C for 14 h. Bacteria were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and dehydrated in a series (25%, 50%, 75%, and 95%) of ethanol, critical-point dried using liquid as the transitional fluid, and sputter coated with gold (∼7 nm thick). At each step, the bacteria were treated as gently as possible to preserve the integrity of surface structures. The mounted bacteria were viewed with a JEOL 6300F scanning electron microscope. Images were captured and stored electronically.For examination of self-assembly of purified HrpA proteins into pilus-like structures, the pH of the HrpA solution (pH 5.0) was raised to 7.8 by adding 0.1 volume of 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0; filtered). After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, a 10-μl drop of the sample was applied to a grid. Three minutes later, excess sample was removed using a piece of filter paper. The grid was dried in a fume hood for 5 min, stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid (pH 6.5), air-dried again, and examined using a JEOL 100-CEX transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV (18Jin Q. Hu W. Brown I. McGhee G. Hart P. McGhee G. Hart P. Jones A.L. He S.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1129-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of a mutant HrpA protein on the self-assembly of the wild-type HrpA protein, we mixed one part of wild-type HrpA protein with one part of the same concentration (∼2 mg/ml) or 10-, 25-, or 50-fold diluted mutant HrpA protein. The mixtures were treated as described above and examined with a transmission electron microscope.Overproduction and Purification of HrpA Protein—Wild-type and mutant hrpA genes were amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-GGA ATTCATATGGTCGCATTTGCAGGAT-3′ and 5′-GGGTAACGCCAGGGTTTT-3′ and cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of pET28a (Novagen). HrpA proteins with the N-terminal His6 tag were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified using an NTA column (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The elution buffer contained 50 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. The HrpA protein preparations were concentrated using Amicon concentrators (molecular weight cutoff of 3000 daltons) to ∼2 mg/ml. The N-terminal His6 tag was removed using the thrombin cleavage capture kit (Novagen). The resulting HrpA protein solutions were stored in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0).RESULTSDominant-negative Effect of HrpA-AvrRpt280–255 on Pst DC3000—In a previous study (31Zwiesler-Vollick J. Plovanich-Jones A. Nomura K. Bandyopadhyay S. Joardar V. Kunkel B.N. He S.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we attempted to identify new type III effector genes in Pst DC3000 using the type III translocation reporter AvrRpt280–255 (26Mudgett M.B. Chesnokova O. Dahlbeck D. Clark E.T. Rossier O. Bonas U. Staskawicz B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13324-13329Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 32Guttman D.S. Greenberg J.T. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As expected, DC3000(pAVRPTO-AVRRPT280–255) caused RPS2-dependent HR, suggesting that this effector is translocated into the Arabidopsis cell (30Flegler S.L. Heckman J.W. Klomparens K.L. Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy: An Introduction. Oxford Press, Oxford1993: 43-168Google Scholar). However, Pst DC3000(pHRPA-AVRRPT2) gave an unexpected result. Not only was there no RPS2-dependent HR (data not shown), but this strain also did not give an HR in the nonhost tobacco, nor did it cause disease in the host Arabidopsis (Fig. 1A). In these experiments, all fusion proteins were expressed from plasmid pUCP19 (33Keen N.T. Tamaki S. Kobayashi D. Trollinger D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar).To determine whether the negative effect of the HrpA-AvrRpt280–255 fusion on the ability of DC3000 to elicit host responses was caused by an overexpression of HrpA from pUCP18/19, we analyzed pHRPA, which expresses only HrpA from pUCP18 (15Roine E. Wei W. Yuan J. Nurmiaho-Lassila E.-L. Kalkkinen N. Romantschuk M. He S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3459-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 24Wei W. Plovanich-Jones A. Deng W.-L. Collmer A. Huang H.-C. He S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2247-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast to pHRPA-AVRRPT280–255, pHRPA did not have a dominant-negative effect on the ability of DC3000 to elicit the HR or to cause disease (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, none of the other type III effector-AvrRpt280–255 fusions we made in pUCP18 had a negative effect on the ability of DC3000 to elicit host responses (30Flegler S.L. Heckman J.W. Klomparens K.L. Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy: An Introduction. Oxford Press, Oxford1993: 43-168Google Scholar, 34Badel J.L. Nomura K. Bandyopadhyay S. Shimizu R. Collmer A. He S.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1239-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that a negative effect on the ability of DC3000 to carry out TTSS-associated functions is unique to the fusion between AvrRpt2 and HrpA, even though both proteins are normal TTSS substrates.To determine the molecular basis of the effect of the addition of AvrRpt280–255 to the C terminus of HrpA, we examined the secretion of TTSS substrates across the bacterial cell wall in culture. Three substrates were monitored: HrpA, HopPtoM (34Badel J.L. Nomura K. Bandyopadhyay S. Shimizu R. Collmer A. He S.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1239-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and AvrPto (24Wei W. Plovanich-Jones A. Deng W.-L. Collmer A. Huang H.-C. He S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2247-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We found that none of these three TTSS substrates was detectable in the culture medium of Pst DC3000(pHRPA-AVRRPT280–255), whereas wild-type DC3000 and DC3000 carrying pUCP18 (the vector control) or pHRPA secreted all three proteins (Fig. 1B). In DC3000(pHRPAAVRRPT280–255), the HrpA-AvrRpt2 fusion itself was detected in the cell but was not secreted to the medium (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the dominant-negative effect of the HrpA-AvrRpt280–255 fusion results from HrpA-AvrRpt280–255-mediated poisoning of the secreton structure and blockage of the exit of TTSS substrates across the bacterial cell wall. Thus, addition of a normal TTSS substrate protein, AvrRpt2, to the C terminus of HrpA causes a dominant-negative effect on the function of the TTSS.Identification of HrpA Mutants that Exhibit Dominant-negative Effects—To determine whether mutations within the HrpA protein could also produce dominant-negative derivatives, we used the elicitation of the HR in the nonhost tobacco as a rapid method of screening of the 3 previously reported mutant HrpA proteins carrying single amino acid mutations (24Wei W. Plovanich-Jones A. Deng W.-L. Collmer A. Huang H.-C. He S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2247-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and 21 mutant HrpA proteins carrying random pentapeptide insertions (23Taira S. Jarno T. Elina R. Eeva-Liisa N.-L. Harri S. Martin R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). DC3000, DC3000(pUCP18), and DC3000(pHRPA) were used as positive controls in this screen. All three positive control strains elicited a robust HR in tobacco leaves (Fig. 2A). In contrast, 11 nonfunctional HrpA proteins carrying pentapeptide insertion F1, F2, F4, F5, F6, F9, F12, F13, F18, F19, or F20 (insertion 203, 204, 287, 211, 213, 379, 246, 248, 272, 288, and 289, respectively, in Ref. 23Taira S. Jarno T. Elina R. Eeva-Liisa N.-L. Harri S. Martin R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) exerted a strong dominant-negative effect, preventing DC3000 from eliciting an HR (Fig. 2). Three nonfunctional HrpA proteins containing single amino acid mutations and six nonfunctional HrpA proteins carrying pentapeptide insertion F7, F8, F10, F11, F16, or F17 (insertion 224, 239, 234, 245, 260, and 268, respectively, in Ref. 23Taira S. Jarno T. Elina R. Eeva-Liisa N.-L. Harri S. Martin R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) had no dominant-negative effect (Fig. 2B). Four nonfunctional HrpA proteins carrying insertion F3, F14, F15, or F22 (insertion 208, 254, 258, and 378, respectively, in Ref. 23Taira S. Jarno T. Elina R. Eeva-Liisa N.-L. Harri S. Martin R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) gave an intermediate dominant-negative effect. According to the HR phenotype, we grouped the analyzed non-functional HrpA proteins into class I (F1, F2, F4, F5, F6, F9, F12, F13, F18, F19, and F20), class II (F7, F8, F10, F11, F16, and F17), and class III (F3, F14, F15, and F22). Class III mutants were not studied further because of the significant variability in the HR phenotype in different experiments.Fig. 2Dominant-negative effects of pHRPA derivatives carrying pentapeptide insertions on the ability of Pst DC3000 to cause the HR in non-host tobacco and/or disease in host Arabidopsis leaves. A, Pst DC3000 (-) or Pst DC3000 carrying pHRPA-F4, -F5, -F6, -F7, -F8, or -F9 was infiltrated into tobacco or Arabidopsis leaves. The HR and disease assay conditions were identical to those described in Fig. 1A. B, a diagram of the C-terminal portion (nucleotides 241–436, amino acid residues 50–113) of HrpA (adapted from Taira et al., Ref. 23Taira S. Jarno T. Elina R. Eeva-Liisa N.-L. Harri S. Martin R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The 21 pentapeptide insertions (F1–F20 and F22) are indicated by different symbols based on their dominant-negative phenotypes: ▵, dominant-negative mutants that block Pst DC3000 to cause the HR and disease but allow effector secretion in culture; □, mutants that have inconsistent dominant-negative phenotypes; ○, mutants that do not have a dominant-negative phenotype; and ⋄, mutants that block Pst DC3000 to cause the HR and disease and to secrete effector proteins in culture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dominant-negative Effect on the Secretion of HrpA and Effector Proteins in Culture—To determine whether the dominant-negative pentapeptide insertional HrpA mutants, like pHRPA-AVRRPT280–255, also poison the secreton function, we examined the secretion of HrpA, AvrPto, and HopPtoM in culture. The three proteins were produced in similar amounts in DC3000 and in DC3000 carrying the mutant hrpA plasmids (Fig. 3), suggesting that the dominant-negative effect was not exerted at the gene expression level. DC3000 containing class II mutants (e.g. F7) secreted HrpA, AvrPto, and HopPtoM normally to the outside of the cell (Fig. 3). However, DC3000 containing pHRPA-AVRRPT280–255 or some of the class I mutants (e.g. F4) secreted much reduced levels of HrpA and no detectable AvrPto and HopPtoM, whereas DC3000 containing other class I mutants (e.g. F5) secreted all three proteins. There was a tight correlation between secretion of HrpA and effector proteins AvrPto and HopPtoM; however, the dominant-negative effect on the secretion of AvrPto and HopPtoM seemed more severe than that on the secretion of HrpA. The cytoplasmic marker protein ShcM was detected only in the cell fraction, indicating no nonspecific leakage in these experiments (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results suggest that the dominant-negative effect of seven class I mutants (F2, F4, F6, F13, F18, F19, and F20; henceforth designated class IA), like pHRPA-AVRRPT280–255, can be attributed to the poisoning of the secreton structure in the bacterial cell wall. However, the dominant-negative effect of four class I mutants (F1, F5, F9, and F12; henceforth designated class IB) on HR elicitation cannot be explained by poisoning of the secreton structure.Fig. 3Immunoblot analysis of the effects of HrpA mutants on the ability of DC3000 to produce and/or secrete effector proteins in culture. Conditions for bacterial growth and immunoblotting were identical to those described in Fig. 1B. The cytosolic chaperone ShcM was used as a cytoplasmic protein control. All HrpA mutants were examined. Results from representative strains are shown here. In the cell fractions of the AvrPto and HopPtoM blots, arrows indicate AvrPto and HopPtoM, to distinguish them from cross-reacting proteins present in all lanes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dominant-negative Effect on the Production of Extracellular Hrp Pili in Vivo—We next examined a possible dominant-negative effect of pentapeptide-induced mutant HrpA proteins on the formation of the Hrp pilus in culture.
