https://openalex.org/W4205283268,"The globally circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant of concern Omicron (B.1.1.529) has a large number of mutations, especially in the spike protein, indicating that recognition by neutralizing antibodies may be compromised. We tested Wuhan (Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain), Beta (B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2), or Omicron pseudoviruses with sera of 51 participants who received two or three doses of the messenger RNA (mRNA)-based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2. After two doses, Omicron-neutralizing titers were reduced >22-fold compared with Wuhan-neutralizing titers. One month after the third vaccine dose, Omicron-neutralizing titers were increased 23-fold relative to their levels after two doses and were similar to levels of Wuhan-neutralizing titers after two doses. The requirement of a third vaccine dose to effectively neutralize Omicron was confirmed with sera from a subset of participants using live SARS-CoV-2. These data suggest that three doses of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 may protect against Omicron-mediated COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4200524230,"Kidney failure is frequently observed during and after COVID-19, but it remains elusive whether this is a direct effect of the virus. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects kidney cells and is associated with increased tubule-interstitial kidney fibrosis in patient autopsy samples. To study direct effects of the virus on the kidney independent of systemic effects of COVID-19, we infected human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived kidney organoids with SARS-CoV-2. Single-cell RNA sequencing indicated injury and dedifferentiation of infected cells with activation of profibrotic signaling pathways. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection also led to increased collagen 1 protein expression in organoids. A SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor was able to ameliorate the infection of kidney cells by SARS-CoV-2. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect kidney cells and induce cell injury with subsequent fibrosis. These data could explain both acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients and the development of chronic kidney disease in long COVID."

Here, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and single-cell proteomics with mechanistic studies to assess pathogenic T cell functions and inducing signals. We identified highly activated CD16+ T cells with increased cytotoxic functions in severe COVID-19. CD16 expression enabled immune-complex-mediated, T cell receptor-independent degranulation and cytotoxicity not found in other diseases. CD16+ T cells from COVID-19 patients promoted microvascular endothelial cell injury and release of neutrophil and monocyte chemoattractants. CD16+ T cell clones persisted beyond acute disease maintaining their cytotoxic phenotype. Increased generation of C3a in severe COVID-19 induced activated CD16+ cytotoxic T cells. Proportions of activated CD16+ T cells and plasma levels of complement proteins upstream of C3a were associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, supporting a pathological role of exacerbated cytotoxicity and complement activation in COVID-19."

https://openalex.org/W4205869773,"In oxidation reactions catalysed by supported metal nanoparticles with oxygen as the terminal oxidant, the rate of the oxygen reduction can be a limiting factor. This is exemplified by the oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohols, an important class of reactions with modern commercial applications1–3. Supported gold nanoparticles are highly active for the dehydrogenation of the alcohol to an aldehyde4 but are less effective for oxygen reduction5,6. By contrast, supported palladium nanoparticles offer high efficacy for oxygen reduction5,6. This imbalance can be overcome by alloying gold with palladium, which gives enhanced activity to both reactions7,8,9; however, the electrochemical potential of the alloy is a compromise between that of the two metals, meaning that although the oxygen reduction can be improved in the alloy, the dehydrogenation activity is often limited. Here we show that by separating the gold and palladium components in bimetallic carbon-supported catalysts, we can almost double the reaction rate compared with that achieved with the corresponding alloy catalyst. We demonstrate this using physical mixtures of carbon-supported monometallic gold and palladium catalysts and a bimetallic catalyst comprising separated gold and palladium regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate electrochemically that this enhancement is attributable to the coupling of separate redox processes occurring at isolated gold and palladium sites. The discovery of this catalytic effect—a cooperative redox enhancement—offers an approach to the design of multicomponent heterogeneous catalysts. ‘Cooperative redox enhancement (CORE) effects, which arise through the coupling of oxidative dehydrogenation and oxygen reduction reactions, can lead to increased rates of reaction over spatially separated bimetallic heterogeneous catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W4206585392,"Using online surveys, we collected data regarding COVID-19-related loss of smell or taste from 69,841 individuals. We performed a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study and identified a genome-wide significant locus in the vicinity of the UGT2A1 and UGT2A2 genes. Both genes are expressed in the olfactory epithelium and play a role in metabolizing odorants. These findings provide a genetic link to the biological mechanisms underlying COVID-19-related loss of smell or taste."
https://openalex.org/W4206948363,"Machine learning-based models of protein fitness typically learn from either unlabeled, evolutionarily related sequences or variant sequences with experimentally measured labels. For regimes where only limited experimental data are available, recent work has suggested methods for combining both sources of information. Toward that goal, we propose a simple combination approach that is competitive with, and on average outperforms more sophisticated methods. Our approach uses ridge regression on site-specific amino acid features combined with one probability density feature from modeling the evolutionary data. Within this approach, we find that a variational autoencoder-based probability density model showed the best overall performance, although any evolutionary density model can be used. Moreover, our analysis highlights the importance of systematic evaluations and sufficient baselines."

https://openalex.org/W4207025918,"Anemia in astronauts has been noted since the first space missions, but the mechanisms contributing to anemia in space flight have remained unclear. Here, we show that space flight is associated with persistently increased levels of products of hemoglobin degradation, carbon monoxide in alveolar air and iron in serum, in 14 astronauts throughout their 6-month missions onboard the International Space Station. One year after landing, erythrocytic effects persisted, including increased levels of hemolysis, reticulocytosis and hemoglobin. These findings suggest that the destruction of red blood cells, termed hemolysis, is a primary effect of microgravity in space flight and support the hypothesis that the anemia associated with space flight is a hemolytic condition that should be considered in the screening and monitoring of both astronauts and space tourists."

https://openalex.org/W4206962982,"Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) have long been known to carry chemical modifications, including 2'O-methylation, pseudouridylation, N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and N6,6-dimethyladenosine. While the functions of many of these modifications are unclear, some are highly conserved and occur in regions of the ribosome critical for mRNA decoding. Both 28S rRNA and 18S rRNA carry single m6A sites, and while the methyltransferase ZCCHC4 has been identified as the enzyme responsible for the 28S rRNA m6A modification, the methyltransferase responsible for the 18S rRNA m6A modification has remained unclear. Here, we show that the METTL5-TRMT112 methyltransferase complex installs the m6A modification at position 1832 of human 18S rRNA. Our work supports findings that TRMT112 is required for METTL5 stability and reveals that human METTL5 mutations associated with microcephaly and intellectual disability disrupt this interaction. We show that loss of METTL5 in human cancer cell lines and in mice regulates gene expression at the translational level; additionally, Mettl5 knockout mice display reduced body size and evidence of metabolic defects. While recent work has focused heavily on m6A modifications in mRNA and their roles in mRNA processing and translation, we demonstrate here that deorphanizing putative methyltransferase enzymes can reveal previously unappreciated regulatory roles for m6A in noncoding RNAs."

https://openalex.org/W4206274013,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the fifth leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide, in part due to a lack of molecular stratification tools that can distinguish primary tumours that will remain indolent from those that will metastasise. Amongst potential molecular biomarkers, microRNAs (miRs) have attracted particular interest because of their high stability in body fluids and fixed tissues. These small non-coding RNAs modulate several physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression. Herein we explore the prognostic potential and the functional role of miRs in localised PCa and their relation to nodal metastasis. We define a 7-miR signature that is associated with poor survival independently of age, Gleason score, pathological T state, N stage and surgical margin status and that is also prognostic for disease-free survival in patients with intermediate-risk localised disease. Within our 7-miR signature, we show that miR-378a-3p (hereafter miR-378a) levels are low in primary tumours compared to benign prostate tissue, and also lower in Gleason score 8-9 compared to Gleason 6-7 PCa. We demonstrate that miR-378a impairs glucose metabolism and reduces proliferation in PCa cells through independent mechanisms, and we identify glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) messenger RNA as a direct target of miR-378a. We show that GLUT1 inhibition hampers glycolysis, leading to cell death. Our data provides a rational for a new PCa stratification strategy based on miR expression, and it reveals that miR-378a and GLUT1 are potential therapeutic targets in highly aggressive glycolytic PCa."
https://openalex.org/W4205788081,"Bone loss is a hallmark of inflammatory bone diseases caused by aberrantly activated osteoclasts (OCLs). Studies have shown that OCLs exhibit various phenotypes and functions due to variations in the source(s) of precursor cells, cytokine expressions, and microenvironment-dependent factors. During these conditions, inflammatory osteoclasts (iOCLs) lose their immune-suppressive effect relative to OCLs under physiological conditions. This induces TNF α-producing CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner and finally leads to cascade amplification of iOCLs. OCL-derived exosomes have been reported to regulate OCL formation and inhibit the osteoblast activity. However, the specific function and mechanism of iOCL-derived exosomes on osteoblast have not been studied yet. In the present study, we compare the osteoblast promoting activities of iOCL-derived exosomes and OCL-derived exosomes. We found that iOCLs exosomes specifically target osteoblasts through ephrinA2/EphA2. Mechanistically, the lncRNA LIOCE is enriched in iOCL exosomes and promotes the osteoblast activity after being incorporated into osteoblasts. Furthermore, our results revealed that exosomal lncRNA LIOCE stabilizes osteogenic transcription factor Osterix by interacting and reducing the ubiquitination level of Osterix. This study demonstrated that the bone loss is alleviated in the inflammatory osteolysis mice model after injection of iOCL exosomes encapsulating lncRNA LIOCE. The role of exosomes encapsulating lncRNA LIOCE in promoting bone formation was well established in the rat bone repair model. Our results indicate that iOCL-derived exosomal lncRNA LIOCE promotes bone formation by upregulating Osx expression, and thus, the exosomes encapsulating lncRNA LIOCE may be an effective strategy to increase bone formation in osteoporosis and other bone metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4206024355,"The calcified cartilage zone (CCZ) is a thin interlayer between the hyaline articular cartilage and the subchondral bone and plays an important role in maintaining the joint homeostasis by providing biological and mechanical support from unmineralized cartilage to the underlying mineralized subchondral bone. The hallmark of CCZ characteristics in osteoarthritis (OA) is less well known. The aim of our study is to evaluate the structural, molecular, and biochemical composition of CCZ in tissues affected by primary knee OA and its relationship with disease severity. We collected osteochondral tissue samples stratified according to disease severity, from 16 knee OA patients who underwent knee replacement surgery. We also used meniscectomy-induced rat samples to confirm the pathophysiologic changes of human samples. We defined the characteristics of the calcified cartilage layer using a combination of morphological, biochemical, proteomic analyses on laser micro-dissected tissue. Our results demonstrated that the Calcium/Phosphate ratio is unchanged during the OA progression, but the calcium-binding protein and cadherin binding protein, as well as carbohydrate metabolism-related proteins, undergo significant changes. These changes were further accompanied by thinning of the CCZ, loss of collagen and proteoglycan content, the occurrence of the endochondral ossification, neovasculature, loss of the elastic module, loss of the collagen direction, and increase of the tortuosity indicating an altered structural and mechanical properties of the CCZ in OA. In conclusion, our results suggest that the calcified cartilage changes can reflect the disease progression."

https://openalex.org/W4205586379,"Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), a derivative of BPA, is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant with weak estrogenic properties. In women, uterine fibroids are highly prevalent estrogen-responsive tumors often with excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and may be the target of environmental estrogens. We have found that BPA has profibrotic effects in vitro, in addition to previous reports of the in vivo fibrotic effects of BPA in mouse uterus. However, the role of TBBPA in fibrosis is unclear. To investigate the effects of TBBPA on uterine fibrosis, we developed a 3D human uterine leiomyoma (ht-UtLM) spheroid culture model. Cell proliferation was evaluated in 3D ht-UtLM spheroids following TBBPA (10-6 -200 µM) administration at 48 h. Fibrosis was assessed using a Masson's Trichrome stain and light microscopy at 7 days of TBBPA (10-3 µM) treatment. Differential expression of ECM and fibrosis genes were determined using RT² Profiler™ PCR arrays. Network and pathway analyses were conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The activation of pathway proteins was analyzed by a transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB) protein array. We found that TBBPA increased cell proliferation and promoted fibrosis in 3D ht-UtLM spheroids with increased deposition of collagens. TBBPA upregulated the expression of profibrotic genes and corresponding proteins associated with the TGFB pathway. TBBPA activated TGFB signaling through phosphorylation of TGFBR1 and downstream effectors-small mothers against decapentaplegic -2 and -3 proteins (SMAD2 and SMAD3). The 3D ht-UtLM spheroid model is an effective system for studying environmental agents on human uterine fibrosis. TBBPA can promote fibrosis in uterine fibroid through TGFB/SMAD signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4205779568,"Shift-workers show an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A possible mechanism is the disruption of the circadian timing of glucose homeostasis. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial function is modulated by the molecular clock. We used time-restricted feeding (TRF) during the inactive phase to investigate how mistimed feeding affects muscle mitochondrial metabolism. Rats on an ad libitum (AL) diet were compared to those that could eat only during the light (inactive) or dark (active) phase. Mitochondrial respiration, metabolic gene expressions, and metabolite concentrations were determined in the soleus muscle. Rats on AL feeding or dark-fed TRF showed a clear daily rhythm in muscle mitochondrial respiration. This rhythm in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity was abolished in light-fed TRF animals and overall 24h respiration was lower. The expression of several genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and the fission/fusion machinery was altered in light-fed animals. Metabolomics analysis indicated that light-fed animals had lost rhythmic levels of α-ketoglutarate and citric acid. Contrastingly, lipidomics showed that light-fed animals abundantly gained rhythmicity in levels of triglycerides. Furthermore, while the RER shifted entirely with the food intake in the light-fed animals, many measured metabolic parameters (e.g., activity and mitochondrial respiration) did not strictly align with the shifted timing of food intake, resulting in a mismatch between expected metabolic supply/demand (as dictated by the circadian timing system and light/dark-cycle) and the actual metabolic supply/demand (as dictated by the timing of food intake). These data suggest that shift-work impairs mitochondrial metabolism and causes metabolic inflexibility, which can predispose to T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W4220970515,"Macrophages are resident myeloid cells in the gingival tissue which control homeostasis and play a pivotal role in orchestrating the immune response in periodontitis. Cell heterogeneity and functional phenotypes of macrophage subpopulations in periodontitis remain elusive. Here, we isolated gingival tissue from periodontitis-affected and healthy sites of patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We then used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define the heterogeneity of tissue-resident macrophages in gingival tissue in health vs. periodontitis. scRNA-seq demonstrated an unforeseen gene expression heterogeneity among macrophages in periodontitis and showed transcriptional and signaling heterogeneity of identified subsets in an independent cohort of patients with periodontitis and T2DM. Our bioinformatic inferences indicated divergent expression profiles in macrophages driven by transcriptional regulators CIITA, RELA, RFX5, and RUNX2. Macrophages in periodontitis expressed both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers and their polarization was not mutually exclusive. The majority of macrophages in periodontitis expressed the monocyte lineage marker CD14, indicating their bone marrow lineage. We also found high expression and activation of RELA, a subunit of the NF-κB transcription factor complex, in gingival macrophages of periodontitis patients with T2DM. Our data suggested that heterogeneity and hyperinflammatory activation of macrophages may be relevant to the pathogenesis and outcomes of periodontitis, and may be further augmented in patients with T2DM."

https://openalex.org/W4205176057,"Current immunosuppressive strategies in organ transplantation rely on calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine A (CsA) or tacrolimus (Tac). Both drugs are nephrotoxic, but CsA has been associated with greater renal damage than Tac. CsA inhibits calcineurin by forming complexes with cyclophilins, whose chaperone function is essential for proteostasis. We hypothesized that stronger toxicity of CsA may be related to suppression of cyclophilins with ensuing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) in kidney epithelia. Effects of CsA and Tac (10 µM for 6 h each) were compared in cultured human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells, primary human renal proximal tubule (PT) cells, freshly isolated rat PTs, and knockout HEK 293 cell lines lacking the critical ER stress sensors, protein kinase RNA–like ER kinase or activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). UPR was evaluated by detection of its key components. Compared with Tac treatment, CsA induced significantly stronger UPR in native cultured cells and isolated PTs. Evaluation of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic markers suggested an enhanced apoptotic rate in CsA-treated cells compared with Tac-treated cells as well. Similar to CsA treatment, knockdown of cyclophilin A or B by siRNA caused proapoptotic UPR, whereas application of the chemical chaperones tauroursodeoxycholic acid or 4-phenylbutyric acid alleviated CsA-induced UPR. Deletion of protein kinase RNA–like ER kinase or ATF6 blunted CsA-induced UPR as well. In summary, inhibition of cyclophilin chaperone function with ensuing ER stress and proapoptotic UPR aggravates CsA toxicity, whereas pharmacological modulation of UPR bears potential to alleviate renal side effects of CsA.

Calcineurin (Cn) inhibitors (CNIs) are considered as the first-line immunosuppressive therapy in patients undergoing organ transplantation (1Williams C.R. Gooch J.L. Calcineurin inhibitors and immunosuppression - a tale of two isoforms.Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2012; 14e14Google Scholar, 2Casey M.J. Meier-Kriesche H.-U. Calcineurin inhibitors in kidney transplantation: Friend or foe?.Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2011; 20: 610-615Google Scholar). Two drugs of this class, cyclosporine A (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506, Tac), have been widely integrated into clinical practice. Cn is a holoenzyme consisting of a catalytic subunit (CnA), a regulatory subunit (CnB), and calmodulin, which functions as a Ca2+-dependent protein serine/threonine phosphatase. Alpha and beta isoforms of the catalytic subunit (CnAα and CnAβ) fulfill distinct and nonredundant tasks in various tissues (1Williams C.R. Gooch J.L. Calcineurin inhibitors and immunosuppression - a tale of two isoforms.Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2012; 14e14Google Scholar, 3Rusnak F. Mertz P. Calcineurin: Form and function.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Google Scholar). CnAβ-dependent dephosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) transcription factors is critical to T-lymphocyte activation and underlies the therapeutic action of CNI (4Bueno O.F.

Off-target effects of CNI include renal complications because of suppression of CnAα activity in kidney tissue (5Gooch J.L. Roberts B.R. Cobbs S.L. Tumlin J.A.

Calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity.Clin. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 4: 481-508Google Scholar). CNI-induced renal vasoconstriction, hyperactivity of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), and dysregulation of major electrolyte transport systems cause hypertension and homeostasis disorders (6Naesens M.

Pathogenesis of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hypertension.J. Nephrol. 2012; 25: 269-275Google Scholar). At the cellular level, CNIs have been shown to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and trigger unfolded protein response (UPR), which in turn may promote apoptosis of kidney epithelia (8Kitamura M.

Along the same line, a recent experimental study in cultured human cells demonstrated higher toxicity of CsA compared with Tac (15Fedele A.O. Carraro V. Xie J. Averous J. Proud C.G. Cyclosporin A but not FK506 activates the integrated stress response in human cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 15134-15143Google Scholar). The two CNIs inhibit Cn activity by forming complexes with distinct members of the immunophilin family: CsA binds to cyclophilins, whereas Tac interacts with 12 kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12). These individual interaction patterns may provide a reasonable explanation for distinct toxicity profiles of CsA versus Tac. Since the chaperone activity of cyclophilins is required for protein maturation, CsA may impair proteostasis (Fig. 1) (16Ram B.M. Ramakrishna G. Endoplasmic reticulum vacuolation and unfolded protein response leading to paraptosis like cell death in cyclosporine A treated cancer cervix cells is mediated by cyclophilin B inhibition.Biochim.

Indeed, studies of CsA versus Tac in cell culture showed substantially stronger association of CsA with ER stress and UPR, but the role of cyclophilins herein remained to be elucidated (15Fedele A.O.

UPR is a complex signal transduction pathway that is triggered by pathophysiological alterations of proteostasis leading to accumulation of misfolded protein (19Hetz C. The unfolded protein response: Controlling cell fate decisions under ER stress and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 89-102Google Scholar, 20Walter P. Ron D. The unfolded protein response: From stress pathway to homeostatic regulation.Science. 2011; 334: 1081-1086Google Scholar). Misfolded protein releases inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1α), protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) from their complexes with binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) by competitive interactions with the latter. IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6 serve as ER-stress sensors and initiate a number of adaptive reactions promoting cell survival. PERK phosphorylates and deactivates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α, thereby inhibiting protein translation. Parallel activation of IRE1α and ATF6 stimulates autophagy and accelerates protein folding via several signaling pathways, such as transcription and splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) (19Hetz C. The unfolded protein response: Controlling cell fate decisions under ER stress and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 89-102Google Scholar). Failure of these adaptive mechanisms triggers the proapoptotic UPR branch via stimulation of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), which is a transcription factor that induces expression of proapoptotic genes (9Cybulsky A.V.

Interestingly, Cn itself has been implicated in adaptive UPR signaling, enabling long-term cell survival upon ER stress (23Bonilla M. Essential role of calcineurin in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2343-2353Google Scholar). Therefore, Cn inhibition may impair the ability of kidney epithelia to compensate for metabolic stress. Pharmacological targeting of UPR using chemical chaperones, inhibitors of translation, or autophagy enhancers has been considered as an emerging strategy to delay progression of chronic kidney disorders (9Cybulsky A.V. Endoplasmic reticulum stress, the unfolded protein response and autophagy in kidney diseases.Nat. Rev. Nephrol. 2017; 13: 681-696Google Scholar). In this context, improved understanding of UPR-related molecular pathways affected by CNI may deliver new options for managing their nephrotoxicity. The present study addresses mechanisms underlying distinct toxicity profiles of CsA versus Tac with a focus on ER stress and UPR. Based on comparative analysis of CsA and Tac in cultured human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells, primary human renal proximal tubular (PT) epithelial cells (HRPTEpCs), and freshly isolated rat PTs, we provide several lines of evidence in support of the hypothesis that the more pronounced toxic effects of CsA on proteostasis are rooted in the suppression of cyclophilin chaperone activity. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that targeting UPR bears therapeutic potential for alleviation of CsA nephrotoxicity. First, we aimed to define the optimal CNI concentrations and treatment duration to set up a protocol permitting comparative analysis of their effects on ER and UPR in cultured cells. Earlier work reported ER stress and UPR in human cervical cancer (HeLa) and human lung carcinoma (A549) cells after application of 10 μM CsA for 6 h (15Fedele A.O. Carraro V. Xie J. Averous J. Proud C.G. Cyclosporin A but not FK506 activates the integrated stress response in human cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 15134-15143Google Scholar). Based on that protocol, we performed a dose–response analysis by treating native HEK 293 cells with increasing doses of CsA versus Tac (5–80 μM each) for 6 h to evaluate the effects on cell viability using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (24Mosmann T. Rapid colorimetric assay for cellular growth and survival: Application to proliferation and cytotoxicity assays.J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Google Scholar). A substantial decrease of cell viability below 50% was observed starting with 20 μM CsA or 40 μM Tac (Fig. 2A), which we defined as limitation precluding evaluation of ER stress and UPR because of the critical reduction of living cell mass. Since CsA has been reported to induce striking morphological changes such as cytoplasmic vacuolization (16Ram B.M. Ramakrishna G. Endoplasmic reticulum vacuolation and unfolded protein response leading to paraptosis like cell death in cyclosporine A treated cancer cervix cells is mediated by cyclophilin B inhibition.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 2014; 1843: 2497-2512Google Scholar, 25Lau D.C. Wong K.L. Hwang W.S. Cyclosporine toxicity on cultured rat microvascular endothelial cells.Kidney Int. 1989; 35: 604-613Google Scholar), we also compared effects of CsA versus Tac (10 μM each) on cell morphology by light and electron microscopy. Ultrastructural analysis revealed no obvious morphological alterations after application of CsA or Tac for 6 h, whereas prolonged treatment for 24 h resulted in formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles in CsA-treated but not in Tac-treated cells (Fig. 2, B–G). Moreover, treatment of cells with CsA for 48 h resulted in a marked reduction of cell confluence compared with Tac or vehicle, as detected by light microscopy (Fig. S1). From these preliminary experiments, we concluded that the previously published treatment protocol for human cancer cells (10 μM CsA versus 10 μM Tac for 6 h) is applicable for our experimental settings (15Fedele A.O. Carraro V. Xie J. Averous J. Proud C.G. Cyclosporin A but not FK506 activates the integrated stress response in human cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 15134-15143Google Scholar), whereas increased CNI doses or treatment duration critically reduce the cell viability. Therefore, further experiments in HEK 293 cells, primary HRPTEpC, and microdissected rat PTs were performed using 10 μM CsA versus 10 μM Tac for 6 h. To verify the equivalent efficacy of the chosen treatment protocols in terms of Cn inhibition, we evaluated phosphorylation of the established Cn substrate, NFAT (3Rusnak F. Mertz P. Calcineurin: Form and function.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Google Scholar). Immunoblotting using an antibody to phosphorylated NFAT showed comparable increases of phospho-NFAT levels in lysates from CsA-treated or Tac-treated HEK 293 cells suggesting that both CNIs attenuated Cn-dependent NFAT dephosphorylation to a comparable extent when applied at 10 μM concentrations for 6 h (Fig. S2). Next, we compared effects of CsA versus Tac on key UPR proteins using thapsigargin (Tg; 0.1 μM), an established ER-stress and UPR inducer (26Madaro L. Marrocco V. Carnio S. Sandri M. Bouché M. Intracellular signaling in ER stress-induced autophagy in skeletal muscle cells.FASEB J. 2013; 27: 1990-2000Google Scholar, 27Oslowski C.M. Urano F. Measuring ER stress and the unfolded protein response using mammalian tissue culture system.Methods Enzymol. 2011; 490: 71-92Google Scholar), as positive control for these experiments. Compared with vehicle, CsA significantly increased levels of CHOP, spliced (s) XBP1, and phosphorylated (p) but not total IRE1α as detected by immunoblotting (+227%, p < 0.001 for CHOP; +223%, p < 0.001 for sXBP1; and +230%, p < 0.01 for p-IRE1α; Fig. 3, A–E). Parallel quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed increased expression of the ER chaperone, BiP (+348%, p < 0.01), CHOP (+751%, p < 0.05), and sXBP1 (+2142%, p < 0.05) in response to CsA (Fig. S3). Similar changes were detected in lysates from Tg-treated cells, whereas Tac produced no significant effects on the tested UPR products (Figs. 3, A–E and S3). Next, we evaluated nuclear abundance of CHOP using immunofluorescence. Compared with vehicle, CsA and Tg induced significant increases of CHOP signal intensities in the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-positive nuclear regions (CsA: +235%, p < 0.0001; Tg: +137%, p < 0.001), whereas Tac did not alter the nuclear CHOP levels (Fig. S4, A–C). To follow up the downstream effects of CHOP activation, we evaluated the survival-promoting B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (BCL-2) as well as the proapoptotic products, BCL-2-associated X protein (Bax) and cleaved caspase-3 (cCas-3) (28Jelínek M. Balušíková K. Schmiedlová M. Němcová-Fürstová V. Šrámek J. Stančíková J. Zanardi I. Ojima I. Kovář J. The role of individual caspases in cell death induction by taxanes in breast cancer cells.Cancer Cell Int. 2015; 15: 8Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analysis showed that CsA and Tg strongly decreased BCL-2 levels (CsA: −76%, p < 0.05; Tg: −58%, p < 0.01) and increased Bax abundance (CsA: +218%, p < 0.0001; Tg: +234, p < 0.01), whereas Tac did not affect the BCL-2 abundance and only moderately increased the Bax levels (Tac: +168%, p < 0.05; Fig. 3, A and G). Immunofluorescence labeling of cCas-3 showed significant numerical increases of cCas-3-positive cells after CsA and Tg but not Tac treatments (Fig. S5, A–C). Together, these results demonstrate that, compared with Tac, CsA induces significantly stronger ER stress and proapoptotic UPR in cultured HEK 293 cells. To corroborate the data obtained in HEK 293 cells in models with more differentiated kidney epithelial phenotype, we next treated HRPTEpCs and isolated rat PTs with either CNI or Tg. Similar to the results obtained in HEK 293 cells, CsA induced significantly stronger UPR compared with Tac in HRPTEpCs, as detected by qPCR analysis of BiP (CsA: +233%, p < 0.0001; Tac: +135%, p < 0.01; and Tg: +1220%, p < 0.001), sXBP1 (CsA: +288%, p < 0.0001; Tac: +122%, not significant [ns]; and Tg: +1196, p < 0.001), and CHOP (CsA: +278%, p < 0.01; Tac: +113, ns; and Tg: +3589, p < 0.0001; Fig. 4A), as well as by immunoblotting for sXBP1 (CsA: +188%, p < 0.01; Tac: 100%, ns; and Tg: +309%, p < 0.0001; Fig. 4, B and C). Along the same line, expression levels of BiP and CHOP were significantly higher in isolated rat PTs treated with CsA (BiP: +234%, p < 0.05; CHOP: +366%, p < 0.05), than in the Tac group (BiP: +184%, ns; CHOP: +139%, ns; Fig. 4, D and E). Since CsA but not Tac induced UPR, we assumed that this discrepancy may result from CsA-dependent suppression of cyclophilins rather than from Cn inhibition. Therefore, we separately suppressed cyclophilin A (CYPA) or cyclophilin B (CYPB) expression in HEK 293 cells using siRNA-mediated knockdown protocols. These protocols led to similar decreases of CYPA or CYPB protein levels (−53% and −57%, respectively, p < 0.0001; Fig. 5, A–D). Evaluation of CHOP abundance by immunoblotting revealed significantly increased levels in both CYPA-knockdown (CYPA-kd) cells (+247%, p < 0.0001) and CYPB-knockdown (CYPB-kd) cells (+364%, p < 0.0001; Fig. 5, E and F). In line with this, immunoblotting for cCas-3 showed increased immunoreactive signals in CYPA-kd cells (+284%, p < 0.001) and CYPB-kd cells (+327%, p < 0.01; Fig. 5, E and G). Notably, effects of CYPA-kd and CYPB-kd cells on CHOP and cCas-3 were largely comparable to effects of CsA in unmodified cells (Figs. 3, A and B and 5, E–G) suggesting a critical role of suppressed cyclophilin activity in the CsA-induced ER stress and UPR. Next, we tested the potential of the chemical chaperones, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA; 300 μM) or 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA; 5 μM), to alleviate the CsA-induced ER stress. The CsA-induced increases of CHOP protein abundance were significantly blunted by concomitant application of TUDCA (from +625% [CsA] to +274% [CsA + TUDCA], p < 0.001; Fig. 6A) or 4-PBA (from +712% [CsA] to +238% [CsA + 4-PBA], p < 0.0001; Fig. 6B). Similarly, the CsA-induced increases of cCas-3-positive cells were blunted by both TUDCA and 4-PBA (from +697% [CsA] to +419% [CsA + TUDCA] or +388% [CsA + 4-PBA], p < 0.05; Fig. 7, A–C), as detected by immunofluorescence.Figure 7Effects of concomitant treatment of chemical chaperones (TUDCA or 4-PBA) on the abundance of cleaved caspase-3 (cCas-3) in HEK 293 cells.

To this end, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing for inactivation of critical ER-stress sensors and UPR initiators, IRE1α, PERK, or ATF6, in HEK 293 cells. While we succeeded in generation of PERK-deficient or ATF6-deficient cell lines (Fig. S6), attempts to delete IRE1α failed to produce viable cell colonies suggesting a critical role for this protein in cell metabolism. PERK-KO and ATF6-KO exerted no significant effects on CnAα, CnAβ, CYPA, CYPB, and FKBP12 protein levels except for a moderate increase of CYPA abundance in PERK-KO cells (+146%, p < 0.01; Figs. S6–S8). These results suggest that deletion of PERK or ATF6 does not affect proteins mediating effects of CsA or Tac. Since the absence of PERK or ATF6 may affect the proteostasis per se, we evaluated their downstream signaling components, namely CHOP and sXBP1. The baseline CHOP abundance was unaltered in PERK-KO cells but increased in ATF6-KO cells (+67%, p < 0.001) as compared with control unmodified cells (Fig. 8A). Evaluation of sXBP1 revealed similar baseline levels in control, PERK-KO, and ATF6-KO cells (Fig. 8B). Hence, we concluded that ATF6 deficiency is associated with altered baseline proteostasis resulting in activation of CHOP-inducing UPR branches such as PERK signaling (9Cybulsky A.V. Endoplasmic reticulum stress, the unfolded protein response and autophagy in kidney diseases.Nat. Rev. Nephrol. 2017; 13: 681-696Google Scholar). Next, we treated PERK-KO and ATF6-KO cells with CsA, Tac, and Tg using the experimental protocols established for nonmodified control HEK 293 cells. PERK-KO cells showed significantly increased levels of CHOP (+165%, p ≤ 0.001) and sXBP1 (+245%, p ≤ 0.0001) in response to CsA, whereas levels of IRE1α and p-IRE1α were not affected by the treatment (Fig. 9, A–E). Tg increased sXBP1 and IRE1α levels (+472%, p < 0.0001, +134%, p < 0.05, respectively), whereas Tac moderately reduced the sXBP1 abundance in PERK-KO cells (−54%, p < 0.05; Fig. 9, A–E). ATF6-KO cells responded to CsA with significant increases of sXBP1 (+419%, p < 0.01) and p-IRE1α levels (+159, p < 0.05), whereas CHOP and IRE1α were not affected (Fig. 10, A–E). Tg increased the levels of sXBP1 (+902, p < 0.0001) and p-IRE1α (+145%, p < 0.001), whereas Tac augmented the p-IRE1α levels only (+129, p ≤ 0.05; Fig. 10, A–E), as detected by immunoblotting. Comparative statistical analysis of the effect strength showed that CsA-induced increases of CHOP and sXBP1 in PERK-KO and ATF6-KO cells were weaker than in unmodified cells (Table 1). These results suggest that induction of UPR by CsA is partially mediated by PERK-dependent and ATF6-dependent signaling pathways.Figure 10Effects of cyclosporine A (CsA), tacrolimus (Tac), and thapsigargin (Tg) on key unfolded protein response products in ATF6-deficient cells.

https://openalex.org/W4205388701,"With the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronaviruses have begun to attract great attention across the world. Of the known human coronaviruses, however, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the most lethal. Coronavirus proteins can be divided into three groups: nonstructural proteins, structural proteins, and accessory proteins. While the number of each of these proteins varies greatly among different coronaviruses, accessory proteins are most closely related to the pathogenicity of the virus. We found for the first time that the ORF3 accessory protein of MERS-CoV, which closely resembles the ORF3a proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, has the ability to induce apoptosis in cells in a dose-dependent manner. Through bioinformatics analysis and validation, we revealed that ORF3 is an unstable protein and has a shorter half-life in cells compared to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a proteins. After screening, we identified a host E3 ligase, HUWE1, that specifically induces MERS-CoV ORF3 protein ubiquitination and degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This results in the diminished ability of ORF3 to induce apoptosis, which might partially explain the lower spread of MERS-CoV compared to other coronaviruses. In summary, this study reveals a pathological function of MERS-CoV ORF3 protein and identifies a potential host antiviral protein, HUWE1, with an ability to antagonize MERS-CoV pathogenesis by inducing ORF3 degradation, thus enriching our knowledge of the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and suggesting new targets and strategies for clinical development of drugs for MERS-CoV treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4205896055,"Moral panics are moments of intense and widespread public concern about a specific group, whose behaviour is deemed a moral threat to the collective. We examined public health guidelines in the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canadian newspaper editorials, columns and letters to the editor, to evaluate how perceived threats to public interests were expressed and amplified through claims-making processes. Normalization of infection control behaviours has led to a moral panic about lack of compliance with preventive measures, which is expressed in opinion discourse. Following public health guidelines was construed as a moral imperative and a civic duty, while those who failed to comply with these guidelines were stigmatized, shamed as ""covidiots,"" and discursively constructed as a threat to public health and moral order. Unlike other moral panics in which there is social consensus about what needs to be done, Canadian commentators presented a variety of possible solutions, opening a debate around infection surveillance, privacy, trust, and punishment. Public health communication messaging needs to be clear, to both facilitate compliance and provide the material conditions necessary to promote infection prevention behaviour, and reduce the stigmatization of certain groups and hostile reactions towards them."

https://openalex.org/W4207014897,"The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) has key functions in the initiation step of protein synthesis. eIF2 guides the initiator tRNA to the ribosome, participates in scanning of the mRNA molecule, supports selection of the start codon, and modulates the translation of mRNAs in response to stress. eIF2 comprises a heterotrimeric complex whose assembly depends on the ATP-grasp protein Cdc123. Mutations of the eIF2γ subunit that compromise eIF2 complex formation cause severe neurological disease in humans. To this date, however, details about the assembly mechanism, step order, and the individual functions of eIF2 subunits remain unclear. Here, we quantified assembly intermediates and studied the behavior of various binding site mutants in budding yeast. Based on these data, we present a model in which a Cdc123-mediated conformational change in eIF2γ exposes binding sites for eIF2α and eIF2β subunits. Contrary to an earlier hypothesis, we found that the associations of eIF2α and eIF2β with the γ-subunit are independent of each other, but the resulting heterodimers are nonfunctional and fail to bind the guanosine exchange factor eIF2B. In addition, levels of eIF2α influence the rate of eIF2 assembly. By binding to eIF2γ, eIF2α displaces Cdc123 and thereby completes the assembly process. Experiments in human cell culture indicate that the mechanism of eIF2 assembly is conserved between yeast and humans. This study sheds light on an essential step in eukaryotic translation initiation, the dysfunction of which is linked to human disease."
https://openalex.org/W4206351642,"RNA polymerase III (pol III) products play fundamental roles in a variety of cellular processes, including protein synthesis and cancer cell proliferation. In addition, dysregulation of pol III-directed transcription closely correlates with tumorigenesis. It is therefore of interest to identify novel pathways or factors governing pol III-directed transcription. Here, we show that transcription factor (TF) GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) expression in SaOS2 cells was stimulated by the silencing of filamin A (FLNA), a repressor of pol III-directed transcription, suggesting that GATA4 is potentially associated with the regulation of pol III-directed transcription. Indeed, we show that GATA4 expression positively correlates with pol III-mediated transcription and tumor cell proliferation. Mechanistically, we found that GATA4 depletion inhibits the occupancies of the pol III transcription machinery factors at the loci of pol III target genes by reducing expression of both TFIIIB subunit TFIIB-related factor 1 and TFIIIC subunit general transcription factor 3C subunit 2 (GTF3C2). GATA4 has been shown to activate specificity factor 1 (Sp1) gene transcription by binding to the Sp1 gene promoter, and Sp1 has been confirmed to activate pol III gene transcription by directly binding to both Brf1 and Gtf3c2 gene promoters. Thus, the findings from this study suggest that GATA4 links FLNA and Sp1 signaling to form an FLNA/GATA4/Sp1 axis to modulate pol III-directed transcription and transformed cell proliferation. Taken together, these results provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanism of pol III-directed transcription."

To persist in the bacterial flora of the host, some bacteria produce antibacterial factors such as the antimicrobial peptides known as bacteriocins. In this study, we tried to isolate bacteriocin-producing S. epidermidis strains. Among 150 S. epidermidis isolates from the oral cavities of 287 volunteers, we detected two bacteriocin-producing strains, KSE56 and KSE650. Complete genome sequences of the two strains confirmed that they carried the epidermin-harboring plasmid pEpi56 and the nukacin IVK45-like-harboring plasmid pNuk650. The amino acid sequence of epidermin from KSE56 was identical to the previously reported sequence, but the epidermin synthesis-related genes were partially different. The prepeptide amino acid sequences of nukacin KSE650 and nukacin IVK45 showed one mismatch, but both mature peptides were entirely similar. pNuk650 was larger and had an additional seven ORFs compared to pIVK45. We then investigated the antibacterial activity of the two strains against several skin and oral bacteria and found their different activity patterns. In conclusion, we report the complete sequences of 2 plasmids coding for bacteriocins from S. epidermidis, which were partially different from those previously reported. Furthermore, this is the first report to show the complete sequence of an epidermin-carrying plasmid, pEpi56."
https://openalex.org/W4205612598,"Rho family small GTPases (Rho) regulate various cell motility processes by spatiotemporally controlling the actin cytoskeleton. Some Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) are regulated via tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family tyrosine kinase (SFK). We also previously reported that PLEKHG2, a RhoGEF for the GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, is tyrosine-phosphorylated by SRC. However, the details of the mechanisms by which SFK regulates RhoGEFs are not well understood. In this study, we found for the first time that PLEKHG1, which has very high homology to the Dbl and pleckstrin homology domains of PLEKHG2, activates Cdc42 following activation by FYN, a member of the SFK family. We also show that this activation of PLEKHG1 by FYN requires interaction between these two proteins and FYN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLEKHG1. We also found that the region containing the Src homology 3 and Src homology 2 domains of FYN is required for this interaction. Finally, we demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-720 and Tyr-801 in PLEKHG1 is important for the activation of PLEKHG1. These results suggest that FYN is a regulator of PLEKHG1 and may regulate cell morphology through Rho signaling via the interaction with and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLEKHG1."
https://openalex.org/W4205755044,"In the striatum, cholinergic interneurons (CINs) have the ability to release both acetylcholine and glutamate, due to the expression of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and the vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3). However, the relationship these neurotransmitters have in the regulation of behavior is not fully understood. Here we used reward-based touchscreen tests in mice to assess the individual and combined contributions of acetylcholine/glutamate co-transmission in behavior. We found that reduced levels of the VAChT from CINs negatively impacted dopamine signalling in response to reward, and disrupted complex responses in a sequential chain of events. In contrast, diminished VGLUT3 levels had somewhat opposite effects. When mutant mice were treated with haloperidol in a cue-based task, the drug did not affect the performance of VAChT mutant mice, whereas VGLUT3 mutant mice were highly sensitive to haloperidol. In mice where both vesicular transporters were deleted from CINs, we observed altered reward-evoked dopaminergic signalling and behavioral deficits that resemble, but were worse, than those in mice with specific loss of VAChT alone. These results demonstrate that the ability to secrete two different neurotransmitters allows CINs to exert complex modulation of a wide range of behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W4207035082,"Dipeptide production from extracellular proteins is crucial for Porphyromonas gingivalis, a pathogen related to chronic periodontitis, because its energy production is entirely dependent on the metabolism of amino acids predominantly incorporated as dipeptides. These dipeptides are produced by periplasmic dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP)4, DPP5, DPP7, and DPP11. Although the substrate specificities of these four DPPs cover most amino acids at the penultimate position from the N terminus (P1), no DPP is known to cleave penultimate Gly, Ser, Thr, or His. Here, we report an expanded substrate preference of bacterial DPP7 that covers those residues. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that DPP7 efficiently degraded incretins and other gastrointestinal peptides, which were successively cleaved at every second residue, including Ala, Gly, Ser, and Gln, as well as authentic hydrophobic residues. Intravenous injection of DPP7 into mice orally administered glucose caused declines in plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 and insulin, accompanied by increased blood glucose levels. A newly developed coupled enzyme reaction system that uses synthetic fluorogenic peptides revealed that the P1' and P2' residues of substrates significantly elevated kcat values, providing an expanded substrate preference. This activity enhancement was most effective toward the substrates with nonfavorable but nonrepulsive P1 residues in DPP7. Enhancement of kcat by prime-side residues was also observed in DPP11 but not DPP4 and DPP5. Based on this expanded substrate specificity, we demonstrate that a combination of DPPs enables proteolytic liberation of all types of N-terminal dipeptides and ensures P. gingivalis growth and pathogenicity."

We propose here a simple and economical method for synthesizing the luminescent nanocrystals MoS2 using the hydrothermal technique. In addition, the synthesized MoS2 nanocrystals display photoluminescence that is tunable according to size. MoS2 nanocrystals have many advantages, such as stable dispersion, low toxicity and luminescent characteristics, offering their encouraging applicability in biomedical disciplines. In this study, human lung cancer epithelial cells (A549) are used to assess fluorescence imaging of MoS2 nanocrystals. MTT assay, trypan blue assay, flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging results have shown that MoS2 nanocrystals can selectively target and destroy lung cancer cells, especially drug-resistant cells (A549)."
https://openalex.org/W4226368284,"Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) is an atypical protein kinase that controls protein synthesis in cells under stress. Although well studied in cancer, less is known about its roles in chronic inflammatory diseases. Here, we examined its regulation of macrophage cholesterol handling in the context of atherosclerosis. eEF2K mRNA expression and protein activity were upregulated in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) exposed to oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (oxLDL). When incubated with oxLDL, BMDMs from eEF2K knockout (Eef2k-/- ) mice formed fewer Oil Red O+ foam cells than Eef2k+/+ BMDMs (12.5% ± 2.3% vs. 32.3% ± 2.0%, p < .01). Treatment with a selective eEF2K inhibitor, JAN-384, also decreased foam cell formation for C57BL/6J BMDMs and human monocyte-derived macrophages. Disabling eEF2K selectively decreased protein expression of the CD36 cholesterol uptake receptor, mediated by a reduction in the proportion of translationally active Cd36 mRNA. Eef2k-/- mice bred onto the Ldlr-/- background developed aortic sinus atherosclerotic plaques that were 30% smaller than Eef2k+/+ -Ldlr-/- mice after 16 weeks of high cholesterol diet (p < .05). Although accompanied by a reduction in plaque CD36+ staining (p < .05) and lower CD36 expression in circulating monocytes (p < .01), this was not associated with reduced lipid content in plaques as measured by oil red O staining. Finally, EEF2K and CD36 mRNA levels were higher in blood mononuclear cells from patients with coronary artery disease and recent myocardial infarction compared to healthy controls without coronary artery disease. These results reveal a new role for eEF2K in translationally regulating CD36 expression and foam cell formation in macrophages. Further studies are required to explore therapeutic targeting of eEF2K in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W4205463550,"Metastatic outgrowth is supported by metabolic adaptations that may differ from the primary tumor of origin. However, it is unknown if such adaptations are therapeutically actionable. Here we report a novel aminopyridine compound that targets a unique Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase (PGD)-dependent metabolic adaptation in distant metastases from pancreatic cancer patients. Compared to structurally similar analogs, 6-aminopicolamine (6AP) potently and selectively reversed PGD-dependent metastatic properties, including intrinsic tumorigenic capacity, excess glucose consumption, and global histone hyperacetylation. 6AP acted as a water-soluble prodrug that was converted into intracellular bioactive metabolites that inhibited PGD in vitro, and 6AP monotherapy demonstrated anti-metastatic efficacy with minimal toxicity in vivo. Collectively, these studies identify 6AP and possibly other 6-aminopyridines as well-tolerated prodrugs with selectivity for metastatic pancreatic cancers. If unique metabolic adaptations are a common feature of metastatic or otherwise aggressive human malignancies, then such dependencies could provide a largely untapped pool of druggable targets for patients with advanced cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4205580243,"Signaling by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) plays pivotal roles in embryogenesis, adult tissue homeostasis, and disease. Recent studies revealed that the well-established WNT agonist R-spondin 2 (RSPO2) is also a BMP receptor (BMP receptor type 1A) antagonist, with roles in early Xenopus embryogenesis and human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To uncouple the BMP antagonist function from the WNT agonist function and to promote development of AML therapeutics, here we identified a 10-mer peptide (RW) derived from the thrombospondin 1 domain of RSPO2, which specifically prevents binding between RSPO2 and BMP receptor type 1A without altering WNT signaling. We also show that a corresponding RW dendrimer (RWd) exhibiting improved half-life relieves inhibition of BMP receptor signaling by RSPO2 in human AML cells, reduces cell growth, and induces differentiation. Moreover, microinjection of RWd in Xenopus embryos ventralizes the dorsoventral embryonic patterning by upregulating BMP signaling without affecting WNT signaling. Our study corroborates the function of RSPO2 as a BMP receptor antagonist and provides a proof of concept for pharmacologically uncoupling BMP antagonist from WNT agonist functions of RSPO2 using the inhibitor peptide RWd with enhanced target selectivity and limited side effects.

A survey of strategies to modulate the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway: Current and future perspectives.Stem Cells Int. 2016; 2016: 7290686Google Scholar). BMPs initiate signaling from a tetrameric receptor kinase complex consisting of type I (BMP receptor type 1A (BMPR1A), BMP receptor type 1B, activin A receptor type I (ACVR1), or activin A receptor–like type I) and type II receptors (BMPR2, ACVR2A, and ACVR2B) (7Heldin C.H.

We showed that among the four RSPOs, only RSPO2 and RSPO3 are bifunctional, activating WNT signaling and inhibiting BMP signaling. Mechanistically, RSPO2 specifically interacts with BMPR1A and tethers it to ZNRF3 in an LGR-independent manner to trigger endocytosis and degradation of BMPR1A (14Lee H. Seidl C. Sun R. Glinka A. Niehrs C. R-spondins are BMP receptor antagonists in Xenopus early embryonic development.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 5570Google Scholar, 26Sun R. He L. Lee H. Glinka A. Andresen C. Hubschmann D. Jeremias I. Muller-Decker K. Pabst C. Niehrs C. RSPO2 inhibits BMP signaling to promote self-renewal in acute myeloid leukemia.Cell Rep. 2021; 36: 109559Google Scholar). In vivo support for a role of RSPO2 as selective BMP antagonist comes from early Xenopus embryogenesis, where RSPO2 cooperates with other BMP antagonists of the Spemann organizer to inhibit BMP signaling during embryonic axis formation (14Lee H. Seidl C. Sun R. Glinka A. Niehrs C. R-spondins are BMP receptor antagonists in Xenopus early embryonic development.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 5570Google Scholar). RSPO2 functions as BMP antagonist rather than WNT agonist also in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, where RSPO2 promotes self-renewal (26Sun R. He L. Lee H. Glinka A. Andresen C. Hubschmann D. Jeremias I. Muller-Decker K. Pabst C. Niehrs C. RSPO2 inhibits BMP signaling to promote self-renewal in acute myeloid leukemia.Cell Rep. 2021; 36: 109559Google Scholar). Moreover, in AML patients, elevated RSPO2 expression is a prognostic marker that strongly correlates with poor disease progression. Thus, RSPO2 is a promising therapeutic target in AML, the more so as it is accessible to extracellularly acting drugs. Indeed, monoclonal antibody antagonists of RSPO family members are effective in inhibiting tumor growth in various solid tumor xenograft models (15Chartier C. Raval J. Axelrod F. Bond C. Cain J. Dee-Hoskins C. Ma S. Fischer M.M. Shah J. Wei J. Ji M. Lam A. Stroud M. Yen W.C. Yeung P. et al.Therapeutic targeting of tumor-derived R-spondin attenuates beta-catenin signaling and tumorigenesis in multiple cancer types.Cancer Res. 2016; 76: 713-723Google Scholar). However, a caveat of bulky antibody antagonists is that they are likely to inhibit both WNT agonist and BMP antagonist function of RSPO2 and RSPO3, thus compromising their specificity. We therefore sought to identify an inhibitor that would specifically target the BMP antagonist (RSPO2BMP) but not WNT agonist (RSPO2WNT) function of RSPO2. RSPOs harbor two furin-like repeat (FU1 and FU2) domains that engage ZNRF3/RNF43 and LGRs, respectively (16de Lau W. Peng W.C. Gros P. Clevers H.

C-terminally, they contain a thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) domain that mediates binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans and promotes WNT5A/planar cell polarity signaling (29Ohkawara B. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Rspo3 binds syndecan 4 and induces Wnt/PCP signaling via clathrin-mediated endocytosis to promote morphogenesis.Dev.

R-spondins engage heparan sulfate proteoglycans to potentiate WNT signaling.Elife. 2020; 9e54469Google Scholar). The key insight toward a BMP-specific inhibitor was our observation that RSPOs binds BMPR1A via its TSP1 domain (14Lee H. Seidl C. Sun R. Glinka A. Niehrs C. R-spondins are BMP receptor antagonists in Xenopus early embryonic development.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 5570Google Scholar). Building on this observation, we identified a 10-mer peptide (RW) derived from the RSPO2 TSP1 domain, which binds BMPR1A and competes RSPO2 binding. A RW peptide dendrimer (RWd) neutralizes the RSPO2-mediated decrease of BMP4 signaling without affecting WNT/β-catenin signaling. In THP-1 AML cells, RWd upregulates BMP signaling, induces cell differentiation, and inhibits cell growth independent of WNT signaling. Finally, administration of RWd to Xenopus embryos increases BMP signaling and induces ventralization during dorsoventral axis formation without affecting WNT signaling. Our study corroborates the RSPO2–BMP4 antagonism and provides a proof of concept that BMP antagonism and WNT agonism can be uncoupled by specific pharmacological intervention with the TSP1 domain of RSPO2 (RSPO2TSP1)–BMPR1A binding. Building on the specific interaction of RSPO2TSP1 with BMPR1A, we wondered whether a peptide derived from RSPO2TSP1 may compete with RSPO2 for BMPR1A binding (Fig. 1A). To this end, we scanned the TSP1 domain designing 11 overlapping 10 to 13 mer peptides derived from human RSPO2TSP1 (Fig. 1B). We set up a solid-phase binding assay with immobilized RSPO2TSP1 to which was added a fusion protein of alkaline phosphatase (AP) and the BMPR1AECD (extracellular domain). We then tested the TSP1-derived peptides as competitors, monitoring inhibition of AP-BMPR1AECD binding to RSPO2 in the solid-phase binding assay. At 100 μM, treatment with peptides RW (RNNRTSGFKW), DE (DTILSPTIAE), and SG (SRRSKMTMRHSPG) reduced the RSPO2TSP1–BMPR1AECD interaction greater than 50% (Fig. 1, C and D). Since RW was the most potent peptide, we focused on it and confirmed that it inhibited RSPO2TSP1–BMPR1AECD binding with an IC50 ≈40 μM (Fig. 1E). The RW sequence is only partially conserved in other RSPOs (Fig. 1F). An in vitro binding assay with biotinylated RW peptide confirmed that it binds BMPR1AECD directly (Fig. 1, G and H). We conclude that RW peptide derived from RSPO2TSP1 is a pseudoligand of BMPR1A that competes with RSPO2 for BMPR1A binding. Low storage stability and short half-life in vivo are known disadvantages of monomeric peptides (33Craik D.J. Fairlie D.P. Liras S. Price D. The future of peptide-based drugs.Chem. Biol. Drug Des. 2013; 81: 136-147Google Scholar, 34Sun A. Fang J. Yan J. Advance and development in research of bacterial drug-resistance signaling mechanism and multiple antigenic peptide-based vaccines.Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban. 2013; 42: 125-130Google Scholar, 35Vlieghe P. Lisowski V. Martinez J. Khrestchatisky M. Synthetic therapeutic peptides: Science and market.Drug Discov. Today. 2010; 15: 40-56Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that storage of reconstituted RW monomer reduces its ability to inhibit RSPO2–BMPR1A binding (Fig. S1A). To retain peptide stability, we tested covalent attachment of PEG to both N and C terminus of the peptide (PEG-RW) (36Roberts M.J. Bentley M.D. Harris J.M. Chemistry for peptide and protein PEGylation.Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2002; 54: 459-476Google Scholar). TK peptide, which showed no effect on RSPO2–BMPR1A interaction (Fig. 1, D and G), was also PEGylated and utilized as a control (PEG-TK). However, in cell surface–binding assays (Fig. S1, B–D), PEGylation of monomeric RW proved ineffective, since PEG-RW inhibited RSPO2–BMPR1A interaction only upon short-term (3 h) but not during long-term (16 h) treatment (Fig. S1, C and D). As alternative to PEGylation, we considered peptide oligomerization in peptide dendrimers, known to strengthen target binding by enhancing avidity (37Sadler K. Tam J.P. Peptide dendrimers: Applications and synthesis.J. Biotechnol. 2002; 90: 195-229Google Scholar) and to provide improved resistance to proteases (38Bracci L. Falciani C. Lelli B. Lozzi L. Runci Y. Pini A. De Montis M.G. Tagliamonte A. Neri P. Synthetic peptides in the form of dendrimers become resistant to protease activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46590-46595Google Scholar, 39Liu J. Gray W.D. Davis M.E. Luo Y. Peptide- and saccharide-conjugated dendrimers for targeted drug delivery: A concise review.Interface Focus. 2012; 2: 307-324Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested RW dendrimers where individual peptide monomers are assembled on an octavalent lysine core matrix, forming an 8-mer complex with expected size of ∼12 kDa. MiniPEG was either added to the N terminus of the RW dendrimer (N-PEG-RWd) or inserted as a linker between peptide monomer and core matrix (C-PEG-RWd) (Fig. 2A). As controls, we employed corresponding KR peptide derivatives, which did not affect RSPO2–BMPR1A interaction in vitro (Fig. S2A). To test whether RW dendrimer retains stability and ability to disrupt the RSPO2–BMPR1A interaction, we performed cell surface–binding assays in cells transfected with BMPR1A or with LGR4 that binds to the FU2 instead of the TSP1 domain (16de Lau W. Peng W.C. Gros P. Clevers H. The R-spondin/Lgr5/Rnf43 module: Regulator of Wnt signal strength.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 305-316Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Three-hour exposure to 20 μM RWd and N-PEG RWd abolished RSPO2 binding to BMPR1A transfected cells, whereas KRd and N-PEG KRd showed no effect (Fig. 2, C–F). RWd and N-PEG RWd were equally effective, indicating that PEGylation does not affect the efficacy of dendrimerized RW. Unlike monomeric RW peptide, 16 h of RWd and N-PEG RWd treatment was still able to completely disrupt RSPO2–BMPR1A binding (Fig. S2, B and C). Interestingly, 20 μM RWd was unable to abolish RSPO3 binding to BMPR1A transfected cells (Fig. 2, G and H). Altogether, these results suggest that RW peptide dendrimer is stable and potently competes the RSPO2–BMPR1A interaction without affecting LGR4 binding, which is required for WNT signal activation. Given that RSPO2 antagonizes BMP4 signaling (14Lee H. Seidl C. Sun R. Glinka A. Niehrs C. R-spondins are BMP receptor antagonists in Xenopus early embryonic development.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 5570Google Scholar, 26Sun R. He L. Lee H. Glinka A. Andresen C. Hubschmann D. Jeremias I. Muller-Decker K. Pabst C. Niehrs C. RSPO2 inhibits BMP signaling to promote self-renewal in acute myeloid leukemia.Cell Rep. 2021; 36: 109559Google Scholar), we expected that RWd derepresses RSPO2-mediated inhibition of BMP4 signaling. To test this prediction, we employed human hepatocellular carcinoma (HEPG2) cells, which harbor very low endogenous RSPO2 expression (14Lee H. Seidl C. Sun R. Glinka A. Niehrs C. R-spondins are BMP receptor antagonists in Xenopus early embryonic development.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 5570Google Scholar). BMP4 induced Smad1 phosphorylation (pSmad1), a hallmark of BMP signaling activation, and RSPO2 treatment inhibited this activation, as previously described (Fig. 3A) (14Lee H. Seidl C. Sun R. Glinka A. Niehrs C. R-spondins are BMP receptor antagonists in Xenopus early embryonic development.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 5570Google Scholar). Importantly, RWd but not KRd rescued the RSPO2-mediated but not the RSPO3-mediated decrease of pSmad1 levels, suggesting that RWd specifically impairs the BMP antagonist function of RSPO2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Administration of RWd without simultaneous treatment of RSPO2 showed no effect on pSmad1 level in HEPG2 cells (Fig. 3C). This result supports that RWd acts via RSPO2 to modulate BMP signaling. To corroborate this finding, we tested RWd on human lung carcinoma (H1581) cells, which express elevated levels of RSPO2 (14Lee H. Seidl C. Sun R. Glinka A. Niehrs C. R-spondins are BMP receptor antagonists in Xenopus early embryonic development.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 5570Google Scholar). Strikingly, RWd increased phosphorylation of Smad1 similar to RSPO2 deficiency (14Lee H. Seidl C. Sun R. Glinka A. Niehrs C. R-spondins are BMP receptor antagonists in Xenopus early embryonic development.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 5570Google Scholar, 26Sun R. He L. Lee H. Glinka A. Andresen C. Hubschmann D. Jeremias I. Muller-Decker K. Pabst C. Niehrs C. RSPO2 inhibits BMP signaling to promote self-renewal in acute myeloid leukemia.Cell Rep. 2021; 36: 109559Google Scholar) (Fig. 3D). BMP signaling activation is also known to induce phosphorylation of MAPKs, referred as a non-Smad1 BMP signaling (11Zhang Y.E. Non-Smad pathways in TGF-beta signaling.Cell Res. 2009; 19: 128-139Google Scholar, 12Cai J. Pardali E. Sanchez-Duffhues G. ten Dijke P. BMP signaling in vascular diseases.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 1993-2002Google Scholar, 40Miyazono K. Kamiya Y. Morikawa M. Bone morphogenetic protein receptors and signal transduction.J. Biochem. 2010; 147: 35-51Google Scholar, 41Zhang Y.E. Non-smad signaling pathways of the TGF-beta family.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2017; 9a022129Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed whether RWd derepresses RSPO2-mediated inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation. BMP4 induced P38 MAPK and P44/42 MAPK phosphorylation (pP38 and pP44/42), and RSPO2 treatment disrupted this activation. Similar to Smad1-dependent BMP4 signaling, RWd but not KRd rescued the RSPO2-mediated decrease of pP38 and pP44/42 levels (Fig. 3E), confirming that RWd diminishes the BMP antagonist function of RSPO2. In contrast to both Smad1 and non-Smad1 BMP signaling, RWd had no effect on WNT-mediated activation of β-catenin (Fig. 3F), corroborating that RW modulates BMP signaling specifically and confirming that the dual function of RSPO2 in BMP and WNT signaling can be uncoupled. Since RSPO2 antagonizes BMP4 signaling by inducing membrane clearance of BMPR1A (14Lee H. Seidl C. Sun R. Glinka A. Niehrs C. R-spondins are BMP receptor antagonists in Xenopus early embryonic development.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 5570Google Scholar), we hypothesized that RWd stabilizes BMPR1A at the plasma membrane. We monitored localization of overexpressed BMPR1A (BMPR1A-HA) by immunofluorescence and found indeed upon RWd but not KRd treatment an increase (approximately threefold) in the number of cells showing BMPR1A-HA membrane staining, similar to siRNA knockdown of RSPO2 (Fig. 3, G and H), consistent with our model of RW blocking the RSPO2–BMPR1A interaction (Fig. 1A). Collectively, we conclude that RWd derepresses BMP4–BMPR1A signaling by specifically neutralizing RSPO2 as a BMPR1A antagonist. We recently showed that RSPO2 inhibits BMP signaling in AML cells to maintain self-renewal and prevent differentiation independent of WNT signaling (26Sun R. He L. Lee H. Glinka A. Andresen C. Hubschmann D. Jeremias I. Muller-Decker K. Pabst C. Niehrs C. RSPO2 inhibits BMP signaling to promote self-renewal in acute myeloid leukemia.Cell Rep. 2021; 36: 109559Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether RWd could reduce endogenous RSPO2 activity of THP-1 AML cells to upregulate BMP signaling and thereby induce monocyte to macrophage (CD11B+) differentiation. Such an effect would mimic cell differentiation therapy of leukemic cells. Indeed, RWd but not KRd treatment induced pSmad1 (Fig. 4, A–C). Elevated pSmad1 levels were detected in nonmodified-treated cells, N-PEG-treated cells, and C-PEG RWd-treated cells, suggesting that PEGylation does not interfere with the functionality of RWd. Moreover, Dox-inducible shRSPO2 knockdown abolished the ability of RWd to induce pSMAD1, supporting that RWd functions via RSPO2 (Fig. S3, A and B). Importantly, by flow cytometric analysis, RWd treatment induced the number of CD11B+ cells up to ∼10-fold, indicating effective monocyte to macrophage differentiation (Fig. 4, D–F). Consistently, treatment with BMPR inhibitor LDN-193189 reverted induction of CD11B+ cell by RWd (Fig. 4G). To confirm that RWd increases BMP signaling and induces THP-1 differentiation independently of WNT signaling, we stimulated THP-1 cells with WNT3A, analyzed active β-catenin levels, and found them unaffected by RWd treatment (Fig. S3, C and D). We conclude that RWd specifically relieves BMP inhibition by RSPO2 in THP-1 cells and thereby induces their monocyte to macrophage differentiation. In AML, RSPO2 acts as autocrine growth factor to maintain self-renewal and cell proliferation (26Sun R. He L. Lee H. Glinka A. Andresen C. Hubschmann D. Jeremias I. Muller-Decker K. Pabst C. Niehrs C. RSPO2 inhibits BMP signaling to promote self-renewal in acute myeloid leukemia.Cell Rep. 2021; 36: 109559Google Scholar). Hence, inhibition of RSPO2 by RWd may provide a therapeutic benefit in AML, by derepressing BMP signaling and reducing cancer cell viability. Consistently, RWd efficiently reduced viability of THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with the IC50 of 1.8, 3.6, and 6.5 μM for nonmodified dendrimer, N-PEG dendrimer, and C-PEG dendrimer, respectively (Fig. 4, H–J). In contrast, immortalized human adult fibroblasts cell line (iHAFs) as control cells were less affected by RWd, tolerating 10-fold higher dendrimer treatment. Moreover, unlike RWd, KRd did not affect the viability of either THP-1 or iHAF cells. The results raise the possibility of a therapeutic window of higher sensitivity in AML cells to RSPO2BMP inhibition. To analyze the efficacy and specificity of RWd in vivo, we employed Xenopus embryos, where an activity gradient of BMP signaling regulates dorsoventral axis formation (42Harland R. Gerhart J. Formation and function of Spemann's organizer.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 611-667Google Scholar, 43De Robertis E.M. Larrain J. Oelgeschlager M. Wessely O.

Regionally specific induction by the Spemann-Mangold organizer.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 425-434Google Scholar), and Rspo2 acts as negative feedback regulator (14Lee H. Seidl C. Sun R. Glinka A. Niehrs C. R-spondins are BMP receptor antagonists in Xenopus early embryonic development.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 5570Google Scholar). The RW peptide sequence is completely conserved between human and Xenopus (Fig. 5A), suggesting that administration of RWd might impact Xenopus dorsoventral axis formation by upregulating BMP signaling. bmp4 overexpression characteristically induces ventralized embryos, featuring small heads and enlarged ventral structures (Fig. 5, C and D) (14Lee H. Seidl C. Sun R. Glinka A. Niehrs C. R-spondins are BMP receptor antagonists in Xenopus early embryonic development.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 5570Google Scholar). Hence, we injected RWd or KRd into the blastocoel cavity of Xenopus blastulae (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, injection of RWd, but not KRd, closely phenocopied bmp4 overexpression (Fig. 5, C and D) and expanded BMP target gene expression (sizzled) toward the dorsal side (Fig. 5, E and F) indicative of ventralization. Of note, both dendrimers induced only a minor growth retardation during gastrulation that may be due to blastocoel swelling after injection but showed no embryotoxicity. To confirm that RWd-mediated defects were due to upregulated BMP signaling but not reduced WNT signaling, we performed BMP-responsive Vent2 reporter assays (Fig. 5G) and WNT-responsive TopFlash reporter assays (Fig. 5H) using RWd injected embryos or KRd injected embryos. While RWd expectedly enhanced endogenous BMP signaling (Fig. 5G), it had no effect on WNT signaling, unlike antisense morpholino inhibition of the WNT receptor Lrp6 (Fig. 5H). The results indicate that RWd is stable in vivo and hyperactivates endogenous BMP signaling independently of WNT signaling. The dual function of RSPO2 as BMP antagonist and WNT agonist raises important questions about its mode of action in the many biological processes where RSPO2 is implicated, ranging from development to cancer (14Lee"

We aimed to conduct this prospective study to investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors influencing survival in patients with gastrointestinal cancer with SpVT.Fifty-one patients with gastrointestinal cancer diagnosed with SpVT were prospectively enrolled. The clinical characteristics and courses of SpVT were analyzed.SpVT occurred in various clinical situations (at the time of initial cancer diagnosis or tumor recurrence after curative therapy, in the postoperative period, during chemotherapy, or in the period of end-of-life care). Among the total patients, 90.2% had no SpVT-related symptoms at initial SpVT diagnosis, and 82.4% did not receive any anticoagulation therapy. The clinical course of SpVT during the follow-up varied: (1) spontaneous resorption without any anticoagulation (47.1%), (2) resorption with anticoagulation (3.9%), (3) persistent thrombosis without progression (17.6%), and (4) SpVT extension (31.4%). Although the SpVT showed extension in some cases, most of them did not cause symptoms or had little impact on the patient's cancer treatment course. During the follow-up period, 23 patients died, all of which were caused by tumor progression. In the multivariable analysis, performance status and clinical situation at the time of SpVT diagnosis were significant prognostic factors.Clinicians could adopt a strategy of close observation for incidentally detected SpVT in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Anticoagulation should be considered only for SpVT cases selected strictly, weighing the risks and benefits."
https://openalex.org/W4205861363,"RNA interference by type III CRISPR systems results in the synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) second messengers, which are known to bind and regulate various CARF domain-containing nuclease receptors. The CARF domain-containing Csa3 family of transcriptional factors associated with the DNA-targeting type I CRISPR systems regulate expression of various CRISPR and DNA repair genes in many prokaryotes. In this study, we extend the known receptor repertoire of cOA messengers to include transcriptional factors by demonstrating specific binding of cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA4) to Saccharolobus solfataricus Csa3 (Csa3Sso). Our 2.0-Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of cA4-bound full-length Csa3Sso reveals the binding of its CARF domain to an elongated conformation of cA4. Using cA4 binding affinity analyses of Csa3Sso mutants targeting the observed Csa3Sso•cA4 structural interface, we identified a Csa3-specific cA4 binding motif distinct from a more widely conserved cOA-binding CARF motif. Using a rational surface engineering approach, we increased the cA4 binding affinity of Csa3Sso up to ∼145-fold over the wildtype, which has potential applications for future second messenger-driven CRISPR gene expression and editing systems. Our in-solution Csa3Sso structural analysis identified cA4-induced allosteric and asymmetric conformational rearrangement of its C-terminal winged helix-turn-helix effector domains, which could potentially be incompatible to DNA binding. However, specific in vitro binding of the purified Csa3Sso to its putative promoter (PCas4a) was found to be cA4 independent, suggesting a complex mode of Csa3Sso regulation. Overall, our results support cA4-and Csa3-mediated cross talk between type III and type I CRISPR systems."
https://openalex.org/W4205992382,"Catabolite control protein A (CcpA) of the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is an essential DNA regulator for carbon catabolite repression and virulence, which facilitates bacterial survival and adaptation to a changing environment. Here, we report that copper (II) signaling mediates the DNA-binding capability of CcpA in vitro and in vivo. Copper (II) catalyzes the oxidation of two cysteine residues (Cys216 and Cys242) in CcpA to form intermolecular disulfide bonds between two CcpA dimers, which results in the formation and dissociation of a CcpA tetramer of CcpA from its cognate DNA promoter. We further demonstrate that the two cysteine residues on CcpA are important for S. aureus to resist host innate immunity, indicating that S. aureus CcpA senses the redox-active copper (II) ions as a natural signal to cope with environmental stress. Together, these findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism for CcpA activity through copper (II)-mediated oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W4206457650,"The potential antimicrobial compound Chuangxinmycin (CXM) targets the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. However, the specific steric recognition mode and interaction mechanism between CXM and TrpRS is unclear. Here, we studied this interaction using recombinant GsTrpRS from Geobacillus stearothermophilus by X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The crystal structure of the recombinant GsTrpRS in complex with CXM was experimentally determined to a resolution at 2.06 Å. After analysis using a complex-structure probe, MD simulations, and site-directed mutation verification through isothermal titration calorimetry, the interaction between CXM and GsTrpRS was determined to involve the key residues M129, D132, I133, and V141 of GsTrpRS. We further evaluated binding affinities between GsTrpRS WT/mutants and CXM; GsTrpRS was found to bind CXM through hydrogen bonds with D132 and hydrophobic interactions between the lipophilic tricyclic ring of CXM and M129, I133, and V141 in the substrate-binding pockets. This study elucidates the precise interaction mechanism between CXM and its target GsTrpRS at the molecular level and provides a theoretical foundation and guidance for the screening and rational design of more effective CXM analogs against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W4205548417,"Lysine N-pyrrolation, a posttranslational modification, which converts lysine residues to Nε-pyrrole-L-lysine, imparts electronegative properties to proteins, causing them to mimic DNA. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) has been identified as a soluble receptor for pyrrolated proteins (pyrP), and accelerated lysine N-pyrrolation has been observed in apoE-deficient (apoE-/-) hyperlipidemic mice. However, the impact of pyrP accumulation consequent to apoE deficiency on the innate immune response remains unclear. Here, we investigated B-1a cells known to produce germline-encoded immunoglobulin M (IgM) from mice deficient in apoE and identified a particular cell population that specifically produces IgM antibodies against pyrP and DNA. We demonstrated an expansion of B-1a cells involved in IgM production in the peritoneal cavity of apoE-/- mice compared with wild-type mice, consistent with a progressive increase of IgM response in the mouse sera. We found that pyrP exhibited preferential binding to B-1a cells and facilitated the production of IgM. B cell receptor analysis of pyrP-specific B-1a cells showed restricted usage of gene segments selected from the germline gene set; most sequences contained high levels of non-templated-nucleotide additions (N-additions) that could contribute to junctional diversity of B cell receptors. Finally, we report that a subset of monoclonal IgM antibodies against pyrP/DNA established from the apoE-/- mice also contained abundant N-additions. These results suggest that the accumulation of pyrP due to apoE deficiency may influence clonal diversity in the pyrP-specific B cell repertoire. The discovery of these unique B-1a cells for pyrP/DNA provides a key link connecting covalent protein modification, lipoprotein metabolism, and innate immunity."

To estimate meat demand in the Tamale Metropolis, we carried out a large-scale survey with more than 300 interviews. Furthermore, we also measured the awareness of processed meat products. Based on the results, our conclusions are as follows: Development of public services offers the opportunity to (1) gaining market power for ourselves while losing market power for others, (2) indirect takeover of control on political and civil societies while losing control for others, (3) to win allies and friends on one hand, potentially losing allies and friends on the other. After spatial analyses of grazing areas, animal markets, trading routes and witnessing the descriptions of basic macroeconomic differences within Ghana; we must conclude that live animal trade is south-orientated, where traders are able to bargain higher prices.

https://openalex.org/W4206180545,"Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) is a developmental liver disease that is caused by mutations in genes that encode ciliary proteins and is characterized by bile duct dysplasia and portal fibrosis. Recent work has demonstrated that mutations in ANKS6 can cause CHF due to its role in bile duct development. Here, we report a novel ANKS6 mutation, which was identified in an infant presenting with neonatal jaundice due to underlying biliary abnormalities and liver fibrosis. Molecular analysis revealed that ANKS6 liver pathology is associated with the infiltration of inflammatory macrophages to the periportal fibrotic tissue and ductal epithelium. To further investigate the role of macrophages in CHF pathophysiology, we generated a novel liver-specific Anks6 knockout mouse model. The mutant mice develop biliary abnormalities and rapidly progressing periportal fibrosis reminiscent of human CHF. The development of portal fibrosis in Anks6 KO mice coincided with the accumulation of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages in the mutant liver. Gene expression and flow cytometric analysis demonstrated the preponderance of M1- over M2-like macrophages at the onset of fibrosis. A critical role for macrophages in promoting peribiliary fibrosis was demonstrated by depleting the macrophages with clodronate liposomes which effectively reduced inflammatory gene expression and fibrosis, and ameliorated tissue histology and biliary function in Anks6 KO livers. Together, this study demonstrates that macrophages play an important role in the initiation of liver fibrosis in ANKS6-deficient livers and their therapeutic elimination may provide an avenue to mitigate CHF in patients."
https://openalex.org/W4221036033,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous condition that affects face perception. Evidence shows that there are differences in face perception associated with the processing of low spatial frequency (LSF) and high spatial frequency (HSF) of visual stimuli between non-symptomatic relatives of individuals with autism (broader autism phenotype, BAP) and typically developing individuals. However, the neural mechanisms involved in these differences are not fully understood. Here we tested whether face-sensitive event related potentials could serve as neuronal markers of differential spatial frequency processing, and whether these potentials could differentiate non-symptomatic parents of children with autism (pASD) from parents of typically developing children (pTD). To this end, we performed electroencephalographic recordings of both groups of parents while they had to recognize emotions of face pictures composed of the same or different emotions (happiness or anger) presented in different spatial frequencies. We found no significant differences in the accuracy between groups but lower amplitude modulation in the Late Positive Potential activity in pASD. Source analysis showed a difference in the right posterior part of the superior temporal region that correlated with ASD symptomatology of the child. These results reveal differences in brain processing of recognition of facial emotion in BAP that could be a precursor of ASD."
https://openalex.org/W4205486741,"The methyl-lysine readers plant homeodomain finger protein 20 (PHF20) and its homolog PHF20-like protein 1 (PHF20L1) are known components of the nonspecific lethal (NSL) complex that regulates gene expression through its histone acetyltransferase activity. In the current model, both PHF homologs coexist in the same NSL complex, although this was not formally tested; nor have the functions of PHF20 and PHF20L1 regarding NSL complex integrity and transcriptional regulation been investigated. Here, we perform an in-depth biochemical and functional characterization of PHF20 and PHF20L1 in the context of the NSL complex. Using mass spectrometry, genome-wide chromatin analysis, and protein-domain mapping, we identify the existence of two distinct NSL complexes that exclusively contain either PHF20 or PHF20L1. We show that the C-terminal domains of PHF20 and PHF20L1 are essential for complex formation with NSL, and the Tudor 2 domains are required for chromatin binding. The genome-wide chromatin landscape of PHF20-PHF20L1 shows that these proteins bind mostly to the same genomic regions, at promoters of highly expressed/housekeeping genes. Yet, deletion of PHF20 and PHF20L1 does not abrogate gene expression or impact the recruitment of the NSL complex to those target gene promoters, suggesting the existence of an alternative mechanism that compensates for the transcription of genes whose sustained expression is important for critical cellular functions. This work shifts the current paradigm and lays the foundation for studies on the differential roles of PHF20 and PHF20L1 in regulating NSL complex activity in physiological and diseases states."
