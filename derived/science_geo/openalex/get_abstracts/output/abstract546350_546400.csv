https://openalex.org/W2175465469,"Elevated postprandial blood glucose levels constitute a global epidemic and a major risk factor for prediabetes and type II diabetes, but existing dietary methods for controlling them have limited efficacy. Here, we continuously monitored week-long glucose levels in an 800-person cohort, measured responses to 46,898 meals, and found high variability in the response to identical meals, suggesting that universal dietary recommendations may have limited utility. We devised a machine-learning algorithm that integrates blood parameters, dietary habits, anthropometrics, physical activity, and gut microbiota measured in this cohort and showed that it accurately predicts personalized postprandial glycemic response to real-life meals. We validated these predictions in an independent 100-person cohort. Finally, a blinded randomized controlled dietary intervention based on this algorithm resulted in significantly lower postprandial responses and consistent alterations to gut microbiota configuration. Together, our results suggest that personalized diets may successfully modify elevated postprandial blood glucose and its metabolic consequences. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

Such improvements are conditional not only on technological innovation, but also on socio-economic factors that are at present poorly understood. Here we examine historical patterns of agricultural nitrogen-use efficiency and find a broad range of national approaches to agricultural development and related pollution. We analyse examples of nitrogen use and propose targets, by geographic region and crop type, to meet the 2050 global food demand projected by the Food and Agriculture Organization while also meeting the Sustainable Development Goals pertaining to agriculture recently adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. Furthermore, we discuss socio-economic policies and technological innovations that may help achieve them."
https://openalex.org/W2175514210,"Protein translation typically begins with the recruitment of the 43S ribosomal complex to the 5′ cap of mRNAs by a cap-binding complex. However, some transcripts are translated in a cap-independent manner through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we show that mRNAs containing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in their 5′ UTR can be translated in a cap-independent manner. A single 5′ UTR m6A directly binds eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), which is sufficient to recruit the 43S complex to initiate translation in the absence of the cap-binding factor eIF4E. Inhibition of adenosine methylation selectively reduces translation of mRNAs containing 5′UTR m6A. Additionally, increased m6A levels in the Hsp70 mRNA regulate its cap-independent translation following heat shock. Notably, we find that diverse cellular stresses induce a transcriptome-wide redistribution of m6A, resulting in increased numbers of mRNAs with 5′ UTR m6A. These data show that 5′ UTR m6A bypasses 5′ cap-binding proteins to promote translation under stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2174056659,"Although attentional abilities vary widely and have profound everyday effects, a standardized measure of these abilities is lacking. This study introduces a new fMRI measure based on patterns of whole-brain connectivity, which predicts adults' attention performance and children's ADHD symptoms from data acquired while individuals are resting in the scanner. Although attention plays a ubiquitous role in perception and cognition, researchers lack a simple way to measure a person's overall attentional abilities. Because behavioral measures are diverse and difficult to standardize, we pursued a neuromarker of an important aspect of attention, sustained attention, using functional magnetic resonance imaging. To this end, we identified functional brain networks whose strength during a sustained attention task predicted individual differences in performance. Models based on these networks generalized to previously unseen individuals, even predicting performance from resting-state connectivity alone. Furthermore, these same models predicted a clinical measure of attention—symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder—from resting-state connectivity in an independent sample of children and adolescents. These results demonstrate that whole-brain functional network strength provides a broadly applicable neuromarker of sustained attention."
https://openalex.org/W2214962513,"Dopamine cell firing can encode errors in reward prediction, providing a learning signal to guide future behavior. Yet dopamine is also a key modulator of motivation, invigorating current behavior. Existing theories propose that fast (phasic) dopamine fluctuations support learning, whereas much slower (tonic) dopamine changes are involved in motivation. We examined dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens across multiple time scales, using complementary microdialysis and voltammetric methods during adaptive decision-making. We found that minute-by-minute dopamine levels covaried with reward rate and motivational vigor. Second-by-second dopamine release encoded an estimate of temporally discounted future reward (a value function). Changing dopamine immediately altered willingness to work and reinforced preceding action choices by encoding temporal-difference reward prediction errors. Our results indicate that dopamine conveys a single, rapidly evolving decision variable, the available reward for investment of effort, which is employed for both learning and motivational functions."

https://openalex.org/W2179892239,"It has been suggested that carbon starvation, owing to reduced availability of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs), is an important contributor to tree mortality during drought in tropical rainforests; however, data from the world’s longest-running experimental drought study presented here show no evidence of carbon starvation, and instead the researchers conclude that impaired water hydraulic processes (involving the transport of water from soil to leaf) have a more important role in triggering tree death from long-term drought. It has been suggested that carbon starvation, caused by reduced availability of non-structural carbohydrates, is an important contributor to tree mortality during drought in tropical rainforests. Using data from the world's longest-running experimental drought study in tropical rainforest, these authors assess the importance of non-structural carbohydrates stores and how they are affected by drought in the long term. They find no evidence of carbon starvation, but instead conclude that impaired water hydraulic processes (involving the transport of water from soil to leaf) has a more important role in triggering tree death from drought. Drought threatens tropical rainforests over seasonal to decadal timescales1,2,3,4, but the drivers of tree mortality following drought remain poorly understood5,6. It has been suggested that reduced availability of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) critically increases mortality risk through insufficient carbon supply to metabolism (‘carbon starvation’)7,8. However, little is known about how NSC stores are affected by drought, especially over the long term, and whether they are more important than hydraulic processes in determining drought-induced mortality. Using data from the world’s longest-running experimental drought study in tropical rainforest (in the Brazilian Amazon), we test whether carbon starvation or deterioration of the water-conducting pathways from soil to leaf trigger tree mortality. Biomass loss from mortality in the experimentally droughted forest increased substantially after >10 years of reduced soil moisture availability. The mortality signal was dominated by the death of large trees, which were at a much greater risk of hydraulic deterioration than smaller trees. However, we find no evidence that the droughted trees suffered carbon starvation, as their NSC concentrations were similar to those of non-droughted trees, and growth rates did not decline in either living or dying trees. Our results indicate that hydraulics, rather than carbon starvation, triggers tree death from drought in tropical rainforest."
https://openalex.org/W2174361280,"L-Glutamine (Gln) functions physiologically to balance the carbon and nitrogen requirements of tissues. It has been proposed that in cancer cells undergoing aerobic glycolysis, accelerated anabolism is sustained by Gln-derived carbons, which replenish the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (anaplerosis). However, it is shown here that in glioblastoma (GBM) cells, almost half of the Gln-derived glutamate (Glu) is secreted and does not enter the TCA cycle, and that inhibiting glutaminolysis does not affect cell proliferation. Moreover, Gln-starved cells are not rescued by TCA cycle replenishment. Instead, the conversion of Glu to Gln by glutamine synthetase (GS; cataplerosis) confers Gln prototrophy, and fuels de novo purine biosynthesis. In both orthotopic GBM models and in patients, (13)C-glucose tracing showed that GS produces Gln from TCA-cycle-derived carbons. Finally, the Gln required for the growth of GBM tumours is contributed only marginally by the circulation, and is mainly either autonomously synthesized by GS-positive glioma cells, or supplied by astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2181090621,"Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a CAG ⋅ CTG expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. While most research has focused on the HTT polyGln-expansion protein, we demonstrate that four additional, novel, homopolymeric expansion proteins (polyAla, polySer, polyLeu, and polyCys) accumulate in HD human brains. These sense and antisense repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation proteins accumulate most abundantly in brain regions with neuronal loss, microglial activation and apoptosis, including caudate/putamen, white matter, and, in juvenile-onset cases, also the cerebellum. RAN protein accumulation and aggregation are length dependent, and individual RAN proteins are toxic to neural cells independent of RNA effects. These data suggest RAN proteins contribute to HD and that therapeutic strategies targeting both sense and antisense genes may be required for efficacy in HD patients. This is the first demonstration that RAN proteins are expressed across an expansion located in an open reading frame and suggests RAN translation may also contribute to other polyglutamine diseases."

Our results for the first time quantify atypical visual attention in ASD across multiple levels and categories of objects. People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show altered attention to, and preferences for, specific categories of visual information. When comparing social versus non-social stimuli, individuals with autism show reduced attention to faces as well as to other social stimuli such as the human voice and hand gestures but pay more attention to non-social objects (Dawson et al., 2005Dawson G.

Such atypical preferences are already evident early in infancy (Osterling and Dawson, 1994Osterling J. Dawson G.

Disord. 1994; 24: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), and the circumscribed attentional patterns in eye tracking data can be found in 2–5 year olds (Sasson et al., 2011Sasson N.J.

Children with autism demonstrate circumscribed attention during passive viewing of complex social and nonsocial picture arrays.Autism Res. 2008; 1: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Several possibly related attentional differences are reported in children with ASD as well, including reduced social and joint attention behaviors (Osterling and Dawson, 1994Osterling J. Dawson G. Early recognition of children with autism: a study of first birthday home videotapes.J. Autism Dev. Disord. 1994; 24: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) and orienting driven more by non-social contingencies rather than biological motion (Klin et al., 2009Klin A. Lin D.J. Gorrindo P. Ramsay G. Jones W. Two-year-olds with autism orient to non-social contingencies rather than biological motion.Nature. 2009; 459: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). We recently showed that people with ASD orient less toward socially relevant stimuli during visual search, a deficit that appeared independent of low-level visual properties of the stimuli (Wang et al., 2014Wang S. Xu J. Jiang M. Zhao Q. Hurlemann R. Adolphs R. Autism spectrum disorder, but not amygdala lesions, impairs social attention in visual search.Neuropsychologia. 2014; 63: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that visual attention in people with ASD is driven by atypical saliency, especially in relation to stimuli that are usually considered socially salient, such as faces. However, the vast majority of prior studies has used restricted or unnatural stimuli, e.g., faces and objects in isolation or even stimuli with only low-level features. There is a growing recognition that it is important to probe visual saliency with more natural stimuli (e.g., complex scenes taken with a natural background) (Itti et al., 1998Itti L. Koch C.

Chaminade T. Da Fonseca D. Silva C. Rosset D. Deruelle C. Just another social scene: evidence for decreased attention to negative social scenes in high-functioning autism.J. Autism Dev. Disord. 2012; 42: 1790-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, people with ASD seem to have similar attentional effects for animate objects, as do controls when measured with a change detection task (New et al., 2010New J.J. Schultz R.T. Wolf J. Niehaus J.L. Klin A. German T.C. Scholl B.J. The scope of social attention deficits in autism: prioritized orienting to people and animals in static natural scenes.Neuropsychologia. 2010; 48: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). What is missing in all these prior studies is a comprehensive characterization of the various attributes of complex visual stimuli that could influence saliency. We aimed to address this issue in the present study, using natural scenes with rich semantic content to assess the spontaneous allocation of attention in a context closer to real-world free viewing. Each scene included multiple dominant objects rather than a central dominant one, and we included both social and non-social objects to allow direct investigation of the attributes that may differentially guide attention in ASD. Natural scene stimuli are less controlled, therefore requiring more sophisticated computational methods for analysis, along with a larger sampling of different images. We therefore constructed a three-layered saliency model with a principled vocabulary of pixel-, object-, and semantic-level attributes, quantified for all the features present in 700 different natural images (Xu et al., 2014Xu J. Jiang M. Wang S. Kankanhalli M.S. Zhao Q. Predicting human gaze beyond pixels.J. Vis. 2014; 14: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike previous work that focused on one or a few object categories with fixed prior hypotheses (Benson et al., 2009Benson V. Piper J. Fletcher-Watson S.

Chaminade T. Da Fonseca D. Silva C. Rosset D. Deruelle C. Just another social scene: evidence for decreased attention to negative social scenes in high-functioning autism.J. Autism Dev. Disord. 2012; 42: 1790-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we used a data-driven approach free of assumptions that capitalized on using machine learning to provide an unbiased comparison among subject groups. Twenty people with ASD and 19 controls who matched on age, IQ, gender, race, and education (see Experimental Procedures; Table S1), freely viewed natural scene images for three seconds each (see Experimental Procedures for details). As can be seen qualitatively from the examples shown in Figure 1 (more examples in Figure S1), people with ASD made more fixations to the center of the images (Figures 1A–1D), fixated on fewer objects when multiple similar objects were present in the image (Figures 1E and 1F), and seemed to have atypical preferences for particular objects in natural images (Figures 1G–1L). To formally quantify these phenomena and disentangle their contribution to the overall viewing pattern of people with ASD, we applied a computational saliency model with support vector machine (SVM) classifier to evaluate the contribution of five different factors in gaze allocation: (1) the image center, (2) the grouped pixel-level (color, intensity, and orientation), (3) object-level (size, complexity, convexity, solidity, and eccentricity), (4) semantic-level (face, emotion, touched, gazed, motion, sound, smell, taste, touch, text, watchability, and operability; see Figure S2A for examples) features shown in each image, and (5) the background (i.e., regions without labeled objects) (see Experimental Procedures and Figure 2A for a schematic overview of the computational saliency model; see Table 1 for detailed description of features). Note that besides pixel-level features, each labeled object always had all object-level features and may have one or multiple semantic-level features (i.e., its semantic label[s]), whereas regions without labeled objects only had pixel-level features.Table 1A Summary of All Features Used in the Computational Saliency ModelFeature TypeFeature NameFeature DescriptionCenterA Gaussian map with σ = 1°BackgroundRegions without any labeled objects in the imagePixel levelColorColor channel in the Itti-Koch modelIntensityIntensity channel in the Itti-Koch modelOrientationOrientation channel in the Itti-Koch modelObject levelSizeThe square root of the object’s areaComplexityThe perimeter of the object’s outer contour divided by the square root of its areaConvexityThe perimeter of the object’s convex hull divided by the perimeter of its outer contourSolidityThe area of the object divided by the area of its convex hullEccentricityThe eccentricity value of an ellipse that has the same second-moments as the object regionSemantic levelFaceBack, profile, and frontal faces from human, animals, and cartoonsEmotionFaces from human, animals, and cartoons with emotional expressionsTouchedObjects touched by a human or animal in the sceneGazedObjects gazed upon by a human or animal in the sceneMotionMoving/flying objects, including humans/animals expressing meaningful gestures of postures that imply movementSoundObjects producing sound in the scene (e.g., a talking person, a musical instrument)SmellObjects with a scent (e.g., a flower, a fish, a glass of wine)TasteFood, drink, and anything that can be tastedTouchObjects with a strong tactile feeling (e.g., a sharp knife, a fire, a soft pillow, a cold drink)TextDigits, letters, words, and sentencesWatchabilityMan-made objects designed to be watched (e.g., a picture, a display screen, a traffic sign)OperabilityNatural or man-made tools used by holding or touching with handsOtherObjects labeled but not in any of the above categories Open table in a new tab Our computational saliency model could predict fixation allocation with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) score of 0.936 ± 0.048 (mean ± SD across 700 images) for people with ASD and 0.935 ± 0.043 for controls (paired t test, p = 0.52; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figures S2B and S2C), suggesting that all subsequent reported differences between the two groups could not be attributed to differences in model fit between the groups. Model fit was also in accordance with our prior work on an independent sample of subjects and a different model training procedure (Xu et al., 2014Xu J. Jiang M. Wang S. Kankanhalli M.S. Zhao Q. Predicting human gaze beyond pixels.J. Vis. 2014; 14: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) (0.940 ± 0.042; Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figures S2B and S2C). The computational saliency model outputs a saliency weight for each feature, which represents the relative contribution of that feature to predict gaze allocation. As can be seen in Figure 2B, there was a large image center bias for both groups, a well-known effect (e.g., Bindemann, 2010Bindemann M. Scene and screen center bias early eye movements in scene viewing.Vision Res. 2010; 50: 2577-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This was followed by effects driven by object- and semantic-level features. Note that before training the SVM classifier, we Z scored the feature vector for each feature dimension by subtracting it from its mean and dividing it by its SD. This assured that saliency weights could be compared and were not confounded by possibly different dynamic ranges for different features. Importantly, people with ASD had a significantly greater image center, background, and pixel-level bias, but a reduced object-level bias and semantic-level bias (see Figure 2B legend for statistical details). The ASD group did not have any greater variance in saliency weights compared with controls (one-tailed F test; all p > 0.94; significantly less variance for all features except pixel-level features). Notably, when we controlled for individual differences in the duration of total valid eye tracking data (due to slight differences in blinks, etc.; Figures S2D–S2G), as well as for the Gaussian blob size for objects, and Gaussian map σ for analyzing the image center, we observed qualitatively the same results (Figure S3), further assuring their robustness. Finally, we addressed the important issue that the different features in our model were necessarily intercorrelated to some extent. We used a leave-one-feature-out approach (Yoshida et al., 2012Yoshida M. Itti L. Berg D.J. Ikeda T. Kato R. Takaura K. White B.J. Munoz D.P. Isa T. Residual attention guidance in blindsight monkeys watching complex natural scenes.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 1429-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that effectively isolates the non-redundant contribution of each feature by training the model each time with all but one feature from the full model (“minus-one” model). The obtained relative contribution of features with this approach was still consistent with the results shown in Figure 2B (Figure S3), showing that our findings could not result from confounding correlations among features in our stimulus set. Note that the very first fixation in each trial was excluded from all analyses (see Experimental Procedures) since each trial began with a drift correction that required subjects to fixate on a dot at the very center of the image to begin with. When fitting the model for each fixation individually, fixation-by-fixation analysis confirmed the above results and further revealed how the relative importance of each factor evolved over time (Figure 3). Over successive fixations, both subject groups weighted objects (Figure 3D) and semantics (Figure 3E) more, but low-level features (Figures 3A–3C) less, suggesting that there was an increase in the role of top-down factors based on evaluating the meaning of the stimuli over time. This observation is consistent with previous findings that we initially use low-level features in the image to direct our eyes (“bottom-up attention”), but that scene understanding emerges as the dominant factor as viewing proceeds (“top-down attention”) (Mannan et al., 2009Mannan S.K.

The decreasing influence of the image center over time resulted from exploration of the image with successive fixations (Zhao and Koch, 2011Zhao Q. Koch C. Learning a saliency map using fixated locations in natural scenes.J. Vis. 2011; 11: 9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, people with ASD showed less of an increase in the weight of object and semantic factors, compared with controls, resulting in increasing group differences over time (Figures 3D and 3E) and a similar but inverted group divergence for effects of image background, pixel-level saliency, and image centers (Figures 3A–3C). Similar initial fixations were primarily driven by the large center bias for both groups, while the diverged later fixations were driven by object-based and semantic factors (note different y axis scales in Figure 3). Thus, these results show an atypically large saliency in favor of low-level properties of images (image center, background textures, and pixel-level features) over object-based properties (object and semantic features) in people with ASD. We further explore the differences in center bias and semantic attributes in the next sections. We examined whether the tendency to look at image center could be attributed to stimulus content. We first selected all images with no objects in the center 2° circular area, resulting in a total of 99 images. We then compared the total number of fixations in this area on these images. The ASD group had more than twice the number of fixations of the control group (ASD: 61.6 ± 34.1; controls: 29.1 ± 25.5; unpaired t test, t(37) = 3.36, p = 0.0018, effect size in Hedges’ g [standardized mean difference]: g = 1.06; permutation p < 0.001). We further analyzed temporal differences and observed that in the early stage of the free-viewing (the first second) the difference was smaller (ASD: 14.5 ± 10.2; controls: 7.74 ± 8.42; t(37) = 2.23, p = 0.032, g = 0.70; permutation p = 0.022), while in the second second (ASD: 16.9 ± 12.6; controls: 6.74 ± 5.71; t(37) = 3.22, p = 0.0027, g = 1.010; permutation p < 0.001) and the third second (ASD: 30.3 ± 16.6; controls: 14.6 ± 13.9; t(37) = 3.18, p = 0.0030, g = 1.00; permutation p = 0.008), the difference was larger. In conclusion, these findings suggested that the stronger center bias in people with ASD could not be attributed to object distribution in the images. The mean distance of all fixations from the image center was significantly smaller than in the control group (ASD: 5.63 ± 0.56°; controls: 6.17 ± 0.60°; unpaired t test, t(37) = −2.92, p = 0.0059, g = −0.92; permutation p = 0.010), and there were more fixations at the image center than periphery compared with the control group (Fisher’s exact test: p < 0.001). As viewing proceeded, people with ASD also tended to return to fixating more central locations, as shown by decreasing distance to center for later fixations (Figure S4A). This re-centering was even evident in individual trials. In exploratory analyses of individual differences, we found that subjects with higher Autism Quotient (AQ) scores (Pearson correlation; pooled ASD and controls: r = −0.42, p = 0.010; ASD only: r = −0.0064, p = 0.98; controls only: r = −0.095, p = 0.73; the correlation was primarily driven by the group difference; Figure 4A) and lower IQ (pooled ASD and controls: r = 0.33, p = 0.039; Figure 4B) looked closer to the image center, suggesting that stronger autistic traits and lower cognitive ability contribute to a more pronounced center bias. However, we found no correlation of center bias with age (pooled ASD and controls: r = −0.15, p = 0.38; Figure 4C), arguing against any simple explanation due to motor slowing. We note that these correlations should be considered exploratory due to the small sample sizes at this stage. Interestingly, we found that people with ASD had a smaller overall number of fixations, longer saccade durations, and reduced saccade velocity (Figure S4), all consistent with a difficulty in shifting attention to other locations. This in turn might contribute to the stronger center bias in people with ASD. Object fixations in ASD were also less well aligned with object centers (measured by average distance from the fixation to the centroid of the respective object region; ASD: 2.65 ± 0.12° [mean ± SD]; controls: 2.54 ± 0.098°; unpaired t test, t(37) = 3.28, p = 0.0023, g = 1.03; permutation p < 0.001), indicating an atypical foveation of visual objects in people with ASD. We verified model-based results with a more standard fixation-based analysis (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for full details). For effects at the semantic level, we compared fixation proportions, latency of the first fixation, and fixation duration (Figures 4D–4F). People with ASD had fewer fixations on semantic features but more fixations on the background (Figure 4D), and they fixated semantic features significantly later than did the control group (Figure 4E). Although the total fixation duration per trial was significantly shorter in people with ASD, their mean duration per fixation was longer (Figure 4F). In conclusion, fixation analysis confirmed the results derived from our saliency model and showed stronger attention to the background rather than to semantic features in people with ASD. In Figure 3, we found that both groups showed a decreasing weighting of low-level features (center bias, background textures, and pixel-level attributes) but an increasing weighting of object and semantic attributes as viewing proceeded. One major advantage of our natural scene stimuli was that there was a broad range of different semantic categories that could be compared. Therefore, we next used the expanded semantic feature set (treating each of the 12 semantic attributes as a different channel) to train the saliency model (Figures 2A, 5, and S5). We found that motion, smell, and touch features had significantly lower weights in people with ASD when training the model using all fixations (Figure 5). We also compared the evolution of saliency weights over serial order of fixations (Figure S5). As shown in Figure S5, saliency weights of most semantic categories increased over time, while low-level saliency weights decreased, confirming that semantic cues played a greater role as viewing proceeded. For most of the semantic-level features, the saliency weights for people with ASD were significantly lower than for controls, showing reduced attention to semantic features in ASD. Importantly, this difference only occurred at later fixations, consistent with the temporally increasing group differences in aggregate semantic weights we had shown earlier (Figure 3). It is notable that the weights of face and emotion attributes were relatively high for initial fixations, suggesting that these attributes attracted attention more rapidly, an effect that could not be explained by a possible center bias for faces appearing in the images (see Figures S6A and S6B). We next examined in more detail the face and emotion attributes, two attributes that are at the focus of autism research. We first observed that people with ASD had marginally reduced weights for faces (Figure 5; using all fixations: unpaired t test, t(37) = −1.71, p = 0.095, g = −0.54; permutation p = 0.088; also see Figure S5E for fixation-by-fixation weights; see Figures 1G and 1H for examples) but not emotion (t(37) = −0.042, p = 0.97, g = −0.013; permutation p ="
https://openalex.org/W2175824842,"Recent studies have provided conflicting accounts regarding where in the human brain visual short-term memory (VSTM) content is stored, with strong univariate fMRI responses being reported in superior intraparietal sulcus (IPS), but robust multivariate decoding being reported in occipital cortex. Given the continuous influx of information in everyday vision, VSTM storage under distraction is often required. We found that neither distractor presence nor predictability during the memory delay affected behavioral performance. Similarly, superior IPS exhibited consistent decoding of VSTM content across all distractor manipulations and had multivariate responses that closely tracked behavioral VSTM performance. However, occipital decoding of VSTM content was substantially modulated by distractor presence and predictability. Furthermore, we found no effect of target-distractor similarity on VSTM behavioral performance, further challenging the role of sensory regions in VSTM storage. Overall, consistent with previous univariate findings, our results indicate that superior IPS, but not occipital cortex, has a central role in VSTM storage."

Direct inhibition of LH GABA neurons, which received input from D1R-MSNs, fully recapitulated these findings. Together, our study resolves a feeding circuit that overrides immediate metabolic need to allow rapid consumption control in response to changing external stimuli. The repertoire of feeding behavior is incredibly diverse and incorporates both flexible preparatory actions, like foraging, and highly stereotyped consummatory responses, like mastication. These behavioral sequences must be enacted at appropriate times to fulfill homeostatic energy demands, but consumption also must remain flexible to respond to immediate changes in sensory or environmental conditions. For example, consumption must stop rapidly when foul food is encountered or if predators arise. Such behavior ensures survival, but in excess could lead to anorexia and weight loss. Conversely, when nutritious and palatable foods are found, prolonged consumption can occur in the absence of any immediate metabolic need (Zheng et al., 2009Zheng H. Lenard N.R. Shin A.C. Berthoud H.-R. Appetite control and energy balance regulation in the modern world: reward-driven brain overrides repletion signals.Int. J. Obes. 2009; 33: S8-S13Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Such feeding serves to accumulate useful energy stores, but in many societies the constant availability of energy-dense and palatable foods promotes overeating, leading to weight gain and obesity (Kenny, 2011Kenny P.J. Reward mechanisms in obesity: new insights and future directions.Neuron. 2011; 69: 664-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Describing neural circuits that can quickly override immediate metabolic need to control consumption in response to changing external conditions represents a necessary step toward identifying causalities in eating disorders and proposing rational treatments. In the lateral hypothalamus (LH), peripheral and central signals that influence food intake converge to generate an output to midbrain motor pattern generators that subserve the behavioral repertoire of feeding (Anand and Brobeck, 1951Anand B.K.

Moreover, increased feeding following NAcSh inhibition is prevented by concomitant infusion of a gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor agonist into the LH (Maldonado-Irizarry et al., 1995Maldonado-Irizarry C.S.

Mem. 2010; 17: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). From these studies, a model has been proposed in which inhibitory projections from the NAcSh to the LH serve as a sensory sentinel, allowing rapid control over food consumption in response to motivational or sensory signals (Baldo and Kelley, 2007Baldo B.A. Kelley A.E.

For instance, NAcSh inhibitory projection neurons can be classified into two distinct populations according to the dopamine receptor they express (Bocklisch et al., 2013Bocklisch C. Pascoli V.

Second, pharmacological manipulations, electrical stimulation, and unit recordings have lacked the temporal resolution or cell type specificity required to provide a causal link between activity in identified NAcSh-to-LH projection neurons and the control over moment-to-moment food intake. Finally, the LH contains an array of neurons that express different neuropeptides and neurotransmitters (Schöne and Burdakov, 2012Schöne C. Burdakov D. Glutamate and GABA as rapid effectors of hypothalamic “peptidergic” neurons.Front. Behav.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 11075-11082Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To address these issues, we established a paradigm in which food consumption could be monitored on a moment-to-moment basis in genetically modified mice, permitting the observation and control of identified cell types. We found that NAcSh D1R-MSNs provide the major source of accumbal inhibition to the LH and reduce their activity during food consumption. Inhibition of D1R-MSNs prolongs feeding in sated mice and even in the face of distracting external stimuli. Conversely, activation of D1R-MSN terminals in LH is sufficient to override immediate metabolic need and rapidly stop food consumption despite hunger. These findings were recapitulated by the direct inhibition of LH GABA neurons, which receive inhibition from D1R-MSNs. To determine the molecular identity of NAcSh neurons projecting to the LH, we first performed a retrograde tracing study, with injections of cholera-toxin subunit B (CTB) conjugated to a fluorescent dye into the LH of transgenic mice that permit identification of D1R- and D2R-MSNs (Figures 1A–1C). Injections were focused to the peduncular part of the LH, just lateral to the fornix and ventral to the zona incerta (Figures S1A and S1B; Paxinos and Franklin, 2008Paxinos G. Franklin K.B.J. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, 2008Google Scholar). Then, 11 days after the injection, coronal slices containing NAcSh were prepared to visualize colocalization of CTB with identified MSNs. Consistent with other neuroanatomical reports (Thompson and Swanson, 2010Thompson R.H. Swanson L.W. Hypothesis-driven structural connectivity analysis supports network over hierarchical model of brain architecture.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 15235-15239Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), prominent CTB labeling was seen in the medial NAcSh (Figure S1C). Few labeled cells were found in the NAcSh when CTB injections were made more medially into the anterior hypothalamic area (between the ventricle and the fornix) or more dorsal to the nigrostriatal tract (data not shown). In Drd1a-tdTomato mice (n = 3), a total of 1,246 CTB-containing cells (i.e., LH-projecting cells) were counted across the rostro-caudal extent of medial NAcSh. Of these cells, 1,173 (93.6% ± 0.8%, grouped mean ± SEM) were positive for tdTomato, identifying them as D1R-MSNs (Figures 1B and 1C). Notably, 60.3% ± 7.7% of D1R-MSNs did not express CTB, likely reflecting cells that project outside of the LH (Bocklisch et al., 2013Bocklisch C. Pascoli V. Wong J.C.Y. House D.R.C. Yvon C. de Roo M.

At the most rostral and most caudal NAcSh sites, the majority of LH-projecting neurons were identified as D1R-MSNs (minimum 89.7%; Figure S1D). However, in the bed nucleus stria terminalis (BNST), which lies caudally to the NAcSh and inhibits LH glutamate neurons to increase food intake (Jennings et al., 2013Jennings J.H. Rizzi G. Stamatakis A.M. Ung R.L. Stuber G.D. The inhibitory circuit architecture of the lateral hypothalamus orchestrates feeding.Science. 2013; 341: 1517-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), only a minority of LH-projecting neurons were positive for tdTomato (for dorsal BNST, grouped mean ± SEM, 15.1% ± 3.1%; for ventral BNST, 22.8% ± 3.5%, n = 5; Figure S2). Consistent with findings in Drd1a-tdTomato mice, in Drd2-eGFP animals (n = 2), a total of 593 CTB-positive cells were counted in the NAcSh, with only 29 cells (5.2% ± 1.1%, grouped mean ± SEM) positive for eGFP (Figures 1B and 1C). Taken together, these tracing studies show that the dominant projection from NAcSh to LH comprises D1R-MSNs. To explore the functional nature of the NAcSh-to-LH connection, an optogenetic-assisted circuit mapping approach was employed. First, the blue light-activated cation channel, channelrhodopsin (ChR2(H134R)), was expressed in D1R- or D2R-MSNs by injecting an adeno-associated virus (AAV) harboring a floxed-ChR2(H134R) construct into the NAcSh of D1RCre or D2RCre mice, respectively (Figures 1D and 1E). After 2 weeks, allowing time for ChR2(H134R) expression, acute coronal brain slices containing LH were prepared for ex vivo electrophysiology recordings. Cells in the LH were randomly patched while monitoring blue light-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) derived from D1R-MSN or D2R-MSN afferents. We observed that few ChR2(H134R)-eYFP-expressing fibers were present in the LH of D2RCre mice compared to D1RCre mice (Figure 4B). In D1RCre mice, light-evoked postsynaptic currents could be recorded in 56% of LH neurons (15 of 27 neurons, n = 3 mice; mean amplitude ± SEM, 630 ± 334 pA) that were blocked with picrotoxin (Figure 1E). This finding is consistent with previous in vivo recordings in rats, where 52.5% of subpallidal neurons received accumbal inhibition (Mogenson et al., 1983Mogenson G.J. Swanson L.W. Wu M. Neural projections from nucleus accumbens to globus pallidus, substantia innominata, and lateral preoptic-lateral hypothalamic area: an anatomical and electrophysiological investigation in the rat.J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar). By comparison, only 17% of LH neurons received inhibition from NAcSh D2R-MSNs (5 of 29 neurons, n = 3 mice; mean amplitude ± SEM, 177 ± 79 pA). Taken together, these data support neuronal tracing studies to show that D1R-MSNs comprise the dominant source of accumbal inhibition to the LH. Following our neuroanatomical data and based on prior descriptions of NAcSh-to-LH circuitry (Berthoud, 2004Berthoud H.-R.

Transitions between sleep and feeding states in rat ventral striatum neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2012; 108: 1739-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we predicted that D1R-MSN activity would reduce during food consumption, thus relieving inhibition from downstream LH neurons to authorize feeding. To test this prediction, we undertook in vivo unit recordings of optogenetically identified NAcSh D1R-MSNs in mice that were freely feeding a palatable liquid fat solution from a sipper tube (5% v/v Lipofundin in water; Figures 2A–2D and S2). Licks on the sipper tube were recorded with a lickometer, allowing the onset and offset of individual feeding events, termed bursts, to be monitored with high temporal resolution. Consistent with a permissive role in food intake control, the majority of optogenetically identified NAcSh D1R-MSNs reduced their activity during consumption onset (n = 5/9, p < 0.05 and n = 2/9, p < 0.1; Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and increased their activity concomitantly with consumption offset (n = 8/9, p < 0.05) (Figures 2B–2D and S3B). Non-light-responsive units (n = 2) showed no change in activity in relation to consumption onset or offset (Figures 2D, S3B, and S3C). We also recorded units that were inhibited by blue light (n = 4; Figures 2D, S3B, and S3D). Half of the light-inhibited units reduced activity during feeding onset and increased activity with feeding offset (p < 0.05), while the remaining units showed no change in activity during consumption onset. While we cannot be certain as to the identity of light-inhibited units, this response most likely arose from local recurrent collateral inhibition, which, in the dorsal striatum, is most common within D1R- or D2R-MSNs than between D1R- and D2R-MSNs (Taverna et al., 2008Taverna S. Ilijic E. Surmeier D.J. Recurrent collateral connections of striatal medium spiny neurons are disrupted in models of Parkinson’s disease.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5504-5512Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To contrast the activity of D1R-MSNs, we repeated in vivo unit-recording experiments in optogenetically identified D2R-expressing NAcSh neurons (D2RCre+ mice; Figures 2E, 2F, S3E, and S3F). D2R-expressing neurons did not reliably change activity in line with consumption onset (smallest p = 0.33 for n = 3/4, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) or offset (smallest p = 0.08 for n = 4/4). Taken together, unit-recording data suggest that NAcSh D1R-MSN activity reductions were key for allowing food intake, while D1R-MSN activity increases serve to stop and shift behavior away from feeding. Since the observed reductions in D1R-MSN activity that parallel food consumption are only correlational, we sought causal evidence by asking first if discrete photoinhibition of NAcSh D1R-MSNs could promote feeding. The orange light-gated inhibitory proton pump, eArch-3.0, was virally expressed in D1R-MSNs and fiber optics implanted targeting the NAcSh (Figures 3A and S6A). Whole-cell recordings of infected NAcSh neurons ex vivo confirmed that orange light illumination inhibited action potentials normally evoked by positive current injection (Figure 3A). In ad-libitum-fed D1RCre+ mice, orange light illumination of the NAcSh significantly increased liquid fat intake, compared to Cre− littermates that did not express eArch-3.0 (Figure 3B). Thus, a reduction in NAcSh D1R-MSN activity was sufficient to promote palatable food consumption, even when there was no immediate metabolic need to feed. We further questioned whether D1R-MSNs could fulfill the role of sensory sentinel previously ascribed to the NAcSh (Kelley et al., 2005aKelley A.E. Baldo B.A. Pratt W.E. A proposed hypothalamic-thalamic-striatal axis for the integration of energy balance, arousal, and food reward.J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 493: 72-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), by rapidly adjusting food intake in response to changing external conditions. To this end, we combined eArch-3.0-mediated optogenetic inhibition experiments with an unexpected stimulus distraction test (Figures 3C–3F). During alternating 10-min blocks of a 1-hr fat consumption session, feeding burst initiation was monitored in real time and triggered the presentation of a brief distractor stimulus (i.e., three consecutive licks, with interlick intervals (ILIs) of ≤1 s, triggered a 500-ms auditory/visual stimulus; Figure 3C). In control mice, the distractor stimulus was efficient in rapidly stopping ongoing consumption from one lick to the next, as shown by an increase in the frequency of bursts comprising only three licks (Figures 3D–3F). However, photoinhibition of D1R-MSNs led to a significant reduction in the efficiency of the distractor stimulus to stop ongoing feeding (Figures 3D–3F). To explore whether this result was unique to D1R-MSN inhibition, stimulus distraction experiments were repeated, but now with eArch-3.0-mediated inhibition of D2R-expressing NAcSh neurons (Figures 3G–3I and S4). As expected from the non-reactivity of these cells in unit-recording observations, photoinhibition of D2R-expressing NAcSh neurons did not alter the efficiency of a distractor stimulus to stop ongoing feeding (Figures 3G–3I). Collectively, these data show that reductions in NAcSh D1R-MSN activity are permissive for feeding and suggest that increases in D1R-MSN activity are required to rapidly stop and shift behavior away from consumption in response to salient external stimuli. Thus far, D1R-MSNs were observed and manipulated at the somatic level in NAcSh. If D1R-MSN activity was causally related to feeding owing to downstream inhibition in the LH, then this could be demonstrated in two ways. First, forcing activation of NAcSh D1R-MSN terminals in the LH should be sufficient to prevent consumption from occurring, even during hunger. Second, in line with findings from the stimulus distraction test, activation of D1R-MSN terminals in the LH should be sufficient to rapidly stop ongoing feeding from one moment to the next. To test the first prediction, ChR2(H134R) was expressed selectively in NAcSh D1R-MSNs with implanted fiber optics now targe"

A Rosetta-based computational strategy identifies a unique 184-residue sequence that adopts a TIM-barrel structure, as revealed by X-ray crystallography. Despite efforts for over 25 years, de novo protein design has not succeeded in achieving the TIM-barrel fold. Here we describe the computational design of four-fold symmetrical (β/α)8 barrels guided by geometrical and chemical principles. Experimental characterization of 33 designs revealed the importance of side chain–backbone hydrogen bonds for defining the strand register between repeat units. The X-ray crystal structure of a designed thermostable 184-residue protein is nearly identical to that of the designed TIM-barrel model. PSI-BLAST searches do not identify sequence similarities to known TIM-barrel proteins, and sensitive profile-profile searches indicate that the design sequence is distant from other naturally occurring TIM-barrel superfamilies, suggesting that Nature has sampled only a subset of the sequence space available to the TIM-barrel fold. The ability to design TIM barrels de novo opens new possibilities for custom-made enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2172956247,"The episodic nature of locomotion is thought to be controlled by descending inputs from the brainstem. Most studies have largely attributed this control to initiating excitatory signals, but little is known about putative commands that may specifically determine locomotor offset. To link identifiable brainstem populations to a potential locomotor stop signal, we used developmental genetics and considered a discrete neuronal population in the reticular formation: the V2a neurons. We find that those neurons constitute a major excitatory pathway to locomotor areas of the ventral spinal cord. Selective activation of V2a neurons of the rostral medulla stops ongoing locomotor activity, owing to an inhibition of premotor locomotor networks in the spinal cord. Moreover, inactivation of such neurons decreases spontaneous stopping in vivo. Therefore, the V2a ""stop neurons"" represent a glutamatergic descending pathway that favors immobility and may thus help control the episodic nature of locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W2175955272,"K-Ras and H-Ras share identical effectors and have similar properties; however, the high degree of tumor-type specificity associated with K-Ras and H-Ras mutations suggests that they have unique roles in oncogenesis. Here, we report that oncogenic K-Ras, but not H-Ras, suppresses non-canonical Wnt/Ca(2+) signaling, an effect that contributes strongly to its tumorigenic properties. K-Ras does this by binding to calmodulin and so reducing CaMKii activity and expression of Fzd8. Restoring Fzd8 in K-Ras mutant pancreatic cells suppresses malignancy, whereas depletion of Fzd8 in H-Ras(V12)-transformed cells enhances their tumor initiating capacity. Interrupting K-Ras-calmodulin binding using genetic means or by treatment with an orally active protein kinase C (PKC)-activator, prostratin, represses tumorigenesis in K-Ras mutant pancreatic cancer cells. These findings provide an alternative way to selectively target this ""undruggable"" protein."
https://openalex.org/W2187976196,"The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is of paramount importance in development and disease. An emergent question is whether the upstream cascade of the canonical Wnt pathway has physiologically relevant roles beyond β-catenin-mediated transcription, which is difficult to study due to the pervasive role of this protein. Here, we show that transcriptionally silent spermatozoa respond to Wnt signals released from the epididymis and that mice mutant for the Wnt regulator Cyclin Y-like 1 are male sterile due to immotile and malformed spermatozoa. Post-transcriptional Wnt signaling impacts spermatozoa through GSK3 by (1) reducing global protein poly-ubiquitination to maintain protein homeostasis; (2) inhibiting septin 4 phosphorylation to establish a membrane diffusion barrier in the sperm tail; and (3) inhibiting protein phosphatase 1 to initiate sperm motility. The results indicate that Wnt signaling orchestrates a rich post-transcriptional sperm maturation program and invite revisiting transcription-independent Wnt signaling in somatic cells as well."

Thyroid progenitors derived from mouse PSCs can be matured into thyroid follicular organoids that provide functional secretion of thyroid hormones in vivo and rescue hypothyroid mice after transplantation. Moreover, by stimulating the same pathways, we were also able to derive human thyroid progenitors from normal and disease-specific iPSCs generated from patients with hypothyroidism resulting from NKX2-1 haploinsufficiency.

A central aim of learning in biological organisms is to maximize reward. To achieve this aim, animals must learn what stimuli and actions predict an often-delayed reward and when the reward is likely to arrive. This poses a fundamental question regarding the synaptic mechanisms of learning: How can a delayed reward gate plasticity in synapses that were transiently activated by the predictive stimulus? A theoretical solution proposed decades ago to bridge the temporal gap between stimulus and reward, the so-called credit assignment problem, is the notion that neural activity generates silent and transient “synaptic eligibility traces” that can be transformed into long-term changes in synaptic strength by reward-linked neuromodulators (Crow, 1968Crow T.J.

Historically, neuroplasticity associated with reward has been studied primarily in the dopaminergic system and its projection areas, including basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex, which are involved in detecting reward and orchestrating the appropriate response. However, the process of learning to recognize the reward-predicting stimuli likely involves remodeling in primary sensory cortices as well. Cells in primary sensory cortices can predict essential attributes of the reward, including timing (Poort et al., 2015Poort J. Khan A.G. Pachitariu M. Nemri A. Orsolic I. Krupic J. Bauza M. Sahani M.

We examined the existence of eligibility traces in layer II/III pyramidal cells in slices from both visual and prefrontal cortices. An important motivation was the observation in the visual cortex that the Hebbian induction of LTP and long-term depression (LTD) depends crucially on not only glutamate receptors but also neuromodulator receptors coupled to Gs and Gq (Choi et al., 2005Choi S.-Y. Chang J. Jiang B. Seol G.-H. Min S.-S. Han J.-S. Shin H.S. Gallagher M. Kirkwood A. Multiple receptors coupled to phospholipase C gate long-term depression in visual cortex.J.

Neurosci. 2014; 34: 15888-15897Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In reinforcement learning, reward is typically delayed. We therefore tested whether neuromodulators could also act in a retrograde manner to allow synaptic changes when applied after conditioning. In both visual and prefrontal cortices, we demonstrated the Hebbian induction of short-lived eligibility traces that can be converted into either LTP or LTD by specific monoamines. We found that LTP- and LTD-associated traces have different dynamics, and we demonstrated the functional significance of these different dynamics by showing that temporal competition between these eligibility traces produces stable learning that allows a recurrent neural network to predict the arrival time of reward. As mentioned earlier, in cortex, unlike other structures such as the hippocampus, the induction of Hebbian plasticity depends critically on the activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such that blockade of these receptors or depletion of the endogenous neuromodulators prevents LTP and LTD (Choi et al., 2005Choi S.-Y. Chang J. Jiang B. Seol G.-H. Min S.-S. Han J.-S. Shin H.S. Gallagher M. Kirkwood A. Multiple receptors coupled to phospholipase C gate long-term depression in visual cortex.J.

Moreover, because of this GPCR dependency, under certain experimental conditions, including ours, the Hebbian induction of synaptic plasticity with spike-timing (ST)-dependent conditioning requires the addition of exogenous neuromodulators (Edelmann and Lessmann, 2013Edelmann E.

We exploited this fact to directly test the induction of eligibility traces in cortical slices by determining whether ST conditioning can result in LTP or LTD if it is rapidly followed by an application of neuromodulator agonists. The neuromodulators tested were norepinephrine (NE), serotonin, dopamine (DA), and acetylcholine, all of which have been implicated in cortical plasticity. We first focused on the primary visual cortex, where reward-based changes are well established in both primates (including humans) and rodents (Goltstein et al., 2013Goltstein P.M. Coffey E.B.J.

The recordings were done in layer II/III pyramidal cells and involved activation of two independent layer IV to layer II/III pathways, which were conditioned simultaneously with near-coincidental pre- and postsynaptic stimulation (ST conditioning, Figures 1A and 1B ). In one pathway, presynaptic stimulation preceded a burst of postsynaptic potentials by 10 ms (pre-post, to promote LTP); in the other one, it occurred 10 ms after the burst (post-pre, to promote LTD). Neuromodulators were pressure ejected from a nearby pipette beginning immediately after ST conditioning and continuing for 10 s. As expected, under control conditions, the ST conditioning elicited no plasticity (Figure 1C, pre-post: p = 0.563; post-pre: p = 0.156), but plasticity was observed when the ST conditioning was immediately followed by pressure ejection of NE (50 μM, 10 s) or serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT; 50 μM, 10 s). NE selectively potentiated the pre-post pathway without affecting the post-pre pathway (Figure 1D, pre-post: p = 0.002; post-pre: p = 0.232); conversely, 5-HT selectively depressed the post-pre pathway but not the pre-post pathway (Figure 1E, pre-post: p = 0.160; post-pre: p = 0.002). Pressure ejection of the agonists alone in naive (non-conditioned) pathways had no lasting effect on synaptic strength (NE only: 102.9% ± 5.6%, n = 6; 5-HT only: 102.8% ± 8.5%, n = 5; data not shown), confirming that the monoamine agonists were converting previously induced eligibility traces into changes of synaptic strength. In contrast to NE and 5-HT, no effect was observed with DA application (50 μM) (Figure 1F, pre-post: p = 0.843; post-pre: p = 1), which is not surprising given that dopaminergic transmission is minimal in the visual cortex. Similarly, application of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh: 250 μM) (Figure 1G, pre-post: p = 0.742; post-pre: p = 0.547) after ST conditioning did not affect the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), even with a long (5 min) puff duration (Figure S1A). However, and confirming previous findings (Kirkwood et al., 1999Kirkwood A. Rozas C. Kirkwood J. Perez F. Bear M.F. Modulation of long-term synaptic depression in visual cortex by acetylcholine and norepinephrine.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1599-1609PubMed Google Scholar), the long CCh exposure promoted LTD induction if applied before the ST conditioning (Figure S1B). Thus, only a subset of neuromodulators can transform eligibility traces into LTP and LTD. The induction of the traces, however, is a general phenomenon not restricted to ST conditioning, and it can be achieved by pairing synaptic stimulation (10 Hz, 20 s) with sustained postsynaptic depolarization (−10 mV for LTP and −40 mV for LTD). Conditioning by pairing to −10 mV depolarization produced a modest LTP (109.64 ± 3.59%, n = 8, p = 0.005, data not shown). Consistent with the crucial role of neuromodulators in cortical LTP (Choi et al., 2005Choi S.-Y. Chang J. Jiang B. Seol G.-H. Min S.-S. Han J.-S. Shin H.S. Gallagher M. Kirkwood A.

D1/D5 dopamine receptor activation increases the magnitude of early long-term potentiation at CA1 hippocampal synapses.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7478-7486PubMed Google Scholar). In these depleted slices, however, LTP developed robustly when NE was puffed on after the conditioning protocol (131.28% ± 7.08%, n = 7, p = 0.006. Figure S1C). Similarly, 10 Hz stimulation paired to −40 mV depolarization alone was not able to induce LTD (106.3% ± 7.0%, n = 9, Figure S1D) in the reserpine-injected mouse. However, it caused prominent LTD when immediately followed by the 5-HT puff (78.2% ± 6.8%, n = 9, p = 0.027, Figure S1D). To evaluate the generality of the eligibility traces, we extended the studies to layer II/III synapses of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which is highly innervated by dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic fibers and has been implicated in multiple forms of reward-based learning (Kahnt et al., 2011Kahnt T.

Frontal cortex and reward-guided learning and decision-making.Neuron. 2011; 70: 1054-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). As in the visual cortex, NE (50 μM, 10 s) transformed the trace in the pre-post pathway into LTP (Figure 2A, p = 0.01) and 5-HT (50 μM, 10 s) transformed the trace in the post-pre pathway into LTD (Figure 2B, p = 0.008). Unlike in the visual cortex, however, DA (50 μM, 10 s) did transform the trace in the pre-post pathway into LTP (Figure 2C, p = 0.01). However, CCh was ineffective in either pathway (Figure 2D, pre-post: p = 0.156; post-pre: p = 0.125). Altogether, these results indicate that eligibility traces for LTP and LTD can be induced in a Hebbian manner and that distinct and specific monoamine neuromodulators can transform these invisible traces into long-term synaptic plasticity throughout many cortical areas. Although puffing neuromodulators at a high concentration yields consistent results, this paradigm may not resemble conditions in vivo. Therefore, we tested a more physiological paradigm for the transformation of eligibility traces by releasing endogenous neuromodulators with optogenetics in TH-ChR2 and Tph2-ChR2 mice, which express channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in adrenergic or dopaminergic (Figure S2) and serotonergic nuclei (Zhao et al., 2011Zhao S. Ting J.T. Atallah H.E. Qiu L. Tan J. Gloss B. Augustine G.J. Deisseroth K. Luo M. Graybiel A.M. et al.Cell type-specific channelrhodopsin-2 transgenic mice for optogenetic dissection of neural circuitry function.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), respectively. Similar to puffing, release of endogenous NE only transformed the LTP eligibility trace (Figure 3A, pre-post: p = 0.039) while endogenous 5-HT only transformed the LTD trace (Figure 3C, post-pre: p = 0.002) in the visual cortex. Importantly, the transformation of the long-term potentiation or depression (LTP/D) traces only happened when the monoamines were released after the Hebbian conditioning, not before (Figures 3B and 3D). The requirement for a strict temporal order between the ST conditioning and the phasic release of neuromodulators mirrors the sequential order of stimulus-reward in reinforcement learning. Reinforced learning in behaving animals occurs over multiple stimulus-reward epochs spaced in time (Chubykin et al., 2013Chubykin A.A. Roach E.B. Bear M.F. Shuler M.G. A cholinergic mechanism for reward timing within primary visual cortex.Neuron. 2013; 77: 723-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Seitz et al., 2009Seitz A.R. Kim D. Watanabe T. Rewards evoke learning of unconsciously processed visual stimuli in adult humans.Neuron. 2009; 61: 700-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This differs from the protocols we used earlier, which were chosen to demonstrate unequivocally the induction and transformation of the eligibility traces. In this study, we delivered the neuromodulators just once after 200 Hebbian conditionings that were massed into a single induction epoch. To better mirror reinforcement learning, we tested whether optogenetic reinforcement of individual ST-conditioning epochs (40 pre-post or post-pre pairings spaced by 20 s intervals) can also result in LTP/D. In slices from TH-ChR2 mice, 1 s trains of blue light pulses (10 ms at 10 Hz) that were flashed immediately after each pre-post conditioning epoch induced robust LTP (Figure 4A, p1, p = 0.016). Similarly, in the Tph2-ChR2 mice, the blue light flashed immediately after each post-pre conditioning epoch induced LTD (Figure 4B, p1, p = 0.002). In both cases (Figures 4A and 4B), synaptic responses in control pathways that were conditioned with the ST epochs but out of phase with the blue light flashes (10 s gap) did not change (p2, pre-post only: p = 0.164, Figure 4A; p2, post-pre only: p = 0.734, Figure 4B). Altogether, these results indicate that the monoamine-mediated transformation of eligibility traces is a physiologically plausible mechanism to encode reward-based learning in vivo. Previously we showed that stimulation of the Gs- and Gq-coupled receptors promotes LTP and LTD, respectively (Seol et al., 2007Seol G.H. Ziburkus J. Huang S. Song L. Kim I.T. Takamiya K. Huganir R. Lee H.K. Kirkwood A. Neuromodulators control the polarity of spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity.Neuron. 2007; 55: 919-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). It was surprising therefore that NE and DA, which stimulate both types of receptors, only affected the eligibility traces for LTP. Only 5-HT acted on the LTD traces. To solve this conundrum, we first set out to identify the relevant neuromodulator receptors using receptor-specific antagonists. One attractive candidate among the adrenoreceptors coupled to Gs were beta 2 adrenergic receptors (β2ARs), which are enriched in spines and promote LTP (Davare et al., 2001Davare M.A. Avdonin V. Hall D.D. Peden E.M. Burette A. Weinberg R.J. Horne M.C. Hoshi T. Hell J.W. A beta2 adrenergic receptor signaling complex assembled with the Ca2+ channel Cav1.2.Science. 2001; 293: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, Qian et al., 2012Qian H. Matt L. Zhang M. Nguyen M. Patriarchi T. Koval O.M. Anderson M.E. He K. Lee H.-K. Hell J.W. β2-Adrenergic receptor supports prolonged theta tetanus-induced LTP.J. Neurophysiol. 2012; 107: 2703-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We found that the β2AR antagonist (ICI 118,551, 1 μM) blocked the transformation of the LTP traces by NE (Figure 5A). Moreover, the beta adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (Iso, 50 μM) was sufficient to transform the LTP trace, as was direct elevation of the intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) level, which is consistent with the role of β2AR stimulation in cAMP production (Figure S3). On the other hand, the generic 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin (1 μM) blocked the transformation of the LTD trace (99.97% ± 6.75%, n = 7, data not shown). In addition, and consistent with the absence of 5-HT2A receptors in layer II/III (Weber and Andrade, 2010Weber E.T. Andrade R. Htr2a gene and 5-HT(2A) receptor expression in the cerebral cortex studied using genetically modified mice.Front. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar), the specific 5-HT2C receptor (5-HT2CR) antagonist RS 102221 (1 μM) was sufficient to block the transformation of the LTD traces by 5-HT (Figure 5B). Thus, although multiple Gs- and Gq-coupled receptors, including the noradrenergic α1 and the cholinergic m1, may prime the subsequent induction of synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex, our results strongly suggest that β2AR and 5-HT2CR are mainly responsible for transforming previously induced eligibility traces. One possible determinant of the specific role of β2AR and 5-HT2CR in trace transformation is the subcellular location of these receptors. Both receptors can directly interact with PDZ domain-containing proteins such as postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and/or MUPP1 (Becamel et al., 2001Becamel C. Figge A. Poliak S. Dumuis A.

Therefore, we tested the effects of disrupting their interaction with PDZ proteins by adding the C-terminal peptides of β2AR (DSPL: 50 μM) or 5-HT2CR (2C-ct: 50 μM) to the recording electrode (Gavarini et al., 2006Gavarini S.

https://openalex.org/W2181193101,"Synapses are often far from their cell bodies and must largely independently cope with dysfunctional proteins resulting from synaptic activity and stress. To identify membrane-associated machines that can engulf synaptic targets destined for degradation, we performed a large-scale in vitro liposome-based screen followed by functional studies. We identified a presynaptically enriched chaperone Hsc70-4 that bends membranes based on its ability to oligomerize. This activity promotes endosomal microautophagy and the turnover of specific synaptic proteins. Loss of microautophagy slows down neurotransmission while gain of microautophagy increases neurotransmission. Interestingly, Sgt, a cochaperone of Hsc70-4, is able to switch the activity of Hsc70-4 from synaptic endosomal microautophagy toward chaperone activity. Hence, Hsc70-4 controls rejuvenation of the synaptic protein pool in a dual way: either by refolding proteins together with Sgt, or by targeting them for degradation by facilitating endosomal microautophagy based on its membrane deforming activity."

We employ bait RAG-generated breaks in endogenous or ectopically inserted RSS pairs to identify huge numbers of RAG ""off-target"" breaks. Such breaks occur at the simple CAC motif that defines the RSS cleavage site and are largely confined within convergent CTCF-binding element (CBE)-flanked loop domains containing bait RSS pairs. Marked orientation dependence of RAG off-target activity within loops spanning up to 2 megabases implies involvement of linear tracking. In this regard, major RAG off-targets in chromosomal translocations occur as convergent RSS pairs at enhancers within a loop. Finally, deletion of a CBE-based IgH locus element disrupts V(D)J recombination domains and, correspondingly, alters RAG on- and off-target distributions within IgH. Our findings reveal how RAG activity is developmentally focused and implicate mechanisms by which chromatin domains harness biological processes within them."

In vivo fiber photometry analyses in freely moving mice indicated that innate but not learned-fear stimuli suppressed the activity of Htr2a-expressing CeA cells. Artificial inactivation of these cells upregulated innate-freezing response and downregulated learned-freezing response.

However, such a flexible signal is not suitable for habitual behaviors that are sustained regardless of recent changes in reward outcome. We discovered a type of dopamine neuron in the monkey substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that retains past learned reward values stably. After reward values of visual objects are learned, these neurons continue to respond differentially to the objects, even when reward is not expected. Responses are strengthened by repeated learning and are evoked upon presentation of the objects long after learning is completed. These “sustain-type” dopamine neurons are confined to the caudal-lateral SNc and project to the caudate tail, which encodes long-term value memories of visual objects and guides gaze automatically to stably valued objects. This population of dopamine neurons thus selectively promotes learning and retention of habitual behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2173261030,"The authors uncover a therapeutic vulnerability to PARP inhibition of acute myeloid leukemias driven by certain oncogenic fusions, and they unravel the mechanisms by which these cancers rely on DNA damage and repair pathways for growth. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is mostly driven by oncogenic transcription factors, which have been classically viewed as intractable targets using small-molecule inhibitor approaches. Here we demonstrate that AML driven by repressive transcription factors, including AML1-ETO (encoded by the fusion oncogene RUNX1-RUNX1T1) and PML-RARα fusion oncoproteins (encoded by PML-RARA) are extremely sensitive to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition, in part owing to their suppressed expression of key homologous recombination (HR)-associated genes and their compromised DNA-damage response (DDR). In contrast, leukemia driven by mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL, encoded by KMT2A) fusions with dominant transactivation ability is proficient in DDR and insensitive to PARP inhibition. Intriguingly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of an MLL downstream target, HOXA9, which activates expression of various HR-associated genes, impairs DDR and sensitizes MLL leukemia to PARP inhibitors (PARPis). Conversely, HOXA9 overexpression confers PARPi resistance to AML1-ETO and PML-RARα transformed cells. Together, these studies describe a potential utility of PARPi-induced synthetic lethality for leukemia treatment and reveal a novel molecular mechanism governing PARPi sensitivity in AML."

New centrioles assemble perpendicularly to pre-existing ones in G1–S and elongate throughout S and G2. Fully elongated daughter centrioles are converted into centrosomes during mitosis to be able to duplicate and organize pericentriolar material in the next cell cycle. Here we show that centriole-to-centrosome conversion requires sequential loading of Cep135, Ana1 (Cep295) and Asterless (Cep152) onto daughter centrioles during mitotic progression in both Drosophila melanogaster and human. This generates a molecular network spanning from the inner- to outermost parts of the centriole. Ana1 forms a molecular strut within the network, and its essential role can be substituted by an engineered fragment providing an alternative linkage between Asterless and Cep135. This conserved architectural framework is essential for loading Asterless or Cep152, the partner of the master regulator of centriole duplication, Plk4. Our study thus uncovers the molecular basis for centriole-to-centrosome conversion that renders daughter centrioles competent for motherhood.

The authors characterize a role for TMEM107, a protein mutated in the ciliopathy Joubert syndrome, in organizing a submodule of the TZ. The transition zone (TZ) ciliary subcompartment is thought to control cilium composition and signalling by facilitating a protein diffusion barrier at the ciliary base. TZ defects cause ciliopathies such as Meckel–Gruber syndrome (MKS), nephronophthisis (NPHP) and Joubert syndrome1 (JBTS). However, the molecular composition and mechanisms underpinning TZ organization and barrier regulation are poorly understood. To uncover candidate TZ genes, we employed bioinformatics (coexpression and co-evolution) and identified TMEM107 as a TZ protein mutated in oral–facial–digital syndrome and JBTS patients. Mechanistic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans showed that TMEM-107 controls ciliary composition and functions redundantly with NPHP-4 to regulate cilium integrity, TZ docking and assembly of membrane to microtubule Y-link connectors. Furthermore, nematode TMEM-107 occupies an intermediate layer of the TZ-localized MKS module by organizing recruitment of the ciliopathy proteins MKS-1, TMEM-231 (JBTS20) and JBTS-14 (TMEM237). Finally, MKS module membrane proteins are immobile and super-resolution microscopy in worms and mammalian cells reveals periodic localizations within the TZ.

These studies involved co-activation of a membrane-tethered GFP lineage label, allowing for direct visualization and isolation of cells undergoing Kras and mutant p53 activation. Kras activation in Mist1(+) adult acinar cells resulted in brisk PanIN formation, whereas no evidence of pancreatic neoplasia was observed for up to 6 months following Kras activation in Hnf1beta(+) adult ductal cells. In contrast to the lack of response to oncogenic Kras alone, simultaneous activation of Kras and mutant p53 in adult ductal epithelium generated invasive PDAC in 75% of mice as early as 2.5 months after tamoxifen administration.

In addition, proximity measurements support formation of preassembled apo-GHSR1a:DRD1:Gαq heteromeric complexes in hippocampal neurons. Activation by a DRD1 agonist produced non-canonical signal transduction via Gαq-PLC-IP3-Ca2+ at the expense of canonical DRD1 Gαs cAMP signaling to result in CaMKII activation, glutamate receptor exocytosis, synaptic reorganization, and expression of early markers of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Remarkably, this pathway is blocked by genetic or pharmacological inactivation of GHSR1a. In mice, GHSR1a inactivation inhibits DRD1-mediated hippocampal behavior and memory. Our findings identify a previously unrecognized mechanism essential for DRD1 initiation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity that is dependent on GHSR1a, and independent of cAMP signaling.

Real-time single-molecule analysis on hippocampal neurons revealed dimerization between apo-GHSR1a and DRD1 that is enhanced by DRD1 agonism. In addition, proximity measurements support formation of preassembled apo-GHSR1a:DRD1:Gαq heteromeric complexes in hippocampal neurons. Activation by a DRD1 agonist produced non-canonical signal transduction via Gαq-PLC-IP3-Ca2+ at the expense of canonical DRD1 Gαs cAMP signaling to result in CaMKII activation, glutamate receptor exocytosis, synaptic reorganization, and expression of early markers of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Remarkably, this pathway is blocked by genetic or pharmacological inactivation of GHSR1a. In mice, GHSR1a inactivation inhibits DRD1-mediated hippocampal behavior and memory. Our findings identify a previously unrecognized mechanism essential for DRD1 initiation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity that is dependent on GHSR1a, and independent of cAMP signaling. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) belong to a large family of cell surface receptors that transduce their signal by activating a trimeric G protein complex (Gαβγ). Since GPCRs are important regulators of cell signaling, developing agonists and antagonists to target GPCRs is a major focus of drug discovery. However, traditional approaches to identify drug candidates based on specificity and functional activity in “artificial” cell-based assays has failed to accurately predict clinical outcomes. GPCRs are perceived to signal as monomers, but emerging evidence also implicates signal transduction through homomers and heteromers. Heteromers may play a crucial role in allosteric interactions that occur between protomers to alter signal transduction and modify biological function. Therefore, knowing the physiological pathways regulated by GPCR heteromers, homomers, and monomers in target cells is clinically relevant. Our research focuses on Class A GPCRs, and in particular the orphan growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR1a) that was subsequently deorphanized by the discovery of ghrelin in stomach extracts (Howard et al., 1996Howard A.D.

We previously showed that GHSR1a forms heteromers with dopamine receptor-2 (DRD2) in hypothalamic neurons and that signaling through GHSR1a:DRD2 is essential for DRD2 agonist-induced suppression of food intake (Kern et al., 2012Kern A.

Paradoxically, despite expression of GHSR1a in the hippocampal structures (Guan et al., 1997Guan X.M. Yu H. Palyha O.C. McKee K.K. Feighner S.D. Sirinathsinghji D.J. Smith R.G. Van der Ploeg L.H.

Based on this observation, we set out to identify a function for apo-GHSR1a in the hippocampus. Using immunohistochemistry on brain sections of Ghsr-IRES-tau-GFP knock-in mice, we identified hippocampal neurons that coexpress GHSR1a and DRD1 (Jiang et al., 2006Jiang H. Betancourt L. Smith R.G.

Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1772-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Although DRD1 is implicated in regulating hippocampal synaptic plasticity involved in memory and learning, the mechanisms involved are incompletely understood (Hamilton et al., 2010Hamilton T.J. Wheatley B.M. Sinclair D.B. Bachmann M. Larkum M.E. Colmers W.F. Dopamine modulates synaptic plasticity in dendrites of rat and human dentate granule cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Dopamine controls persistence of long-term memory storage.Science. 2009; 325: 1017-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). We speculated that determining the function of apo-GHSR1a in DRD1 expressing hippocampal neurons would provide new insight into these mechanisms. Previously, studies on dopamine/DRD1 signaling in the hippocampus have focused mainly on canonical signaling, with DRD1 coupling to Gαs that enhances cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation and activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (Abel et al., 1997Abel T. Nguyen P.V. Barad M. Deuel T.A. Kandel E.R. Bourtchouladze R.

USA. 1995; 92: 2446-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). However, DRD1 signaling through Gαq has also been described (Jin et al., 2003Jin L.Q. Goswami S. Cai G. Zhen X. Friedman E. SKF83959 selectively regulates phosphatidylinositol-linked D1 dopamine receptors in rat brain.J.

D1/D5 dopamine receptors stimulate intracellular calcium release in primary cultures of neocortical and hippocampal neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 2167-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); nevertheless, what determines Gαq over Gαs signaling had not been elucidated. Here, we shed light on DRD1 signaling in the hippocampus by illustrating formation of apo-GHSR1a:DRD1 heteromers that by an allosteric mechanism result in DRD1 coupling to Gαq at the expense of Gαs. Activation of apo-GHSR1a:DRD1 by a DRD1 agonist mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and initiates hippocampal synaptic plasticity, independent of cAMP signaling. An essential modulatory role for apo-GHSR1a on hippocampal DRD1 signaling would not have been recognized previously because experiments were performed in animals that express GHSR1a endogenously. By establishing that apo-GHSR1a is an essential modifier of DRD1 signaling in the hippocampus, we resolve the conundrum of hippocampal GHSR1a expression in the absence of endogenous ghrelin, and provide a mechanism for how DRD1 activation of Gαq-signaling in hippocampal neurons is regulated. While it is generally agreed that memory consolidation involves DRD1-induced PKA and cAMP signaling, our results support an essential and fundamental role for Gαq-PLC-Ca2+ signal transduction in initiating this process. Following confirmation of the selectivity of the DRD1 antibody (Figure S1A), immunohistochemistry on Ghsr-IRES-tauGFP mouse brain sections revealed highest levels of GHSR1a and DRD1 coexpression in the Cornu Ammonis region III of hippocampus (CA3) and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampal structures (Figure 1A). Hypothalamic regions also stained for GHSR1a, but lacked detectable DRD1 staining (Figure 1A).Figure 1Co-expression of GHSR1a and DRD1 in Mouse Hippocampal Neurons and Heteromer Formation Measured by FRET Confocal Microscopy and TIRF-MShow full caption(A) Brain sections from Ghsr-IRES-tauGFP mice stained for DRD1 (red) and GHSR1a (green).

Data represent the mean ± SEM of at least three experiments (∗p < 0.05 versus control; ∗∗p < 0.01 versus control; ∗∗∗p < 0.001 versus control). To test for formation of GHSR1a:DRD1 heteromers in hippocampal neurons, we employed confocal fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy on hippocampal brain slices. Biotin-ghrelin labeled with FITC-avidin (green) was used to detect GHSR1a, and a fluorescently labeled DRD1 antagonist (red-SKF83566) was used for DRD1. We validated the utility of fluorescently labeled ligands for FRET and binding specificity of each fluorophore (Figures S1B–S1D). FRET confocal microscopy and image analysis showed GHSR1a and DRD1 in close proximity (6.8 ± 0.1 nm) with a FRET efficiency of 0.51 ± 0.02, consistent with formation of GHSR1a:DRD1 heteromers (Figure 1B). Parallel incubations using hippocampal slices from Ghsr−/− mice illustrated red-SKF83566 labeling of DRD1 receptors without green fluorescence labeling (Figure 1B). GPCRs are recruited and dynamically assembled on the cell membrane (Kasai and Kusumi, 2014Kasai R.S. Kusumi A. Single-molecule imaging revealed dynamic GPCR dimerization.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2014; 27: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To monitor real-time dynamics of DRD1 and GHSR1a interactions in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures, we performed two-color single-molecule analyses using total-internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF-M). Qdot565-avidin-labeled biotinylated-ghrelin was used to detect GHSR1a, and Qdot655-labeled DRD1 monoclonal antibody for DRD1. GHSR1a and DRD1 exhibited mobility and co-localization in the membrane (Figure S1C). Analysis of the individual trajectories of GHSR1a and DRD1 molecules illustrated significantly slower diffusion within the complex, rather than outside the complex (Figures 1C and 1D). Treatment with a DRD1-specific agonist (SKF81297) increased co-localization compared to vehicle treatment (312% ± 31.2% versus 100% ± 9%, p < 0.001; Figure 1E) and augmented the number of co-localization events (163.8% ± 17.1% versus 100% ± 8.5%, p < 0.01; Figure 1E). By measuring diffusion of the individual GHSR1a molecules, we showed that SKF81297 significantly increased the confinement of GHSR1a in a complex with DRD1, as indicated by a reduction in the steady state of the mean square displacement (MSD) curve (p < 0.001; Figure 1F). The diffusion coefficient of mobile receptors was higher before SKF81297 treatment (0.033 ± 0.009), than after treatment (0.0072 ± 0.002; p < 0.01; Figure 1F); hence, single-molecule analysis revealed that a DRD1 agonist enhances formation of GHSR1a:DRD1 heteromeric complexes on mouse hippocampal neurons. Having demonstrated close proximity and dynamic interactions of GHSR1a and DRD1 in hippocampal neurons, we asked whether these interactions modified canonical DRD1 signal transduction. To test for mobilization of [Ca2+]i, we transduced primary cultures of mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons with lentivirus expressing the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor GCaMP3. Treatment with SKF81297 dose-dependently induced rapid Ca2+ transients (EC50 = 50.37 ± 0.12 nM; Figure 2A). Post-treatment with ghrelin induced Ca2+ transient in the same neurons that responded to SKF81297 (Figure 2A), which confirmed coexpression of GHSR1a and DRD1. To test for GHSR1a dependence, we compared the effects of SKF81297 in organotypic hippocampal slices from Ghsr +/+ and Ghsr −/− mice expressing GCaMP3. Ca2+ transients were induced by SKF81297 in slices from Ghsr +/+ mice, but not in slices from Ghsr −/− mice; thus, Ca2+ mobilization is dependent on interactions between DRD1 and GHSR1a (Figure 2B, p < 0.001). A characteristic property of GPCR heteromers is the ability of an antagonist of one protomer to modify signaling of its protomer partner (Smith and Milligan, 2010Smith N.J. Milligan G. Allostery at G protein-coupled receptor homo- and heteromers: uncharted pharmacological landscapes.Pharmacol. Rev. 2010; 62: 701-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Pretreating organotypic hippocampal slices from Ghsr+/+ mice with the GHSR1a neutral antagonist JMV2959 blocked SKF81297-induced Ca2+ mobilization (p < 0.05; Figure 2C), which is consistent with modification of allosteric interactions between GHSR1a and DRD1 in the GHSR1a:DRD1 heteromeric complex. We next asked whether SKF81297-induced [Ca2+]i mobilization was mediated by DRD1:Gαq coupling through a preassembled GHSR1a:DRD1:Gαq complex. Gαq and DRD1 showed punctate co-localization in neuritic processes, indicating formation of signalosomes (Figure 2D). FRET confocal microscopy showed Gαq and DRD1 in close proximity (5.45 ± 0.2 nm; FRET efficiency, 0.416 ± 0.06; Figure 2D), consistent with GHSR1a:DRD1:Gαq preassembly in hippocampal neurons. In contrast to DRD1:Gαq, the FRET distance (9.98 ± 0.035 nm) and FRET efficiency (0.005 ± 0.02; Figure 2D) measured for DRD2 and Gαq in hippocampal neurons is inconsistent with their close proximity. In the striatum, DRD2 and DRD1 are reported to form heteromers that couple to Gαq; concomitant agonist activation of DRD2 and DRD1 mobilized Ca2+, which was blocked by a DRD2 antagonist (Hasbi et al., 2009Hasbi A. Fan T. Alijaniaram M. Nguyen T. Perreault M.L. O’Dowd B.F. George S.R. Calcium signaling cascade links dopamine D1-D2 receptor heteromer to striatal BDNF production and neuronal growth.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 21377-21382Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). While proximity measurements did not support DRD2:Gαq interactions in hippocampal neurons (Figure 2D), the possibility remained that DRD1 agonist-induced [Ca2+]i mobilization was explained by DRD1 coupling to Gαq in a DRD2:DRD1 complex rather than GHSR1a:DRD1. To address this possibility, we measured [Ca2+]i release after treatment with pharmacologic agents: DRD1 agonist, SKF81297; DRD2 agonist, quinpirole; DRD2 antagonist, raclopride. Quinpirole neither mobilized, nor enhanced, SKF81297-induced [Ca2+]i mobilization (Figure 2E), and raclopride did not attenuate SKF81297-induced Ca2+ release (Figure 2F); thus, signaling through a DRD2:DRD1:Gαq complex does not explain SKF81297-induced Ca2+ release in hippocampal neurons. In addition, SKF81297 did not mobilize Ca2 in hypothalamic neurons or in striatal neurons (Figure 2G). Further supporting hippocampal specificity, confocal FRET microscopy showed no evidence of GHSR1a:DRD1 heteromers in hypothalamic or striatal neurons (Figure 2H). To test whether SKF81297 activation of [Ca2+]i release through GHSR1a:DRD1 was mediated by Phospholipase C (PLC), we monitored, in real-time, the localization of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Primary hippocampal neurons from Ghsr+/+ and Ghsr−/− mice were transduced with lentivirus encoding the PIP2 biosensor, GFP-PH (Stauffer et al., 1998Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Receptor-induced transient reduction in plasma membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 concentration monitored in living cells.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the basal state, GFP-PH was confined to the plasma membrane, indicating that the GHSR1a:DRD1 complex was not constitutively active. Treatment with SKF81297 rapidly induced cytoplasmic accumulation of GFP-PH in the soma and in neuritic processes of hippocampal neurons from Ghsr+/+, but not in neurons from Ghsr−/− mice (Figure 3A); thus, translocation of PIP2 is dependent on GHSR1a. Pretreatment of hippocampal neurons with the PLC inhibitor U73122 inhibited DRD1 agonist-induced Ca2+ mobilization, further supporting dependence on PLC (p < 0.001; Figure 3B). To determine whether Gαq coupling and PLC activation occurred at the expense of canonical DRD1 Gαs coupling, membranes isolated from the hippocampus of Ghsr+/+ and Ghsr−/− mice were treated with SKF81297 or vehicle, and cAMP production measured. Hippocampal membranes from Ghsr+/+ mice produced markedly less cAMP in response to SKF81297 compared to those from Ghsr −/− mice (Figure 3C). Therefore, the presence of GHSR1a on the membranes reduces DRD1 coupling to Gαs in favor of Gαq, suggesting an equilibrium between GHSR1a:DRD1 and DRD1:DRD1 on the hippocampal neuron to allow signaling through Gαq and Gαs, respectively. To further characterize interactions between apo-GHSR1a and DRD1, and to determine whether GHSR1a heteromerization and dopamine activation of non-canonical DRD1 signaling is conserved across species, we expressed human GHSR1a and DRD1 in the human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell line. We monitored heteromerization by time-resolved (Tr)-FRET using GHSR1a and DRD1 with a SNAP- or CLIP- tagged N terminus, using methods described previously (Kern et al., 2012Kern A. Albarran-Zeckler R. Walsh H.E. Smith R.G. Apo-ghrelin receptor forms heteromers with DRD2 in hypothalamic neurons and is essential for anorexigenic effects of DRD2 agonism.Neuron. 2012; 73: 317-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Tr-FRET receptor titration assays and competition assays supported the formation of GHSR1a and DRD1 homomers and heteromers on the plasma membrane (Figures S2A and S2B). As additional proof of heteromer formation, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) saturation, type-2 BRET, and microscopic BRET assays were conducted. The results ruled out random stochastic interactions between apo-GHSR1a and DRD1 and confirmed formation of GHSR1a:DRD1 heteromers (Figures S2C–S2E). We employed HEK293-AEQ cells that stably express the bioluminescence Ca2+ sensor aequorin to monitor [Ca2+]i mobilization. Dopamine and SKF81297 dose-dependently induced Ca2+ mobilization with dependence on apo-GHSR1a, which was blocked by the DRD1 antagonist, SCH23390, but not by the DRD2 antagonist, raclopride (Figures S3A–S3C). In control experiments, Ca2+ release was not detected when GHSR1a or DRD1 were coexpressed with other Gαs- or Gαq-coupled GPCRs (Figure S3D), which was consistent with their failure to form heteromers (Figure S2B). Collectively, these results show that dopamine-induced [Ca2+]i mobilization correlates with GHSR1a:DRD1 heteromer formation rather than cross-talk between Gαq and Gαs signaling. To quantify the correlation between GHSR1a:DRD1 formation and [Ca2+]i release, we constructed GHSR1a fusion proteins containing inducible homodimerization domains at the C terminus (GHSR1a-Hom). The cross linking agent, B/B, dose-dependently reduced dopamine-induced [Ca2+]i mobilization by 40%–50% in HEK293-AEQ cells expressing GHSR1a-Hom + DRD1 compared to cells expressing GHSR1a + DRD1 (Figures 4A and 4B ). B/B itself did not attenuate Ca2+ release or cell surface expression of either GHSR1a-Hom or DRD1 (Figures 4C and Figures S3E–S3G). TIRF-M analyses showed B/B treatment enhanced GHSR1a-Hom homodimerization by ∼50%, thereby reducing the concentration of GHSR1a-Hom monomers available for forming heteromers (Figure S3H). The resulting reduction in the concentration of GHSR1a-Hom:DRD1 heteromers correlated with dopamine-induced [Ca2+]i mobilization (Figure 4B).Figure 4Dopamine-Induced [Ca2+]i Mobilization Correlates with Formation of GHSR1a:DRD1 HeteromersShow full caption(A) Dopamine-induced [Ca2+]i mobilization measured in HEK-AEQ cells expressing DRD1 with either GHSR1a (■) or GHSR1a-Hom (▲) preincubated with increasing concentrations of homodimerization inducer (B/B).(B and C) Dose-dependent dopamine-induced [Ca2+]i release in the absence or presence of B/B in cells coexpressing GHSR1a-Hom and DRD1 (B) or in cells coexpressing GHSR1a and DRD1 (C).Data represent the mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments (∗p < 0.05 versus control; ∗∗p < 0.01 versus control; ∗∗∗p < 0.001 versus control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Dopamine-induced [Ca2+]i mobilization measured in HEK-AEQ cells expressing DRD1 with either GHSR1a (■) or GHSR1a-Hom (▲) preincubated with increasing concentrations of homodimerization inducer (B/B).

Data represent the mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments (∗p < 0.05 versus control; ∗∗p < 0.01 versus control; ∗∗∗p < 0.001 versus control). Additional experiments tested whether dopamine-induced Ca2+ release involved cross-talk between Gαs and Gαq within the heteromeric complex or involved GHSR1a constitutive activity. We found that dopamine-induced [Ca2+]i mobilization by GHSR1a:DRD1was not dependent on signaling through Gαs, AC-PKA, Gαi/o-Gβγ, or PKC (Figures S4A–S4E). Coexpressing DRD1 with GHSR1a mutants lacking constitutive activity (F279L and A204E) resulted in dopamine-induced Ca2+ release (Figure S4F); hence, non-canonical DRD1 signaling is independent of GHSR1a constitutive activity. The observed 30%–40% reduction in the Ca2+ response is likely explained by the lower affinity of the mutants for forming heteromers with DRD1 (Figure S4G). To test for formation of an apo-GHSR1a:DRD1:Gαq complex in HEK293 cells, we combined bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and BRET analysis (Galés et al., 2006Galés C. Van Durm J.J. Schaak S. Pontier S. Percherancier Y. Audet M. Paris H. Bouvier M. Probing the activation-promoted structural rearrangements in preassembled receptor-G protein complexes.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Co-expression of split YFP-tagged GHSR1a and DRD1 (GHSR1a-YFP-C and DRD1-YFP-N) produced YFP fluorescence localized on the plasma membrane, confirming formation of GHSR1a:DRD1 heteromers (Figure S5A). Expression of Gαq-Rluc8 with the split YFP-tagged GHSR1a and DRD1 produced a robust BRET signal, consistent with Gαq in a preassembled complex with GHSR1a:DRD1, which was not observed in control experiments (Gαq-Rluc coexpressed with DRD1-YFP-N + DRD1-YFP-C or empty vector) (Figure S5A). Agonist treatment markedly reduced the BRET signal associated with the GHSR1a-YFP-C:DRD1-YFP-N:Gαq-Rluc8 complex, illustrating agonist-induced dissociation of Gαq (Figure S5A). To assess direct coupling to the Gαqβγ trimer, Gαq-Rluc8 and split Venus-Gβ1 and -Gγ2 proteins were coexpressed with GHSR1a and DRD1 (Figure S5B). The BRET signal was attenuated by SKF81297 treatment (p < 0.001; Figure S5B, middle panel), consistent with DRD1 pre-coupling to Gαq and agonist-induced dissociation of the heterotrimeric G protein complex. Pretreatment with JMV2959 dose-dependently inhibited the SKF81297-induced decrease in BRET (IC50 = 477 ± 45 nM; Figure S5B, right panel); hence, GHSR1a is intimately involved in DRD1:Gαq coupling. Dopamine-induced cAMP accumulation was reduced when DRD1 was expressed with GHSR1a, indicating GHSR1a promotes DRD1 coupling to Gαq at the expense of Gαs coupling (Figure S5C). To determine whether GHSR1a antagonists inhibit dopamine-induced Ca2+ mobilization by interfering with allosteric interactions between GHSR1a and DRD1, three structurally distinct GHSR1a neutral antagonists (JMV2959, JMV3002, and BIM-28163) equipotent in inhibiting ghrelin activation of GHSR1a were tested (Figure S5D). The antagonists had no effect on DRD1-induced cAMP accumulation (Figure S5E). JMV2959 was a full antagonist of dopamine-induced [Ca2+]i release, while JMV3002 and BIM were partial antagonists (Figure S5F). BRET titration employing Nluc-GHSR1a and SNAP-DRD1 in the presence or absence of each GHSR1a antagonist was performed. JMV2959 did not affect the BRET50, but significantly changed the BRETmax (BRETmax control, 0.0038 ± 0.0008, and BRETmax JMV2959, 0.0017 ± 0.0005; p < 0.05; Figure S5G), indicating JMV2959 modifies allosteric interactions between GHSR1a and DRD1 (Ha"
https://openalex.org/W2179450982,"Our ability to learn a wide range of behavioral tasks is essential for responding appropriately to sensory stimuli according to behavioral demands, but the underlying neural mechanism has been rarely examined by neurophysiological recordings in the same subjects across learning. To understand how learning new behavioral tasks affects neuronal representations, we recorded from posterior parietal cortex (PPC) before and after training on a visual motion categorization task. We found that categorization training influenced cognitive encoding in PPC, with a marked enhancement of memory-related delay-period encoding during the categorization task that was absent during a motion discrimination task before categorization training. In contrast, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) exhibited strong delay-period encoding during both discrimination and categorization tasks. This reveals a dissociation between PFC's and PPC's roles in working memory, with general engagement of PFC across multiple tasks, in contrast with more task-specific mnemonic encoding in PPC."
https://openalex.org/W2178681339,"Inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor by Mdm2 is one of the most frequent events in cancer, so compounds targeting the p53-Mdm2 interaction are promising for cancer therapy. Mechanisms conferring resistance to p53-reactivating compounds are largely unknown. Here we show using CRISPR-Cas9-based target validation in lung and colorectal cancer that the activity of nutlin, which blocks the p53-binding pocket of Mdm2, strictly depends on functional p53. In contrast, sensitivity to the drug RITA, which binds the Mdm2-interacting N terminus of p53, correlates with induction of DNA damage. Cells with primary or acquired RITA resistance display cross-resistance to DNA crosslinking compounds such as cisplatin and show increased DNA cross-link repair. Inhibition of FancD2 by RNA interference or pharmacological mTOR inhibitors restores RITA sensitivity. The therapeutic response to p53-reactivating compounds is therefore limited by compound-specific resistance mechanisms that can be resolved by CRISPR-Cas9-based target validation and should be considered when allocating patients to p53-reactivating treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2180251131,"Unit recordings in behaving animals have revealed the transformation of sensory to motor representations in cortical neurons. However, we still lack basic insights into the mechanisms by which neurons interact to generate such transformations. Here, we study cortical circuits related to behavioral control in mice engaged in a sensory detection task. We recorded neural activity using extracellular and intracellular techniques and analyzed the task-related neural dynamics to reveal underlying circuit processes. Within motor cortex, we find two populations of neurons that have opposing spiking patterns in anticipation of movement. From correlation analyses and circuit modeling, we suggest that these dynamics reflect neural ensembles engaged in a competition. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this competitive circuit may convert a transient, sensory stimulus into a motor command. Together, these data reveal cellular and circuit processes underlying behavioral control and establish an essential framework for future studies linking cellular activity to behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2176580488,Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental feature of the nervous system that allows adaptation to changing behavioral environments. Most studies of synaptic plasticity have examined the regulated trafficking of postsynaptic glutamate receptors that generates alterations in synaptic transmission. Whether and how changes in the presynaptic release machinery contribute to neuronal plasticity is less clear. The SNARE complex mediates neurotransmitter release in response to presynaptic Ca(2+) entry. Here we show that the SNARE fusion clamp Complexin undergoes activity-dependent phosphorylation that alters the basic properties of neurotransmission in Drosophila. Retrograde signaling following stimulation activates PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the Complexin C terminus that selectively and transiently enhances spontaneous release. Enhanced spontaneous release is required for activity-dependent synaptic growth. These data indicate that SNARE-dependent fusion mechanisms can be regulated in an activity-dependent manner and highlight the key role of spontaneous neurotransmitter release as a mediator of functional and structural plasticity.

https://openalex.org/W2204222147,"Communication between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the bone marrow microenvironment is known to control disease progression. Therefore, regulation of AML cell trafficking and adhesion to the bone marrow is of significant interest. In this study, we demonstrate that differential expression of the membrane scaffold CD82 modulates the bone marrow homing of AML cells. By combining mutational analysis and super-resolution imaging, we identify membrane protein clustering by CD82 as a regulator of AML cell adhesion and bone marrow homing. Cluster analysis of super-resolution data indicates that N-linked glycosylation and palmitoylation of CD82 are both critical modifications that control the microdomain organization of CD82 as well as the nanoscale clustering of associated adhesion protein, N-cadherin. We demonstrate that the inhibition of CD82 glycosylation increases the molecular packing of N-cadherin and promotes the bone marrow homing of AML cells. In contrast, we find that the inhibition of CD82 palmitoylation disrupts the formation and organization of N-cadherin clusters and significantly diminishes bone marrow trafficking of AML. Taken together, these data establish a mechanism where the membrane organization of CD82, through specific posttranslational modifications, regulates N-cadherin clustering and membrane density, which impacts the in vivo trafficking of AML cells. As such, these observations provide an alternative model for targeting AML where modulation of protein organization within the membrane may be an effective treatment therapy to disrupt the bone marrow homing potential of AML cells."

But how the polarity of luminance change is represented in the activity of cortical circuits remains unclear. Using wide-field epifluorescence and two-photon imaging we demonstrate a robust modular representation of luminance polarity (ON or OFF) in the superficial layers of ferret primary visual cortex. Polarity-specific domains are found with both uniform changes in luminance and single light/dark edges, and include neurons selective for orientation and direction of motion. The integration of orientation and polarity preference is evident in the selectivity and discrimination capabilities of most layer 2/3 neurons. We conclude that polarity selectivity is an integral feature of layer 2/3 neurons, ensuring that the distinction between light and dark stimuli is available for further processing in downstream extrastriate areas."

Translation normally occurs sequentially in triplets of nucleotides (codons) with strict maintenance by the ribosome of fidelity and reading frame with error rates of 10−3 to 10−4 per codon (Dunkle and Dunham, 2015Dunkle J.A.

There are cases in which this well-established rule breaks down, where the genetic code can be recoded and altered in an mRNA-specific manner (called “programmed”). During programmed frameshifting, a portion of translating ribosomes can be stochastically diverted to a different reading frame (Chen et al., 2014bChen J. Petrov A. Johansson M. Tsai A. O’Leary S.E.

Kim H.K. Yan S. Frameshifting dynamics.Biopolymers. 2013; 99: 1147-1166PubMed Google Scholar). Ribosomes can even be directed to bypass, hopping over a stretch of nucleotides to continue translating a contiguous polypeptide (Herr et al., 2000aHerr A.J. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Coupling of open reading frames by translational bypassing.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 343-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These events increase the richness of information encoded in DNA or RNA, where a coding sequence can specify additional protein products not predicted from the standard readout of the open reading frame, as well as adding a layer of translational control. The best-documented case of programmed bypassing is the gene 60 mRNA of bacteriophage T4 that codes for a subunit of a viral DNA topoisomerase (Herr et al., 2000aHerr A.J. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Coupling of open reading frames by translational bypassing.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 343-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, Huang et al., 1988Huang W.M. Ao S.Z. Casjens S. Orlandi R.

Dunn D.M. A nascent peptide is required for ribosomal bypass of the coding gap in bacteriophage T4 gene 60.Cell. 1990; 62: 117-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). During translation of the gene 60 mRNA, ribosomes translate the first 45 codons (excluding the initiator fMet tRNA, which we term codon 0) to a Gly GGA codon. Half of the translating ribosomes stop at the subsequent UAG stop codon, and the other half skips the next 50 nt and resumes translation from a downstream Gly codon (Maldonado and Herr, 1998Maldonado R. Herr A.J. Efficiency of T4 gene 60 translational bypassing.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1822-1830PubMed Google Scholar). Instead of stopping at the stop codon, the anticodon of the peptidyl-tRNAGly2 (Gly-2) (Herr et al., 1999Herr A.J. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Mutations which alter the elbow region of tRNA2Gly reduce T4 gene 60 translational bypassing efficiency.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2886-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) disengages from mRNA (in a process called “take-off”), the ribosome skips over the 50-nt gap, and the peptidyl-tRNA re-pairs to mRNA downstream at a GGA codon (called the “landing site”). As a result, translation resumes at codon 46 to create a single, continuous protein product from a discontinuous open reading frame (Wills, 2010Wills N.M. Translational bypassing - peptidyl-tRNA re-pairing at non-overlapping sites.in: Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Recoding: Expansion of Decoding Rules Enriches Gene Expression. Springer, 2010: 365-381Crossref Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). Biochemical, genetic, and mutational analysis relying on detection of protein products, both in vitro and in vivo, have identified the essential stimulatory elements for programmed bypassing in gene 60: (1) the tRNAGly (Gly-2) and the matching GGA take-off and landing sites bounding the non-coding gap, (2) an upstream nascent peptide sequence, (3) a stem loop consisting of the take-off codon and the adjacent UAG stop codon, and (4) a GAG Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence located 6 nt 5′ to the landing site to promote precision of landing (Figure 1A). With the matched take-off/landing pairs, bypassing is the most efficient for the wild-type (WT) GGA codon; other codons are possible, but codons with G or C in the first two positions yield more efficient bypassing (Bucklin et al., 2005Bucklin D.J. Wills N.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. P-site pairing subtleties revealed by the effects of different tRNAs on programmed translational bypassing where anticodon re-pairing to mRNA is separated from dissociation.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). With unmatched take-off/landing pairs, for example, GGA/GCA or GCA/GGA, bypassing efficiencies were greatly reduced (Weiss et al., 1990Weiss R.B. Huang W.M. Dunn D.M. A nascent peptide is required for ribosomal bypass of the coding gap in bacteriophage T4 gene 60.Cell. 1990; 62: 117-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The take-off codon is located within a potential –UUCG– hairpin stem loop in the 5′ portion of the non-coding gap, which is important for bypassing: mutations that disrupted base pairing reduced bypassing, whereas compensatory double mutations restored it. Altering the –UUCG– tetraloop sequence at the top of the stem, extending the length of the stem, or increasing loop size also reduced bypassing (Herr et al., 2000bHerr A.J. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F.

In addition to the hairpin, a “nascent peptide signal,” KKYKLQNNVRRSIKSSS13-29, potentially interacts with the exit tunnel of the ribosome to stimulate bypassing (Herr et al., 2004Herr A.J.

A nascent peptide is required for ribosomal bypass of the coding gap in bacteriophage T4 gene 60.Cell. 1990; 62: 117-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Lastly, there is an alternative landing site at GGG within the non-coding gap near the top of the stem loop (positions 9–11 from the take-off codon); however, the bypassing ribosome always lands at the wild-type landing codon (positions 48–50 from the take-off codon). Thus, it has been proposed that the ribosome does not scan the full non-coding gap in search of a potential landing site, but rather hops over the non-coding region (Wills et al., 2008Wills N.M. O’Connor M. Nelson C.C. Rettberg C.C. Huang W.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Translational bypassing without peptidyl-tRNA anticodon scanning of coding gap mRNA.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2533-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). How the ribosome traverses the gap remains unclear, and no definitive and testable model is proposed for the mechanism of such a large-scale movement. What stimulates the ribosome to initiate bypass, and what determines whether or not a ribosome bypasses? What are the roles of the nascent peptide and mRNA secondary structure in inducing bypass? What is the conformational state of the ribosome during bypassing? Prior investigations of frameshifting have underscored the importance of dynamics in translational recoding (Caliskan et al., 2014Caliskan N. Katunin V.I. Belardinelli R. Peske F. Rodnina M.V.

Petrov A. Johansson M. Tsai A. O’Leary S.E. Puglisi J.D. Dynamic pathways of -1 translational frameshifting.Nature. 2014; 512: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Here, we probe the dynamic and stochastic nature of bypassing using single-molecule fluorescence to track single translating ribosomes in real time, allowing us to define a global mechanism for bypassing. To monitor single Escherichia coli ribosome progression on mRNAs in real-time, we used zero-mode waveguide (ZMW) instrumentation (Chen et al., 2014aChen J. Dalal R.V. Petrov A.N. Tsai A. O’Leary S.E. Chapin K. Cheng J. Ewan M. Hsiung P.L. Lundquist P. et al.High-throughput platform for real-time monitoring of biological processes by multicolor single-molecule fluorescence.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Dynamic pathways of -1 translational frameshifting.Nature. 2014; 512: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this study, we followed conformational changes underlying elongation, involving rotational movements of the small (30S) ribosomal subunit with respect to the large (50S) ribosomal subunit and correlated them with binding and departure of tRNAs and elongation factors. To observe rotational movement, the 30S subunit was labeled with Cy3B on helix 44, and a non-fluorescent quencher, BHQ-2, was placed on helix 101 of the 50S subunit, allowing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the two dyes (Chen et al., 2012bChen J.

Coordinated conformational and compositional dynamics drive ribosome translocation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). During one elongation cycle, the two subunits start in a non-rotated state (characterized by high FRET, low Cy3B intensity). The EF-Tu-GTP-aa-tRNA ternary complex (TC) binds to the vacant A site, followed by peptidyl transfer from P-site tRNA to the new A-site aa-tRNA. After peptidyl transfer, the ribosomal subunits rapidly rotate relative to each other (rotated state; lower FRET, higher Cy3B intensity). During this stage, the ribosome is “unlocked,” where the ribosome conformation and tRNA spontaneously fluctuate (Blanchard et al., 2004aBlanchard S.C. Gonzalez R.L. Kim H.D. Chu S.

Upon translocation catalyzed by EF-G, the two subunits rotate back to their original high-FRET state and the ribosome is “relocked.” Thus, one round of high-low FRET (low-high Cy3B intensity) corresponds to a single ribosome translating one codon, allowing tracking of translation at codon resolution, and providing the timings of individual substeps at each codon (Chen et al., 2013Chen J. Petrov A. Tsai A. O’Leary S.E. Puglisi J.D. Coordinated conformational and compositional dynamics drive ribosome translocation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (Figure S1B). As opposed to previous smFRET studies with probes labeled at ribosomal proteins S6 and L9 showing spontaneous intersubunit rotations after peptidyl transfer (Cornish et al., 2008Cornish P.V. Ermolenko D.N. Noller H.F. Ha T. Spontaneous intersubunit rotation in single ribosomes.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 578-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), our FRET probe positions possibly monitor a different intersubunit movement that occurs only one cycle per codon. Arrival and departure of the dye-labeled ligands, such as tRNAs, can be simultaneously observed as a sequence of fluorescent pulses (Chen et al., 2013Chen J. Petrov A. Tsai A. O’Leary S.E.

The correlation of single cycles of FRET to translation of a single codon has been confirmed in multiple studies (Aitken and Puglisi, 2010Aitken C.E. Puglisi J.D.

To follow translating ribosomes, we monitored the intersubunit conformational signal upon delivering total tRNA (tRNAtot) ternary complex (aa-tRNA-EF-Tu-GTP), EF-G, and BHQ-50S to immobilized Cy3B-30S preinitiation complexes on the bottom of the ZMWs, as done previously (Johansson et al., 2014Johansson M.

Through statistical analysis of multiple translating single ribosomes, we obtained waiting times for the non-rotated and rotated states of each codon. Continuous translation can be observed for more than 50 codons, allowing us to profile the real-time dynamics approaching, during, and after bypassing. Translation of the first 40 codons of wild-type gene 60 mRNA proceeds normally, with expected lifetimes of the rotated (waiting for translocation) and non-rotated (waiting for peptidyl transfer) states (2–5 s at 3 μM tRNAtot TC and 240 nM EF-G), demonstrating a regular elongation rate at these codons. From codons 40 to 45, i.e., before the take-off site, translation gradually slows with an increase in both rotated and non-rotated states lifetimes to roughly 15 s for each state (3- to 7-fold increase). At the bypass site at codon Gly45, an exceptionally long rotated-state pause is observed, with a 20-fold higher mean lifetime of 40 s. For a subset of ribosomes paused at codon Gly45, translation resumes instead of stopping at the UAG stop codon after Gly45, indicating that we observe bypassing (Figures 1B, 1C, S2A, and S2B). Translating single ribosomes cluster into three major subpopulations: (1) ribosomes that translate 45 codons and stall at the stop codon; these ribosomes do not bypass and do not exhibit the long rotated pause at Gly45, (2) ribosomes that bypass and translate at least codon 46; these ribosomes ubiquitously exhibit a long rotated state at codon 45, or (3) ribosome traces showing end of Cy3B signal during the long rotated state due to photobleaching or end of movie. Combining the second and third clusters gives a bypassing efficiency of ∼35%, consistent with our in vivo assays (33%) and prior studies (Maldonado and Herr, 1998Maldonado R. Herr A.J.

Commun. 2014; 5: 4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); no other auxiliary factors beyond the standard factors added here are required. Bypassing and non-bypassing ribosomes show distinct dynamics. All ribosomes exhibit the gradual increase in non-rotated state and rotated lifetimes from codons 40 to 45. This increase in lifetime upon approaching the bypass site is reminiscent of the dynamic signatures observed for nascent peptide-ribosome interactions during SecM stalling (Tsai et al., 2014Tsai A. Kornberg G. Johansson M. Chen J. Puglisi J.D. The dynamics of SecM-induced translational stalling.Cell Rep. 2014; 7: 1521-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The long rotated-state pause at the bypass site (Gly45) is observed only for ribosomes that undergo bypassing and is similar to the non-canonical rotated states observed in −1 frameshifting (Chen et al., 2014bChen J. Petrov A. Johansson M. Tsai A. O’Leary S.E. Puglisi J.D. Dynamic pathways of -1 translational frameshifting.Nature. 2014; 512: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). By parsing into two distinct populations of ribosomes, we obtain a more accurate mean lifetime for the rotated-state pause (88.2 ± 26.4 s) without the convolution of non-bypassed ribosomes (Figure 1D). Resumption of normal translation post bypassing is not immediate, and the ribosome translates slowly for a few more codons before the rotated state lifetimes return to normal (mean lifetime is 5 s), while the non-rotated state lifetimes remain higher (mean lifetime is 15 s) (Figures 1B and 1C; see Figure S3). We hypothesized that the general slowdown in translation observed for both non-bypassed and bypassed ribosomes is due to the nascent peptide signal, KYKLQNNVRRSIKSSS14-29 (Weiss et al., 1990Weiss R.B. Huang W.M. Dunn D.M.

Translational bypassing - peptidyl-tRNA re-pairing at non-overlapping sites.in: Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Recoding: Expansion of Decoding Rules Enriches Gene Expression. Springer, 2010: 365-381Crossref Google Scholar), which interacts with the ribosome exit tunnel. In vivo, deleting from codon 14 to codon 29 causes a 70% decrease in bypassing efficiency (Figure 2A). Mutational analysis of the nascent peptide highlighted the importance of a KKYK13-16 motif (Figure 2A). With our in vitro single-molecule system, deleting the sequence encoding KYKLQNNVRRSIKSSS14-29 eliminates observable bypassing and pausing: translating ribosomes no longer exhibit the increase in rotated and non-rotated state lifetimes and ribosomes now translate 29 codons to the stop codon, with only 1% of the traces showing translation beyond the UAG stop codon (Figure S4). Mutating the critical KKYK motif to AAAA resulted in a similar behavior; the increases in non-rotated and rotated states lifetimes are no longer observed (Figure 2B). Deletion of the non-coding gap, while maintaining the nascent peptide signal, abrogates bypassing as expected, but increases in rotated and non-rotated state lifetimes approaching codon Gly45 are observed as for the wild-type sequence (Figure S4). These results indicate that the nascent peptide is responsible for the slowdown approaching the bypass site independent of the mRNA sequence and structure at the bypass site and that this slowdown is necessary for the ribosome to undergo the rotated-state pause at Gly45 for bypassing. Importantly, these interactions are different from SecM-induced stall (Figure 2C).Figure S4The Effects of the Nascent Peptide Signal, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Deleting the non-coding gap such that codon Gly45 is now contiguous to codon Leu46 results in continuous translation.

The nascent peptide signal alone is not sufficient to promote bypass; the hairpin at the bypass site is required. Disrupting the potential base pairing in the hairpin stem abolishes the long rotated-state pause at Gly45, but we still observe the slowdown caused by the nascent peptide signal (Figure 3A). This demonstrates that the hairpin stem loop is required for the long pause in the rotated state prior to bypassing and that the action of the hairpin follows that of the nascent chain. How the mRNA hairpin promotes such a pause is puzzling, since the –UUCG– hairpin stem loop should be fully melted by the ribosome within the mRNA channel at the take-off site, as the ribosome protects 9 nt subsequent to the P-site codon (Qu et al., 2011Qu X.

The ribosome uses two active mechanisms to unwind messenger RNA during translation.Nature. 2011; 475: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We hypothesize here that the unusual stability of a UUCG tetraloop (Ennifar et al., 2000Ennifar E. Nikulin A. Tishchenko S. Serganov A. Nevskaya N. Garber M. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Nikonov S.

If this hypothesis were correct, then the top portion of the hairpin would be sufficient for pausing and bypassing. To test this hypothesis, we created two mutants, called Δtop hairpin (destabilized the three base pairs below the UUCG tetraloop) and Δbottom hairpin (leaving the three base pairs below the tetraloop intact but disrupting seven potential base pairs in the lower part of the stem) (Figures 3B and 3C). Translation of the Δtop hairpin mutant mRNA resulted in a decrease of ribosomes that enter the rotated-state pause (12%). Translation of the Δbottom hairpin mRNA remained similar to the wild-type sequence (36% compared to WT 35%). This highlights the importance of the UUCG tetraloop and the top portions of the hairpin in stimulating bypass, consistent with prior mutagenesis (Weiss et al., 1990Weiss R.B. Huang W.M. Dunn D.M.

Interestingly, destabilizing the three base pairs located 5 nt from the tetraloop did not significantly reduce bypass efficiency (∼60%–90% of WT) (Weiss et al., 1990Weiss R.B. Huang W.M. Dunn D.M.

https://openalex.org/W2172716470,"Infection of human B lymphocytes by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) leads to the establishment of immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) that are widely used as a model of viral oncogenesis. An early consequence of infection is the induction of DNA damage and activation of the DNA damage response, which limits the efficiency of growth transformation. The cause of the DNA damage remains poorly understood. We have addressed this question by comparing the response of B lymphocytes infected with EBV or stimulated with a potent B-cell mitogen. We found that although the two stimuli induce comparable proliferation during the first 10 days of culture, the EBV-infected blasts showed significantly higher levels of DNA damage, which correlated with stronger and sustained accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Treatment with ROS scavengers decreased DNA damage in both mitogen-stimulated and EBV-infected cells. However, while mitogen-induced proliferation was slightly improved, the proliferation of EBV-infected cells and the establishment of LCLs were severely impaired. Quenching of ROS did not affect the kinetics and magnitude of viral gene expression but was associated with selective downregulation of the viral LMP1 and phosphorylated cellular transcription factor STAT3 that have key roles in transformation. Analysis of the mechanism by which high levels of ROS support LMP1 expression revealed selective inhibition of viral microRNAs that target the LMP1 transcript. Our study provides novel insights into the role of EBV-induced oxidative stress in promoting B-cell immortalization and malignant transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2218260032,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling has a critical role in oncogenic Kras-driven pancreatic carcinogenesis. However, the downstream targets of this signaling network are largely unknown. We developed a novel model system utilizing murine primary pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (PDECs), genetically engineered to allow time-specific expression of oncogenic Kras(G12D) from the endogenous promoter. We show that primary PDECs are susceptible to Kras(G12D)-driven transformation and form pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas in vivo after Cdkn2a inactivation. In addition, we demonstrate that activation of Kras(G12D) induces an EGFR signaling loop to drive proliferation. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of EGFR fails to decrease Kras(G12D)-activated ERK or PI3K signaling. Instead our data provide novel evidence that EGFR signaling is needed to activate the oncogenic and pro-proliferative transcription factor c-MYC. EGFR and c-MYC have been shown to be essential for pancreatic carcinogenesis. Importantly, our data link both pathways and thereby explain the crucial role of EGFR for Kras(G12D)-driven carcinogenesis in the pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W2173793830,"The Na(+)-coupled betaine symporter BetP senses changes in the membrane state and increasing levels of cytoplasmic K(+) during hyperosmotic stress latter via its C-terminal domain and regulates transport activity according to both stimuli. This intriguing sensing and regulation behavior of BetP was intensively studied in the past. It was shown by several biochemical studies that activation and regulation depends crucially on the lipid composition of the surrounding membrane. In fact, BetP is active and regulated only when negatively charged lipids are present. Recent structural studies have revealed binding of phosphatidylglycerol lipids to functional important parts of BetP, suggesting a functional role of lipid interactions. However, a regulatory role of lipid interactions could only be speculated from the snapshot provided by the crystal structure. Here, we investigate the nature of lipid-protein interactions of BetP reconstituted in closely packed two-dimensional crystals of negatively charged lipids and probed at the molecular level with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The FTIR data indicate that K(+) binding weakens the interaction of BetP especially with the anionic lipid head groups. We suggest a regulation mechanism in which lipid-protein interactions, especially with the C-terminal domain and the functional important gating helices transmembrane helice 3 (TMH3) and TMH12, confine BetP to its down-regulated transport state. As BetP is also activated by changes in the physical state of the membrane, our results point toward a more general mechanism of how active transport can be modified by dynamic lipid-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2174664303,"Failure of lens fiber cell denucleation (LFCD) is associated with congenital cataracts, but the pathobiology awaits elucidation. Recent work has suggested that mechanisms that direct the unidirectional process of LFCD are analogous to the cyclic processes associated with mitosis. We found that lens-specific mutations that elicit an unfolded-protein response (UPR) in vivo accumulate p27(Cdkn1b), show cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-1 inhibition, retain their LFC nuclei, and are cataractous. Although a UPR was not detected in lenses expressing K6W-Ub, they also accumulated p27 and showed failed LFCD. Induction of a UPR in human lens epithelial cells (HLECs) also induced accumulation of p27 associated with decreased levels of S-phase kinase-associated protein (Skp)-2, a ubiquitin ligase that regulates mitosis. These cells also showed decreased lamin A/C phosphorylation and metaphase arrest. The suppression of lamin A/C phosphorylation and metaphase transition induced by the UPR was rescued by knockdown of p27. Taken together, these data indicate that accumulation of p27, whether related to the UPR or not, prevents the phosphorylation of lamin A/C and LFCD in maturing LFCs in vivo, as well as in dividing HLECs. The former leads to cataract and the latter to metaphase arrest. These results suggest that accumulation of p27 is a common mechanism underlying retention of LFC nuclei."

In Arabidopsis, most Rab GTPases have two C-terminal cysteines and potentially can be double-geranylgeranylated by heterodimeric Rab geranylgeranyltransferases (Rab-GGTs). Genes encoding two putative α subunits and two putative β subunits of Rab-GGTs have been annotated in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, but little is known about Rab-GGT activity in Arabidopsis. In this study, we demonstrate that four different heterodimers can be formed between putative Arabidopsis Rab-GGT α subunits RGTA1/RGTA2 and β subunits RGTB1/RGTB2, but only RGTA1·RGTB1 and RGTA1·RGTB2 exhibit bona fide Rab-GGT activity, and they are biochemically redundant in vitro. We hypothesize that RGTA2 function might be disrupted by a 12-amino acid insertion in a conserved motif. We present evidence that Arabidopsis Rab-GGTs may have preference for prenylation of C-terminal cysteines in particular positions. We also demonstrate that Arabidopsis Rab-GGTs can not only prenylate a great variety of Rab GTPases in the presence of Rab escort protein but, unlike Rab-GGT in yeast and mammals, can also prenylate certain non-Rab GTPases independently of Rab escort protein.

Rab-GGT has a distinct set of subunits, and no shared subunits between Rab-GGT and PFT/PGGT-I have been reported. Despite sharing only 20–30% amino acid sequence similarity with their counterparts in PFT and PGGT-I, Rab-GGT subunits structurally resemble PFT and PGGT-I subunits (10Running M.P.

The N-terminal helical domain of the Rab-GGT α subunit is structurally very similar to the PFT/PGGT-I α subunit, whereas the Rab-GGT β subunit forms an α-α barrel structure, as does the PFT β subunit (16Leung K.F.

Protein prenyltransferases.Handbook of Metalloproteins. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2006Crossref Google Scholar). Mammalian and plant Rab-GGT α subunits have an additional immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, both of which all known PFT/PGGT-I α subunits and yeast Rab-GGT α subunits lack (12Maurer-Stroh S.

Crystal structure of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase at 2.0 Å resolution.Structure. 2000; 8: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, it appears that neither of these two domains is required for Rab-GGT activity (28Dursina B. Thomä N.H. Sidorovitch V. Niculae A. Iakovenko A. Rak A. Albert S. Ceacareanu A.C. Kölling R.

Interaction of yeast Rab geranylgeranyl transferase with its protein and lipid substrates.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6805-6816Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Remarkably, rather than recognizing target proteins by itself as PFT and PGGT-I do, Rab-GGT relies on a cofactor protein called Rab escort protein (REP) to recognize Rab GTPases (26Zhang H.

According to different models, REP binds to unprenylated Rab GTPase, either before or after forming a complex with the Rab-GGT α·β heterodimer and helps load the C-terminal end of the unprenylated Rab GTPase into the catalytic site of Rab-GGT (30Anant J.S.

In the Arabidopsis genome, genes encoding two putative α subunits, RGTA1 and RGTA2, and two putative β subunits, RGTB1 and RGTB2, of Rab-GGT were annotated (36Lange B.M. Ghassemian M. Genome organization in Arabidopsis thaliana: a survey for genes involved in isoprenoid and chlorophyll metabolism.Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 51: 925-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). rgtb1 mutants show a series of defects in shoot morphology, shoot gravitropism, tip growth of root hairs and pollen tubes, and light response (37Hála M. Soukupová H. Synek L. Zárský V. Arabidopsis RAB geranylgeranyl transferase β-subunit mutant is constitutively photomorphogenic and has shoot growth and gravitropic defects.Plant J. 2010; 62: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 38Gutkowska M. Wnuk M. Nowakowska J. Lichocka M. Stronkowski M.M. Swiezewska E. Rab geranylgeranyl transferase β subunit is essential for male fertility and tip growth in Arabidopsis.J. Exp. Bot. 2015; 66: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). rgtb2 mutants are broadly indistinguishable from wild-type plants under normal conditions but are also defective in tip growth (38Gutkowska M. Wnuk M. Nowakowska J. Lichocka M. Stronkowski M.M. Swiezewska E. Rab geranylgeranyl transferase β subunit is essential for male fertility and tip growth in Arabidopsis.J. Exp. Bot. 2015; 66: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The rgtb1 rgtb2 double mutants are pollen-lethal, suggesting that they are at least partially genetically redundant (38Gutkowska M. Wnuk M. Nowakowska J. Lichocka M. Stronkowski M.M. Swiezewska E. Rab geranylgeranyl transferase β subunit is essential for male fertility and tip growth in Arabidopsis.J. Exp. Bot. 2015; 66: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The effects of mutations in either RGTA1 or RGTA2 have not been reported. However, loss of the sole Physcomitrella patens Rab-GGT α subunit results in lethality (39Thole J.M. Perroud P.F. Quatrano R.S. Running M.P. Prenylation is required for polar cell elongation, cell adhesion, and differentiation in Physcomitrella patens.Plant J. 2014; 78: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), suggesting that Arabidopsis lacking a functional Rab-GGT α subunit might also be non-viable. The REP homolog in Arabidopsis has also been characterized biochemically. Recombinant AtREP can promote the prenylation of various Rab GTPases in Arabidopsis cell extracts but fails to complement a yeast REP mutation due to a change in AtREP of an arginine residue conserved in non-plant REPs to an asparagine (40Hála M. Eliás M. Zárský V. A specific feature of the angiosperm Rab escort protein (REP) and evolution of the REP/GDI superfamily.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 1299-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence that RGTB1 is a bona fide Rab-GGT subunit comes from studies of rgtb1 mutants; specifically, the level of prenylated RABA2A is reduced in rgtb1 mutants, and rgtb1 total extracts cannot efficiently prenylate recombinant RABA2A in vitro (37Hála M. Soukupová H. Synek L. Zárský V. Arabidopsis RAB geranylgeranyl transferase β-subunit mutant is constitutively photomorphogenic and has shoot growth and gravitropic defects.Plant J. 2010; 62: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical activity of the other putative subunits and possible target specificity differences among different α·β combinations remain unknown. It is also unclear whether AtREP is required for Arabidopsis Rab-GGT activity. In this study, we used an isotope-based in vitro prenylation assay to address these questions. Here we report that RGTB1 and RGTB2 are biochemically redundant Rab-GGT β-subunits in Arabidopsis, whereas RGTA1 is the only active α subunit. Arabidopsis Rab-GGT also appears to show a preference for prenylation of cysteines in particular positions at the C terminus. Arabidopsis Rab-GGT not only prenylates a vast variety of Rab GTPases with various C-terminal sequences in vitro in an REP-dependent manner, but, unlike what has been reported for other eukaryotic Rab-GGTs, can also prenylate certain non-Rab small GTPases in vitro in an REP-independent manner. Our results help partially explain the survivability of Arabidopsis mutants lacking PFT/PGGT-I activity, the lack of phenotypes in PGGT-I mutants, and the observation of partial membrane localization of PGGT-I targets in PFT/PGGT-I mutants (15Zeng Q.
