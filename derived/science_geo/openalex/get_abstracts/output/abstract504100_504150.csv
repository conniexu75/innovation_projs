Studies identified dystrophin as the culprit gene, which galvanized research into gene-targeted therapies. Long et al. apply genome editing to “correct” the disease-causing mutation in mice genetically destined to develop the disease. This germline editing strategy kept muscles from degenerating, even in mice harboring only a small percentage of corrected cells. Although not feasible for humans, this proof of concept sets the stage for applying genome editing to specific cell types involved in the disease. Science , this issue p. 1184"

Recent findings indicate that multipotent neural progenitor cells derived from either embryonic spinal cord or embryonic stem (ES) cells extend abundant numbers of axons over long distances when implanted into sites of spinal cord injury (SCI) (Lu et al., 2012bLu P.

These cells form functional relays across sites of complete spinal cord transection to restore conductivity across a lesion site and improve functional outcomes (Lu et al., 2012bLu P. Wang Y.

Grafts of neural progenitor cells can also remyelinate spared axons surrounding sites of partial spinal cord injury and may have neuroprotective properties (Cummings et al., 2005Cummings B.J.

These properties of neural stem cells raise the possibility of developing experimental treatments for spinal cord injury. However, immunosuppression to allow neural stem cell grafting in humans with spinal cord injury is potentially hazardous, given compromised health and high risk of infection in traumatized patients. Alternative cell sources that may not require immunosuppression could constitute a major advance. Accordingly, we explored whether human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) exhibit similar properties of engraftment, differentiation, and axonal outgrowth when driven to a neural stem cell fate. Human iPSCs were differentiated into neural stem cells and implanted into immunodeficient rats 2 weeks after C5 lateral hemisection lesions, a clinically relevant treatment time period. Three months later, we found an unprecedented degree of axonal outgrowth: indeed, axons extended nearly the entire rostral-to-caudal extent of the adult rat nervous system and formed synapses with rodent neurons, while host axons penetrated human iPSC grafts and also formed synapses. Human iPSCs were derived from a healthy 86-year-old male and driven toward a neural stem cell (NSC) lineage, as previously described (Yuan et al., 2011Yuan S.H. Martin J. Elia J. Flippin J.

Briefly, primary dermal fibroblasts were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC, cultured on PA6 cells in the presence of SMAD inhibitors for induction of neural stem cells (Yuan et al., 2011Yuan S.H.

Purified neural stem cells were then cultured on polyornithine/laminin-coated plates with DMEM/F12 supplemented with N2, B27, and basic fibroblast growth factor. This iPSC-derived NSC line was extensively characterized in vitro, including immunocytochemistry, genome-wide mRNA expression profiles, and electrophysiology (Israel et al., 2012Israel M.A. Yuan S.H. Bardy C. Reyna S.M. Mu Y. Herrera C. Hefferan M.P. Van Gorp S. Nazor K.L. Boscolo F.S. et al.Probing sporadic and familial Alzheimer’s disease using induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2012; 482: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Proliferating NSCs were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing GFP (Taylor et al., 2006Taylor L. Jones L. Tuszynski M.H. Blesch A. Neurotrophin-3 gradients established by lentiviral gene delivery promote short-distance axonal bridging beyond cellular grafts in the injured spinal cord.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9713-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). FACS analysis reviewed that more than 99% of NSCs expressed GFP (Figure S1A available online). In addition, NSCs, whether transduced with GFP or not, dramatically downregulated expression of the conventional pluripotency markers Tra1-81 and SSEA4 (Figures S1B and S1C) and maintained expression of NSC-associated markers, including nestin and Sox2 (Figures S1D and S1E) (Israel et al., 2012Israel M.A. Yuan S.H. Bardy C. Reyna S.M. Mu Y. Herrera C. Hefferan M.P. Van Gorp S. Nazor K.L. Boscolo F.S. et al.Probing sporadic and familial Alzheimer’s disease using induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2012; 482: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). GFP-expressing NSCs were harvested and embedded in fibrin matrices containing a growth factor cocktail (see Experimental Procedures; Lu et al., 2012bLu P. Wang Y. Graham L. McHale K. Gao M. Wu D. Brock J. Blesch A. Rosenzweig E.S. Havton L.A. et al.Long-distance growth and connectivity of neural stem cells after severe spinal cord injury.Cell. 2012; 150: 1264-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) to promote graft survival and retention in the lesion site. Cells were grafted into C5 spinal cord hemisection lesion sites (n = 7), 2 weeks after the original spinal cord injury. Control subjects (n = 5) underwent the same lesions and injections of the fibrin matrix containing the growth factor cocktail lacking neural stem cells. Subjects underwent weekly functional assessment and were perfused 3 months postgrafting. When examined 3 months posttransplantation, grafted human iPSC-derived NSCs survived and were distributed through most of the lesion (Figure 1A; Figures S2A–S2G). Grafts in four of seven animals exhibited a rift near the center of the graft (Figures S2D–S2G) that contained collagen that effectively segregated the graft into rostral and caudal components (Figures S2H and S2I), while grafts in the remaining three animals were free of rifts but exhibited some attenuation of cell density near the central region of the graft (Figures S2A–S2C and S2J). The majority (71.2% ± 3.1%) of grafted human iPSC-derived NSCs expressed the mature neuronal marker NeuN (Figure 1B; Figure S2K). Grafted cells also expressed the neuronal markers MAP2 and Tuj1 (Figures S2L and S2M), whereas expression of the immature neuronal marker doublecortin (DCX) was rarely detected by 3 months postgrafting (data not shown); 17.7% ± 2.8% of grafted cells expressed the mature astrocyte marker GFAP (Figure S2N). We could not detect expression of the mature oligodendrocyte marker APC in NSC grafts: while NG2-labeled oligodendrocyte progenitor cells were present in the graft, they did not colocalize with GFP or human nuclear antigen (Figures S2O and S2P), suggesting origin from the host; our iPSC selection conditions favored neuronal and astrocyte enrichment (see Experimental Procedures). In addition to general neuronal markers, 4.4% ± 0.9% of grafted cells expressed choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), characteristic of spinal motor neurons (Figures S2Q and S2R). No cells within grafts detectably expressed the serotonergic neuronal marker, 5-HT. Some grafted cells migrated into the host spinal cord adjoining the lesion site (Figure 1A) and expressed the mature astrocytic marker GFAP (Figures S2S and S2T). Seven percent of grafted cells expressed Ki67 (Figures S3A–S3D), suggesting continued proliferation of a proportion of grafted human cells 3 months postimplantation. No teratomas were observed. Grafted human iPSC-derived NSCs extended very large numbers of GFP-expressing immunoreactive axons directly out of the lesion site and into the host spinal cord (Figures 1C–1G). The axonal nature of these GFP-expressing projections from the lesion site was confirmed by GFP colocalization with Tuj1 (ßIII-tubulin, Figure 1C, inset). Interestingly, despite expression of mature neuronal markers by cell somata in the graft, few GFP-expressing graft-derived axons that had grown out of the graft expressed the mature axonal marker neurofilament (NF) 3 months postgrafting (Figure 1C, inset). The number of GFP-labeled human axons emerging caudally from the hemilesion site was quantified in a series of horizontal sections at a point 0.5 mm caudal to the lesion site in the entire right hemicord of a representative subject: 20,500 axons were identified, a conservative estimate, because bundles of axons that could not be independently resolved were counted as single axons. This number is 41% higher than the number of axons emerging from grafts of rat-derived neural progenitor cells per hemicord in our previous report (Lu et al., 2012bLu P. Wang Y. Graham L. McHale K. Gao M. Wu D. Brock J. Blesch A. Rosenzweig E.S. Havton L.A. et al.Long-distance growth and connectivity of neural stem cells after severe spinal cord injury.Cell. 2012; 150: 1264-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Indeed, within three spinal segments of implantation, the density of graft-derived human axons appeared to qualitatively equal that of rodent host axons in some regions of white matter (Figure 1G). Notably, human axons grew in organized, rostrocaudal linear trajectories in host white matter (Figures 1D, 1F, and 1G). Throughout the course of their white matter projections, human axons gave off branches that dove into host gray matter (Figures 1E; Figures S3E–S3H). Human axons in host gray matter were highly ramified (Figures 1E; Figures S3E–S3H), similar to patterns of endogenous axonal branching and termination in host gray matter. Many human axons terminated in lamina IV to VII (Figure 1F). The density of human axons extending in rostral and caudal directions from the implant site qualitatively appeared equal (Figures S3I–S3P). Human NSC graft-derived axons extended over very long distances in the host spinal cord, continuing to extend into the brain and even reaching the olfactory bulb (Figure 2). Indeed, from the C5 lesion site axons extended through adult host white matter as far caudally as the distal lumbar spinal cord (Figures 2A–2D) and as far rostrally as the frontal cortex and olfactory bulb (Figures 2E–2K); human axons essentially extended the entire length of the adult rat neuraxis. Most rostrally extending axons grew as a bundle through the ventrolateral spinal cord and ventral portion of the brainstem (Figure 2E), continuing to extend rostrally through the region of the hypothalamus (Figure 2E). The total distance traversed corresponded to more than 26 spinal segments, greater than 9 cm in length; this exceeds by 2-fold the distance over which axons emerged from grafts of rat multipotent neural precursor cells in our previous study (Lu et al., 2012bLu P. Wang Y. Graham L. McHale K. Gao M. Wu D. Brock J. Blesch A. Rosenzweig E.S. Havton L.A. et al.Long-distance growth and connectivity of neural stem cells after severe spinal cord injury.Cell. 2012; 150: 1264-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Axon density progressively diminished as a function of distance from the graft. Recently, it was reported that grafts of multipotent neural progenitor cells can spread from an implantation site in approximately half of cases, although teratomas are not observed (Steward et al., 2014Steward O. Sharp K.G. Matsudaira Yee K. Long-distance migration and colonization of transplanted neural stem cells.Cell. 2014; 156: 385-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, Tuszynski et al., 2014Tuszynski M.H. Wang Y. Graham L. Gao M. Wu D. Brock J. Blesch A. Rosenzweig E.S. Havton L.A. Zheng B. et al.Neural stem cell dissemination after grafting to CNS injury sites.Cell. 2014; 156: 388-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After grafting human iPSCs in the present study, we observed cell spread into the central canal for up to three segments from the implantation site in four of seven grafted animals (Figures S3Q–S3T). There were not, however, ectopic collections or nodules of cells at more remote segments from the lesion, including the distal spinal cord, brainstem, or brain after examining every sixth section labeled for GFP throughout the neuraxis. Graft cells that spread into the central canal extended axons into the immediately adjoining spinal cord, but these did not extend farther than 0.5–1 mm into host parenchyma. Notably, the extraordinarily high number of axons extending into host white matter surrounding the lesion site emerged directly from grafts in the lesion site (Figures 1A and 1C) and not from the modest numbers of neurons located in ectopic cell nests in the central canal (which extended axons into the host spinal cord for more limited distances). Similarly, axons extending into the brainstem and brain were direct extensions of axons in ventromedial white matter emerging from grafts placed in the lesion site, as observed in Figure 2E; these axons did not arise from the modest numbers of neurons located in ectopic cell nests in the central canal. Tracing of individual axons from the olfactory bulb and lumbar spinal cord to the midcervical spinal cord graft would be required to state with certainty that axons visualized as far rostrally as the olfactory bulb and as far caudally as the lumbar spinal cord arose from the graft, rather than these isolated cell nests. However, the preponderance of evidence suggests that these long-growing axons originated from the graft in the lesion site: axons emerging from the graft numbered in the tens of thousands and could be visualized extending directly into the brainstem, whereas (1) the number of cells in ectopic nests was far lower, (2) cell nests were present only up to three segments from the lesion site, and (3) axons arising from these nests extended few axons in comparison to grafts in the lesion site. Previously, we reported that grafted rat NSC-derived axons were frequently myelinated by host rat oligodendrocytes in spinal cord white matter 7 weeks postgrafting (Lu et al., 2012bLu P. Wang Y. Graham L. McHale K. Gao M. Wu D. Brock J. Blesch A. Rosenzweig E.S. Havton L.A. et al.Long-distance growth and connectivity of neural stem cells after severe spinal cord injury.Cell. 2012; 150: 1264-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Three months postgrafting an extremely high density of human iPSC-derived axons extended through adult white matter (Figures 1C, 1D, 1F, 1G, 2A, 2B, 2E, 2H, 3A, and 3 B; Figures S3E–S3P). These extending human axons frequently directly contacted host myelin membranes (Figures 3A–3C), suggesting that graft-derived axons are not inhibited by adult myelin (Schwab et al., 2005Schwab J.M. Failli V. Chédotal A. Injury-related dynamic myelin/oligodendrocyte axon-outgrowth inhibition in the central nervous system.Lancet. 2005; 365: 2055-2057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, graft-derived human axons were not detectably myelinated by rat host oligodendrocytes (Figures 3A–3C). GFP-labeled human axons formed bouton-like terminals in host rat gray matter (Figure 3D). These structures colocalized with synaptophysin and were present at all levels of the rat spinal cord in close apposition to host neurons and dendrites, including choline acetyltransferase-expressing host spinal motor neurons (Figure 3E). Human-specific synaptophysin labeling was detected at human axon terminals in host spinal cord gray matter and was distributed predominantly in laminae VI-VII (Figure 3F; Figures S4A, S4B, S4D, and S4E). Human axon terminals expressing human-specific synaptophysin were frequently in direct contact with host neuronal dendrites labeled with MAP-2 (Figure 3F). Given the availability of a human-specific synaptophysin label (hSyn, Chemicon), we were able to quantify the relative contribution of human synaptophysin to total synaptophysin at a location three spinal segments caudal to the graft, at the C8 level: human synaptophysin accounted for 9% of total synaptophysin at this level (Figures S4A–S4F). In addition, a modest number of human axon terminals expressed vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1), suggesting the presence of glutamatergic terminals (Figure 3G), whereas expression of GABAergic markers was not detected. However, the overall expression of transmitter-associated markers was relatively modest, possibly reflecting the still-developing nature of many human axons at this stage. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the presence of synaptic structures forming between GFP-labeled, graft-derived human axons and host dendrites (Figure 3H). A priori it is extremely unlikely that the human axons observed in this study were a result of fusion with host rat spinal cord neurons, given (1) the very high density of GFP-expressing axons, (2) their presence in axonal tracts originating from the brain (where fusion could not have occurred), and (3) their projection to ectopic locations (such as the olfactory bulb). To confirm the absence of fusion, we performed an additional study. Human iPSC-derived NSCs were transduced with lentiviral vectors to express red fluorescent protein (RFP) and were grafted into C5 hemisection lesion sites in transgenic GFP-expressing mice (n = 4). The recipient mice were immunodeficient (Niclou et al., 2008Niclou S.P. Danzeisen C. Eikesdal H.P. Wiig H. Brons N.H. Poli A.M. Svendsen A. Torsvik A. Enger P.O. Terzis J.A. Bjerkvig R. A novel eGFP-expressing immunodeficient mouse model to study tumor-host interactions.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 3120-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). When examined 1 month after grafting, numerous graft-derived axons emerged from the lesion site; cells or axons double labeled for RFP (human) and GFP (rats) were never detected (Figures 4A and 4B ). We examined whether host axons also grew into human iPSC-derived NSC grafts. Host serotonergic axons, which exert important roles in modulating motor function (Ribotta et al., 2000Ribotta M.G. Provencher J. Feraboli-Lohnherr D. Rossignol S. Privat A. Orsal D.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 9264-9278Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), penetrated human iPSC-derived NSC grafts and expressed the presynaptic terminal marker synaptophysin (Figures 4C–4F). Their growth into iPSC grafts significantly exceeded growth into the lesion cavity in control animals by 6-fold (p < 0.001; Figure 4G). The reticulospinal motor projection to the spinal cord was anterogradely labeled by injecting biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the pontine paragigantocellular reticular nucleus (Lu et al., 2012aLu P. Blesch A. Graham L. Wang Y. Samara R. Banos K. Haringer V. Havton L. Weishaupt N. Bennett D. et al.Motor axonal regeneration after partial and complete spinal cord transection.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 8208-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Reticulospinal motor axons also penetrated human iPSC-derived NSC grafts (Figures S4G–S4I). Thus, reciprocal connections from host-to-graft (Figure 4; Figures S4G–S4I) and graft-to-host (Figure 3) were present. The presence of both host-to-graft and graft-to-host synaptic structures generated a potential mechanism for creating relays across lesions that could support functional recovery (Lu et al., 2012bLu P. Wang Y. Graham L. McHale K. Gao M. Wu D. Brock J. Blesch A. Rosenzweig E.S. Havton L.A. et al.Long-distance growth and connectivity of neural stem cells after severe spinal cord injury.Cell. 2012; 150: 1264-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). However, as noted earlier, collagenous rifts were present within the centers of most grafts, and axons did not cross these rifts (Figures S2D–S2I); this could lead to disconnection of proximal and distal graft segments. In addition, among grafts lacking clear midline rifts, there were regions of cell density attenuation in the graft core (Figures 1A; Figures S2A–S2C and S2J) that also reduced potential substrates for neural relay formation. When behavioral outcomes were assessed on three tasks sensitive to forelimb function (grid-walking, grooming, and vertical exploration), functional recovery was not observed (Figures S4J and S4L). We recently reported that neural stem cells extend axons over very long distances when grafted to the injured spinal cord (Lu et al., 2012bLu P. Wang Y. Graham L. McHale K. Gao M. Wu D. Brock J. Blesch A. Rosenzweig E.S. Havton L.A. et al.Long-distance growth and connectivity of neural stem cells after severe spinal cord injury.Cell. 2012; 150: 1264-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), despite the inhibitory milieu of the adult CNS. We now report yet more extensive growth of neural stem cells derived from human iPSCs: human axons extend in both greater numbers and over virtually the entire length of the rat CNS. Indeed, in some regions of the injured spinal cord, the number of human axons appears nearly equal to rat axons (Figures 3A and 3B). Human axons form synapses onto rodent neurons, and rodent axons penetrate human grafts and express presynaptic proteins. Notably, this degree of axonal extension occurs from cells of an 86-year-old human, indicating that age does not appear to be a barrier to the expression of highly plastic properties of neural stem cells grafted into models of central injury. These findings provide further support that intrinsic neuronal growth mechanisms overcome the inhibitory milieu of the injured adult CNS, permitting extensive and very long-distance axonal growth. While previous studies grafted iPSC-derived neural stem cells in models of spinal cord injury, the extensive degree of axonal growth that we detect was not previously recognized, possibly because reporter genes or their promoters were weaker (Tsuji et al., 2010Tsuji O.

Neurol. 2013; 248: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our vectors robustly express enhanced GFP using a hybrid chick β-actin promoter (Taylor et al., 2006Taylor L. Jones L. Tuszynski M.H. Blesch A. Neurotrophin-3 gradients established by lentiviral gene delivery promote short-distance axonal bridging beyond cellular grafts in the injured spinal cord.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9713-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Moreover, our grafting method appears to result in superior graft survival and filling of the lesion site, which may support emergence of greater numbers of axons. Human axons in this experiment were in direct physical contact with rat myelin (Figure 3C), yet their growth was not inhibited. It is possible that the lengthened developmental period of human compared to rat neurons allowed human axons to grow for longer distances prior to the expression of cell surface receptors that mediate axon-glial interactions and myelin-associated inhibition. Indeed, human axons emerging from grafts commonly expressed the early axonal marker Tuj1 but not the mature axonal marker neurofilament, suggesting that as axons extend outward from the lesion site, they are still at a developmental stage. The expression of neurofilament in the developing human CNS starts as late as gestational week 25 (>6 months) (Pundir et al., 2012Pundir A.S. Hameed L.S. Dikshit P.C. Kumar P. Mohan S. Radotra B.

Funct. 2012; 217: 303-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and it is possible that axons had not yet reached this stage of relative maturity. A prolonged developmental period of human neurons could also account for the lack of detectable myelination of human axons in the rat spinal cord in this experiment: human axon myelination might require neuronal maturation or contact/stabilization with a host target neuron. Previous reports demonstrate that human oligodendrocytes are capable of myelinating rodent axons (Keirstead et al., 2005Keirstead H.S. Nistor G. Bernal G. Totoiu M. Cloutier F. Sharp K. Steward O.

Host axons grew into human iPSC-derived neural stem cell grafts placed in the C5 hemisection lesion site and formed synaptic structures, and human axons grew in both directions from the lesion site and formed synaptic structures with host neurons and dendrites. Yet persistent functional improvement was not detected, in contrast to our previous study grafting rat or human neural progenitors to sites of spinal cord injury (Lu et al., 2012bLu P. Wang Y. Graham L. McHale K. Gao M. Wu D. Brock J. Blesch A. Rosenzweig E.S.

Numerous mechanisms may account for a lack of functional benefit in this study, including (1) separation of the graft into rostral and caudal compartments by a central collagenous fissure, across which relays did not extend, (2) continuing maturation of grafted cells, such that too few neurons were fully mature and functional at the time of behavioral assessment to support recovery, (3) an absence of myelination of grafted axons (Alto et al., 2009Alto L.T. Havton L.A. Conner J.M. Hollis 2nd, E.R. Blesch A. Tuszynski M.H. Chemotropic guidance facilitates axonal regeneration and synapse formation after spinal cord injury.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1106-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), (4) formation of ectopic projections that were functionally detrimental, (5) insufficient expression of neurotransmitters that are compatible with normal circuit function, or (6) a type I error in which too few animals were studied to yield significant differences. Can one conclude from the present study that human iPSC-derived neurons are inferior to ES-derived or neural progenitor cells in supporting functional recovery, since we observed significant functional improvement in our previous study after grafting multipotent neural precursor cells to sites of T3 complete transection (Lu et al., 2012bLu P. Wang Y. Graham L. McHale K. Gao M. Wu D. Brock J. Blesch A. Rosenzweig E.S. Havton L.A. et al.Long-distance growth and connectivity of neural stem cells after severe spinal cord injury.Cell. 2012; 150: 1264-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), but no functional improvement in the present study? No. The comparison of behavioral outcomes between studies is complex. Our previous study (Lu et al., 2012bLu P. Wang Y. Graham L. McHale K. Gao M. Wu D. Brock J. Blesch A. Rosenzweig E.S. Havton L.A. et al.Long-distance growth and connectivity of neural stem cells after severe spinal cord injury.Cell. 2012; 150: 1264-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) assessed outcomes on hindlimb locomotion, which reflects whether supraspinal inputs from above the lesion are activating pattern generators for locomotion that are located entirely below the lesion; reconstruction of the (preserved) pattern generator is not necessary, only the activation of this circuitry. In contrast, the motor endpoints in the current study consist of more complex use and placement of the forepaw, features that are not driven by local pattern generators and that probably require more accurate innervation and integration of several supraspinal inputs to local segmental motor output neurons. Moreover, this lesion was a hemisection rather than a complete transection, thus host axon sparing and sprouting may support, or interfere with, functional improvement (Tuszynski and Steward, 2012Tuszynski M.H. Steward O. Concepts and methods for the study of axonal regeneration in the CNS.Neuron. 2012; 74: 777-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A determination of relative functional benefits of iPSC-derived neural stem cells, embryonic-derived neural stem cells, and rodent-derived neural stem cells requires concurrent study in the same model system to draw clear conclusions. Moreover, in the present iPSC, grafts contained collagenous rifts that divided grafts into rostral and caudal compartments across which axons did not travel, precluding formation of neuronal relays across the lesion to restore function. Grafts in our previous study did not contain large rifts, although smaller rifts were present in some cases (Lu et al., 2012bLu P. Wang Y. Graham L. McHale K. Gao M. Wu D. Brock J. Blesch A. Rosenzweig E.S. Havton L.A. et al.Long-distance growth and connectivity of neural stem cells after severe spinal cord injury.Cell. 2012; 150: 1264-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). We also observe collagenous rifts when grafting neural stem cells into animals with chronic injuries (P.L. et al., unpublished data). We are currently attempting to attenuate or eliminate rifts by degrading collagen in the lesion cavity at the time of neural stem cell grafting. Interestingly, grafts into closed contusion cavities do not consistently form rifts (P.L. et al., unpublished data), suggesting that cells from the leptomeninges in open lesion cavities form these scars. Spinal cord contusion is the most common mechanism of human injury, and rift formation may therefore not be a limiting factor in considering future human translation. iPSC-derived cells offer the possibility of avoiding immunosuppressant drugs that are problematic in an already severely injured and vulnerable human population. One human iPSC line was the subject of the present study, and additional lines need to be tested to determine the extent to which heterogeneity in donor source and methods of cell preparation (Toivonen et al., 2013Toivonen S.

In addition, specific iPSC lines have differing teratogenic properties (Tsuji et al., 2010Tsuji O. Miura K. Okada Y. Fujiyoshi K. Mukaino M. Nagoshi N. Kitamura K. Kumagai G. Nishino M.

Yet the present demonstration that human neural stem cells exhibit the most extensive outgrowth of axons from a spinal cord lesion site yet reported, that these properties are observed even when using donor cells of old age, and that grafting can be performed after clinically relevant treatment delays, motivates the performance of additional studies that more fully identify and utilize optimal cell types for nonhuman studies of neural injury and for potential future translational trials. Prior to considering clinical trials, several additional points should be addressed: can extending axons be guided toward appropriate targets and away from inappropriate targets? Might axons that project to ectopic targets result in adverse behavioral consequences? How will grafts affect sensory and autonomic outcomes? Will projections arising from grafted neural stem cells, like the naturally developing nervous system, undergo pruning, as some projections are strengthened and others eliminated? These and related studies will determine whether the extensive axonal growth observed from iPSC-derived neural stem cells can be harnessed for therapeutic benefit. The generation of human iPSCs and NSCs was described previously (Yuan et al., 2011Yuan S.H. Martin J. Elia J. Flippin J. Paramban R.I. Hefferan M.P. Vidal J.G. Mu Y. Killian R.L.

Adult female athymic nude rats (n = 14) and adult SCID mice (n = 4) underwent C5 lateral spinal cord lesions; seven rats received human iPSC-derived NSC grafts, and five controls received no grafts; all underwent weekly behavioral analysis for 3 months postgrafting. Two additional subjects were grafted and dedicated to ultrastructural analysis. Four SCID-GFP mice received RFP-expressing iPSC grafts for study of cell fusion over a 1 month survival period. Spinal cord blocks containing iPSC grafts, the rest of spinal cord, and brain were sectioned and immunolabeled for GFP and additional cell markers.

Herzfeld et al. found that when we practice a movement, the human brain has a memory for errors that is then used to learn faster in new conditions. This memory for error exists in parallel with motor memory's two traditional forms: memory of actions and memory of external perturbations. They also proposed a mathematical model for learning from errors. This model explained previous experimental results and predicted other major findings that they later verified experimentally.

The Ionotropic Receptor (IR) superfamily is best known for its role in olfaction, but virtually nothing is known about a clade of ∼35 members, the IR20a clade. Here, a comprehensive analysis of this clade reveals expression in all taste organs of the fly. Some members are expressed in orphan taste neurons, whereas others are coexpressed with bitter- or sugar-sensing Gustatory receptor (Gr) genes. Analysis of the closely related IR52c and IR52d genes reveals signatures of adaptive evolution, roles in male mating behavior, and sexually dimorphic expression in neurons of the male foreleg, which contacts females during courtship. These neurons are activated by conspecific females and contact a neural circuit for sexual behavior. Together, these results greatly expand the repertoire of candidate taste and pheromone receptors in the fly."

https://openalex.org/W1975050865,"Spinal circuits generate locomotion with variable speed as circumstances demand. These circuits have been assumed to convey equal and uniform excitation to all motoneurons whose input resistance dictates their activation sequence. However, the precise connectivity pattern between excitatory premotor circuits and the different motoneuron types has remained unclear. Here, we generate a connectivity map in adult zebrafish between the V2a excitatory interneurons and slow, intermediate, and fast motoneurons. We show that the locomotor network does not consist of a uniform circuit as previously assumed. Instead, it can be deconstructed into three separate microcircuit modules with distinct V2a interneuron subclasses driving slow, intermediate, or fast motoneurons. This modular design enables the increase of locomotor speed by sequentially adding microcircuit layers from slow to intermediate and fast. Thus, this principle of organization of vertebrate spinal circuits represents an intrinsic mechanism to increase the locomotor speed by incrementally engaging different motor units."
https://openalex.org/W2065575763,"The synaptic connectivity within neuronal networks is thought to determine the information processing they perform, yet network structure-function relationships remain poorly understood. By combining quantitative anatomy of the cerebellar input layer and information theoretic analysis of network models, we investigated how synaptic connectivity affects information transmission and processing. Simplified binary models revealed that the synaptic connectivity within feedforward networks determines the trade-off between information transmission and sparse encoding. Networks with few synaptic connections per neuron and network-activity-dependent threshold were optimal for lossless sparse encoding over the widest range of input activities. Biologically detailed spiking network models with experimentally constrained synaptic conductances and inhibition confirmed our analytical predictions. Our results establish that the synaptic connectivity within the cerebellar input layer enables efficient lossless sparse encoding. Moreover, they provide a functional explanation for why granule cells have approximately four dendrites, a feature that has been evolutionarily conserved since the appearance of fish."
https://openalex.org/W1970685138,"Using an array-based approach after auditory fear conditioning and microRNA (miRNA) sponge-mediated inhibition, we identified a role for miR-34a within the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in fear memory consolidation. Luciferase assays and bioinformatics suggested the Notch pathway as a target of miR-34a. mRNA and protein levels of Notch receptors and ligands are downregulated in a time- and learning-specific manner after fear conditioning in the amygdala. Systemic and stereotaxic manipulations of the Notch pathway indicated that Notch signaling in the BLA suppresses fear memory consolidation. Impairment of fear memory consolidation after inhibition of miR-34a within the BLA is rescued by inhibiting Notch signaling. Together, these data suggest that within the BLA, a transient decrease in Notch signaling, via miR-34a regulation, is important for the consolidation of fear memory. This work expands the idea that developmental molecules have roles in adult behavior and that existing interventions targeting them hold promise for treating neuropsychiatric disorders.Video Abstracthttps://www.cell.com/cms/asset/28a30166-13ad-41cc-bb9d-4e6d5e0ed572/mmc3.mp4Loading ...(mp4, 77.4 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2168311440,"The endothelial surface glycocalyx is a hydrated mesh in which proteoglycans are prominent. It is damaged in diseases associated with elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). We investigated the mechanism of TNF-α-induced disruption of the glomerular endothelial glycocalyx. We used conditionally immortalized human glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs), quantitative PCR arrays, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and dot blots to examine the effects of TNF-α. TNF-α induced syndecan 4 (SDC4) mRNA up-regulation by 2.5-fold, whereas cell surface SDC4 and heparan sulfate (HS) were reduced by 36 and 30%, respectively, and SDC4 and sulfated glycosaminoglycan in the culture medium were increased by 52 and 65%, respectively, indicating TNF-α-induced shedding. Small interfering (siRNA) knockdown of SDC4 (by 52%) caused a corresponding loss of cell surface HS of similar magnitude (38%), and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that SDC4 and HS are shed as intact proteoglycan ectodomains. All of the effects of TNF-α on SDC4 and HS were abrogated by the metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor batimastat. Also abrogated was the associated 37% increase in albumin passage across GEnC monolayers. Specific MMP9 knockdown by siRNA similarly blocked TNF-α effects. SDC4 is the predominant HS proteoglycan in the GEnC glycocalyx. TNF-α-induced MMP9-mediated shedding of SDC4 is likely to contribute to the endothelial glycocalyx disruption observed in diabetes and inflammatory states.—Ramnath, R., Foster, R.

How a single chemotropic molecule can act in such contradictory ways has long been a puzzle at the molecular level. Here we present the crystal structure of netrin-1 in complex with the Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) receptor. We show that one netrin-1 molecule can simultaneously bind to two DCC molecules through a DCC-specific site and through a unique generic receptor binding site, where sulfate ions staple together positively charged patches on both DCC and netrin-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that UNC5A can replace DCC on the generic receptor binding site to switch the response from attraction to repulsion. We propose that the modularity of binding allows for the association of other netrin receptors at the generic binding site, eliciting alternative turning responses."

Runx2 expression occurs at early stages of osteochondroprogenitor determination, followed by Osx induction during osteoblast maturation. We demonstrate that coexpression of Osx and Runx2 leads to cooperative induction of expression of the osteogenic genes Col1a1, Fmod, and Ibsp. Functional interaction of Osx and Runx2 in the regulation of these promoters is mediated by enhancer regions with adjacent Sp1 and Runx2 DNA-binding sites. These enhancers allow formation of a cooperative transcriptional complex, mediated by the binding of Osx and Runx2 to their specific DNA promoter sequences and by the protein-protein interactions between them. We also identified the domains involved in the interaction between Osx and Runx2. These regions contain the amino acids in Osx and Runx2 known to be phosphorylated by p38 and ERK MAPKs.

Bone development and remodeling depend on the activity of the osteoblasts that derive from condensations of mesenchymal stem cells. It is well known that osteochondroprogenitor maturation and the later conversion of preosteoblasts to mature osteoblasts are controlled by a complex network of transcription factors activated by specific osteogenic signals. Among these transcription factors, Runx2 and Osx (Osterix) play a critical role in osteogenesis (1.Sinha K.M. Yasuda H. Zhou X. de Crombrugghe B.

Promoters of several osteoblast-specific genes contain both Runx2-binding sites (TGTGGT) and Sp1 boxes (which are bound by Osx). Thus, it is plausible that Runx2 and Osx work in a collaborative manner to activate the osteoblast genetic program and produce a bone-specific matrix. This hypothesis is supported by the described interaction between Runx2 and Osx in the transcriptional regulation of Mmp13 and Col1a1 genes (19.Nishimura R. Wakabayashi M. Hata K. Matsubara T.

Conversely, in the regulation of Nell-1 expression, Osx and Runx2 seem to play opposite roles, as the former represses the expression of this gene, and the latter activates it (23.Chen F. Zhang X.

NELL-1, an osteoinductive factor, is a direct transcriptional target of Osterix.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e24638Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the control of downstream events, the master function of Runx2 has also been shown to be tightly regulated by interaction with cofactors. For instance, interaction with Stat1 inhibits its nuclear localization, and interaction with Twist1, Nrf2, or COUP-TFII (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II) blocks Runx2 DNA-binding ability (20.Lee K.N.

In turn, Osx also collaborates with other transcription factors and cofactors such as Sp1, NFATc1, and NO66, which regulate its activity (1.Sinha K.M. Yasuda H. Zhou X. de Crombrugghe B.

NFATc1 forms a complex with Osx and activates Col1a1 promoter activity, but it does not activate Runx2-dependent transcription (31.Koga T. Matsui Y. Asagiri M. Kodama T. de Crombrugghe B. Nakashima K. Takayanagi H. NFAT and Osterix cooperatively regulate bone formation.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). These studies evidence a complex cross-talk between these transcription factors and the transcriptional machinery but also highlight that our knowledge of their regulatory mechanisms is limited. Recent work has expanded our understanding of the role of p38 and ERK MAPKs in the control of osteogenesis and, in particular, their regulation of Runx2 and Osx transcriptional activity (32.Greenblatt M.B. Shim J.H. Glimcher L.H. Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in osteoblasts.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2013; 29: 63-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Induction of Osx expression requires the activation of Dlx5 through p38-mediated phosphorylation (16.Ulsamer A. Ortuño M.J. Ruiz S. Susperregui A.R. Osses N. Rosa J.L. Ventura F.

Furthermore, it has been shown that Osx itself is a substrate for p38 (33.Ortuño M.J. Ruiz-Gaspà S. Rodríguez-Carballo E. Susperregui A.R. Bartrons R. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. p38 regulates expression of osteoblast-specific genes by phosphorylation of Osterix.J. Biol.

Osterix is regulated by Erk1/2 during osteoblast differentiation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 415: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 35.Celil A.B. Campbell P.G. BMP-2 and insulin-like growth factor-I mediate Osterix (Osx) expression in human mesenchymal stem cells via the MAPK and protein kinase D signaling pathways.J. Biol.

Rodríguez-Carballo E. Susperregui A.R. Bartrons R. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. p38 regulates expression of osteoblast-specific genes by phosphorylation of Osterix.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 31985-31994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Similarly, Runx2 is strongly regulated through direct p38 and ERK MAPK phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Runx2 at multiple sites leads to increased transcriptional activity. Thus, a regulatory network exists in which p38 and ERK MAPK phosphorylation is involved in the induction and control of Runx2 and Osx transcriptional activity. Here, we report functional cooperation between Osx and Runx2 modulating the expression of osteoblast genes Col1a1, Fmod (fibromodulin), and Ibsp, which are involved in the formation of a mature bone matrix. Induction of these genes is mediated through enhancer regions encompassing nearby Sp1 sites and Runx2 DNA-binding sites. Formation of a cooperative complex is mediated through DNA binding of Runx2 and Osx to their cognate sequences as well as protein-protein interactions between them. Moreover, we demonstrate that their phosphorylation by p38 and/or ERK MAPK at specific sites is required for efficient interaction and cooperation. C2C12, Saos-2, and HEK-293T cell lines (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm pyruvate, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin.

SB203580 and U0126 (Calbiochem) were used at final concentrations of 10 and 5 µm, respectively. Antibodies against Osx (Abcam), Runx2 (MBL International Corp.), and α-tubulin (Sigma) were used at a 1:1000 dilution. Saos-2 or C2C12 cells were cultured in 6-well plates and transfected for 8 h with Lipofectamine LTX with the indicated plasmids. The transfection efficiency was assessed by GFP expression. Luciferase activities were quantified at 48 h using the Luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized using the β-Galactosidase Detection Kit II (Clontech). The fusion proteins GST-Osx and GST-Runx2 and their derivatives were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads. For in vitro binding assays, cells expressing Osx and/or Runx2 were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with 0.3% CHAPS, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors at 4 °C for 15 min. Lysates were collected and centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 5 min to eliminate cellular debris. Supernatants were incubated with the appropriate chimeric protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were then collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 1 min and washed five times with wash buffer (0.1% CHAPS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 150 mm NaCl). Finally, proteins bound to the beads were subjected to immunoblotting. Primary osteoblasts or transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were lysed as described above. The supernatant fraction was incubated overnight with 1 µg of anti-Osx or anti-Runx2 antibody, followed by incubation with 20 µl of Protein A/G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h. Bound proteins were washed four times with lysis buffer and detected by immunoblotting. To detect the presence of proteins in the cell extracts or pulldowns, we performed immunoblotting with anti-Osx, anti-Runx2, or anti-α-tubulin antibody diluted at 1:1000. Immunoreactive bands were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using an ECL kit (Biological Industries). Saos-2 and MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured until confluence and fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, and the reaction was stopped with 0.01 m glycine for 5 min. Cells were lysed and sonicated to obtain 200–1000-bp fragments. ChIP was carried out using 1 µg of the indicated antibody (anti-Osx, anti-Runx2, anti-RNA polymerase II (Upstate), or anti-IgG (Upstate) as a control) and purified with 20 µl of Magna ChIP Protein A+G magnetic beads (Millipore). The complexes were washed once with four different wash buffers and eluted with a solution containing SDS and NaHCO3. Reversion of cross-linking was carried out by overnight incubation with 0.2 m NaCl at 65 °C, followed by treatment with proteinase K and RNase A. The DNA fragments were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and analyzed by PCR. The primers used for Saos-2 cells for PCR analysis were as follows: HsFmod F, 5′-ggacccagagctcccaatgtttcaggga; HsFmod R, 5′-cgtccctcgagctggcctccttgggttg; HsIbsp F, 5′-cttctttctcatgtggccaacactcg; HsIbsp R, 5′-tggcatcaggagatgtcctctctt; HsColBE F, 5′-tgctccagagctgcaaacgtggaagc; HsColBE R, 5′-tccattgctgtctccagtcctgcct; HsColProx F, 5′-ggttagcccacgccattctgagga; and HsColProx R, 5′-ggaaggggtcggtgtttctcagatg.

Saos-2 and transfected C2C12 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with normal goat serum for 1 h. Cells were stained with anti-Osx antibody at 1:150 dilution and anti-Runx2 antibody at 1:100 dilution, followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 at 1:500 dilution or anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488. Nuclei were stained using a 1:1000 dilution of DRAQ5. Labeling was detected using a Leica TCS SL inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. Total RNA was isolated from C2C12 and MC3T3-E1 cells using TRIsure reagent (Bioline). 5 µg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCRs were carried out using the ABI Prism 7900 HT Fast real-time PCR system and a TaqMan 5′-nuclease probe method (Applied Biosystems). All transcripts were normalized to Gapdh, and transfection efficiency was assessed by GFP expression. Designed TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems) were used to quantify gene expression of mouse Col1a1, Fmod, Ibsp, Gapdh, and osteocalcin. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Quantitative data are presented as means ± S.E. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. The expression of many osteogenic markers is modulated by Osx and/or Runx2. To de"

Osmosensory transduction is a mechanical process whereby decreases in cell volume cause the activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) channels to induce depolarization and increase spiking activity in ONs. However, it is not known how cell shrinking is mechanically coupled to channel activation. Using superresolution imaging, we found that ONs are endowed with a uniquely interweaved scaffold of microtubules throughout their somata. Microtubules physically interact with the C terminus of TRPV1 at the cell surface and provide a pushing force that drives channels activation during shrinking. Moreover, we found that changes in the density of these interactions can bidirectionally modulate osmosensory gain. Microtubules are thus an essential component of the vital neuronal mechanotransduction apparatus that allows the brain to monitor and correct body hydration.

Systemic osmoregulation is a vital process whereby changes in plasma osmolality detected by osmosensory neurons (ONs) modulate ingestive behavior, sympathetic outflow, and renal function to stabilize the tonicity and volume of the extracellular fluid (Bourque, 2008Bourque C.W. Central mechanisms of osmosensation and systemic osmoregulation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Failure to osmoregulate can lead to irreversible organ injury and neurological trauma because of damaging changes in cell volume caused by acute hyperosmolality or hypoosmolality (Bourque, 2008Bourque C.W.

This enhanced electrical activity causes antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) release into the bloodstream and thereby promotes water reabsorption at the kidney to restore hydromineral homeostasis (Bourque, 2008Bourque C.W. Central mechanisms of osmosensation and systemic osmoregulation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Osmosensory transduction in ONs is mediated by an N-terminal variant of transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1), a nonselective cation channel that is activated during hypertonicity-evoked shrinking (Ciura and Bourque, 2006Ciura S. Bourque C.W. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 is required for intrinsic osmoreception in organum vasculosum lamina terminalis neurons and for normal thirst responses to systemic hyperosmolality.J.

An N-terminal variant of Trpv1 channel is required for osmosensory transduction.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The membrane depolarization and increased action potential firing caused by decreases in the volume of ONs is equivalent whether shrinking is evoked by hypertonicity or by negative pressure applied through a patch pipette. Thus, osmosensory transduction does not rely on changes in the concentration of intracellular solutes or ionic strength but is a mechanical process mediated by the decrease in cell volume (Zhang et al., 2007Zhang Z. Kindrat A.N. Sharif-Naeini R. Bourque C.W. Actin filaments mediate mechanical gating during osmosensory transduction in rat supraoptic nucleus neurons.J.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 14669-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which decreases in cell volume are coupled to the activation of TRPV1 in ONs are unknown. However, previous studies have shown that microtubules can interact with TRPV1 in vitro (Goswami et al., 2004Goswami C. Dreger M. Jahnel R. Bogen O. Gillen C. Hucho F.

Dogterom M. Dynamic instability of microtubules is regulated by force.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, Dogterom et al., 2005Dogterom M. Kerssemakers J.W.

Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that microtubules may play a direct role in osmosensory transduction by coupling changes in cell volume to channel activation. Previous work has shown that the magnitude of the cation current activated by hypertonicity in acutely isolated ONs is similar to that generated by intact ONs recorded in situ, suggesting that transduction occurs primarily in the soma of these cells (Bourque, 1989Bourque C.W. Ionic basis for the intrinsic activation of rat supraoptic neurones by hyperosmotic stimuli.J. Physiol. 1989; 417: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, Oliet and Bourque, 1993aOliet S.H. Bourque C.W.

Steady-state osmotic modulation of cationic conductance in neurons of rat supraoptic nucleus.Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: R1475-R1479PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore compared the organization of microtubules in the somata and proximal dendrites of ONs and nonosmosensitive neurons using superresolution imaging with structured illumination microscopy (SIM). SIM analysis of immunostained tissue sections revealed an equivalent density of microtubules in the dendrites of ONs, cortical, and hippocampal neurons (Figures 1A–1G and Figure S1 available online). However, we found that microtubule density was significantly higher in the somata of ONs than in other types of neurons (Figures 1A–1C, 1I–1K, and 1O). Moreover, microtubules in the somata of ONs formed a highly interweaved 3D network that occupied the full volume of the perinuclear cytoplasm, as compared to the sparse and rectilinear arrays observed in other types of neurons (Figures 1I–1O) and commonly reported in other studies (Baas et al., 1987Baas P.W.

Dynamic behavior and organization of cytoskeletal proteins in neurons: reconciling old and new findings.Bioessays. 1998; 20: 798-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To determine whether microtubules are required for osmosensory transduction, we first examined the effects of the microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole (Samson et al., 1979Samson F. Donoso J.A. Heller-Bettinger I. Watson D. Himes R.H. Nocodazole action on tubulin assembly, axonal ultrastructure and fast axoplasmic transport.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1979; 208: 411-417PubMed Google Scholar, Jordan et al., 1992Jordan M.A. Thrower D. Wilson L. Effects of vinblastine, podophyllotoxin and nocodazole on mitotic spindles. Implications for the role of microtubule dynamics in mitosis.J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 401-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on ONs acutely isolated from the SON of adult rats. As illustrated in Figure S2, the somata of untreated ONs preserved a highly interweaved microtubule scaffold similar to that of ONs in situ. Current-clamp recordings showed that increasing the osmolality of the perfusing solution by the addition of mannitol caused a depolarization of the membrane potential and an increase in action potential firing rate in control ONs, but these effects were abolished in cells that had been pretreated with 0.5 μM nocodazole for 15–40 min (Figures 2A and 2B ). Similarly, nocodazole treatment eliminated the hypertonicity-induced increases in membrane conductance observed in control cells (Figures 2C and 2D), despite an equivalent degree of shrinking in both groups of ONs (Figure 2D). Since the effects of hypertonicity on ONs are caused by a mechanical activation of the transduction channels (Oliet and Bourque, 1993bOliet S.H. Bourque C.W. Steady-state osmotic modulation of cationic conductance in neurons of rat supraoptic nucleus.Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: R1475-R1479PubMed Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2007Zhang Z. Kindrat A.N.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4008-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that disrupting microtubules should also interfere with responses to shrinking induced by application of negative pressure to the recording pipette. Indeed, mechanically evoked shrinking caused a depolarization and excitation of control cells, but not nocodazole-treated ONs (Figures 3A and 3B ). Similarly, increases in membrane conductance induced by the application of negative pressure in control ONs were absent in nocodazole-treated cells (Figures 3C and 3D), despite equivalent decreases in ON volume (Figure 3D). By contrast, ONs pretreated with the microtubule-stabilizing compound taxol (5 μM; 15–40 min) (Downing, 2000Downing K.H. Structural basis for the interaction of tubulin with proteins and drugs that affect microtubule dynamics.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 89-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) displayed enhanced responses under both current-clamp (Figures 3A and 3B) and voltage-clamp conditions (Figures 3C and 3D). The ion channel responsible for osmosensory transduction in ONs is an N-terminal variant of TRPV1 that bears an intact cytoplasmic C terminus (Sharif Naeini et al., 2006Sharif Naeini R. Witty M.F. Séguéla P. Bourque C.W. An N-terminal variant of Trpv1 channel is required for osmosensory transduction.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Previous in vitro studies have shown that TRPV1 can directly interact with microtubules through a pair of binding sites for β-tubulin located in the channel’s C terminus (Goswami et al., 2004Goswami C. Dreger M. Jahnel R. Bogen O. Gillen C. Hucho F. Identification and characterization of a Ca2+ -sensitive interaction of the vanilloid receptor TRPV1 with tubulin.J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1092-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, Goswami et al., 2007Goswami C. Hucho T.B. Hucho F. Identification and characterisation of novel tubulin-binding motifs located within the C-terminus of TRPV1.J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that a tubulin-TRPV1 interaction is required for the mechanical excitation of ONs during cell shrinking. To determine whether tubulin interacts with TRPV1 in vivo, we immunoprecipitated extracts prepared from rat SONs with anti-TRPV1 antibody. Tubulin coimmunoprecipitated with TRPV1, revealing the presence of a physical interaction between these proteins in SON (Figure 4A). To determine whether tubulin and TRPV1 interact in intact ONs, we next performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA) that allows detection of proteins that are colocalized at the nanoscale in situ. The PLA approach involves fluorescence detection of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon whose production is conditional on the colocalization of oligonucleotides brought together by antibodies targeting the selected pair of antigens (see Experimental Procedures) (Söderberg et al., 2006Söderberg O. Gullberg M. Jarvius M. Ridderstråle K. Leuchowius K.J. Jarvius J. Wester K. Hydbring P. Bahram F. Larsson L.G. Landegren U.

Detection of antigen interactions ex vivo by proximity ligation assay: endogenous dopamine D2-adenosine A2A receptor complexes in the striatum.Biotechniques. 2011; 51: 111-118PubMed Google Scholar). Application of the PLA approach in acutely isolated ONs revealed multiple sites of tubulin-TRPV1 interaction (Figures 4B–4D). Notably, the majority of tubulin-TRPV1 interactions were observed on the surface of ONs, where transduction is presumed to occur (Figure 4E). The findings above indicate that microtubules might extend all the way to the plasma membrane where they interact with TRPV1 channels on the cell surface. Therefore the effects of nocodazole and taxol on mechanical transduction could be mediated either through a modulation of the density of these interaction sites or through an effect on the integrity of the microtubule scaffold. SIM analysis revealed that nocodazole has no effect on the density or complexity of the somatic microtubule network (Figures 5A, 5B, 5D, and 5E ). Similarly, taxol only caused a slight increase (∼25%) in somatic microtubule density and had no effect on network complexity (Figures 5C–5E). We therefore specifically examined the nature of the submembrane microtubule network using SIM on cells in which tubulin was labeled using immunohistochemistry and the plasma membrane was labeled with DiI. As illustrated in Figure 5F, microtubules were commonly observed to approach and contact the plasma membrane. Moreover, inspection of cell regions displaying intense staining of both microtubules and plasma membrane showed that treatment of ONs with taxol or nocodazole does not affect the integrity of the submembrane microtubule network or the density of sites at which microtubules appear to reach the plasma membrane (Figures 5G–5I) (see Experimental Procedures). In agreement with these observations, previous studies have shown that low concentrations of nocodazole do not affect the integrity of microtubules but can displace proteins that bind at the plus end of microtubules (Stepanova et al., 2003Stepanova T. Slemmer J. Hoogenraad C.C. Lansbergen G. Dortland B. De Zeeuw C.I. Grosveld F. van Cappellen G. Akhmanova A. Galjart N.

Ahmad F.J. Beyond taxol: microtubule-based treatment of disease and injury of the nervous system.Brain. 2013; 136: 2937-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that low doses of nocodazole release TRPV1 from the microtubule tips at the cell surface by disrupting the tubulin-TRPV1 interaction, we examined the effects of 0.5 μM nocodazole on interaction sites detected using the PLA approach. Indeed, nocodazole dramatically decreased the number of sites at which tubulin and TRPV1 interact on the surface of ONs (Figures 5J, 5K, and 5M). Conversely, the density of tubulin-TRPV1 interaction sites was almost doubled on the surface of ONs treated with 5 μM taxol (Figures 5L and 5M). These results suggest that effects of nocodazole and taxol on osmosensory transduction are mediated by their ability to modulate the density of tubulin-TRPV1 interaction sites rather than by affecting the organization of the microtubule network. Previous work has shown that TRPV1 can interact with microtubules via a pair of tubulin-binding domains located in the channel’s cytoplasmic C terminus (Figure S3) (Goswami et al., 2004Goswami C. Dreger M. Jahnel R. Bogen O. Gillen C. Hucho F. Identification and characterization of a Ca2+ -sensitive interaction of the vanilloid receptor TRPV1 with tubulin.J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1092-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, Goswami et al., 2007Goswami C. Hucho T.B. Hucho F. Identification and characterisation of novel tubulin-binding motifs located within the C-terminus of TRPV1.J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To examine whether these interaction sites are involved in mediating mechanotransduction, we examined the effects of specifically disrupting tubulin-TRPV1 interaction at these sites on responses induced by shrinking in ONs. To perform this experiment, we generated three synthetic peptides (P1, P2, P3), whose sequences corresponded to the two tubulin-binding domains (P1 and P2, respectively), and to a nonoverlapping portion of the C terminus to be used as a control (P3; Figure S3) (Goswami et al., 2007Goswami C. Hucho T.B. Hucho F. Identification and characterisation of novel tubulin-binding motifs located within the C-terminus of TRPV1.J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Figure 6A, addition of P1, P2, or P1+P2 significantly interfered with the coimmunoprecipitation of tubulin and TRPV1 in SON lysates, whereas P3 had no effect (Figures 6A and 6B). Thus, P1 and P2 can be used to disrupt the tubulin-TRPV1 interaction, while the P3 peptide can be used as a control. To examine the effect of perturbing the tubulin-TRPV1 interaction on mechanotransduction in isolated ONs, we included synthetic peptides in the solution filling the recording pipettes and recorded mechanically evoked responses at least 20 min after establishing the whole-cell configuration (Figure S4A). While negative pressure caused a similar degree of shrinking in all groups (Figure S4B), excitation was observed only in cells loaded with P3 or vehicle, but not when P1 or P2 were dialyzed into the cells (Figures 6C and 6D). Similarly, suction-induced increases in membrane conductance were abolished by inclusion P1 or P2 peptides in the recording pipette (Figures 6E and 6F). To determine whether TRPV1 channels disconnected from microtubules can be still activated by other (nonmechanical) stimuli, we examined the effect of bath-applying angiotensin II, a neuropeptide that exclusively activates TRPV1 in ONs of the SON via G protein-coupled PKC/PLC pathway (Chakfe and Bourque, 2000Chakfe Y. Bourque C.W. Excitatory peptides and osmotic pressure modulate mechanosensitive cation channels in concert.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, Sharif Naeini et al., 2006Sharif Naeini R. Witty M.F. Séguéla P. Bourque C.W. An N-terminal variant of Trpv1 channel is required for osmosensory transduction.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Application of angiotensin II was found to activate TRPV1 in ONs that had been rendered insensitive to mechanical stimulation by loading with P1 and P2 peptides (Figures 6G and 6H; Figure S5). Thus, displacement of the tubulin-TRPV1 interaction can specifically abolish mechanical regulation of TRPV1 channels, without preventing the activation of these channels by other forms of signaling. Taken together, the findings described above suggest that two models should be considered to explain the mechanical gating of TRPV1 by microtubules in ONs. In the first model (the association model; Figure 7A), the inward movement of the plasma membrane caused by cell shrinking would promote an increase in the number of TRPV1 channels that interact with microtubules, and channel activation would result directly from the establishment of this interaction. In the second model (the push-activation model; Figure 7B), only TRPV1 channels with a preexisting interaction with microtubules would be available for activation. In this case, the inward movement of the plasma membrane would presumably compress the microtubules and generate a push force that leads channel activation. To resolve between these possibilities, we examined the effect of hypertonicity-induced shrinking on the density of TRPV1-tubulin interaction sites detected by the PLA method. Despite the pronounced increase in membrane conductance provoked by hypertonicity (Figures 2C and 2D), this stimulus failed to increase the number of interaction sites observed on the surface of ONs (Figures 7C and 7D). If TRPV1 activation is mediated by application of a push force via an attached microtubule, then this process should occur with little delay (Christensen and Corey, 2007Christensen A.P. Corey D.P. TRP channels in mechanosensation: direct or indirect activation?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 510-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). To determine whether transduction channels can be activated with rapid kinetics, we performed cell-attached recordings from ONs and examined the effects of suddenly displacing the membrane in an inward direction using a high-speed pressure clamp (Figure 8A; see Experimental Procedures). As illustrated in Figures 8B and 8C, small increases in pipette pressure caused a rapid and reversible activation of cation channels with a unitary amplitude of ∼2 pA. Although the probability of channel opening increased gradually following the onset of the pressure pulse (Figure 8D), the latency to first opening was quite rapid (range 4−196 ms, median 54 ms; n = 60; Figure 8E). Collectively, these observations support a push-activation model as the basis for osmosensory transduction. Many types of mechanosensitive cells feature unique molecular architectures that allow them to detect forces associated with physical sensory stimuli (e.g., touch and hearing) and visceral interoceptive signals such as arterial blood pressure and fluid osmolality (Chalfie, 2009Chalfie M. Neurosensory mechanotransduction.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, Marshall and Lumpkin, 2012Marshall K.L. Lumpkin E.A. The molecular basis of mechanosensory transduction.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2012; 739: 142-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A common requirement in these cells is that stimulus-dependent forces dynamically modulate the activity of a mechanosensitive ion channel to generate receptor potentials that change neuronal firing in a manner that faithfully encodes the original stimulus. Previous work has shown that cytoskeletal proteins including actin, cadherins, and myosins can contribute to many forms of mechanotransduction (Christensen and Corey, 2007Christensen A.P. Corey D.P.

The mechanobiology of brain function.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In most cases, these proteins are localized to specialized subcellular regions (e.g., cilia) or extracellular structures (e.g., tip-links in vertebrate hair cells), where they may play an active role in the transduction process (Chalfie, 2009Chalfie M. Neurosensory mechanotransduction.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, little is known concerning the possible role of microtubules in mechanotransduction. Although microtubules are best known for their important roles in intracellular transport and cell division, they are also recognized as the cytosketon’s strongest filaments (Dogterom et al., 2005Dogterom M.

Early studies exploring touch-insensitive mutants of C. elegans suggested that microtubules might play an important role in mechanotransduction at the whole organism level (Chalfie and Sulston, 1981Chalfie M.

https://openalex.org/W1521072705,"Emerging evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS) can stimulate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in a number of cellular processes. However, potential sources of endogenous ROS have not been thoroughly explored. Here, we show that growth factor depletion in human neural progenitor cells induces ROS production in mitochondria. Elevated ROS levels augment activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that regulates neural differentiation. We find that growth factor depletion stimulates the release of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum stores. Ca(2+) subsequently accumulates in the mitochondria and triggers ROS production. The inhibition of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake with simultaneous growth factor depletion prevents the rise in ROS metabolism. Moreover, low ROS levels block the dissociation of the Wnt effector Dishevelled from nucleoredoxin. Attenuation of the response amplitudes of pathway effectors delays the onset of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation and results in markedly impaired neuronal differentiation. Our findings reveal Ca(2+)-mediated ROS metabolic cues that fine-tune the efficiency of cell differentiation by modulating the extent of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling output."

Dual luciferase assay identified a 120-bp JH response region (JHRR) in the Kr-h1α promoter. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that Met and Gce transduce JH signals to induce Kr-h1 expression through the JHRR. DNA affinity purification identified chaperone protein Hsp83 as one of the proteins bound to the JHRR in the presence of JH. Interestingly, Hsp83 physically interacts with PAS-B and basic helix-loop-helix domains of Met, and JH induces Met-Hsp83 interaction. As determined by immunohistochemistry, Met is mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of fat body cells of the larval when the JH titer is low and JH induces Met nuclear import. Hsp83 was accumulated in the cytoplasm area adjunct to the nucleus in the presence of JH and Met/Gce. Loss-of-function of Hsp83 attenuated JH binding and JH-induced nuclear import of Met, resulting in a decrease in the JHRR-driven reporter activity leading to reduction of Kr-h1 expression. These data show that Hsp83 facilitates the JH-induced nuclear import of Met that induces Kr-h1 expression through the JHRR."

This phenotype was rescued by either kinase-dead MLCK or five-DFRXXL motif, a MLCK fragment with potent F-actin-binding activity. Pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that the absence of MLCK led to attenuated formation of transmembrane complexes, including myosin II, integrins and fibronectin. We suggest that MLCK is not required for myosin phosphorylation in a migrating cell. A critical role of MLCK in cell migration involves regulating the cell membrane tension and protrusion necessary for migration, thereby stabilizing the membrane skeleton through F-actin-binding activity. This finding sheds light on a novel regulatory mechanism of protrusion during cell migration.

https://openalex.org/W2057308490,"Single α-helix (SAH) domains are rich in charged residues (Arg, Lys, and Glu) and stable in solution over a wide range of pH and salt concentrations. They are found in many different proteins where they bridge two functional domains. To test the idea that their high stability might enable these proteins to resist unfolding along their length, the properties and unfolding behavior of the predicted SAH domain from myosin-10 were characterized. The expressed and purified SAH domain was highly helical, melted non-cooperatively, and was monomeric as shown by circular dichroism and mass spectrometry as expected for a SAH domain. Single molecule force spectroscopy experiments showed that the SAH domain unfolded at very low forces (<30 pN) without a characteristic unfolding peak. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the SAH domain unfolds progressively as the length is increased and refolds progressively as the length is reduced. This enables the SAH domain to act as a constant force spring in the mechanically dynamic environment of the cell."

This process takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is accomplished by protein disulfide isomerase and ER oxidoreductin 1β, generating stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as byproduct. During insulin resistance in the prediabetic state, increased insulin biosynthesis can overwhelm the ER antioxidative and folding capacity, causing an imbalance in the ER redox homeostasis and oxidative stress. Peroxiredoxin 4 (Prdx4), an ER-specific antioxidative peroxidase can utilize luminal H2O2 as driving force for reoxidizing protein disulfide isomerase family members, thus efficiently contributing to disulfide bond formation. Here, we examined the functional significance of Prdx4 on β-cell function with emphasis on insulin content and secretion during stimulation with nutrient secretagogues. Overexpression of Prdx4 in glucose-responsive insulin-secreting INS-1E cells significantly metabolized luminal H2O2 and improved the glucose-induced insulin secretion, which was accompanied by the enhanced proinsulin mRNA transcription and insulin content. This β-cell beneficial effect was also observed upon stimulation with the nutrient insulin secretagogue combination of leucine plus glutamine, indicating that the effect is not restricted to glucose. However, knockdown of Prdx4 had no impact on H2O2 metabolism or β-cell function due to the fact that Prdx4 expression is negligibly low in pancreatic β-cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that the constitutively low expression of Prdx4 is highly susceptible to hyperoxidation in the presence of high glucose. Overall, these data suggest an important role of Prdx4 in maintaining insulin levels and improving the ER folding capacity also under conditions of a high insulin requirement.

https://openalex.org/W2093382165,"Conserved clusters of genes encoding DsrE and TusA homologs occur in many archaeal and bacterial sulfur oxidizers. TusA has a well documented function as a sulfurtransferase in tRNA modification and molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, and DsrE is an active site subunit of the DsrEFH complex that is essential for sulfur trafficking in the phototrophic sulfur-oxidizing Allochromatium vinosum. In the acidothermophilic sulfur (S(0))- and tetrathionate (S4O6(2-))-oxidizing Metallosphaera cuprina Ar-4, a dsrE3A-dsrE2B-tusA arrangement is situated immediately between genes encoding dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase and a heterodisulfide reductase-like complex. In this study, the biochemical features and sulfur transferring abilities of the DsrE2B, DsrE3A, and TusA proteins were investigated. DsrE3A and TusA proved to react with tetrathionate but not with NaSH, glutathione persulfide, polysulfide, thiosulfate, or sulfite. The products were identified as protein-Cys-S-thiosulfonates. DsrE3A was also able to cleave the thiosulfate group from TusA-Cys(18)-S-thiosulfonate. DsrE2B did not react with any of the sulfur compounds tested. DsrE3A and TusA interacted physically with each other and formed a heterocomplex. The cysteine residue (Cys(18)) of TusA is crucial for this interaction. The single cysteine mutants DsrE3A-C(93)S and DsrE3A-C(101)S retained the ability to transfer the thiosulfonate group to TusA. TusA-C(18)S neither reacted with tetrathionate nor was it loaded with thiosulfate with DsrE3A-Cys-S-thiosulfonate as the donor. The transfer of thiosulfate, mediated by a DsrE-like protein and TusA, is unprecedented not only in M. cuprina but also in other sulfur-oxidizing prokaryotes. The results of this study provide new knowledge on oxidative microbial sulfur metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2030989962,"Proteolysis of the Glu(441)-Ala(442) bond in the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) β domain of the versican-V1 variant by a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase domain with thrombospondin type 1 motif (ADAMTS) proteases is required for proper embryo morphogenesis. However, the processing mechanism and the possibility of additional ADAMTS-cleaved processing sites are unknown. We demonstrate here that if Glu(441) is mutated, ADAMTS5 cleaves inefficiently at a proximate upstream site but normally does not cleave elsewhere within the GAGβ domain. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) modification of versican is a prerequisite for cleavage at the Glu(441)-Ala(442) site, as demonstrated by reduced processing of CS-deficient or chondroitinase ABC-treated versican-V1. Site-directed mutagenesis identified the N-terminal CS attachment sites Ser(507) and Ser(525) as essential for processing of the Glu(441)-Ala(442) bond by ADAMTS5. A construct including only these two GAG chains, but not downstream GAG attachment sites, was cleaved efficiently. Therefore, CS chain attachment to Ser(507) and Ser(525) is necessary and sufficient for versican proteolysis by ADAMTS5. Mutagenesis of Glu(441) and an antibody to a peptide spanning Thr(432)-Gly(445) (i.e. containing the scissile bond) reduced versican-V1 processing. ADAMTS5 lacking the C-terminal ancillary domain did not cleave versican, and an ADAMTS5 ancillary domain construct bound versican-V1 via the CS chains. We conclude that docking of ADAMTS5 with two N-terminal GAG chains of versican-V1 via its ancillary domain is required for versican processing at Glu(441)-Ala(442). V1 proteolysis by ADAMTS1 demonstrated a similar requirement for the N-terminal GAG chains and Glu(441). Therefore, versican cleavage can be inhibited substantially by mutation of Glu(441), Ser(507), and Ser(525) or by an antibody to the region of the scissile bond."

Hepatic fibrosis can also develop from metabolic liver disease, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NASH). We investigated the role of MIF in high-fat or methionine- and choline-deficient diet mouse models of NASH. Mif–/– mice showed elevated liver triglyceride levels (WT, 53±14 mg/g liver; Mif–/–, 103±7 mg/g liver; P<0.05) and a 2-3-fold increased expression of lipogenic genes. Increased fatty degeneration in the livers of Mif–/– mice was associated with increased hepatic inflammatory cells (1.6-fold increase in F4/80+ macrophages) and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., 2.3-fold increase in Tnf-α and 2-fold increase in Il-6 expression). However, inflammatory cells and cytokines were decreased by 50-90% in white adipose tissue (WAT) of Mif–/– mice. Subset analysis showed that macrophage phenotypes in livers of Mif–/– mice were skewed toward M2 (e.g., 1.7-fold and 2.5-fold increase in Arg1 and Il-13, respectively, and 2.5-fold decrease in iNos), whereas macrophages were generally reduced in WAT of these mice (70% reduction in mRNA expression of F4/80+ macrophages). The protective MIF effect was scrutinized in isolated hepatocytes. MIF reversed inflammation-induced triglyceride accumulation in Hepa1-6 cells and primary hepatocytes and also attenuated oleic acid-elicited triglyceride increase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Protection from fatty hepatocyte degeneration was paralleled by a 2- to 3-fold reduction by MIF of hepatocyte proinflammatory cytokine production. Blockade of MIF receptor cluster of differentiation 74 (CD74) but not of CXCR2 or CXCR4 fully reverted the protective effect of MIF, comparable to AMPK inhibition. In summary, we demonstrate that MIF mediates hepatoprotection through the CD74/AMPK pathway in hepatocytes in metabolic models of liver injury.—Heinrichs, D., Berres, M.-L., Coeuru, M., Knauel, M., Nellen, A., Fischer, P., Philippeit, C., Bucala, R., Trautwein, C., Wasmuth, H.

Various GAG lyases have been identified from terrestrial but not marine organisms even though marine animals are rich in GAGs with unique structures and functions. Herein we isolated a novel GAG lyase for the first time from the marine bacterium Vibrio sp. FC509 and then recombinantly expressed and characterized it. It showed strong lyase activity toward hyaluronan (HA) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) and was designated as HA and CS lyase (HCLase). It exhibited the highest activities to both substrates at pH 8.0 and 0.5 m NaCl at 30 °C. Its activity toward HA was less sensitive to pH than its CS lyase activity. As with most other marine enzymes, HCLase is a halophilic enzyme and very stable at temperatures from 0 to 40 °C for up to 24 h, but its activity is independent of divalent metal ions.

The aim was to analyze by confocal and electron microscopy the effects of vibration on myofibril and filament integrity in soleus (Sol) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscle; differential proteomics of contractile, cytoskeletal, and costameric proteins (TN-C, ROCK1, and FAK); and expression of PGC1α and atrophy-related master genes MuRF1 and MuRF2. RVE (but not RE) preserved myofiber size and phenotype in Sol and VL by overexpressing MYBPC1 (42%, P ≤ 0.01), WDR1 (39%, P ≤ 0.01), sarcosin (84%, P ≤ 0.01), and CKM (20%, P ≤ 0.01) and prevented myofibrillar ultrastructural damage as detectable by MuRF1 expression. In Sol, cytoskeletal and contractile proteins were normalized by RVE, and TN-C increased (59%, P ≤ 0.01); the latter also with RE (108%, P ≤ 0.01). In VL, the outcomes of both RVE (acting on sarcosin and desmin) and RE (by way of troponinT-slow and MYL2) were similar.

Despite these findings, a clear mechanistic link between rotenone exposure and neuronal damage remains to be determined. Here, we report alterations to lipid metabolism in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells exposed to rotenone. The absolute levels of acetyl-CoA were found to be maintained despite a significant decrease in glucose-derived acetyl-CoA. Furthermore, palmitoyl-CoA levels were maintained, whereas the levels of many of the medium-chain acyl-CoA species were significantly reduced. Additionally, using isotopologue analysis, we found that β-oxidation of fatty acids with varying chain lengths helped maintain acetyl-CoA levels. Rotenone also induced increased glutamine utilization for lipogenesis, in part through reductive carboxylation, as has been found previously in other cell types. Finally, palmitoylcarnitine levels were increased in response to rotenone, indicating an increase in fatty acid import. Taken together, these findings show that alterations to lipid and glutamine metabolism play an important compensatory role in response to complex I inhibition by rotenone."
https://openalex.org/W2067913805,"Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a key regulator of sulfur amino acid metabolism diverting homocysteine, a toxic intermediate of the methionine cycle, via the transsulfuration pathway to the biosynthesis of cysteine. Although the pathway itself is well conserved among eukaryotes, properties of eukaryotic CBS enzymes vary greatly. Here we present a side-by-side biochemical and biophysical comparison of human (hCBS), fruit fly (dCBS) and yeast (yCBS) enzymes. Preparation and characterization of the full-length and truncated enzymes, lacking the regulatory domains, suggested that eukaryotic CBS exists in one of at least two significantly different conformations impacting the enzyme’s catalytic activity, oligomeric status and regulation. Truncation of hCBS and yCBS, but not dCBS, resulted in enzyme activation and formation of dimers compared to native tetramers. The dCBS and yCBS are not regulated by the allosteric activator of hCBS, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet); however, they have significantly higher specific activities in the canonical as well as alternative reactions compared to hCBS. Unlike yCBS, the heme-containing dCBS and hCBS showed increased thermal stability and retention of the enzyme’s catalytic activity. The mass-spectrometry analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry showed clear presence and binding of AdoMet to yCBS and hCBS, but not dCBS. However, the role of AdoMet binding to yCBS remains unclear, unlike its role in hCBS. This study provides valuable information for understanding the complexity of the domain organization, catalytic specificity and regulation among eukaryotic CBS enzymes."

In patients (cEDS, n=7; BJHS, n=8) and controls (Ctrl, n=8), we measured patellar tendon ultrastructure (transmission electron microscopy), dimensions (magnetic resonance imaging), and biomechanical properties (force and ultrasonographic measurements during a ramped isometric knee extension). Mutation analyses (COL5A1 and COL5A2) were performed in the patients. COL5A1 mutations were found in 3 of 4 of the patients with cEDS. Patellar tendon dimensions were similar between the groups, but large, irregular collagen fibrils were in 4 of 5 patients with cEDS. In the cEDS group, tendon stiffness and Young's modulus were reduced to ~50% of that in BJHS and Ctrl groups (P<0.05). The nonhypermobile, healthy controls were matched with the patients in age, sex, body weight, and physical activity, to compare outcomes. COL5A1 mutations led to structural tendon pathology and low tendon stiffness in cEDS, explaining the patients' hypermobility, whereas no tendon pathology was found that explained the hypermobility in BJHS.—Nielsen, R.

To facilitate and optimize MTB therapeutic selections, a mononuclear phagocyte (MP; monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell)-targeted drug delivery strategy was developed. Long-acting nanoformulations of RIF and an INH derivative, pentenyl-INH (INHP), were prepared, and their physicochemical properties were evaluated. This included the evaluation of MP particle uptake and retention, cell viability, and antimicrobial efficacy. Drug levels reached 6 μg/10(6) cells in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) for nanoparticle treatments compared with 0.1 μg/10(6) cells for native drugs. High RIF and INHP levels were retained in MDM for >15 d following nanoparticle loading. Rapid loss of native drugs was observed in cells and culture fluids within 24 h. Antimicrobial activities were determined against Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis). Coadministration of nanoformulated RIF and INHP provided a 6-fold increase in therapeutic efficacy compared with equivalent concentrations of native drugs. Notably, nanoformulated RIF and INHP were found to be localized in recycling and late MDM endosomal compartments. These were the same compartments that contained the pathogen. Our results demonstrate the potential of antimicrobial nanomedicines to simplify MTB drug regimens."

The complex crystallized as a dimer of complexes, with the conserved Nef PXXPXR motif engaging the Hck SH3 domain. A new intercomplex contact was found between SH3 Glu-93, and Nef Arg-105. Mutagenesis of Hck SH3 Glu-93 interfered with Nef·Hck complex formation and kinase activation in cells. The Hck SH2 domains impinge on the N-terminal region of Nef to stabilize a dimer conformation that exposes Asp-123, a residue critical for Nef function. Our results suggest that in addition to serving as a kinase effector for Nef, Hck binding may reorganize the Nef dimer for functional interaction with other signaling partners."
https://openalex.org/W2084509221,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor that may have adverse effects on human health. We recently isolated protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) as a BPA-binding protein from rat brain homogenates and found that BPA markedly inhibited PDI activity. To elucidate mechanisms of this inhibition, detailed structural, biophysical, and functional analyses of PDI were performed in the presence of BPA. BPA binding to PDI induced significant rearrangement of the N-terminal thioredoxin domain of PDI, resulting in more compact overall structure. This conformational change led to closure of the substrate-binding pocket in b' domain, preventing PDI from binding to unfolded proteins. The b' domain also plays an essential role in the interplay between PDI and ER oxidoreduclin 1α (Ero1α), a flavoenzyme responsible for reoxidation of PDI. We show that BPA inhibited Ero1α-catalyzed PDI oxidation presumably by inhibiting the interaction between the b' domain of PDI and Ero1α; the phenol groups of BPA probably compete with a highly conserved tryptophan residue, located in the protruding β-hairpin of Ero1α, for binding to PDI. Consistently, BPA slowed down the reoxidation of PDI and caused the reduction of PDI in HeLa cells, indicating that BPA has a great impact on the redox homeostasis of PDI within cells. However, BPA had no effect on the interaction between PDI and peroxiredoxin-4 (Prx4), another PDI family oxidase, suggesting that the interaction between Prx4 and PDI is different from that of Ero1α and PDI. These results indicate that BPA, a widely distributed and potentially harmful chemical, inhibits Ero1-PDI-mediated disulfide bond formation."
https://openalex.org/W2124444027,"Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast differentiation/function via inhibition of Rap1A isoprenylation. As Rap1 is the effector of exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) proteins, we determined the role of EPAC in osteoclast differentiation. We examined osteoclast differentiation as the number of primary murine/human bone-marrow precursors that differentiated into multinucleated TRAP-positive cells in the presence of EPAC-selective stimulus (8-pCTP-2‘-O-Me-cAMP, 100 μM; 8-pCTP-2‘-O-Me-cAMP-AM, 1 μM) or inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA), ESI-05, and ESI-09 (10 μM each). Rap1 activity was assessed, and signaling events, as well as differentiation in EPAC1/2-knockdown RAW264.7 cells, were studied. Direct EPAC1/2 stimulation significantly increased osteoclast differentiation, whereas EPAC1/2 inhibition diminished differentiation (113±6%, P<0.05, and 42±10%, P<0.001, of basal, respectively). Rap1 activation was maximal 15 min after RANKL stimulation (147±9% of basal, P< 0.001), whereas silencing of EPAC1/2 diminished activated Rap1 (43±13 and 20±15% of control, P<0.001) and NFκB nuclear translocation. TRAP-staining revealed no osteoclast differentiation in EPAC1/2-KO cells. Cathepsin K, NFATc1, and osteopontin mRNA expression decreased in EPAC1/2-KO cells when compared to control. RhoA, cdc42, Rac1, and FAK were activated in an EPAC1/2-dependent manner, and there was diminished cytoskeletal assembly in EPAC1/2-KO cells. In summary, EPAC1 and EPAC2 are critical signaling intermediates in osteoclast differentiation that permit RANKL-stimulated NFκB nuclear translocation and actin rearrangements.

In contrast to the protective role of other AlkB family members after suffering alkylation-induced DNA damage, ALKBH7 triggers the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and promotes cell death. Moreover, genetic ablation of mouse Alkbh7 dramatically increases body weight and fat mass. Here, we present crystal structures of human ALKBH7 in complex with Mn(II) and α-ketoglutarate at 1.35 Å or N-oxalylglycine at 2.0 Å resolution. ALKBH7 possesses the conserved double-stranded β-helix fold that coordinates a catalytically active iron by a conserved HX(D/E) … Xn … H motif. Self-hydroxylation of Leu-110 was observed, indicating that ALKBH7 has the potential to catalyze hydroxylation of its substrate. Unlike other AlkB family members whose substrates are DNA or RNA, ALKBH7 is devoid of the ""nucleotide recognition lid"" which is essential for binding nucleobases, and thus exhibits a solvent-exposed active site; two loops between β-strands β6 and β7 and between β9 and β10 create a special outer wall of the minor β-sheet of the double-stranded β-helix and form a negatively charged groove. These distinct features suggest that ALKBH7 may act on protein substrate rather than nucleic acids. Taken together, our findings provide a structural basis for understanding the distinct function of ALKBH7 in the AlkB family and offer a foundation for drug design in treating cell death-related diseases and metabolic diseases."

While AA is an activator of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), its metabolite prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a known inhibitor. In this study, we determined that GX sPLA2 is expressed in insulin-producing cells of mouse pancreatic islets and investigated its role in beta cell function. GSIS was measured in vivo in wild-type (WT) and GX sPLA2-deficient (GX KO) mice and ex vivo using pancreatic islets isolated from WT and GX KO mice. GSIS was also assessed in vitro using mouse MIN6 pancreatic beta cells with or without GX sPLA2 overexpression or exogenous addition. GSIS was significantly higher in islets isolated from GX KO mice compared with islets from WT mice. Conversely, GSIS was lower in MIN6 cells overexpressing GX sPLA2 (MIN6-GX) compared with control (MIN6-C) cells. PGE2 production was significantly higher in MIN6-GX cells compared with MIN6-C cells and this was associated with significantly reduced cellular cAMP. The effect of GX sPLA2 on GSIS was abolished when cells were treated with NS398 (a COX-2 inhibitor) or L-798,106 (a PGE2-EP3 receptor antagonist). Consistent with enhanced beta cell function, GX KO mice showed significantly increased plasma insulin levels following glucose challenge and were protected from age-related reductions in GSIS and glucose tolerance compared with WT mice. We conclude that GX sPLA2 plays a previously unrecognized role in negatively regulating pancreatic insulin secretion by augmenting COX-2-dependent PGE2 production."
https://openalex.org/W2023521117,"The core histone tail domains mediate inter-nucleosomal interactions that direct folding and condensation of nucleosome arrays into higher-order chromatin structures. The histone H4 tail domain facilitates inter-array interactions by contacting both the H2A/H2B acidic patch and DNA of neighboring nucleosomes. Likewise, H4 tail-H2A contacts stabilize array folding. However, whether the H4 tail domains stabilize array folding via inter-nucleosomal interactions with the DNA of neighboring nucleosomes remains unclear. We utilized defined oligonucleosome arrays containing a single specialized nucleosome with a photo-inducible cross-linker in the N terminus of the H4 tail to characterize these interactions. We observed that the H4 tail participates exclusively in intra-array interactions with DNA in unfolded arrays. These interactions are diminished during array folding, yet no inter-nucleosome, intra-array H4 tail-DNA contacts are observed in condensed chromatin. However, we document contacts between the N terminus of the H4 tail and H2A. Installation of acetylation mimics known to disrupt H4-H2A surface interactions did not increase observance of H4-DNA inter-nucleosomal interactions.

The de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a is implicated in this process, but the effects of its absence have not been fully characterized in a purified neuronal population. To better understand how DNA modifications contribute to neuronal function, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes of Dnmt3a-deficient mature olfactory sensory neurons (mOSNs), the primary sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium. Dnmt3a is required for both 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine patterning within accessible genomic regions, including hundreds of neurodevelopmental genes and neural enhancers. Loss of Dnmt3a results in the global disruption of gene expression via activation of silent genes and reduction of mOSN-expressed transcripts. Importantly, the DNA modification state and inducibility of odorant-activated genes are markedly impaired in Dnmt3a knockouts, suggesting a crucial role for this enzyme in establishing an epigenetic landscape compatible with neuronal plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2049845899,"Pitx2, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and microRNAs (miRs) play a critical role in the regulation of dental stem cells during embryonic development. In this report, we have identified a Pitx2:β-catenin regulatory pathway involved in epithelial cell differentiation and conversion of mesenchymal cells to amelogenin expressing epithelial cells via miR-200a. Pitx2 and β-catenin are expressed in the labial incisor cervical loop or epithelial stem cell niche, with decreased expression in the differentiating ameloblast cells of the mouse lower incisor. Bioinformatics analyses reveal that miR-200a-3p expression is activated in the pre-ameloblast cells to enhance epithelial cell differentiation. We demonstrate that Pitx2 activates miR-200a-3p expression and miR-200a-3p reciprocally represses Pitx2 and β-catenin expression. Pitx2 and β-catenin interact to synergistically activate gene expression during odontogenesis and miR-200a-3p attenuates their expression and directs differentiation. To understand how this mechanism controls cell differentiation and cell fate, oral epithelial and odontoblast mesenchymal cells were reprogrammed by a two-step induction method using Pitx2 and miR-200a-3p. Conversion to amelogenin expressing dental epithelial cells involved an up-regulation of the stem cell marker Sox2 and proliferation genes and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers. E-cadherin expression was increased as well as ameloblast specific factors. The combination of Pitx2, a regulator of dental stem cells and miR-200a converts mesenchymal cells to a fully differentiated dental epithelial cell type. This pathway and reprogramming can be used to reprogram mesenchymal or oral epithelial cells to dental epithelial (ameloblast) cells, which can be used in tissue repair and regeneration studies."
https://openalex.org/W2108383175,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS) commonly infects human skin and occasionally causes severe and life-threatening invasive diseases. The hyaluronan (HA) capsule of GAS has been proposed to protect GAS from host defense by mimicking endogenous HA, a large and abundant glycosaminoglycan in the skin. However, HA is degraded during tissue injury, and the functions of short-chain HA that is generated during infection have not been studied. To examine the impact of the molecular mass of HA on GAS infection, we established infection models in vitro and in vivo in which the size of HA was defined by enzymatic digestion or custom synthesis. We discovered that conversion of high molecular mass HA to low molecular mass HA facilitated GAS phagocytosis by macrophages and limited the severity of infection in mice. In contrast, native high molecular mass HA significantly impaired internalization by macrophages and increased GAS survival in murine blood. Thus, our data demonstrate that GAS virulence can be influenced by the size of HA derived from both the bacterium and host and suggest that high molecular mass HA facilitates GAS deep tissue infections, whereas the generation of short-chain HA can be protective."
https://openalex.org/W2001082554,"Catechol (benzenediol) is present in plant-derived products, such as vegetables, fruits, coffee, tea, wine, areca nut and cigarette smoke. Because platelet dysfunction is a risk factor of cardiovascular diseases, including stroke, atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-platelet and anti-inflammatory effect of catechol and its mechanisms. The effects of catechol on cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, arachidonic acid (AA)-induced aggregation, thromboxane B2 (TXB2) production, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/p38 phosphorylation were determined in rabbit platelets. In addition, its effect on IL-1β-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by fibroblasts was determined. The ex vivo effect of catechol on platelet aggregation was also measured. Catechol (5-25 µM) suppressed AA-induced platelet aggregation and inhibited TXB2 production at concentrations of 0.5–5 µM; however, it showed little cytotoxicity and did not alter U46619-induced platelet aggregation. Catechol (10–50 µM) suppressed COX-1 activity by 29–44% and COX-2 activity by 29–50%. It also inhibited IL-1β-induced PGE2 production, but not COX-2 expression of fibroblasts. Moreover, catechol (1–10 µM) attenuated AA-induced ROS production in platelets and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced ROS production in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Exposure of platelets to catechol decreased AA-induced ERK and p38 phosphorylation. Finally, intravenous administration of catechol (2.5–5 µmole/mouse) attenuated ex vivo AA-induced platelet aggregation. These results suggest that catechol exhibited anti-platelet and anti-inflammatory effects, which were mediated by inhibition of COX, ROS and TXA2 production as well as ERK/p38 phosphorylation. The anti-platelet effect of catechol was confirmed by ex vivo analysis. Exposure to catechol may affect platelet function and thus cardiovascular health."
https://openalex.org/W2042420933,"Much of our knowledge of protein binding pathways is derived from extremely stable complexes that interact very tightly, with lifetimes of hours to days. Much less is known about weaker interactions and transient complexes because these are challenging to characterize experimentally. Nevertheless, these types of interactions are ubiquitous in living systems. The combination of NMR relaxation dispersion Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) experiments and isothermal titration calorimetry allows the quantification of rapid binding kinetics for complexes with submillisecond lifetimes that are difficult to study using conventional techniques. We have used this approach to investigate the binding pathway of the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain from the Fyn tyrosine kinase, which forms complexes with peptide targets whose lifetimes are on the order of about a millisecond. Long range electrostatic interactions have been shown to play a critical role in the binding pathways of tightly binding complexes. The role of electrostatics in the binding pathways of transient complexes is less well understood. Similarly to previously studied tight complexes, we find that SH3 domain association rates are enhanced by long range electrostatics, whereas short range interactions are formed late in the docking process. However, the extent of electrostatic association rate enhancement is several orders of magnitudes less, whereas the electrostatic-free basal association rate is significantly greater. Thus, the SH3 domain is far less reliant on electrostatic enhancement to achieve rapid association kinetics than are previously studied systems. This suggests that there may be overall differences in the role played by electrostatics in the binding pathways of extremely stable versus transient complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2009710676,"The cell-protective features of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response are chronically activated in vigorously growing malignant tumor cells, which provide cellular growth advantages over the adverse microenvironment including chemotherapy. As an intervention with ER stress responses in the intestinal cancer cells, preventive exposure to flavone apigenin potentiated superinduction of a regulatory transcription factor, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which is also known to be an integral player coordinating ER stress response-related gene expression. ATF3 superinduction was due to increased turnover of ATF3 transcript via stabilization with HuR protein in the cancer cells under ER stress. Moreover, enhanced ATF3 caused inhibitory action against ER stress-induced cancer chemokines that are potent mediators determining the survival and metastatic potential of epithelial cancer cells. Although enhanced ATF3 was a negative regulator of the well known proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB, blocking of NF-κB signaling did not affect ER stress-induced chemokine expression. Instead, immediately expressed transcription factor early growth response protein 1 (EGR-1) was positively involved in cancer chemokine induction by ER stressors. ER stress-induced EGR-1 and subsequent chemokine production were repressed by ATF3. Mechanistically, ATF3 directly interacted with and recruited HDAC1 protein, which led to epigenetic suppression of EGR-1 expression and subsequent chemokine production. Conclusively, superinduced ATF3 attenuated ER stress-induced cancer chemokine expression by epigenetically interfering with induction of EGR-1, a transcriptional modulator crucial to cancer chemokine production. Thus, these results suggest a potent therapeutic intervention of ER stress response-related cancer-favoring events by ATF3."
https://openalex.org/W2025503069,"The infrageneric phylogeny and temporal divergence of Sorghum were explored in the present study. Sequence data of two low-copy nuclear (LCN) genes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 4 (Pepc4) and granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI), from 79 accessions of Sorghum plus Cleistachne sorghoides together with those from outgroups were used for maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) analyses. Bayesian dating based on three plastid DNA markers (ndhA intron, rpl32-trnL, and rps16 intron) was used to estimate the ages of major diversification events in Sorghum. The monophyly of Sorghum plus Cleistachne sorghoides (with the latter nested within Sorghum) was strongly supported by the Pepc4 data using BI analysis, and the monophyly of Sorghum was strongly supported by GBSSI data using both ML and BI analyses. Sorghum was divided into three clades in the Pepc4, GBSSI, and plastid phylograms: the subg. Sorghum lineage; the subg. Parasorghum and Stiposorghum lineage; and the subg. Chaetosorghum and Heterosorghum lineage. Two LCN homoeologous loci of Cleistachne sorghoides were first discovered in the same accession. Sorghum arundinaceum, S. bicolor, S. x drummondii, S. propinquum, and S. virgatum were closely related to S. x almum in the Pepc4, GBSSI, and plastid phylograms, suggesting that they may be potential genome donors to S. almum. Multiple LCN and plastid allelic variants have been identified in S. halepense of subg. Sorghum. The crown ages of Sorghum plus Cleistachne sorghoides and subg. Sorghum are estimated to be 12.7 million years ago (Mya) and 8.6 Mya, respectively. Molecular results support the recognition of three distinct subgenera in Sorghum: subg. Chaetosorghum with two sections, each with a single species, subg. Parasorghum with 17 species, and subg. Sorghum with nine species and we also provide a new nomenclatural combination, Sorghum sorghoides."
https://openalex.org/W2069346317,"The primary aim of this study was to characterize oculomotor performances in elderly depressed patients. The second aim was to investigate whether cognitive inhibition measured by the antisaccade task was associated with a psychomotor retardation or rather with a more specific cognitive-motor inhibition deficit. Twenty patients with a major depressive disorder and forty-seven healthy subjects performed two eye movement tasks. Saccadic reaction time and error rates were analyzed in the prosaccade task to obtain basic parameters of eye movements. Saccade latency, error rates and correction rates were evaluated in the antisaccade task to investigate inhibition capacities. Performances were impaired in patients, who exhibited a higher reaction time and error rates compared to controls. The higher time cost of inhibition suggested that the reaction time was not related to global psychomotor retardation alone. The higher time cost of inhibition could be explained by a specific alteration of inhibition processes evaluated by the antisaccade task. These changes were associated with the severity of depression. These findings provide a new perspective on cognitive inhibition in elderly depressed patients and could have important clinical implications for our understanding of critical behaviors involving deficits in inhibitory processes in the elderly."

Surprisingly, the ligand, which is considered to be a “partial” PKC activator (24.Saraiva L. Fresco P. Pinto E. Gonçalves J.

From this structure alone, it is unclear how the residue identities lead to dramatic changes in ligand binding affinities and PKC isoform activities. A critical component that is usually omitted from high-resolution structural studies of C1 domains is membranes or membrane mimics. We previously reported a micelle system that enabled us to obtain residue-specific information about DAG and PE binding to the C1B domain from PKCα (25.Stewart M.D. Morgan B. Massi F. Igumenova T.I.

One component of this micelle system is a detergent bearing the phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) head group. The role of PtdSer as a specific phospholipid activator of PKCs was discovered in the late 1980s (26.Bell R.M. Burns D.J. Lipid activation of protein kinase C.J. Biol.

This has been demonstrated, in the presence of DAG/PE, for full-length PKCδ (16.Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Medkova M. Ananthanarayanan B. Rafter J.D. Melowic H.R. Cho W.

Despite the significance of PtdSer in the activation of PKCs, the identities of residues involved in these interactions remain unknown. In this work, we applied high-resolution NMR methods to the wild-type C1Bδ (wtC1Bδ) and its diagnostic variant W252Y to obtain residue-specific information about their interactions with lipophilic effectors. The properties of C1Bδ, which differs from the conventional C1B domains in amino acid sequence (58% identity with C1Bα and C1Bβ), higher intrinsic affinity to DAG, and position in the primary structure of the parent enzyme, have enabled us to probe for the first time the ligand-independent interactions of C1 domains with membrane mimics. To mimic the membrane environment, we used a micelle system that contained a PtdSer component and faithfully reproduced the pattern of DAG affinities previously measured in lipid bilayers (35.Dries D.R. Gallegos L.L. Newton A.C. A single residue in the C1 domain sensitizes novel protein kinase C isoforms to cellular diacylglycerol production.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 826-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Our findings offer insight not only into the PKCδ-specific interactions with membrane-like hydrophobic environment and DAG, but also into the origin of differential DAG affinities in conventional and novel PKC isozymes. The DNA sequence of the C1Bδ domain from Rattus norvegicus was amplified by PCR using the cDNA clone of PKCδ (Open Biosystems) as a template. A 53-residue construct of C1Bδ (residues 229–281) was subsequently cloned into a pET-SUMO expression vector (Invitrogen). W252Y mutation was introduced into the plasmid using the QuikChange® site-directed mutatgenesis kit (Stratagene) and appropriate primers. Both C1Bδ variants were overexpressed and purified as described previously for C1Bα (25.Stewart M.D. Morgan B. Massi F. Igumenova T.I.

Isotope labeling with 13C and 15N was carried out in M9 minimal medium using [U-13C]glucose and [U-15N]ammonium chloride as sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. NMR experiments were carried out on a 14.1 Tesla VNMRS instrument (1H Larmor frequency of 600 MHz) equipped with a room temperature triple-resonance probe. The temperature was 25 °C, as calibrated with methanol. The NMR sample contained 1 mm U-15N,13C-enriched apo wtC1Bδ in the NMR buffer: 10 mm [2H-4]imidazole (Cambridge Isotopes) at pH 6.5, 150 mm KCl, 8% 2H2O, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine, and 0.02% NaN3. Resonance assignments for apo-wtC1Bδ were obtained from the following three-dimensional NMR experiments: CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB (36.Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E.

SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2008Google Scholar) software packages were used for data processing and assignment, respectively. HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH NMR experiments were also conducted on the sample containing 0.5 mm wtC1Bδ and 1 mm 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DOG) in 100 mm mixed micelles (3:7 molar ratio of 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine] (DPS) and [2H38]n-dodecylphosphocholine (DPC)), to verify the protein assignments in the DOG-complexed state. DOG and DPS were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, and DPC was obtained from Cambridge Isotopes. The spectra of the W252Y variant in the apo and DOG-bound states were assigned by comparison with the wtC1Bδ spectra and by following the cross-peak trajectories during the NMR-detected DOG titration. The spectra of the binary wtC1Bδ- and W252Y-micelle complexes were assigned from the NMR-detected micelle titration experiments. DOG or the short chain phorbol ester, phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in [2H6]dimethyl sulfoxide (Cambridge Isotopes) and added stepwise into 0.1 mm wtC1Bδ or W252Y preincubated with 10 mm mixed micelles (DPS/DPC, 3:7 molar ratio). 15N-1H HSQC spectra were collected on a 14.1 T Varian INOVA NMR spectrometer at each concentration of the ligand. Dimethyl sulfoxide concentration was <7% (v/v) at the highest ligand concentration. For W252Y, the binding curves were constructed by plotting the overall change in chemical shift Δ against the total DOG concentration, L0. Δ was calculated according to the following equation (40.Schumann F.H. Riepl H. Maurer T. Gronwald W. Neidig K.P. Kalbitzer H.R. Combined chemical shift changes and amino acid specific chemical shift mapping of protein–protein interactions.J. Biomol. NMR. 2007; 39: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).Δ=(ΔδH2+(0.152ΔδN)2)1/2(Eq. 1) The curves were fit with the single-site binding equation (41.Wilcox C.S.

The binding of DOG to wtC1Bδ was also detected by following the change in the fluorescence emission of Trp-252. The experiments were carried out on ISS Koala fluorometer (ISS, Champaign, IL), with excitation at 295 nm and detection with a 335 nm cut-on filter. The total protein concentration was 0.5 µm in the “NMR buffer,” where imidazole was replaced with 10 mm 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (Fisher Scientific). As observed previously for C1Bα (25.Stewart M.D. Morgan B. Massi F. Igumenova T.I. Probing the determinants of diacylglycerol binding affinity in the C1B domain of protein kinase Cα.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 408: 949-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the effective protein concentration in solution was 50% of the total due to adsorption on cuvette walls. After each subsequent addition of DOG, the fluorescence emission spectrum was recorded on a protein sample and a “blank” sample containing the same components with the exception of the protein. The fluorescence intensities were subtracted to correct for any change due to DOG/dimethyl sulfoxide addition that did not arise from protein binding. The fraction of DOG-complexed wtC1Bδ was calculated as ΔF/F0, where ΔF is the absolute value of the intensity change corrected for protein dilution during the titration, and F0 is the fluorescence intensity before titrating DOG. The experiments were performed in triplicate. All NMR measurements were conducted on an 18.8 Tesla Bruker Avance III instrument (1H Larmor frequency of 800 MHz) equipped with a cryogenically cooled triple-resonance probe. The samples contained 0.1 mm U-15N-enriched C1Bδ (wt or W252Y) in the NMR buffer with a KCl concentration of 20 mm. Micelle binding was detected using the fHSQC (fast heteronuclear single-quantum coherence) experiment (42.Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. Vanzijl P.C.M. Improved sensitivity of HSQC spectra of exchanging protons at short interscan delays using a new fast HSQC (FHSQC) detection scheme that avoids water saturation.J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1995; (10.1006/jmrb.1995.1109)Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The binding experiments were carried out with the following ligands: (i) pure DPC micelles, (ii) DPS titrated into the binary C1Bδ-DPC micelle complex, and (iii) mixed DPS/DPC micelles with a 3:7 molar ratio of the detergent components. The detergent concentration ranged from 3.0–100 mm in (i), 1.3–178 mm in (ii), and 5.0–200 mm in (iii). The total detergent concentration in experiments (i) and (iii) was converted to micelle concentration using an aggregation number of 56. The aggregation number was calculated from the translational diffusion coefficients that we measured in a set of pulsed-field gradient NMR experiments (43.Balayssac S. Delsuc M.A. Gilard V. Prigent Y. Malet-Martino M. Two-dimensional DOSY experiment with Excitation Sculpting water suppression for the analysis of natural and biological media.J. Magn. Reson. 2009; 196: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and is consistent with previous findings (44.Lauterwein J. Bösch C. Brown L.R. Wüthrich K. Physicochemical studies of the protein-lipid Interactions in melittin-containing micelles.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 556: 244-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The binding curves were constructed by plotting the residue-specific chemical shift changes Δ against the micelle concentration in (i) and (iii), and the total DPS concentration in (ii). The apparent dissociation constants of the binary protein-micelle complexes were obtained from the fit of the binding curves to Equation 2. The diamagnetic sample contained 100 mm total detergent (DPS/DPC, 2:8 molar ratio) in the NMR buffer with 20 mm KCl, 0.15 mm protein (wtC1Bδ or W252Y) and either no DOG or 1 mm DOG. For the paramagnetic sample preparation, 1.3 mol % of a paramagnetic lipid, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-14-doxyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (14-doxyl PC, Avanti Polar Lipids), was incorporated into the micelles while keeping all other components the same. The intensities of protein cross-peaks in the fHSQC NMR spectra were measured and used to calculate the residue-specific Ipara/Idia ratios. These ratios were then compared between wtC1Bδ and W252Y in both the absence and presence of DOG. The root mean square noise level of the base plane in each spectrum was taken as the uncertainty in peak intensities. It has been demonstrated that the identity of residue at position 22 (or 252 if using the numbering scheme of full-length PKCδ) has a profound influence on the affinity of C1 domains to DAG (35.Dries D.R. Gallegos L.L. Newton A.C. A single residue in the C1 domain sensitizes novel protein kinase C isoforms to cellular diacylglycerol production.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 826-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This residue is an invariant Tyr in C1B domains of conventional PKCs and is Trp in all other C1 domains of conventional and novel PKCs (45.Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M.

In the C1B domains of α and β isoforms, the mutation of Tyr to Trp increased the DAG affinity 31-fold in large unilamellar vesicles (35.Dries D.R. Gallegos L.L. Newton A.C.

The receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib are not perfect clinical therapeutic agents for NSCLC treatment due to primary or acquired tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. Herein, 3,6,2',4',5'-pentahydroxyflavone (36245-PHF) was identified as a multiple kinase inhibitor for NSCLC treatment based on the computational screening of a natural products database. 36245-PHF was shown to inhibit PI3K and Aurora A and B kinases and overcome gefitinib-resistant NSCLC growth. Our data clearly showed that 36245-PHF markedly inhibited anchorage-independent growth of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines and exerted a substantial chemotherapeutic effect following oral administration in a gefitinib-resistant NSCLC xenograft model. The evidence from three different subsequent methodological approaches, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo, all confirmed that 36245-PHF as a multiple protein kinase inhibitor. Overall, we identified 36245-PHF as a multiple protein kinase inhibitor and as a novel therapeutic agent to overcome gefitinib-resistant NSCLC growth, which could provide a new option for clinical NSCLC oral treatment."

The dissociation step showed an apparent affinity for ATP that was very weak (K½,ATP at 133 µm). Moreover, the linear fit of the initial ATP concentration dependence of the dissociation kinetics revealed an apparent second-order rate constant at 0.09 µm−1 s−1, which is inconsistent with fast ATP binding at 7.5 µm−1 s−1 and a Kd,ATP at 6.1 µm.

To better understand the complex intramolecular and intermolecular communication required for these highly ordered and distinctive transport and signaling pathways, it is necessary to define the biophysical properties that regulate this motor. Heterotrimeric kinesin-2 has been of interest since 1992 (24.Cole D.G. Cande W.Z. Baskin R.J. Skoufias D.A. Hogan C.J. Scholey J.M.

Progress in studying the biochemical pathway has been hindered by a lack of sufficient materials. Instead, experiments have focused on KIF3AB homologs in various model organisms and single molecule studies of these homologs to better understand the kinesin-2 family members. Single molecule studies using full-length M. musculus KIF3AB measured the mean velocity at 436 nm/s (25.Muthukrishnan G. Zhang Y. Shastry S. Hancock W.O. The processivity of kinesin-2 motors suggests diminished front-head gating.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 442-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Chimeric motors using the kinesin-1 kinesin heavy chain rod domain with chimeric M. musculus KIF3AA motor heads demonstrated that processivity scaled inversely with increased neck linker length (26.Shastry S. Hancock W.O. Neck linker length determines the degree of processivity in kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 motors.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 939-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, single molecule studies using the Caenorhabditis elegans KIF3AB homolog, KLP20/KLP11, found homodimeric KLP11 (KIF3B) to be unprocessive, yet heterodimeric KLP20/KLP11 was processive (27.Brunnbauer M. Mueller-Planitz F. Kösem S. Ho T.H. Dombi R. Gebhardt J.C. Rief M. Okten Z. Regulation of a heterodimeric kinesin-2 through an unprocessive motor domain that is turned processive by its partner.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 10460-10465Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results showed that heterodimerization was required for processivity and clearly documented the influence of KLP20 on KLP11. Single molecule studies of the Xenopus laevis KIF3AB homolog XkplA/B revealed that kinesin-2 generates force similar to conventional kinesin-1, yet kinesin-2 XkplA/B was more likely to detach from the microtubule at this stall force than kinesin-1 (28.Schroeder 3rd, H.W. Hendricks A.G. Ikeda K. Shuman H. Rodionov V. Ikebe M. Goldman Y.E. Holzbaur E.L. Force-dependent detachment of kinesin-2 biases track switching at cytoskeletal filament intersections.Biophys. J. 2012; 103: 48-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, studies using suspended microtubules to measure the torque of the M. musculus KIF3AB upon microtubules found no signs of torque generation, leading to the conclusion that the processive run is along a single protofilament (29.Brunnbauer M. Dombi R. Ho T.H. Schliwa M. Rief M. Ökten Z. Torque generation of kinesin motors is governed by the stability of the neck domain.Mol. Cell. 2012; 46: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although these studies have provided a better understanding of the single molecule characteristics, there remain questions about properties that are species-specific as compared with conserved attributes of the KIF3AB homologs. Additionally, there has not been a comprehensive analysis of the ATPase cycle reported that focuses on understanding the coupling of the ATP turnover to processive stepping. KIF3AB provides a unique and challenging model to define the mechanochemical properties of a kinesin-2 because the polypeptides and the motor heads of KIF3A and KIF3B are not identical, and each may have distinctive properties that contribute to transport roles of the heterodimeric motor. In this study, an M. musculus KIF3AB heterodimer was used that includes the respective native motor domains, neck region, and three native heptads of coiled-coil prior to a synthetic heterodimerization domain (SHD) 5The abbreviations used are: SHDsynthetic heterodimer domainMTmicrotubuleAHDacidic heterodimerization domainBHDbasic heterodimerization domainAMPPNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphateATPγSadenosine-5′-(γ-thio)-triphosphatemant2′-(or 3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)TEVtobacco etch virusNTAnitrilotriacetic acidKHCkinesin-1 heavy chain. that stabilizes the KIF3AB heterodimeric state. This strategy resulted in the ability to purify milligram quantities of well behaved KIF3AB motors from a bacterial expression system that made the presteady-state kinetic analysis possible. The experimental results show that ADP release upon MT collision is rate-limiting and that there is an apparent weak affinity for ATP at the MT·KIF3AB dissociation step that was also detected in the steady-state ATPase kinetics. These unique characteristics were not observed previously for the well characterized homodimeric kinesins, conventional kinesin-1 KHC, kinesin-5 (Eg5), or kinesin-7 (CENP-E). Therefore, these studies on KIF3AB provide key insights into the fundamental characteristics that evolved to give kinesin-2s their unique physiological roles in organelle trafficking and signal transduction. synthetic heterodimer domain microtubule acidic heterodimerization domain basic heterodimerization domain adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate adenosine-5′-(γ-thio)-triphosphate 2′-(or 3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) tobacco etch virus nitrilotriacetic acid kinesin-1 heavy chain. M. musculus KIF3A and KIF3B genes were the generous gift of William O. Hancock (Pennsylvania State University), and each gene was modified using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol as described previously (30.Klenchin V.A. Frye J.J. Jones M.H. Winey M. Rayment I.

The spurious mutations subsequently identified in the original materials were rectified to match the published sequences (31.Zhang Y. Hancock W.O.

Fig. 1 shows the engineered KIF3AB heterodimer used in this study, in which stable dimerization was achieved through inclusion of an SHD motif containing either an acidic or a basic helix (32.Lindhout D.A.

The KIF3A-AHD polypeptide consisted of the motor domain, neck linker, and three heptads of native helix sequence followed by the acidic synthetic fusion helix (AHD). The KIF3A-AHD construct was amplified and introduced into a modified pET31b plasmid (Novagen) that contains the C-terminal AHD fusion sequence, a TEV protease site, and a StrepII tag. The KIF3B-BHD polypeptide contained the motor domain, neck linker, and three heptads of native helix sequence followed by the basic fusion helix (BHD), a TEV protease site, and then finally a His8 tag. The KIF3B-BHD gene was amplified and introduced into a modified pET24d (Novagen) plasmid containing the C-terminal BHD fusion followed by a TEV protease site and His8 tag. The expressed sequences of KIF3A-AHD and KIF3B-BHD are as follows, where the amino acid residues in boldface type denote the SHD fusion sequence: KIF3A(Met1–Glu376)-LEKEIAALEKEIAALEKTTSENLYFQGASNWSHPQFEK (predicted molecular weight = 46,341); KIF3B(Met1–Lys371), LKEKIAALKEKIAALKETTSENLYFQGASHHHHHHHH (predicted molecular weight = 45,790). KIF3A-AHD and KIF3B-BHD plasmids (100 ng each) were co-transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene, Inc.) and applied to selective LB plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin, 50 µg/ml kanamycin, and 10 µg/ml chloramphenicol. Positive colonies were selected and grown in liquid LB with antibiotics at 37 °C until A600 was ∼0.5 and then cooled on ice to shift the temperature to 16 °C. Protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, shaking at 185 rpm at 16 °C for ∼15 h. The cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and subsequently resuspended (1 g/10 ml of buffer) and lysed in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP, and 30 mm imidazole containing 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle stirring. Following three cycles of freezing (liquid N2) and thawing (37 °C), the cell lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation, and the soluble cell extract was loaded onto a HisTrap FF Ni2+-NTA column (GE Healthcare) that was pre-equilibrated in Ni+2-NTA binding buffer: 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP, and 30 mm imidazole. The column was washed with Ni+2-NTA binding buffer, and KIF3AB was eluted in 2-ml fractions using the Ni+2-NTA binding buffer at 200 mm imidazole. Fractions containing KIF3AB were identified by SDS-PAGE and then loaded onto a pre-equilibrated StrepTactinTM column (StrepTrapII HP, GE Healthcare) at 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP. After washing the StrepTrap column to return the absorbance to baseline, KIF3AB was eluted as 2-ml fractions with the StrepTrap binding buffer plus 2.5 mm desthiobiotin. Fractions enriched in KIF3AB were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and dialyzed overnight in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with KOH, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 5% sucrose, 100 mm NaCl. The dialyzed protein was clarified by ultracentrifugation, and KIF3AB heterodimerization state was confirmed by analytical gel filtration (Fig. 2A) and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A, inset). Aliquots of KIF3AB were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. KIF3AB was clarified (90,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, Beckman Coulter TLA 100 rotor, Beckman Coulter Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge), and the protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using IgG as a protein standard. KIF3AB at 6, 12, and 25 µm (heterodimer concentration) or protein standards at 25 µm were loaded onto the HPLC gel filtration column (SuperoseTM 10/300, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) with elution at 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with KOH, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm DTT plus 100 mm NaCl using a Beckman Coulter System Gold HPLC. Protein elution was determined by intrinsic fluorescence detection (Jasco FP-2020, Victoria, British Columbia) as described previously (34.Cochran J.C. Krzysiak T.C. Gilbert S.P.

Oligomeric structure of bacteriophage T7 DNA primase/helicase proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10668-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equation 1 was used to determine the partition coefficients of standards relative to KIF3AB, where Ve is the elution volume, Vt is the total volume, and V0 is the void volume.Kav=(Ve−V0)/(Vt−V0)(Eq. 1) The Stokes radii of each of the five standards are as follows: avidin, 2.3 nm; ovalbumin, 3.0 nm; bovine serum albumin (BSA), 3.5 nm; IgG, 3.9 nm; and catalase, 5.2 nm. The linear fit of the data for the plot of (−log Kav)½ versus Stokes radius enabled the Stokes radius to be determined for KIF3AB (Fig. 2B). The relative molecular mass (Mr) was calculated for KIF3AB as described previously (35.Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. Oligomeric structure of bacteriophage T7 DNA primase/helicase proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10668-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows the semilog plot of Kav versus log Mr using the known standards: BSA (67,000 Da), IgG (120,000 Da), and catalase (250,000 Da). Microtubule gliding assays were used to characterize the motility of KIF3AB, as described previously (36.Sardar H.S. Luczak V.G. Lopez M.M. Lister B.C. Gilbert S.P. Mitotic kinesin CENP-E promotes microtubule plus-end elongation.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 1648-1653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The PME-80 motility buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, with KOH, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA) was supplemented with 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.25 mg/ml casein, 25 mm glucose, 0.2 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 175 µg/ml catalase, 0.3 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 2 mm phosphocreatine, 15 µm paclitaxel, and 1 mm ATP. The microtubule movement was measured with time lapse image capture total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 Inverted Laser TIRF3 microscope system with a Hamamatsu EM-CCD digital camera and a 561-nm laser for excitation. Time lapse sequences were taken for a 180-ms exposure time, with images taken every 20 s for 15 min and analyzed by tracking individual microtubules as they were propelled by the coverslip-attached motors as described previously (36.Sardar H.S. Luczak V.G. Lopez M.M. Lister B.C. Gilbert S.P. Mitotic kinesin CENP-E promotes microtubule plus-end elongation.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 1648-1653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The direction and distance of gliding were quantified as a function of time using Zeiss AxioVision version 4.8.2 software to determine the velocity of motility that was promoted by KIF3AB (Fig. 2D). The criteria for analysis were that MTs must be 3–8 µm in length with movement occurring completely in the field of focus and without pauses. Approximately 15–20 MTs were quantified per video. Before each experiment, KIF3AB was clarified (90,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, Beckman Coulter TLA 100 rotor, Beckman Coulter Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge), and the protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using IgG as a protein standard. For the experiments presented here, the purification tags were not removed, and the protein concentration is reported as the KIF3AB heterodimer (molecular weight = 92,131) with the ATP site concentration at two nucleotide sites per KIF3AB heterodimer. The experiments were performed at 25 °C in ATPase buffer: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with KOH, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm DTT, and 5% sucrose. The MT or tubulin polymer concentrations reported resulted from bovine tubulin that was cold-depolymerized, clarified, and polymerized with 1 mm MgGTP at 37 °C, followed by MT stabilization with 40 µm paclitaxel (37.Chen C.J.

The reported concentrations of nucleotides (ATP and GTP) and nucleotide analogs (mantATP, mantADP, AMPPNP, and ATPγS) also include an equivalent concentration of magnesium acetate. The fluorescent analogs mantATP and mantADP were purchased from Invitrogen as the racemate mixture. Errors are reported as S.E. The steady-state ATPase was measured by following the hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP to [α-32P]ADP·Pi as described previously (39.Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Kinetics: a tool to study molecular motors.Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The Michaelis-Menten equation was fit to the observed rates of ATP turnover as a function of MgATP concentration (Fig. 3A) with the rate quantified from the concentration of ATP binding sites of the KIF3AB heterodimer. The enzyme concentration at 0.5 µm was not 10-fold less than the K½MT, which required that quadratic Equation 2 be used to fit the MT concentration dependence (Fig. 3B).Rate=0.5×(kcat/E0)((E0+k1/2,MT+MT0)−(E0+K1/2,MT+MT0)2−2−(4E0MT0)1/2)(Eq. 2) Rate (s−1) is expressed as µm ADP·Pi produced/s/ATP binding site, and kcat is the maximum rate constant of steady-state ATP turnover. E0 is the concentration of KIF3AB ATP binding sites in the experiment, K½,MT is the concentration of tubulin polymer that provides one-half the maximum rate of steady-state ATP turnover, and MT0 is the tubulin polymer concentration. The ADP at the active sites of KIF3AB was exchanged with the fluorescent analog mantADP at a concentration of 5 µm KIF3AB nucleotide sites and 30 µm mantADP (1:6 ratio). Subsequently, the KIF3AB·mantADP complex was transferred to a KinTek SF2003 stopped-flow instrument (Kintek Corp., Austin, TX) and rapidly mixed with varying concentrations of MTs plus 2 mm MgATP (syringe concentration). The fluorescence change was monitored as a function of time (λex = 360 nm, λem = 450 nm; detected using a 409-nm long pass filter). A double exponential function was used to fit the biphasic transients, and the observed rates of the initial fast exponential phase were plotted as a function of increasing MT concentrations.kobs=k+1[MTs]+k−1(Eq. 3) At low MT concentrations (0.5–1.5 µm), the rate of mantADP release is limited by MT collision; therefore, in this MT concentration range, the linear fit of the data provides the second-order rate constant for MT association, k+1, with the KIF3AB off rate, k−1, as defined by the y intercept. At higher concentrations of MTs, mantADP release after MT collision becomes rate-limiting, and the hyperbolic fit of the data provides the maximum rate constant of mantADP release, k+2 (see Fig. 4, Scheme 1, and Table 1).SCHEME 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Kinesin-2 KIF3AB experimentally determined constantsMT KIF3AB·ADP associationk+1 = 5.7 ± 0.5 µm−1 s−1k−1 = 0.3 ± 0.4 s−1MantADP releasek+2 = 12.8 ± 0.2 s−1K½,MTs = 1.13 ± 0.08 µmMantATP binding: first phasek+3 = 7.5 ± 0.5 µm−1 s−1k−3 = 46.1 ± 5.5 s−1Kd,ATP = 6.1 µmMantATP binding: second phasekobs = 12–16 s−1ATP binding (pulse-chase)K3 = 0.16 ± 0.02"

Mitogenic stimulation triggers the binding of Tiam1 to the F-box protein βTrCP via its degron sequence and subsequent Tiam1 ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. The proteolysis of Tiam1 is prevented by βTrCP silencing, inhibition of CK1 and MEK, or mutation of the Tiam1 degron site. Expression of a stable Tiam1 mutant that is unable to interact with βTrCP results in sustained activation of the mTOR/S6K signaling and increased apoptotic cell death.

Hazardous alcohol use and probable alcohol dependence negatively affected panic disorder outcomes, and hazardous drug use led to worse social anxiety outcomes. Depression outcomes were not affected by substance use. Treatment adherence was negatively affected by problematic drug use among men and 25-34 year olds; combined substance use negatively affected adherence for women and 35-64 year olds.Problematic substance use does not preclude ICBT treatment but can worsen outcomes, particularly problematic alcohol use for panic disorder patients and hazardous drug use for social anxiety patients. ICBT clinicians should exercise particular caution when treating men and younger patients with problematic drug use, and women or older patients with combined substance use."
https://openalex.org/W2058941762,"Roles of the prostaglandin E2 E-prostanoid 4 receptor (EP4) on extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation induced by TGF-β1 in mouse glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) remain unknown. Previously, we have identified that TGF-β1 stimulates the expression of FN and Col I in mouse GMCs. Here we asked whether stimulation of EP4 receptors would exacerbate renal fibrosis associated with enhanced glomerular ECM accumulation. We generated EP4(Flox/Flox) and EP4(+/-) mice, cultured primary WT, EP4(Flox/Flox) and EP4(+/-) GMCs, AD-EP4 transfected WT GMCs (EP4 overexpression) and AD-Cre transfected EP4(Flox/Flox) GMCs (EP4 deleted). We found that TGF-β1-induced cAMP and PGE2 synthesis decreased in EP4 deleted GMCs and increased in EP4 overexpressed GMCs. Elevated EP4 expression in GMCs augmented the coupling of TGF-β1 to FN, Col I expression and COX2/PGE2 signaling, while TGF-β1 induced FN, Col I expression and COX2/PGE2 signaling were down-regulated in EP4 deficiency GMCs. 8 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx), WT and EP4(+/-) mice exhibited markedly increased accumulation of ECM compared with sham-operated controls. Albuminuria, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine (BUN and Cr) concentrations were significantly increased in WT mice as compared to those of EP4(+/-) mice. Urine osmotic pressure was dramatically decreased after 5/6 Nx surgery in WT mice as compared to EP4(+/-) mice. The pathological changes in kidney of EP4(+/-) mice was markedly alleviated compared with WT mice. Immunohistochemical analysis showed significant reductions of Col I and FN in the kidney of EP4(+/-) mice compared with WT mice. Collectively, this investigation established EP4 as a potent mediator of the pro-TGF-β1 activities elicited by COX2/PGE2 in mice GMCs. Our findings suggested that prostaglandin E2, acting via EP4 receptors contributed to accumulation of ECM in GMCs and promoted renal fibrosis."
