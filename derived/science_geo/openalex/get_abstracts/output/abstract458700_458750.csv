https://openalex.org/W2155542819,"In a significant fraction of breast cancer patients, distant metastases emerge after years or even decades of latency. How disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) are kept dormant, and what wakes them up, are fundamental problems in tumour biology. To address these questions, we used metastasis assays in mice and showed that dormant DTCs reside on microvasculature of lung, bone marrow and brain. We then engineered organotypic microvascular niches to determine whether endothelial cells directly influence breast cancer cell (BCC) growth. These models demonstrated that endothelial-derived thrombospondin-1 induces sustained BCC quiescence. This suppressive cue was lost in sprouting neovasculature; time-lapse analysis showed that sprouting vessels not only permit, but accelerate BCC outgrowth. We confirmed this surprising result in dormancy models and in zebrafish, and identified active TGF-β1 and periostin as tumour-promoting factors derived from endothelial tip cells. Our work reveals that stable microvasculature constitutes a dormant niche, whereas sprouting neovasculature sparks micrometastatic outgrowth. Bissell, Ghajar and colleagues use organotypic culture systems and in vivo mouse and zebrafish models to reveal the distinct effects of different microvascular niches on tumour cell dormancy. They report that although the stable microvasculature promotes cancer cell quiescence through the production of thrombospondin-1, cancer cells residing near neovascular tips are induced to grow through the action of TGF-β and periostin."
https://openalex.org/W2111099379,"The functional importance of gene enhancers in regulated gene expression is well established. In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, it has remained unclear whether these eRNAs are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation. Here we report that in human breast cancer cells 17β-oestradiol (E2)-bound oestrogen receptor α (ER-α) causes a global increase in eRNA transcription on enhancers adjacent to E2-upregulated coding genes. These induced eRNAs, as functional transcripts, seem to exert important roles for the observed ligand-dependent induction of target coding genes, increasing the strength of specific enhancer-promoter looping initiated by ER-α binding. Cohesin, present on many ER-α-regulated enhancers even before ligand treatment, apparently contributes to E2-dependent gene activation, at least in part by stabilizing E2/ER-α/eRNA-induced enhancer-promoter looping. Our data indicate that eRNAs are likely to have important functions in many regulated programs of gene transcription."

https://openalex.org/W1985105928,"It is unclear whether bidirectional non-coding RNAs transcribed from enhancer elements (eRNAs) have any functional role; here, the repressive functions of Rev-Erb nuclear receptors in macrophages are shown to be linked to their ability to inhibit the transcription of eRNAs. Bidirectional non-coding RNAs are transcribed from enhancer elements, but it is unclear whether these enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs) have a functional role or are merely a reflection of enhancer activity. Two manuscripts in this issue of Nature examine this question in the context of the positive and negative transcriptional functions of different nuclear receptors. Wenbo Li et al. provide evidence for the functional importance of eRNA transcription during the activation of genes by the oestrogen receptor in breast cancer cell lines; and Michael Lam et al. show that the repressive functions of Rev-Erb nuclear receptors in macrophages are linked to their ability to inhibit the transcription of eRNAs. Taken together these studies provide evidence for a role for eRNAs in contributing to enhancer functions. Rev-Erb-α and Rev-Erb-β are nuclear receptors that regulate the expression of genes involved in the control of circadian rhythm1,2, metabolism3,4 and inflammatory responses5. Rev-Erbs function as transcriptional repressors by recruiting nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR)–HDAC3 complexes to Rev-Erb response elements in enhancers and promoters of target genes6,7,8, but the molecular basis for cell-specific programs of repression is not known. Here we present evidence that in mouse macrophages Rev-Erbs regulate target gene expression by inhibiting the functions of distal enhancers that are selected by macrophage-lineage-determining factors, thereby establishing a macrophage-specific program of repression. Remarkably, the repressive functions of Rev-Erbs are associated with their ability to inhibit the transcription of enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs). Furthermore, targeted degradation of eRNAs at two enhancers subject to negative regulation by Rev-Erbs resulted in reduced expression of nearby messenger RNAs, suggesting a direct role of these eRNAs in enhancer function. By precisely defining eRNA start sites using a modified form of global run-on sequencing that quantifies nascent 5′ ends, we show that transfer of full enhancer activity to a target promoter requires both the sequences mediating transcription-factor binding and the specific sequences encoding the eRNA transcript. These studies provide evidence for a direct role of eRNAs in contributing to enhancer functions and suggest that Rev-Erbs act to suppress gene expression at a distance by repressing eRNA transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2026067651,"Inflammation is now acknowledged as an hallmark of cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) force a malignant cross talk with cancer cells, culminating in their epithelial–mesenchymal transition and achievement of stemness traits. Herein, we demonstrate that stromal tumor-associated cells cooperate to favor malignancy of prostate carcinoma (PCa). Indeed, prostate CAFs are active factors of monocyte recruitment toward tumor cells, mainly acting through stromal-derived growth factor-1 delivery and promote their trans-differentiation toward the M2 macrophage phenotype. The relationship between M2 macrophages and CAFs is reciprocal, as M2 macrophages are able to affect mesenchymal–mesenchymal transition of fibroblasts, leading to their enhanced reactivity. On the other side, PCa cells themselves participate in this cross talk through secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein-1, facilitating monocyte recruitment and again macrophage differentiation and M2 polarization. Finally, this complex interplay among cancer cells, CAFs and M2 macrophages, cooperates in increasing tumor cell motility, ultimately fostering cancer cells escaping from primary tumor and metastatic spread, as well as in activation of endothelial cells and their bone marrow-derived precursors to drive de novo angiogenesis. In keeping with our data obtained in vitro, the analysis of patients affected by prostate cancers at different clinical stages revealed a clear increase in the M2/M1 ratio in correlation with clinical values. These data, coupled with the role of CAFs in carcinoma malignancy to elicit expression of stem-like traits, should focus great interest for innovative strategies aimed at the co-targeting of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts to improve therapeutic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2056652832,"Through their functional diversification, distinct lineages of CD4(+) T cells can act to either drive or constrain immune-mediated pathology. Transcription factors are critical in the generation of cellular diversity, and negative regulators antagonistic to alternate fates often act in conjunction with positive regulators to stabilize lineage commitment. Genetic polymorphisms within a single locus encoding the transcription factor BACH2 are associated with numerous autoimmune and allergic diseases including asthma, Crohn's disease, coeliac disease, vitiligo, multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes. Although these associations point to a shared mechanism underlying susceptibility to diverse immune-mediated diseases, a function for BACH2 in the maintenance of immune homeostasis has not been established. Here, by studying mice in which the Bach2 gene is disrupted, we define BACH2 as a broad regulator of immune activation that stabilizes immunoregulatory capacity while repressing the differentiation programs of multiple effector lineages in CD4(+) T cells. BACH2 was required for efficient formation of regulatory (Treg) cells and consequently for suppression of lethal inflammation in a manner that was Treg-cell-dependent. Assessment of the genome-wide function of BACH2, however, revealed that it represses genes associated with effector cell differentiation. Consequently, its absence during Treg polarization resulted in inappropriate diversion to effector lineages. In addition, BACH2 constrained full effector differentiation within TH1, TH2 and TH17 cell lineages. These findings identify BACH2 as a key regulator of CD4(+) T-cell differentiation that prevents inflammatory disease by controlling the balance between tolerance and immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2146729875,"DNA damage activates a signalling network that blocks cell-cycle progression, recruits DNA repair factors and/or triggers senescence or programmed cell death. Alterations in chromatin structure are implicated in the initiation and propagation of the DNA damage response. Here we further investigate the role of chromatin structure in the DNA damage response by monitoring ionizing-radiation-induced signalling and response events with a high-content multiplex RNA-mediated interference screen of chromatin-modifying and -interacting genes. We discover that an isoform of Brd4, a bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family member, functions as an endogenous inhibitor of DNA damage response signalling by recruiting the condensin II chromatin remodelling complex to acetylated histones through bromodomain interactions. Loss of this isoform results in relaxed chromatin structure, rapid cell-cycle checkpoint recovery and enhanced survival after irradiation, whereas functional gain of this isoform compacted chromatin, attenuated DNA damage response signalling and enhanced radiation-induced lethality. These data implicate Brd4, previously known for its role in transcriptional control, as an insulator of chromatin that can modulate the signalling response to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W1584202600,"Understanding molecular mechanisms for regeneration of hair follicles provides new opportunities for developing treatments for hair loss and other skin disorders. Here we show that fibroblast growth factor 9 (Fgf9), initially secreted by γδ T cells, modulates hair follicle regeneration after wounding the skin of adult mice. Reducing Fgf9 expression decreases this wound-induced hair neogenesis (WIHN). Conversely, overexpression of Fgf9 results in a two- to threefold increase in the number of neogenic hair follicles. We found that Fgf9 from γδ T cells triggers Wnt expression and subsequent Wnt activation in wound fibroblasts. Through a unique feedback mechanism, activated fibroblasts then express Fgf9, thus amplifying Wnt activity throughout the wound dermis during a crucial phase of skin regeneration. Notably, humans lack a robust population of resident dermal γδ T cells, potentially explaining their inability to regenerate hair after wounding. These findings highlight the essential relationship between the immune system and tissue regeneration. The importance of Fgf9 in hair follicle regeneration suggests that it could be used therapeutically in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2087965324,"The authors use two-photon calcium imaging, EEG and electrophysiology to study ensemble neuronal activity in genetically altered mice that lack the Fmr1 protein: a model of Fragile X syndrome. Unanesthetized Fmr1−/− mice showed high synchrony of neocortical network activity and higher firing rates during sleep. Subtle alterations in how cortical network dynamics are modulated by different behavioral states could disrupt normal brain function and underlie symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders, including Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Using two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we recorded spontaneous neuronal ensemble activity in mouse somatosensory cortex. Unanesthetized Fmr1−/− mice exhibited abnormally high synchrony of neocortical network activity, especially during the first two postnatal weeks. Neuronal firing rates were threefold higher in Fmr1−/− mice than in wild-type mice during whole-cell recordings manifesting Up/Down states (slow-wave sleep, quiet wakefulness), probably as a result of a higher firing probability during Up states. Combined electroencephalography and calcium imaging experiments confirmed that neurons in mutant mice had abnormally high firing and synchrony during sleep. We conclude that cortical networks in FXS are hyperexcitable in a brain state–dependent manner during a critical period for experience-dependent plasticity. These state-dependent network defects could explain the intellectual, sleep and sensory integration dysfunctions associated with FXS."
https://openalex.org/W2159416713,"Cell-based therapies hold the potential to alleviate the growing burden of liver diseases. Such therapies require human hepatocytes, which, within the stromal context of the liver, are capable of many rounds of replication. However, this ability is lost ex vivo, and human hepatocyte sourcing has limited many fields of research for decades. Here we developed a high-throughput screening platform for primary human hepatocytes to identify small molecules in two different classes that can be used to generate renewable sources of functional human hepatocytes. The first class induced functional proliferation of primary human hepatocytes in vitro. The second class enhanced hepatocyte functions and promoted the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes toward a more mature phenotype than what was previously obtainable. The identification of these small molecules can help address a major challenge affecting many facets of liver research and may lead to the development of new therapeutics for liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1987864047,"Active sensation requires the convergence of external stimuli with representations of body movements. We used mouse behavior, electrophysiology and optogenetics to dissect the temporal interactions among whisker movement, neural activity and sensation of touch. We photostimulated layer 4 activity in single barrels in a closed loop with whisking. Mimicking touch-related neural activity caused illusory perception of an object at a particular location, but scrambling the timing of the spikes over one whisking cycle (tens of milliseconds) did not abolish the illusion, indicating that knowledge of instantaneous whisker position is unnecessary for discriminating object locations. The illusions were induced only during bouts of directed whisking, when mice expected touch, and in the relevant barrel. Reducing activity biased behavior, consistent with a spike count code for object detection at a particular location. Our results show that mice integrate coding of touch with movement over timescales of a whisking bout to produce perception of active touch."
https://openalex.org/W2151554216,"Sharon Savage and colleagues report the results of a genome-wide association study of osteosarcoma. They identify two susceptibility loci for this primary bone malignancy, including variants within the metabotropic glutamate receptor gene GRM4. Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy of adolescents and young adults. To better understand the genetic etiology of osteosarcoma, we performed a multistage genome-wide association study consisting of 941 individuals with osteosarcoma (cases) and 3,291 cancer-free adult controls of European ancestry. Two loci achieved genome-wide significance: a locus in the GRM4 gene at 6p21.3 (encoding glutamate receptor metabotropic 4; rs1906953; P = 8.1 × 10−9) and a locus in the gene desert at 2p25.2 (rs7591996 and rs10208273; P = 1.0 × 10−8 and 2.9 × 10−7, respectively). These two loci warrant further exploration to uncover the biological mechanisms underlying susceptibility to osteosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2017076914,"Cellular reprogramming is shown to occur in an ordered, stepwise manner, marked by changes in the cell-surface markers CD44, ICAM1 and Nanog–eGFP; molecular characterization of discrete subpopulations of partially reprogrammed cells shows that reprogramming is not simply the reversal of the normal development process. Reprogramming of differentiated cells into the pluripotent state requires considerable transcriptional and epigenetic reconfiguration. Keisuke Kaji and colleagues provide new insight into this process by identifying two cell-surface markers (CD44 and ICAM1) that define distinct subpopulations of cells that have reached different stages on the path to pluripotency. Further analysis of these discrete subpopulations enabled molecular characterization of reprogramming intermediates, showing that reprogramming is not simply the reversal of normal developmental processes. The generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells presents a challenge to normal developmental processes. The low efficiency and heterogeneity of most methods have hindered understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms promoting, and roadblocks preventing, efficient reprogramming. Although several intermediate populations have been described1,2,3,4,5,6,7, it has proved difficult to characterize the rare, asynchronous transition from these intermediate stages to iPS cells. The rapid expansion of minor reprogrammed cells in the heterogeneous population can also obscure investigation of relevant transition processes. Understanding the biological mechanisms essential for successful iPS cell generation requires both accurate capture of cells undergoing the reprogramming process and identification of the associated global gene expression changes. Here we demonstrate that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, reprogramming follows an orderly sequence of stage transitions, marked by changes in the cell-surface markers CD44 and ICAM1, and a Nanog–enhanced green fluorescent protein (Nanog–eGFP) reporter. RNA-sequencing analysis of these populations demonstrates two waves of pluripotency gene upregulation, and unexpectedly, transient upregulation of several epidermis-related genes, demonstrating that reprogramming is not simply the reversal of the normal developmental processes. This novel high-resolution analysis enables the construction of a detailed reprogramming route map, and the improved understanding of the reprogramming process will lead to new reprogramming strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2028243804,"Drug resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains a major problem warranting new treatment strategies. Wnt/catenin signaling is critical for the self-renewal of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Deregulated Wnt signaling is evident in chronic and acute myeloid leukemia; however, little is known about ALL. Differential interaction of catenin with either the Kat3 coactivator CREBBP (CREB-binding protein (CBP)) or the highly homologous EP300 (p300) is critical to determine divergent cellular responses and provides a rationale for the regulation of both proliferation and differentiation by the Wnt signaling pathway. Usage of the coactivator CBP by catenin leads to transcriptional activation of cassettes of genes that are involved in maintenance of progenitor cell self-renewal. However, the use of the coactivator p300 leads to activation of genes involved in the initiation of differentiation. ICG-001 is a novel small-molecule modulator of Wnt/catenin signaling, which specifically binds to the N-terminus of CBP and not p300, within amino acids 1–110, thereby disrupting the interaction between CBP and catenin. Here, we report that selective disruption of the CBP/β- and γ-catenin interactions using ICG-001 leads to differentiation of pre-B ALL cells and loss of self-renewal capacity. Survivin, an inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein, was also downregulated in primary ALL after treatment with ICG-001. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrate occupancy of the survivin promoter by CBP that is decreased by ICG-001 in primary ALL. CBP mutations have been recently identified in a significant percentage of ALL patients, however, almost all of the identified mutations reported occur C-terminal to the binding site for ICG-001. Importantly, ICG-001, regardless of CBP mutational status and chromosomal aberration, leads to eradication of drug-resistant primary leukemia in combination with conventional therapy in vitro and significantly prolongs the survival of NOD/SCID mice engrafted with primary ALL. Therefore, specifically inhibiting CBP/catenin transcription represents a novel approach to overcome relapse in ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2151419509,"Here we report an integrated analysis that leverages data from treatment of genetic mouse models of prostate cancer along with clinical data from patients to elucidate new mechanisms of castration resistance. We show that castration counteracts tumor progression in a Pten loss-driven mouse model of prostate cancer through the induction of apoptosis and proliferation block. Conversely, this response is bypassed with deletion of either Trp53 or Zbtb7a together with Pten, leading to the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Mechanistically, the integrated acquisition of data from mouse models and patients identifies the expression patterns of XAF1, XIAP and SRD5A1 as a predictive and actionable signature for CRPC. Notably, we show that combined inhibition of XIAP, SRD5A1 and AR pathways overcomes castration resistance. Thus, our co-clinical approach facilitates the stratification of patients and the development of tailored and innovative therapeutic treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2005496710,"Mammalian sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) has connected to an ever widening circle of activities that encompass cellular stress resistance, energy metabolism and tumorigenesis. However, underlying mechanisms leading to oncogenic SIRT1 overexpression are less understood. In this study, we identified SIRT1 regulatory microRNA (miRNA) and its function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Aberrant SIRT1 overexpression was demonstrated in a subset of human HCCs. SIRT1 knockdown suppressed HCC cell growth by transcriptional deregulation of cell cycle proteins. This led to hypophosphorylation of pRb, which inactivated E2F/DP1 target gene transcription, and thereby caused significant increase of HCC cells to remain in the G1/S phase. A comprehensive miRNA profiling analysis indentified five putative endogenous miRNAs that are significantly downregulated in HCC. Ectopic expression of miRNA mimics evidenced miR-29c to suppress SIRT1 in HCC cells. Notably, ectopic miR-29c expression repressed cancer cell growth and proliferation, and it recapitulated SIRT1 knockdown effects in HCC cells. In addition, miR-29c expression was downregulated in a large cohort of HCC patients, and low expression of miR-29c was significantly associated with poor prognosis of HCC patients. Taken together, we demonstrated that miR-29c suppresses oncogenic SIRT1 by way of binding to 3′-untranslated region of SIRT1 mRNA causing translational inhibition in liver cancer cells. The loss or suppression of miR-29c may cause aberrant SIRT1 overexpression and promotes liver tumorigenesis. Overall, we suggest that miR-29c functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating abnormal SIRT1 activity in liver."
https://openalex.org/W2112965309,"As a member of the Tet (Ten-eleven translocation) family proteins that can convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxylmethylcytosine (5hmC), Tet1 has been implicated in regulating global DNA demethylation and gene expression. Tet1 is highly expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells and appears primarily to repress developmental genes for maintaining pluripotency. To understand how Tet1 may regulate gene expression, we conducted large scale immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry of endogenous Tet1 in mouse ES cells. We found that Tet1 could interact with multiple chromatin regulators, including Sin3A and NuRD complexes. In addition, we showed that Tet1 could also interact with the O-GlcNAc transferase (Ogt) and be O-GlcNAcylated. Depletion of Ogt led to reduced Tet1 and 5hmC levels on Tet1-target genes, whereas ectopic expression of wild-type but not enzymatically inactive Ogt increased Tet1 levels. Mutation of the putative O-GlcNAcylation site on Tet1 led to decreased O-GlcNAcylation and level of the Tet1 protein.

DNA methylation is generally associated with gene silencing. The ability of Tet1 to hydrolyze 5mC suggests a role of Tet1 in transcriptional activation; however, several studies in mouse ES cells indicate a more complex picture. For example, recent proteomic and genetic studies suggest that chromatin remodeling and histone modification complexes, such as Sin3A and NuRD, may be linked to Tet1 for controlling local 5hmC levels and target gene expression (13.Wu H.

Immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectrometry analysis using 293T cells expressing epitope-tagged Tet1 found it to associate with the chromatin repression Sin3A complex (14.Williams K.

Mouse ES cells knocked down for either Tet1 or Sin3A exhibited similar gene expression profiles, suggesting that Tet1 functions at least in part through the Sin3A repression complex (14.Williams K.

TET1 and hydroxymethylcytosine in transcription and DNA methylation fidelity.Nature. 2011; 473: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), and the polycomb repression complex 2 (PRC2) appeared to be recruited to its genomic targets in a Tet1-dependent manner in mouse ES cells (13.Wu H.

Indeed, genome-wide ChIP-sequencing results combined with gene expression analyses using cDNA microarray and RNA-sequencing revealed an enrichment of mostly derepressed genes, suggesting that Tet1 functions primarily to repress its direct targets (4.Xu Y.

To understand further how Tet1 may recruit chromatin components to its genomic targets for transcriptional silencing, we determined the Tet1-associated protein complex by carrying out large scale IP and mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous Tet1 in mouse ES cells. We found that Tet1 could interact with multiple chromatin repression factors, supporting the notion that Tet1 functions mainly to repress target genes for pluripotency maintenance in mouse ES cells. Despite the wealth of information on Tet1 and other Tet family members, very little is known about how Tet1 is posttranslationally modified. Recent findings indicate that Tet1 could interact with Ogt and this interaction could stabilize Tet1 binding to target promoters (17.Vella P. Scelfo A. Jammula S. Chiacchiera F. Williams K. Cuomo A. Roberto A. Christensen J. Bonaldi T. Helin K. Pasini D. Mol. Cell. 2013; 49: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of O-GlcNAcylation in regulating Tet1 remains unclear. Through our proteomic study, we also identified O-GlcNAc transferase (Ogt) in the Tet1 complex. We show here that Ogt is important for Tet1-mediated gene repression, where RNAi depletion of Ogt led to decreased Tet1 localization and 5hmC enrichment on Tet1-target genes. Our study provides further evidence that Tet1 is O-GlcNAcylated, and that Tet1 level is regulated by Ogt and O-GlcNAcylation. These findings indicate that Tet1 is a substrate of Ogt, and Ogt-mediated glycosylation of Tet1 in turn regulates its repression function on developmentally important genes. The Ogt-Tet1 link should further our understanding of how posttranslational modifications are integrated into the regulatory networks of ES cell maintenance. AB2.2 mouse ES cells (passage 18, kindly provided by Darwin Core facility, Baylor college of Medicine, Houston, TX) were maintained on a 0.1% gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated tissue culture dish in high glucose DMEM (Hyclone), supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm GlutaMax-I supplement, 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm MEM nonessential amino acid, and 1000 units/ml ESGRO (Millipore) under feeder-free conditions. HEK293T cells were cultured in high glucose (25 mm) containing MEMα (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% FBS. cDNAs encoding murine Tet1 and Ogt were PCR-amplified from AB2.2 cells. Tet1 cDNA was cloned into a pBabe-based retroviral expression vector to be tagged with SFB (S-tag, FLAG tag, and strepavidin-binding peptide). Ogt was cloned into an MSCV-EF1a-based retroviral expression vector for tagging with both HA and FLAG. A site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate the Tet1 T535A and T535V and Ogt H568A mutations following the manufacturer's instruction. The following siRNA oligonucleotides were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen): Ctrl KD, 5′-UUCCUCUCCACGCGCAGUACAUUUA; Tet1 KD1, 5′-CAGACUUUAACAACAAACCAGUAAA; Tet1 KD2, 5′-CCGCCCGAAUGAAUCGGGAUCGAAA; Ogt KD1, 5′-GCCCUCUGUUCAACACCAAACAAUA; Ogt KD2, 5′-GCGGAUGAAGAAAUUGGUUAGUAUU. Large scale affinity purification, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (18.Liang J. Wan M. Zhang Y. Gu P. Xin H. Jung S.Y. Qin J. Wong J. Cooney A.J. Liu D. Songyang Z. Nanog and Oct4 associate with unique transcriptional repression complexes in embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: anti-Tet1 (09-872, Millipore), anti-Ogt (O6264, Sigma), anti-GlcNAc (MMS-248R, Covance), anti-5-hydroxymethylcytosine (39769, Active Motif), anti-Nanog (A300-397A, Bethyl Laboratories), anti-Oct4 (sc-8628, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Sox2 (ab15830, Abcam), anti-Ezh2 (39639, Active Motif), anti-Sin3A (ab3479, Abcam), anti-FLAG (F7425, Sigma), anti-GAPDH and anti-β-tubulin (sc-25778 and sc-9104, respectively, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cycloheximide, d-(+)-glucose, PUGNAc, and alloxan were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and GlcNAc was purchased from Vector laboratories. Real-time PCR was carried out using an ABI StepOnePlus Real-time PCR System and SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) essentially as previously described (18.Liang J. Wan M. Zhang Y. Gu P. Xin H. Jung S.Y. Qin J. Wong J. Cooney A.J. Liu D. Songyang Z. Nanog and Oct4 associate with unique transcriptional repression complexes in embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using the iScript Select cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). The primers used for SYBR Green real-time PCR were designed using the Prime Time qPCR Primer Design Software (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, IA) (supplemental Table S1) and tested with the intron-spanning assay. ChIP assays were performed using the fast ChIP protocol (19.Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K. Protocol for the fast chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) method.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The sonicated chromatin was incubated with antibodies or control IgG in an ultrasonic water bath for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated chromatin fragments were subjected to real-time PCR, and the enrichment of target gene promoter regions was compared with IgG control (see supplemental Table S2 for ChIP primers). Whole cell lysate (∼50 mg) was first precleared with 30 ml of 50% (v/v) of unconjugated agarose beads (Vector Laboratories) in a total volume of 100 ml of NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) for 2 h at 4 °C. A total of 30 ml of sWGA-conjugated agarose beads (50% (v/v)) (Vector Laboratories) was added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and eluted in 30 ml of 2× SDS loading buffer. To minimize indirect association of protein complexes, extract was incubated with sWGA-conjugated agarose beads in the presence of 0.2% SDS. To better understand how Tet1 carries out its function in regulating gene expression in ES cells, we performed large scale IP followed by mass spectrometry analysis using mouse ES cells and an antibody against endogenous Tet1 (18.Liang J. Wan M. Zhang Y. Gu P. Xin H. Jung S.Y. Qin J. Wong J. Cooney A.J. Liu D. Songyang Z. Nanog and Oct4 associate with unique transcriptional repression complexes in embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, endogenous Tet1 could co-purify with proteins that belong to major chromatin remodeling and repression complexes, including Sin3A, Hdac1/2, Mta3, and Chd4. These results indicate that multiple chromatin repression factors can interact with Tet1 and potentially participate in Tet1-mediated repression function. Interestingly, Ogt was also one of the top Tet1-interacting candidates (Fig. 1A). Unlike worms (20.Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A.

Ogt is essential for mouse early development (24.Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D.

To further confirm the interaction between Ogt and Tet1, we carried out co-IP experiments. As shown in Fig. 1B, Tet1 IP could indeed bring down Ogt, in addition to its known interactor Sin3A. Likewise, reciprocal IP with Ogt also pulled down Tet1 and Sin3A. The identification of Ogt in the Tet1 complex suggests cross-talk between Tet1 and Ogt-mediated pathways in maintaining ES cells. We next examined whether Tet1 could be O-linked GlcNAcylated. Here, we took advantage of the ability of sWGA to specifically bind proteins with the O-GlcNAc moiety. O-GlcNAcylated proteins can bind directly to sWGA, whereas indirectly associated proteins can be washed away in the presence of detergents such as SDS. As expected, we could bring down Ogt using sWGA-conjugated beads because Ogt is itself O-GlcNAcylated (Fig. 1C). Importantly, sWGA also pulled down endogenous Tet1 protein. Furthermore, the sWGA-bound Tet1 proteins could be specifically eluted with free GlcNAc. Alternatively, O-GlcNAcylated proteins can also be detected using anti-O-GlcNAc antibodies (30.Jang H. Kim T.W. Yoon S. Choi S.Y. Kang T.W. Kim S.Y. Kwon Y.W. Cho E.J. Youn H.D. O-GlcNAc regulates pluripotency and reprogramming by directly acting on core components of the pluripotency network.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11: 62-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). When we blotted the precipitates with an anti-O-GlcNAc antibody, Ogt could be readily detected (Fig. 1D), and the same antibody was also able to detect Tet1 proteins that came down with sWGA. These observations indicate that endogenous Tet1 is physically associated with Ogt in ES cells and is modified by Ogt to become O-linked-GlcNAcylated. Ogt knockout in mice resulted in embryonic lethality before implantation (24.Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. The O-GlcNAc transferase gene resides on the X chromosome and is essential for embryonic stem cell viability and mouse ontogeny.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), a clear indication of the essential role of Ogt in early development. To explore the functional significance of Tet1-Ogt interaction, we used siRNA oligonucleotides to deplete Tet1 and Ogt in mouse ES cells. We confirmed the efficacy of Ogt and Tet1 knockdown by RT-qPCR and Western blotting (Fig. 2, A and B). Both siRNA oligonucleotides against Ogt were able to achieve >70% knockdown efficiency of Ogt mRNA and protein expression. Either Tet1 or Ogt knockdown led to reduced alkaline phosphatase staining and increased percentages of differentiated cells (Fig. 2c). When we examined several developmentally important genes, we found that most of the lineage-specific markers we tested, such as ectodermal markers Sox1 and Mash1, endodermal markers Gata6 and Sox17, mesodermal markers Branchyury and Mixl1, and trophectodermal markers Cdx2 and Eomes, appeared to be derepressed in cells depleted for either Tet1 or Ogt (Fig. 2D). It is interesting to note that the phenotypes exhibited by Ogt knockdown cells appeared more severe, compared with Tet1 knockdown cells. It is likely that Ogt inhibition may have a broader impact on ES cells because Ogt can modify substrates from diverse pathways. In addition, our proteomic data (Fig. 1A) and results from others indicate that Tet1 functions through communicating with multiple repression-associated chromatin factors (13.Wu H. D'Alessio A.C.

Indeed, Tet1 knockdown led to reduced genomic targeting of both Ezh2 and Sin3A (Fig. 2, E and F). Similar reduction was also observed in Ogt-depleted cells. These findings underline the importance of both Tet1 and Ogt in repressing developmental genes in ES cells and suggest intersections between the pathways mediated by Tet1 and Ogt. Recent studies indicate that Tet1 is enriched on CpG islands of promoters of genes important for pluripotency and development in ES, and may be responsible for generating 5hmC at these loci (4.Xu Y.

https://openalex.org/W1998605742,"Src tyrosine kinase (Src) is implicated in the development of bone metastasis and castration resistance of prostate cancer. Src inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical trials for such diseases. Understanding the molecular and cellular actions of Src inhibitors holds the key to future improvement of this line of therapy. Here we describe the microRNA expression profiles modulated by two Src inhibitors and demonstrate that the miR-30 family members are the most prominently induced species. Consistent with its tumor suppressor role, miR-30 is downmodulated by oncogenic signals such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor, and is generally underexpressed in prostate cancer specimens. A number of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated genes are predicted targets of miR-30. Among these genes the Ets-related gene (ERG) is the most frequently overexpressed oncogene in prostate cancer activated by genomic fusion events between promoter upstream sequences of the TMPRSS2 and coding sequences of ERG. We showed by ERG 3′ untranslated region reporter and mutagenesis assays that ERG is a direct target of miR-30. Overexpression of miR-30 in prostate cancer cells suppresses EMT phenotypes and inhibits cell migration and invasion. It also inhibits the in vitro and in vivo growth of VCaP cells, which depends on TMPRSS2-ERG for proliferation. TMPRSS2-ERG is generally regulated by androgen at the transcriptional level. Our finding reveals a new post-transcriptional mechanism of TMPRSS2-ERG regulation by Src and growth signals via miR-30 providing a rationale for targeting ERG-positive castration-resistant tumors with Src inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2071187736,"The polycomb protein BMI1 has been linked to maintenance of adult stem cells. Klein and colleagues find that BMI1 is also required for the maintenance of stem cells in the continuously growing mouse incisor, through repression of the Ink4a/Arf locus to modulate the proliferation of stem cells and repression of Hox genes to prevent inappropriate lineage decisions in stem cell progeny. The polycomb group gene Bmi1 is required for maintenance of adult stem cells in many organs1,2. Inactivation of Bmi1 leads to impaired stem cell self-renewal due to deregulated gene expression. One critical target of BMI1 is Ink4a/Arf, which encodes the cell-cycle inhibitors p16Ink4a and p19Arf (ref. 3). However, deletion of Ink4a/Arf only partially rescues Bmi1-null phenotypes4, indicating that other important targets of BMI1 exist. Here, using the continuously growing mouse incisor as a model system, we report that Bmi1 is expressed by incisor stem cells and that deletion of Bmi1 resulted in fewer stem cells, perturbed gene expression and defective enamel production. Transcriptional profiling revealed that Hox expression is normally repressed by BMI1 in the adult, and functional assays demonstrated that BMI1-mediated repression of Hox genes preserves the undifferentiated state of stem cells. As Hox gene upregulation has also been reported in other systems when Bmi1 is inactivated1,2,5,6,7, our findings point to a general mechanism whereby BMI1-mediated repression of Hox genes is required for the maintenance of adult stem cells and for prevention of inappropriate differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2104628579,"The transcription factor Zbtb7a was previously described as an oncogene in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Now, Pier Paolo Pandolfi and colleagues report that loss of Zbtb7a accelerates the progression of invasive prostate tumorigenesis in Pten-null mice and shows evidence of monoallelic loss in 18% of individuals with advanced prostate cancer. Zbtb7a has previously been described as a powerful proto-oncogene. Here we unexpectedly demonstrate that Zbtb7a has a critical oncosuppressive role in the prostate. Prostate-specific inactivation of Zbtb7a leads to a marked acceleration of Pten loss–driven prostate tumorigenesis through bypass of Pten loss–induced cellular senescence (PICS). We show that ZBTB7A physically interacts with SOX9 and functionally antagonizes its transcriptional activity on key target genes such as MIA, which is involved in tumor cell invasion, and H19, a long noncoding RNA precursor for an RB-targeting microRNA. Inactivation of Zbtb7a in vivo leads to Rb downregulation, PICS bypass and invasive prostate cancer. Notably, we found that ZBTB7A is genetically lost, as well as downregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels, in a subset of human advanced prostate cancers. Thus, we identify ZBTB7A as a context-dependent cancer gene that can act as an oncogene in some contexts but also has oncosuppressive-like activity in PTEN-null tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2017957177,"The location, size, and number of synapses critically influence the specificity and strength of neural connections. In axons, synaptic vesicle (SV) and active zone (AZ) proteins are transported by molecular motors and accumulate at discrete presynaptic loci. Little is known about the mechanisms coordinating presynaptic protein transport and deposition to achieve proper distribution of synaptic material. Here we show that SV and AZ proteins exhibit extensive cotransport and undergo frequent pauses. At the axonal and synaptic pause sites, the balance between the capture and dissociation of mobile transport packets determines the extent of presynaptic assembly. The small G protein ARL-8 inhibits assembly by promoting dissociation, while a JNK kinase pathway and AZ assembly proteins inhibit dissociation. Furthermore, ARL-8 directly binds to the UNC-104/KIF1A motor to limit the capture efficiency. Together, molecular regulation of the dichotomy between axonal trafficking and local assembly controls vital aspects of synapse formation and maintenance."

Here we demonstrate that adeno-associated viruses (AAV) encoding two such broadly neutralizing antibodies are protective against diverse influenza strains. Serum from mice that received a single intramuscular AAV injection efficiently neutralized all H1, H2 and H5 influenza strains tested. After infection with diverse strains of H1N1 influenza, treated mice showed minimal weight loss and lung inflammation. Protection lasted for at least 11 months after AAV injection. Notably, even immunodeficient and older mice were protected by this method, suggesting that expression of a monoclonal antibody alone is sufficient to protect mice from illness. If translated to humans, this prophylactic approach may be uniquely capable of protecting immunocompromised or elderly patient populations not reliably protected by existing vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2140616584,"In the socially monogamous prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster), mating induces enduring pair-bonds that are initiated by partner preference formation and regulated by a variety of neurotransmitters, including oxytocin, vasopressin and dopamine. We examined potential epigenetic mechanisms mediating pair-bond regulation and found that the histone deacetylase inhibitors sodium butyrate and trichostatin A (TSA) facilitated partner preference formation in female prairie voles in the absence of mating. This was associated with a specific upregulation of oxytocin receptor (OTR, oxtr) and vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR, avpr1a) in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), through an increase in histone acetylation at their respective promoters. Furthermore, TSA-facilitated partner preference was prevented by OTR or V1aR blockade in the NAcc. Notably, mating-induced partner preference triggered the same epigenetic regulation of oxtr and avpr1a gene promoters as TSA. These observations indicate that TSA and mating facilitate partner preference through epigenetic events, providing, to the best of our knowledge, the first direct evidence for epigenetic regulation of pair-bonding."
https://openalex.org/W2045945310,"Hypoxia is a salient feature of most solid tumors, and hypoxic adaptation of cancer cells has crucial implications in propagation of malignant clonal cell population. Osteopontin (OPN) has been identified as a hypoxia-responsive gene, but the mechanistic and regulatory role of OPN under hypoxia is less characterized. The present study identifies the existence of a positive inter-regulatory loop between hypoxia and OPN. We have shown that hypoxia induces OPN expression in breast cancer cells; however, the expression was found to be HIF1α independent. OPN enabled transcriptional upregulation of HIF1α expression both under normoxia and hypoxia, whereas stability of HIF1α protein in breast cancer cells remained unaffected. Moreover, we have shown that OPN induces integrin-linked kinase (ILK)/Akt-mediated nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65 activation leading to HIF1α-dependent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and angiogenesis in response to hypoxia. These in vitro data are biologically important as OPN expressing cells induce greater tumor growth and angiogenesis through enhanced expressions of proangiogenic molecules as compared with control. Immunohistochemical analysis of human breast cancer specimens revealed significant correlation between OPN and HIF1α but not HIF2α. Elevated expression of HIF1α and OPN was observed in pre-neoplastic and early stage infiltrating ductal carcinoma implicating the role of these proteins in neoplastic progression of breast cancer. Together, our results substantiate the prime role of OPN in cellular adaptation through ILK and NF-κB-mediated HIF1α-dependent VEGF expression in response to hypoxia that ultimately controls breast cancer progression and angiogenesis. Our study reinforces the fact that targeting OPN and its regulated signaling network hold important therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2016932826,"Our aim was to determine the effect of exposure to maternal obesity or to maternal weight loss around conception on the programming of hepatic insulin signaling in the offspring. We used an embryo transfer model in sheep to investigate the effects of exposure to either maternal obesity or to weight loss in normal and obese mothers preceding and for 1 wk after conception on the expression of hepatic insulin-signaling and gluconeogenic factors and key miRNAs involved in insulin signaling in the offspring. We found that exposure to maternal obesity resulted in increased hepatic miR-29b (P<0.05), miR-103 (P<0.01), and miR-107 (P<0.05) expression, a decrease in IR (P<0.05), phopsho-Akt (P<0.01), and phospho-FoxO1 (P<0.01) abundance, and a paradoxical decrease in 11βHSD1 (P<0.05), PEPCK-C (P<0.01), and PEPCK-M (P<0.05) expression in lambs. These changes were ablated by a period of moderate dietary restriction imposed during the periconceptional period. Maternal dietary restriction alone also resulted in decreased abundance of a separate subset of hepatic insulin-signaling molecules, namely, IRS1 (P<0.05), PDK1 (P<0.01), phospho-PDK1 (P<0.05), and aPKCζ (P<0.05) and in decreased PEPCK-C (P<0.01) and G6Pase (P<0.01) expression in the lamb. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of the epigenome to maternal nutrition around conception and the need for dietary interventions that maximize metabolic benefits and minimize metabolic costs for the next generation."
https://openalex.org/W2042549207,"Ribosomal proteins have emerged as novel regulators of the Mdm2-p53 feedback loop, especially in the context of ribosomal stress. RPS26 is a recently identified Diamond-Blackfan Anemia-related ribosomal protein and its role in p53 activation has not been previously explored. In this study we found knockdown of RPS26 induced p53 stabilization and activation via a RPL11-dependent mechanism, resulting in p53-dependent cell growth inhibition. Moreover, RPS26 has the ability to interact with Mdm2 and inhibits Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination that leads to p53 stabilization upon overexpression. Importantly, we discovered that RPS26 knockdown impaired p53’s ability to transcriptionally activate its target genes in response to DNA damage, without affecting its stability. Accordingly, the cells lost the ability to induce G2/M cell cycle arrest. We further found that upon RPS26 knockdown, the DNA damage induced recruitment of p53 to the promoters of its target genes and p53 acetylation were both greatly reduced. In addition, RPS26 can interact with p53 independent of Mdm2 and coexist in a complex with p53 and p300. These data establish a role of RPS26 in DNA damage response by directly influencing p53 transcriptional activity, and suggest that RPS26 acts distinctively in different scenarios of p53 activation. Our finding also implicates p53 transcriptional activity control as an important mechanism of p53 regulation by ribosomal proteins."

Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) protein is a BZ site ligand expressed endogenously in the brain, but functional evidence for BZ-mimicking positive modulatory actions has been elusive. We demonstrate an endogenous potentiation of GABAergic synaptic transmission and responses to GABA uncaging in the thalamic reticular nucleus (nRT) that is absent in both nm1054 mice, in which the Dbi gene is deleted, and mice in which BZ binding to α3 subunit-containing GABAARs is disrupted. Viral transduction of DBI into nRT is sufficient to rescue the endogenous potentiation of GABAergic transmission in nm1054 mice. Both mutations enhance thalamocortical spike-and-wave discharges characteristic of absence epilepsy. Together, these results indicate that DBI mediates endogenous nucleus-specific BZ-mimicking (""endozepine"") roles to modulate nRT function and suppress thalamocortical oscillations. Enhanced DBI signaling might serve as a therapy for epilepsy and other neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2005335881,"Stress-inducible phosphoprotein 1 (STI1) is part of the chaperone machinery, but it also functions as an extracellular ligand for the prion protein. However, the physiological relevance of these STI1 activities in vivo is unknown. Here, we show that in the absence of embryonic STI1, several Hsp90 client proteins are decreased by 50%, although Hsp90 levels are unaffected. Mutant STI1 mice showed increased caspase-3 activation and 50% impairment in cellular proliferation. Moreover, placental disruption and lack of cellular viability were linked to embryonic death by E10.5 in STI1-mutant mice. Rescue of embryonic lethality in these mutants, by transgenic expression of the STI1 gene, supported a unique role for STI1 during embryonic development. The response of STI1 haploinsufficient mice to cellular stress seemed compromised, and mutant mice showed increased vulnerability to ischemic insult. At the cellular level, ischemia increased the secretion of STI1 from wild-type astrocytes by 3-fold, whereas STI1 haploinsufficient mice secreted half as much STI1. Interesting, extracellular STI1 prevented ischemia-mediated neuronal death in a prion protein-dependent way.

https://openalex.org/W2075394493,"Aldosterone triggers the stiff endothelial cell syndrome (SECS), characterized by an up-regulation of epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) and mechanical stiffening of the endothelial cell cortex accompanied by endothelial dysfunction. In vivo, aldosterone antagonism exerts sustained protection on the cardiovascular system. To illuminate the molecular mechanisms of this time-dependent effect, a study on endothelial cells in vitro and ex vivo was designed to investigate SECS over time. Endothelia (from human umbilical veins, bovine aortae, and explants of human arteries) were cultured in aldosterone-supplemented medium with or without the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist spironolactone. MR expression, ENaC expression, cortical stiffness, and shear-mediated nitric oxide (NO) release were determined after 3 d (short term) and up to 24 d (long term). Over time, MR expression increased by 129%. ENaC expression and surface abundance increased by 32% and 42% (13.8 to 19.6 molecules per cell surface), paralleled by a 49% rise in stiffness. Spironolactone prevented this development and, after 3 wk of treatment, increased NO release by 50%. Thus, spironolactone improves endothelial function long-lastingly by preventing a time-dependent manifestation of SECS. This emphasizes the key role of vascular endothelium as a therapeutical target in cardiovascular disorders and might explain blood pressure independent actions of MR antagonism.—Drüppel, V., Kusche-Vihrog, K., Grossmann, C., Gekle, M., Kasprzak, B., Brand, E., Pavenstädt, H., Oberleithner, H., Kliche, K., Long-term application of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone prevents stiff endothelial cell syndrome.

https://openalex.org/W2065138170,"Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) represents one of the most prominent proteins associated with tumorigenesis and is a modulator of the tumor microenvironment during angiogenesis. Recently, syndecan-1 (SDC1), a transmembrane heparan sulfate-bearing proteoglycan, was also speculated to have a critical role in contributing to angiogenesis when associated with MMP-9. However, the mechanism behind their synergistic regulation is not fully understood. In the current study, we report for the first time that ionizing radiation (IR)-induced MMP-9 enhances SDC1 shedding, corroborating to tube-inducing ability of medulloblastoma (MB) cells. Furthermore, we observed that the tumor angiogenesis is associated with higher MMP-9–SDC1 interactions on both the cell surface and extracellular medium. Our results also revealed the existence of a novel regulatory mechanism where MMP-9 drives the suppression of miR-494, resulting in enhanced SDC1 shedding and angiogenesis. From the in situ hybridization analysis, we found that MMP-9-specific shRNA (shMMP-9) treatment of mouse intracranial tumors resulted in elevated expression of miR-494. This negative correlation between MMP-9 and miR-494 levels was observed to be dependent on the methylation status of a miR-494 promoter-associated CpG island region (−186 to −20), which was confirmed by bisulfite-sequencing and methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis. Further, validation of MMP-9 and SDC1 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) targets with luciferase reporter assay provided a more favorable result for miR-494-mediated regulation of SDC1 but not of MMP-9, suggesting that the 3′-UTR of SDC1 mRNA is a direct target of miR-494. Overall, our results indicate that angiogenesis induced by radiotherapy is associated with an MMP-9–miR-494–SDC1 regulatory loop and that MMP-9–SDC1 activity creates a negative feedback loop by regulating the expression of miR-494."
https://openalex.org/W2004293544,"Glioblastomas (GBMs), the most common and malignant brain tumors, are highly resistant to current therapies. The failure of targeted therapies against aberrantly activated oncogenic signaling, such as that of the EGFR-PI3K/Akt pathway, underscores the urgent need to understand alternative downstream pathways and to identify new molecular targets for the development of more effective treatments for gliomas. Here, we report that EGFRvIII (ΔEGFR/de2-7EGFR), a constitutively active EGFR mutant that is frequently co-overexpressed with EGFR in clinical GBM tumors, promotes glioma growth and invasion through protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of Dock180, a bipartite guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1. We demonstrate that EGFRvIII induces serine phosphorylation of Dock180, stimulates Rac1 activation and glioma cell migration. Treatments of glioma cells using the PKA inhibitors H-89 and KT5720, overexpression of a PKA inhibitor (PKI), and in vitro PKA kinase assays show that EGFRvIII induction of serine phosphorylation of Dock180 is PKA-dependent. Significantly, PKA induces phosphorylation of Dock180 at amino acid residue S1250 that resides within its Rac1-activating DHR-2 domain. Expression of the Dock180S1250L mutant, but not wild type Dock180WT, protein in EGFRvIII-expressing glioma cells inhibited receptor-stimulated cell proliferation, survival, migration in vitro and glioma tumor growth and invasion in vivo. Together, our findings describe a novel mechanism by which EGFRvIII drives glioma tumorigenesis and invasion through PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Dock180, thereby suggesting that targeting EGFRvIII-PKA-Dock180-Rac1 signaling axis could provide a novel pathway to develop potential therapeutic strategies for malignant gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2156315357,"We have previously shown that deletion of CuZnSOD in mice (Sod1(-/-) mice) leads to accelerated loss of muscle mass and contractile force during aging. To dissect the relative roles of skeletal muscle and motor neurons in this process, we used a Cre-Lox targeted approach to establish a skeletal muscle-specific Sod1-knockout (mKO) mouse to determine whether muscle-specific CuZnSOD deletion is sufficient to cause muscle atrophy. Surprisingly, mKO mice maintain muscle masses at or above those of wild-type control mice up to 18 mo of age. In contrast, maximum isometric specific force measured in gastrocnemius muscle is significantly reduced in the mKO mice. We found no detectable increases in global measures of oxidative stress or ROS production, no reduction in mitochondrial ATP production, and no induction of adaptive stress responses in muscle from mKO mice. However, Akt-mTOR signaling is elevated and the number of muscle fibers with centrally located nuclei is increased in skeletal muscle from mKO mice, which suggests elevated regenerative pathways. Our data demonstrate that lack of CuZnSOD restricted to skeletal muscle does not lead to muscle atrophy but does cause muscle weakness in adult mice and suggest loss of CuZnSOD may potentiate muscle regenerative pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2007755341,"Most known small-molecule inhibitors of voltage-gated ion channels have poor subtype specificity because they interact with a highly conserved binding site in the central cavity. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, electrophysiological recordings and molecular modeling, we have identified a new drug-binding site in Kv1.x channels. We report that Psora-4 can discriminate between related Kv channel subtypes because, in addition to binding the central pore cavity, it binds a second, less conserved site located in side pockets formed by the backsides of S5 and S6, the S4-S5 linker, part of the voltage sensor and the pore helix. Simultaneous drug occupation of both binding sites results in an extremely stable nonconducting state that confers high affinity, cooperativity, use-dependence and selectivity to Psora-4 inhibition of Kv1.x channels. This new mechanism of inhibition represents a molecular basis for the development of a new class of allosteric and selective voltage-gated channel inhibitors."

Whereas the process of somatic cell formation has been studied in detail, the mechanics of PGC formation are poorly understood. Here, using four-dimensional multi-photon imaging combined with genetic and pharmacological manipulations, we find that PGC formation requires an anaphase spindle-independent cleavage pathway. In addition to using core regulators of cleavage, including the small GTPase RhoA (Drosophila rho1) and the Rho-associated kinase, ROCK (Drosophila drok), we show that this pathway requires Germ cell-less (GCL), a conserved BTB-domain protein not previously implicated in cleavage mechanics. This alternative form of cell formation suggests that organisms have evolved multiple molecular strategies for regulating the cytoskeleton during cleavage."

However, little is known about how IL-32 is induced in response to viral infection and the mechanisms of IL-32-mediated antiviral activities. We discovered that IL-32 is elevated by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection both in vitro and in vivo and that HBV induced IL-32 expression at the level of both transcription and post-transcription. Furthermore, microRNA-29b was found to be a key factor in HBV-regulated IL-32 expression by directly targeting the mRNA 3'-untranslated region of IL-32. Antiviral analysis showed that IL-32 was not sufficient to alter HBV replication in HepG2.2.15 cells. To mimic the viremic phase of viral infection, freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with IL-32γ, the secretory isoform, and the supernatants were used for antiviral assays. Surprisingly, these supernatants exhibited extensive antiviral activity against multiplex viruses besides HBV. Thus, we speculated that the IL-32γ-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells produced and secreted an unknown antiviral factor. Using antibody neutralization assays, we identified the factor as interferon (IFN)-λ1 and not IFN-α. Further studies indicated that IL-32γ effectively inhibited HBV replication in a hydrodynamic injection mouse model. Clinical data showed that elevated levels of IFN-λ1 both in serum and liver tissue of HBV patients were positively correlated to the increased levels of IL-32. Our results demonstrate that elevated IL-32 levels during viral infection mediate antiviral effects by stimulating the expression of IFN-λ1."
https://openalex.org/W2056508558,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and young adults, is characterized by a partially differentiated myogenic phenotype. We have previously shown that the blocking of tumor growth and resumption of differentiation can be achieved by re-expression of miR-206, a muscle-enriched microRNA missing in RMS. In this work, we focused on BAF53a, one of the genes downregulated in miR-206-expressing RMS cells, which codes for a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Here we show that the BAF53a transcript is significantly higher in primary RMS tumors than in normal muscle, and is a direct target of miR-206. Sustained expression of BAF53a interferes with differentiation in myogenic cells, whereas its silencing in RMS cells increases expression of myogenic markers and inhibits proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Accordingly, BAF53a silencing also impairs embryonal RMS and alveolar RMS tumor growth, inducing their morphological and biochemical differentiation. These results indicate that failure to downregulate the BAF53a subunit may contribute to the pathogenesis of RMS, and suggest that BAF53a may represent a novel therapeutic target for this tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2060579679,"The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is absolutely dependent on the acquisition of host pantothenate for its development within human erythrocytes. Although the biochemical properties of this transport have been characterized, the molecular identity of the parasite-encoded pantothenate transporter remains unknown. Here we report the identification and functional characterization of the first protozoan pantothenate transporter, PfPAT, from P. falciparum. We show using cell biological, biochemical, and genetic analyses that this transporter is localized to the parasite plasma membrane and plays an essential role in parasite intraerythrocytic development. We have targeted PfPAT to the yeast plasma membrane and showed that the transporter complements the growth defect of the yeast fen2Δ pantothenate transporter-deficient mutant and mediates the entry of the fungicide drug, fenpropimorph. Our studies in P. falciparum revealed that fenpropimorph inhibits the intraerythrocytic development of both chloroquine- and pyrimethamine-resistant P. falciparum strains with potency equal or better than that of currently available pantothenate analogs. The essential function of PfPAT and its ability to deliver both pantothenate and fenpropimorph makes it an attractive target for the development and delivery of new classes of antimalarial drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1995193532,"Signalling by the toll-like receptor (TLR) family of pathogen recognition receptors has emerged as a key molecular component in the pathogenesis of an increasing number of inflammatory-related cancers, among which gastric cancer rates as the second most lethal cancer world-wide. The myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) adapter molecule has a critical role in mediating innate immune signalling by members of the TLR and interleukin (IL)-1 families, and has been associated with either pro- or antitumourigenic responses in various cancer models. However, little is known about the in vivo role of MyD88 adapter-like (Mal)/TIR-domain containing adapter protein (TIRAP), which is restricted to facilitating TLR4 and TLR2 signalling. To interrogate the role of these innate immune signalling components in gastric tumourigenesis, here we have employed the spontaneous gastric cancer gp130(F/F) mouse model, in which TLR2 promotes the growth of gastric tumours. Genetic ablation of Myd88 in gp130(F/F) mice suppressed tumourigenesis and was associated with increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation in the gastric tumour epithelium, comparable to that observed previously upon deletion of Tlr2 in gp130(F/F) mice. By contrast, the tumour burden in gp130(F/F):Mal(-/-) mice was equivalent to their gp130(F/F) littermates. At the molecular level, suppressed tumourigenesis in gp130(F/F):Myd88(-/-) mice correlated with reduced expression and activation of TLR2-regulated protumourigenic genes and signalling pathways, respectively. Consistent with the previously defined non-essential role for TLR2 in gastric tumour inflammation, the extent of inflammatory cell infiltrates in gastric tumours from gp130(F/F):Mal(-/-) and gp130(F/F):Myd88(-/-) mice remained unaltered compared with gp130(F/F) mice. Collectively, our data reveal a differential, but inflammation-independent, requirement for Mal and MyD88 during TLR2-promoted gastric tumourigenesis."

Here we show that transgenic mice overexpressing STK25, when challenged with a high-fat diet, develop reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared to wild-type siblings, as evidenced by impairment in glucose and insulin tolerance tests as well as in euglycemic-hyperin-sulinemic clamp studies. The fasting plasma insulin concentration was elevated in Stk25 transgenic mice compared to wild-type littermates (4.9±0.8 vs. 2.6±0.4 ng/ml after 17 wk on high-fat diet, P<0.05). Overexpression of STK25 decreased energy expenditure during the dark phase of observation (P<0.05), despite increased spontaneous activity. The oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle of transgenic carriers was reduced, as evidenced by altered expression of Cpt1, Acox1, and ACC. Hepatic triglycerides and glycogen were elevated (1.6- and 1.4-fold, respectively; P<0.05) and expression of key enzymes regulating lipogenesis (Fasn), glycogen synthesis (Gck), and gluconeogenesis (G6pc, Fbp1) was increased in the liver of the transgenic mice.

https://openalex.org/W2118607691,"Interspecies prion transmission often leads to stable changes in physical and biological features of prion strains, a phenomenon referred to as a strain mutation. It remains unknown whether changes in the replication environment in the absence of changes in PrP primary structure can be a source of strain mutations. To approach this question, RNA content was altered in the course of amplification of hamster strains in serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCAb). On adaptation to an RNA-depleted environment and then readaptation to an environment containing RNA, strain 263K gave rise to a novel PrPSc conformation referred to as 263KR+, which is characterized by very low conformational stability, high sensitivity to proteolytic digestion, and a replication rate of 106-fold/PMCAb round, which exceeded that of 263K by almost 104-fold. A series of PMCAb experiments revealed that 263KR+ was lacking in brain-derived 263K material, but emerged de novo as a result of changes in RNA content. A similar transformation was also observed for strain Hyper, suggesting that this phenomenon was not limited to 263K.

https://openalex.org/W2148299947,"Tissue perivascular resident macrophages (PVM/Ms), a hybrid cell type with characteristics of both macrophages and melanocytes, are critical for establishing and maintaining the endocochlear potential (EP) required for hearing. The PVM/Ms modulate expression of tight- and adherens-junction proteins in the endothelial barrier of the stria vascularis (intrastrial fluid-blood barrier) through secretion of a signaling molecule, pigment epithelium growth factor (PEDF). Here, we identify a significant link between abnormalities in PVM/Ms and endothelial barrier breakdown from acoustic trauma to the mouse ear. We find that acoustic trauma causes activation of PVM/Ms and physical detachment from capillary walls. Concurrent with the detachment, we find loosened tight junctions between endothelial cells and decreased production of tight- and adherens-junction protein, resulting in leakage of serum proteins from the damaged barrier. A key factor in the intrastrial fluid-blood barrier hyperpermeability exhibited in the mice is down-regulation of PVM/M modulated PEDF production. We demonstrate that delivery of PEDF to the damaged ear ameliorates hearing loss by restoring intrastrial fluid-blood barrier integrity. PEDF up-regulates expression of tight junction-associated proteins (ZO-1 and VE-cadherin) and PVM/M stabilizing neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM-120). These studies point to the critical role PVM/Ms play in regulating intrastrial fluid-blood barrier integrity in healthy and noise-damaged ears."
https://openalex.org/W2029912427,"The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is indispensable for the viability of melanocytic cells, is an oncogene in melanoma and has a cell type-specific expression pattern. As the modulation of MITF activity by direct chemical targeting remains a challenge, we assessed a panel of drugs for their ability to downregulate MITF expression or activity by targeting its upstream modulators. We found that the multi-kinase inhibitors midostaurin and sunitinib downregulate MITF protein levels. To identify the target molecules shared by both the drugs in melanocytic cells, a chemical proteomic approach was applied and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) was identified as the relevant target for the observed phenotype. RNA interference and chemical inhibition of AMPK led to a decrease in MITF protein levels. Reduction of MITF protein levels was the result of proteasomal degradation, which was preceded by enhanced phosphorylation of MITF mediated by ERK. As expected, downregulation of MITF protein levels by AMPK inhibition was associated with decreased viability. Together, these results identify AMPK as an important regulator for the maintenance of MITF protein levels in melanocytic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2111655319,"We have shown previously that Clock, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), and nocturnin are involved in the circadian regulation of intestinal lipid absorption. Here, we clarified the role of apolipoprotein AIV (apoAIV) in the diurnal regulation of plasma lipids and intestinal lipid absorption in mice. Plasma triglyceride in apoAIV(-/-) mice showed diurnal variations similar to apoAIV(+/+) mice; however, the increases in plasma triglyceride at night were significantly lower in these mice. ApoAIV(-/-) mice absorbed fewer lipids at night and showed blunted response to daytime feeding. To explain reasons for these lower responses, we measured MTP expression; intestinal MTP was low at night, and its induction after food entrainment was less in apoAIV(-/-) mice. Conversely, apoAIV overexpression increased MTP mRNA in hepatoma cells, indicating transcriptional regulation. Mechanistic studies revealed that sequences between -204/-775 bp in the MTP promoter respond to apoAIV and that apoAIV enhances expression of FoxA2 and FoxO1 transcription factors and their binding to the identified cis elements in the MTP promoter at night. Knockdown of FoxA2 and FoxO1 abolished apoAIV-mediated MTP induction. Similarly, knockdown of apoAIV in differentiated Caco-2 cells reduced MTP, FoxA2, and FoxO1 mRNA levels, cellular MTP activity, and media apoB. Moreover, FoxA2 and FoxO1 expression showed diurnal variations, and their expression was significantly lower in apoAIV(-/-) mice. These data indicate that apoAIV modulates diurnal changes in lipid absorption by regulating forkhead transcription factors and MTP and that inhibition of apoAIV expression might reduce plasma lipids."

We investigated whether hypoxia actually occurred in an in vivo model of menstruation. Three complementary approaches were used to look for signs of hypoxia in fragments of human functionalis xenografted to ovariectomized immunodeficient mice bearing pellets-releasing estradiol and progesterone, and then deprived of ovarian steroids. Hormone withdrawal 21 d after grafting induced menstrual breakdown and MMP expression within 4 d. Local partial oxygen pressure (pO2) was measured by electron paramagnetic resonance using implanted lithium phtalocyanine crystals. In mice with hormone maintenance until sacrifice, pO2 was low one week after grafting (14.8±3.4 mmHg) but increased twofold from the second week when tissue was largely revascularized. After 3 wk, pO2 was not modified by hormone withdrawal but was slightly increased on hormone reimpregnation 4 d after removal (34.7 ±6.1 mmHg) by comparison with hormone maintenance (27.1 ±8.6 mmHg). These results were confirmed using fluorescence quenching-based OxyLite measurements. In a further search for signs of hypoxia, we did not find significant HIF1-α immunostaining, nor pimonidazole adducts after hormone withdrawal.

In addition, we showed that only one gp45 clamp is continuously associated with the replisome and that no additional clamps accumulate on the DNA, providing further evidence that the clamp departs, whereas the polymerase is recycled upon completion of an Okazaki fragment synthesis cycle.

We report that HDAC5 is recruited to the long telomeres of osteosarcoma- and fibrosarcoma-derived cell lines, where it ensures proper maintenance of these repetitive regions. Indeed, depletion of HDAC5 by RNAi resulted in the shortening of longer telomeres and homogenization of telomere length in cells that use either telomerase or an alternative mechanism of telomere maintenance. Furthermore, we present evidence for the activation of telomere recombination on depletion of HDAC5 in fibrosarcoma telomerase-positive cancer cells. Of potential importance, we also found that depletion of HDAC5 sensitizes cancer cells with long telomeres to chemotherapeutic drugs. Cells with shorter telomeres were used to control the specificity of HDAC5 role in the maintenance of long telomeres. HDAC5 is essential for the length maintenance of long telomeres and its depletion is required for sensitization of cancer cells with long telomeres to chemotherapy. —Novo, C.

Mammalian SREBPs are proteolytically activated and liberated from the membrane by Golgi Site-1 and Site-2 proteases. Fission yeast SREBPs, Sre1 and Sre2, employ a different mechanism that genetically requires the Golgi Dsc E3 ligase complex for cleavage activation. Here, we established Sre2 as a model to define structural requirements for SREBP cleavage. We showed that Sre2 cleavage does not require the N-terminal basic helix-loop-helix zipper transcription factor domain, thus separating cleavage of Sre2 from its transcription factor function. From a mutagenesis screen of 94 C-terminal residues of Sre2, we isolated 15 residues required for cleavage and further identified a glycine-leucine sequence required for Sre2 cleavage. Importantly, the glycine-leucine sequence is located at a conserved distance before the first transmembrane segment of both Sre1 and Sre2 and cleavage occurs in between this sequence and the membrane. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a broad conservation of this novel glycine-leucine motif in SREBP homologs of ascomycete fungi, including the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus where SREBP is required for virulence. Consistent with this, the sequence was also required for cleavage of the oxygen-responsive transcription factor Sre1 and adaptation to hypoxia, demonstrating functional conservation of this cleavage recognition motif. These cleavage mutants will aid identification of the fungal SREBP protease and facilitate functional dissection of the Dsc E3 ligase required for SREBP activation and fungal pathogenesis."

We proposed that a zinc-regulated humoral factor might mediate the effects of zinc deprivation. Using a novel approach, primary rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were treated with plasma from zinc-deficient (<1 mg Zn/kg) or zinc-adequate (35 mg Zn/kg, pair-fed) adult male rats, and zinc levels were manipulated to distinguish direct and indirect effects of plasma zinc. Gene expression changes were analyzed by microarray and qPCR, and incubation of VSMCs with blood plasma from zinc-deficient rats strongly changed the expression of >2500 genes, compared to incubation of cells with zinc-adequate rat plasma. We demonstrated that this effect was caused by a low-molecular-weight (~2-kDa) zinc-regulated humoral factor but that changes in gene expression were mostly reversed by adding zinc back to zinc-deficient plasma. Strongly regulated genes were overrepresented in pathways associated with immune function and development. We conclude that zinc deficiency induces the production of a low-molecular-weight humoral factor whose influence on VSMC gene expression is blocked by plasma zinc. This factor is therefore under dual control by zinc.— Ou, O., Allen-Redpath, K., Urgast, D., Gordon, M.-J., Campbell, G., Feldmann, J., Nixon, G. F., Mayer, C.-D., Kwun, I.-S., and Beattie, J. H.
