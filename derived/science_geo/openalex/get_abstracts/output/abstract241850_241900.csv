Paradoxically, cells invest many resources to maintain tubular mitochondrial morphology, when reducing both fusion and fission simultaneously achieves the same end. This observation suggests a requirement for mitochondrial fusion, beyond maintenance of organelle morphology. Here, we show that cells with targeted null mutations in Mfn1 or Mfn2 retained low levels of mitochondrial fusion and escaped major cellular dysfunction. Analysis of these mutant cells showed that both homotypic and heterotypic interactions of Mfns are capable of fusion. In contrast, cells lacking both Mfn1 and Mfn2 completely lacked mitochondrial fusion and showed severe cellular defects, including poor cell growth, widespread heterogeneity of mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased cellular respiration. Disruption of OPA1 by RNAi also blocked all mitochondrial fusion and resulted in similar cellular defects. These defects in Mfn-null or OPA1-RNAi mammalian cells were corrected upon restoration of mitochondrial fusion, unlike the irreversible defects found in fzoΔ yeast. In contrast, fragmentation of mitochondria, without severe loss of fusion, did not result in such cellular defects. Our results showed that key cellular functions decline as mitochondrial fusion is progressively abrogated.

In cultured cells, an equilibrium is achieved between the two processes, and thus a relatively stable but dynamic morphology is maintained.

If fusion is inhibited, however, unopposed fission leads to mitochondrial fragmentation (3Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J.

In mammalian cells, the large mitochondrial GTPases Mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), and OPA1 play important roles in mitochondrial fusion (3Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E.

Thiselton D.L. Mayer S. Moore A. Rodriguez M. Kellner U. Leo-Kottler B. Auburger G. Bhattacharya S.S. Wissinger B. Nat.

Mice lacking either of the mitofusins die as embryos, with Mfn2-null mice showing placental insufficiency (3Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). To understand these diverse tissue-specific phenotypes, it will be critical to elucidate the relative importance of Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1 in specific cell types. In particular, Mfn1 and Mfn2 appear to play similar roles in mitochondrial fusion, but the degree of redundancy between these homologs and whether they can cooperate in mitochondrial fusion remains to be determined. On a cellular level, the best known function of mitochondrial fusion is to maintain mitochondrial morphology (12Bleazard W. McCaffery J.M. King E.J. Bale S. Mozdy A. Tieu Q. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 13Sesaki H. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Given the highly ordered arrangement of mitochondrial networks in some cell types (14Bakeeva L.E. Chentsov Y.S. Skulachev V.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 25: 175-181PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that mitochondrial shape indeed has important consequences for mitochondrial function. Nevertheless, there are clues that mitochondrial fusion has additional functions beyond regulation of morphology. First, the in vivo rates of mitochondrial fusion and fission far exceed those necessary to maintain tubular mitochondrial morphology. Cells with greatly reduced rates can have tubular mitochondria, as long as the fusion and fission rates are appropriately balanced (3Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). Second, in Mfn1-null or Mfn2-null cells, a small subset of mitochondria lose their membrane potential (ΔΨ) (3Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that mitochondrial dynamics protects mitochondria by ensuring that stochastic depletion of materials, such as metabolic substrates or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), is transient. Without fusion, however, these deficiencies persist, accumulate, and result in cellular dysfunction. In this study, we examined the dependence of mitochondrial fusion on Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1 and demonstrated that cells lacking all mitochondrial fusion show defects in key cellular functions. Fusion-defective cells have dramatically reduced growth rates, reduced respiration, and a highly heterogeneous mitochondrial population prone to loss of ΔΨ. Cell Lines and Culture—To generate Mfn-dm cells, MEFs were first derived from Mfn1–/–, Mfn2-/conditional embryos (carrying one copy of a loxP-flanked conditional allele of Mfn2), as described previously (3Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). Transient transfection with a Cre-enhanced GFP expression plasmid, followed by cell sorting for Cre-GFP expression, was used to isolate Mfn-dm cells. The genotypes of all mutant cells were confirmed by PCR analysis. Mfn-dm and OPA1-RNAi lines were derived and maintained in rich medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 1 mm pyruvate, 50 μg/ml uridine). All other cell lines were maintained in standard medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum). All experiments involving retroviral infection were conducted on both freshly infected bulk cultures and multiple clonal lines. Mitochondrial ΔΨ was monitored, as described previously (3Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar), except that mitochondria were detected by expression Su9-GFP (enhanced GFP with the mitochondrial presequence of subunit 9 of the F0-ATPase). Z-stacks of images acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m microscope were deconvolved using the iterative algorithm in AxioVision 4.2 and presented as maximum intensity projections. For cell growth measurements, parental control cultures were split in two and either mock-infected or infected with the experimental virus. Cells were then plated onto two 6-well plates, at 6 × 104 cells/well in their respective growth media. 4 h later, the cells were counted, in triplicate, to constitute the day 0 score. At this time, the medium in the remaining 9 wells of each cell line was changed to standard medium. The cells were then counted, in triplicate, on days 2, 3, and 4. Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA) Construction—For RNA interference (RNAi) studies, we constructed retroviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs from the human H1-RNA promoter. The H1-RNA promoter was cloned into pBKSII (Stratagene), as described previously (15Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). The pMND-BANSHEE vector carrying GFP (gift of Drs. G. Hernandez-Hoyos and J. Ila-Alberola, California Institute of Technology) and pMND-BANSHEE vector carrying Neo(R) (gift of Dr. J. Rossi, City of Hope, CA) were digested with BglII and StuI. The H1 promoter was then inserted as a BamHI/HincII fragment to make the retroviral vectors pBG and pBN, respectively. shRNA constructs were then inserted as annealed oligonucleotides into BglII/HindIII sites. An RNAi-resistant OPA1 construct was made by altering codons for residues 13–18 (from gtc tgc caa tcc tta gtg to gtg tgt cag tcg ttg gta). Retrovirus was prepared from these plasmids and used to infect MEFs, as described previously (3Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used: anti-OPA1-f, 5′-gatccccgtctgtcaatccttagtgattcaagagatcactaaggattggcagactttttggaaa-3′; anti-OPA1-r, 5′-agcttttccaaaaagtctgccaatccttagtgatctcttgaatcactaaggattgacagacggg-3′; anti-Mfn1-f, 5′-gatcccccggtatctctactgaagcattcaagagatgcttcagtggagatacgtttttggaaa-3′; anti-Mfn1-r, 5′-agcttttccaaaaacggtatctccactgaagcatctcttgaatgcttcagtagagataccgggg-3′. Antibodies—Standard Western analysis and immunofluorescence were conducted using the following antibodies: anti-OPA1 (gift of Drs. L. Griparic and A. van der Bliek, UCLA), anti-Mfn1 (3Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar), anti-β-actin (Sigma, clone AC-15), and anti-Myc (9E10 hybridoma). PEG Fusion Assay—PEG fusion was performed, as described previously (3Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar), except that cells were plated and grown in rich medium. Cell fusion was allowed to proceed for 7 h in the presence of cycloheximide. Pre-incubation with cycloheximide for 1–8 h did not affect the fusion results. To evaluate outer membrane fusion in OPA1-RNAi cells, cells expressing the mitochondrial outer membrane marker Mfn1(K88T)-Myc (3Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar) were used. The marker was detected by immunofluorescence against the Myc epitope. Mfn1(K88T)-Myc is a non-functional Mfn1 that has no dominant negative effects on mitochondrial morphology. The cells were imaged with a Plan NeoFluar 63× objective on a Zeiss 410 laser confocal microscope using AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). Oxygen Electrode Polarography—Oxygen consumption was measured in intact cells using a Clark oxygen electrode (Oxygraph, Hansatech Instruments), as described previously (16Villani G. Attardi G. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 119-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 2 × 106 cells in 500 μl of TD buffer (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) were added to the chamber, and mixing was started. After 1 min of equilibration, the chamber was stoppered. Endogenous respiration was measured as the average oxygen consumption over a period of 1 min, starting 2 min after cap closure. At ∼4.5 min, 2,4-dinitrophenol (83 mm final concentration) was injected into the chamber, and the maximum respiration rate was measured for 1 min starting 0.5 min after injection. Substrate-driven respiration rates were measured in digitonin-permeabilized cells, as described previously (17Duan S. Hajek P. Lin C. Shin S.K. Attardi G. Chomyn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1346-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Comparison of Mitochondrial Morphologies in Cells Lacking Mitofusins or OPA1—Using targeted mutagenesis, we previously reported that Mfn1-null, Mfn2-null, and Mfn double mutant (Mfn-dm) cells have fragmented mitochondria, because of perturbations in mitochondrial fusion (3Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar, 18Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear to what degree these homologs are functionally redundant and whether they cooperate to mediate normal levels of mitochondrial fusion. To address these issues, we performed a comparative analysis of mitochondrial morphology and fusion in the mutant cell lines. Although MEFs of all three genotypes (Mfn1-null, Mfn2-null, and Mfn-dm) showed extensive mitochondrial fragmentation, they could be readily distinguished. We found that all mutant cells could be scored into three categories. Class I cells showed complete fragmentation resulting in only mitochondrial spheres. Class II cells showed extensive fragmentation but contained some very short mitochondrial rods (<5 μm in length). Cells with any medium-length mitochondrial tubules (>5 μm in length) were placed in Class III, regardless of whether accompanying fragmentation was present. Representative images of these classes are shown in Fig. 1 for each of the mutant MEFs. None of these three phenotypic classes approaches the tubular network typically found in wild-type cells (Fig. 1A). Mfn2-null cells (Fig. 1, B–E) showed all three phenotypic classes. 20% showed no mitochondrial rods (Class I). Most (>60%) contained a few short rods in addition to mitochondrial spheres (Class II), and 16% contained medium-length tubules (Class III). In contrast, Mfn1-null MEFs (Fig. 1, B, F, and G) showed more severe mitochondrial fragmentation, with 27% of cells showing only small mitochondrial spheres (Class I). Mfn1-null cells of Class I could be distinguished from Mfn2-null cells of Class I by the smaller diameter of the Mfn1-null mitochondrial spheres. The majority (73%) of Mfn1-null cells showed a combination of small spheres and very short rods (Class II). No Mfn1-null cells contained Class III morphology. The presence of more rod-shaped mitochondria in Mfn2-null cells suggests that cells containing only Mfn1 retain more fusion activity than cells containing only Mfn2. Notably, all Mfn-dm cells (Fig. 1, B and H) belonged to Class I and never showed significant mitochondrial rods or tubules. However, in contrast to Mfn1-null or Mfn2-null cells of Class I, Mfn-dm cells showed prominent heterogeneity in the mitochondrial population, characterized by a mixture of large and small spheres. Fig. 1 summarizes the scoring of these mutant cells and shows how even cells scored into the same class have distinctive mitochondrial morphologies, depending on their genotype. We also analyzed the mitochondrial morphology of cells with perturbed expression of OPA1, another protein implicated in mitochondrial dynamics (4Olichon A. Baricault L. Gas N. Guillou E. Valette A. Belenguer P. Lenaers G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7743-7746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 5Griparic L. van der Wel N.N. Orozco I.J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15927-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). OPA1-deficient cells (termed OPA1-RNAi) were created by stably infecting wild-type MEFs with retrovirus encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against OPA1. This shRNA sequence targets all isoforms of OPA1, and indeed, OPA1-RNAi cells had <10% of wild-type OPA1 protein levels (supplemental Fig. S1). Wild-type cells overexpressing a Myc-tagged OPA1 were also established (termed OPA1-OE). Similar results were obtained with untagged OPA1. 2H. Chen and D. Chan, unpublished results. As previously described, both overexpression and underexpression of OPA1 lead to mitochondrial fragmentation (4Olichon A. Baricault L. Gas N. Guillou E. Valette A. Belenguer P. Lenaers G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7743-7746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 5Griparic L. van der Wel N.N. Orozco I.J. Peters P.J. van der Bliek A.M. J. Biol.

A. 2004; 101: 15927-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). However, we found that the mitochondrial morphologies of the two types of cells could nevertheless be easily distinguished. OPA1-OE cells (Fig. 1K) had uniform, small mitochondrial spheres that were spread throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, OPA-RNAi cells (Fig. 1I) contained mitochondria that were highly heterogeneous in size, a phenotype similar to that of Mfn-dm cells. Both OPA1-RNAi and Mfn-dm cells typically had some very large mitochondrial spheres (several microns in diameter) accompanied by a scattering of very small mitochondrial fragments. For both Mfn-dm (18Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and OPA1-RNAi cells (Fig. 1J), this mitochondrial fragmentation was reversible, because re-expression of the corresponding gene restored the tubular network of mitochondria. Requirements for OPA1 and Mitofusins in Fusion—The different types of mitochondrial fragmentation observed could be explained by differences in the degree of residual mitochondrial fusion. To test this hypothesis, we used the PEG cell fusion technique to quantitate mitochondrial fusion in our mutant cell lines (Table I). In each case, 250 cell hybrids were scored for mitochondrial fusion. Consistent with previous results (18Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), wild-type cells demonstrated complete fusion of all their mitochondria in the vast majority (97%) of cell fusion events after 7 h (Table I; Fig. 2A), whereas Mfn-dm cells showed absolutely no fusion (Table I), even after 24 h. 2H.

Cell hybrids containing only Mfn2 (Mfn1-null cells; Table I) usually showed unambiguous and extensive partial fusion (94% of cell hybrids), although full fusion was found in only one hybrid of 250. Most cell hybrids containing only Mfn1 (Mfn2-null cells; Table I) showed partial fusion (85%), but a significant fraction even showed full fusion (14%). These residual levels of fusion activity likely explain the presence of mitochondrial rods in Mfn1-null and Mfn2-null cells and again suggest that, in fibroblasts, Mfn1 has a more prominent role in mitochondrial fusion than Mfn2. Thus, the mitofusins are partially redundant in that a single Mfn homolog is capable of mediating substantial levels of fusion. Because mitofusins have been shown to be required on adjacent mitochondria to mediate fusion (18Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), these results indicate that homotypic Mfn interactions (Mfn1-Mfn1 and Mfn2-Mfn2) can promote fusion. Notably, cell hybrids between Mfn1-null and Mfn2-null cells also had significant fusion, with 92% showing partial fusion and 6% showing full fusion (Table I; Fig. 2B). This result indicates, for the first time, that heterotypic Mfn interactions (Mfn1-Mfn2) can promote fusion at endogenous expression levels. A previous OPA1 RNAi study shows that a reduction of OPA1 levels to 30% of wild-type results in reduction of mitochondrial fusion by 33% (6Cipolat S. Martins de Brito O. Dal Zilio B. Scorrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15927-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Because of the inefficiency of this RNAi experiment, it was not possible to conclude whether OPA1 is absolutely essential for mitochondrial fusion or simply enhances the efficiency of fusion. We addressed this issue with our OPA1-RNAi cells, which had barely detectable levels of OPA1 (supplemental Fig. S1). In PEG fusion assays, OPA1-RNAi cells were devoid of any mitochondrial fusion (Table I; Fig. 2C), even after 24 h.2 This complete fusion defect likely explains the similar morphological defects in mitochondria in OPA1-RNAi and Mfn-dm cells. Moreover, these results definitely demonstrated that OPA1, like mitofusins, are strictly required for mitochondrial fusion. Because our standard PEG fusion assay relied on mitochondrial matrix markers, we also used an outer mitochondrial membrane marker to test whether outer membrane fusion is abolished in OPA1-RNAi cells. Again, no mitochondrial fusion was observed (Fig. 2D), indicating that both outer and inner membrane fusion require OPA1. In contrast, OPA1-OE cells fused their mitochondria as efficiently as wild-type cells (Table I), indicating that the mitochondrial fragmentation observed in these cells was not due to the lack of fusion. We also found normal levels of fusion at earlier time points (supplemental Table S1), eliminating the possibility that OPA1-OE cells have a subtle fusion defect. In previous studies of mitochondrial fragmentation by OPA1 overexpression (5Griparic L. van der Wel N.N. Orozco I.J. Peters P.J. van der Bliek A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18792-18798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 19Misaka T. Miyashita T. Kubo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15834-15842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), it has been unclear whether fragmentation is because of reduced fusion or increased fission. Our findings suggest the latter possibility. Consistent with this possibility, we found that mitochondrial fragmentation due to OPA1 overexpression was blocked when the fission molecule Drp1 was down-regulated by RNAi.2 Inhibition of Cell Growth—In addition to defects in mitochondrial morphology, we noticed that both OPA1-RNAi and Mfn-dm cells grow significantly more slowly than wild-type MEFs. Because cell growth is a general indicator of cell function, we quantitated this growth defect by monitoring cell proliferation over the course of 4 days. Mfn2-null cells depleted of Mfn1 by shRNA (supplemental Fig. S1) grew to only 18% of the parental Mfn2-null control (Fig. 3A). Likewise, Mfn-dm cells also showed very slow growth. This growth defect was reversible, as demonstrated by the growth rescue of such cells upon re-introduction of Mfn1 and Mfn2 (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, cells lacking only Mfn2 or Mfn1 showed no growth defect,2 suggesting that the residual levels of fusion documented above are sufficient to prevent severe disruption of cell function. Similar to Mfn-dm cells, OPA1-RNAi cells also grew much more slowly and attained only 15% of the density of mock-infected control cells (Fig. 3C). Finally, OPA1-OE cells, with fusion-competent but fragmented mitochondria, grew at the same rate as wild-type controls (Fig. 3D). Loss of Mitochondrial ΔΨ—The generalized cell growth problem in cells deficient in mitochondrial fusion led us to investigate what specific mitochondrial defects might exist. To monitor mitochondrial ΔΨ, cells were stained with MitoTracker Red, a mitochondrial dye dependent on ΔΨ. This staining was compared with Su9-GFP, a marker that localizes to the mitochondrial matrix even in cells with low mitochondrial ΔΨ (20Westermann B. Neupert W. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). For the studies described below, identical results were obtained when a mitochondrial outer membrane marker (GFP-OMP25) was used instead of Su9-GFP.2 Consistent with our previous study (3Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar), we found that both Mfn1-null and Mfn2-null cells have mild heterogeneity in mitochondrial ΔΨ.2 Most Mfn1-null cells showed some mitochondria with weak MitoTracker Red staining, but this was restricted to only a few mitochondria (1–10/cell). With Mfn2-null cells, only a minority of cells showed heterogeneity in MitoTracker staining, and again this defect was restricted to a few mitochondria. In contrast, 100% of Mfn-dm cells showed widespread heterogeneity of mitochondrial ΔΨ, with a large fraction of the mitochondrial population failing to stain well with MitoTracker Red (Fig. 4, A–C). The loss of mitochondrial ΔΨ was reversible with complete restoration of ΔΨ in Mfn-null cells overexpressing Mfn1.2 Depletion of OPA1 by RNAi similarly led to wide-spread loss of mitochondrial ΔΨ (Fig. 4, D–F). Cells overexpressing OPA1 showed no ΔΨ defects (Fig. 4, G–I). Taken together with the PEG fusion data, these results indicate that the severity of mitochondrial ΔΨ loss correlates with the severity of fusion deficiency. Reduced Mitochondrial Respiration—To examine the respiratory capacity of mutant cells, we used oxygen electrode studies to measure the rate of oxygen consumption in intact cells. We first measured the endogenous respiration rate and then added a proton ionophore (2,4-dinitrophenol) to induce the uncoupled respiration rate. Upon dissipation of the proton gradient, a compensatory increase in electron transport ensued, resulting in respiration at maximal capacity. Wild-type MEFs had a strong endogenous respiration rate that was capable of increasing 40–70% upon dissipation of the proton gradient (Fig. 5A). A similar profile was observed in OPA1-OE cells (Fig. 5B). In contrast, Mfn-dm cells had reduced endogenous respiration, and respiration failed to increase upon the addition of ionophore (Fig. 5C). OPA1-RNAi cells reproducibly displayed an even more severe reduction in endogenous respiration and again no increase upon the addition of ionophore (Fig. 5E). The more severe defect found in OPA1-RNAi cells, as compared with that of Mfn-dm cells, was highly reproducible between multiple trials (Fig. 5G). To further dissect the respiration defect in our fusion-deficient cell lines, we measured substrate-driven respiration in permeabilized cells. Specifically, we used glutamate and malate to measure complex I activity, succinate/glycerol-3-phosphate for complex III, and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine/ascorbate for complex IV. Respiratory capacity was attenuated for all three complexes in the mutant lines (Fig. 6). An important aspect of the respiration defects was that they were reversible. Mfn-dm cells had a restored respiration profile upon expression of exogenous Mfn1 and Mfn2 (Fig. 5, D and G). Even more strikingly, expression of OPA1 in OPA1-RNAi cells completely restored normal respiration (Fig. 5, F and G), despite the severe defect in OPA1-RNAi cells. This reversibility indicates that, unlike in yeast, respiration defects in mammalian cells are not secondary to a complete loss of mtDNA, and suggests that lack of fusion itself affects respiration. It is interesting to note that cells lacking only Mfn1 or Mfn2 had no gross defect in cell growth or bulk respiration,2 implying that low levels of mitochondrial fusion are sufficient to prevent at least some of the functional defects shown here. Requirement of Mfns and OPA1 in Mitochondrial Membrane Fusion—There is some evidence that Mfn1 and Mfn2 may have distinct activities (6Cipolat S. Martins de Brito O. Dal Zilio B. Scorrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15927-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 21Ishihara N. Eura Y. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6535-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), but they nevertheless have similar roles in mitochondrial membrane fusion. Because these two mitofusin homologs have overlapping expression patterns, it is important to clarify whether they play redundant roles in tissues where they are co-expressed and whether they can cooperate to mediate mitochondrial fusion. Our study showed that both Mfn1 and Mfn2 play a major role in maintaining normal levels of mitochondrial fusion. In the absence of either homolog, mitochondrial fragmentation results from a drastic reduction in the extent of mitochondrial fusion, as observed by the PEG fusion assay. Nevertheless, a single mitofusin is sufficient to generate residual mitochondrial fusion that can be readily detected. In mouse fibroblasts, Mfn1 appears to play a more prominent role than Mfn2, as evidenced by the greater loss of mitochondrial fusion and more severe fragmentation found in Mfn1-null MEFs. Recent evidence suggests that mitofusins act in trans to mediate mitochondrial tethering and fusion (18Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Our PEG fusion assays, using various combinations of Mfn1-null and Mfn2-null cells, further suggest that mitochondrial fusion, in vivo, can be mediated by three distinct complexes acting in trans: Mfn1 homotypic complexes, Mfn2 homotypic complexes, and Mfn1/Mfn2 heterotypic complexes. Our results clarify the puzzling observation reported here and by others (4Olichon A. Baricault L. Gas N. Guillou E. Valette A. Belenguer P. Lenaers G. J. Biol.

We find that OPA1 deficiency abolishes all mitochondrial fusion. In contrast, fragmentation due to overexpression of OPA1 does not result from a fusion defect but is Drp1-dependent. The basis for this fragmentation remains to be resolved. One possibility is that overexpression of OPA1 can lead to an imbalance in OPA1 isoforms. A similar phenomenon is observed in yeast. Pcp1p is the rhomboid protease responsible for cleavage of Mgm1p (23Herlan M. Vogel F. Bornhovd C. Neupert W. Reichert A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27781-27788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 24McQuibban G.A. Saurya S. Freeman M. Nature. 2003; 423: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The proper balance of long and short isoforms of Mgm1p is critical for maintenance of tubular mitochondrial morphology (25Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Hobbs A.E. Jensen R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26Herlan M. Bornhovd C. Hell K. Neupert W. Reichert A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Yeast lacking Pcp1p produce only the long form of Mgm1p and have fragmented mitochondria that are fusion-competent (25Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Hobbs A.E. Jensen R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Additional Functions of Mitochondrial Fusion—Previous studies have clearly substantiated the role of mitochondrial fusion and fission in maintenance of mitochondrial morphology (3Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar, 12Bleazard W. McCaffery J.M. King E.J. Bale S. Mozdy A. Tieu Q. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 13Sesaki H. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). It is likely that, depending on the cell type, the shape of mitochondria can directly influence their functional properties. For example, it has been hypothesized that the filamentous and interconnected structure of mitochondria in some cells may facilitate the delivery of energy or membrane potential to specific regions of the cell (27Skulachev V.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 23-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In addition to this role in regulation of organelle shape, our studies suggest that mitochondrial fusion per se is important for mitochondrial function. Mfn1-null and Mfn2-null MEFs contain highly fragmented mitochondria but retain enough residual mitochondrial fusion to escape major cellular dysfunction. In contrast, Mfn-dm cells and OPA1-RNAi cells lack any detectable mitochondrial fusion. These cells grow poorly, show widespread heterogeneity in mitochondrial ΔΨ, and suffer reduced respiratory capacity. In polarography measurements, these fusion-incompetent cells respire at maximal rates in the absence of an uncoupler, and these rates are severely depressed compared with wild-type cells. Because these cells have increased heterogeneity in their mitochondria, this phenomenon may reflect a compensatory mechanism for the reduced number of functional mitochondria. Furthermore, the mutant cells have little or no reserve capacity for increased respiration. These functional deficits do not appear to be secondary to mitochondrial fragmentation, because OPA1-overexpressing cells have severely fragmented mitochondria without loss of mitochondrial fusion and do not suffer cellular defects. Also of note is that the cell growth and respiratory defects are not due to an irreversible loss of mtDNA as seen in yeast, because reintroduction of the relevant protein restores normal cell function. It remains a formal possibility that the severe functional defects observed in Mfn-dm and OPA1-RNAi cells may be due to as yet unknown functions of Mfns or OPA1, apart from fusion. This issue is more of a concern with OPA1, because this protein is still poorly understood and has been proposed to play a role in inner membrane remodeling (4Olichon A. Baricault L. Gas N. Guillou E. Valette A. Belenguer P. Lenaers G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7743-7746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Such additional functions may explain why the respiration defect in OPA1-RNAi cells is significantly more severe than in Mfn-dm cells. However, we favor the explanation that the functional defects observed in Mfn-dm and OPA1-RNAi cells are specifically because of the lack of mitochondrial fusion. Mitofusins are becoming increasingly well understood and appear to play a direct role in mediating mitochondrial membrane fusion (18Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In addition, the functional deficits in Mfn-dm and OPA1-RNAi cells are very similar, consistent with the hypothesis that they arise from a common defect. A major challenge for future studies will be to identify the pathway through which loss of fusion in mammalian cells results in mitochondrial dysfunction. In some experimental systems, mitochondrial fusion has been associated with protective effects on mitochondrial function. Cell hybrids between parental cells containing mutant mtDNA molecules result in restoration of respiratory activity (28Ono T. Isobe K. Nakada K. Hayashi J.I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), indicating that complementation of mtDNA products can occur in fused mitochondria. Moreover, mice containing pathogenic mtDNA mutations are protected from mitochondrial dysfunction until a critical load of mutant mtDNA molecules is reached (22Nakada K. Inoue K. Ono T. Isobe K. Ogura A. Goto Y.I. Nonaka I. Hayashi J.I. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 934-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These results again suggest that mitochondrial fusion can allow interaction of mtDNA gene products and enable protection of mitochondrial function. We are grateful to Drs. G. Hernandez-Hoyos, J.

Previous studies have shown that mTOR is a direct substratefor the AKT kinase and identified Ser-2448 as the AKT target site in mTOR.

Furthermore, thephosphorylation of Ser-2448 was dependent on mTOR kinase activity, suggestingthat mTOR itself or a protein kinase downstream from mTOR was responsible forthe modification of Ser-2448.

In addition, we show that cellular amino acid status,which modulates p70S6 kinase (S6K1) activity via the TSC/Rheb pathway,regulates Ser-2448 phosphorylation.

In particular, mTOR plays a critical role incoordinating cell growth with growth factor inputs as well as cellularnutrient and energy status. The bacterially derived macrolide ester, rapamycin, is clinically approvedas an immunosuppressant and shows promising anti-tumor activity. Rapamycin,when complexed with FKBP-12 (FK506-binding protein, 12 kDa), bindsspecifically to mTOR at a conserved stretch of ∼100 amino acids termed theFKBP-12·rapamycin binding domain(4Chen J.

Mutation of a criticalserine residue (Ser-2035) in the FKBP-12·rapamycin binding domain to amore bulky amino acid, such as isoleucine, abrogates FKBP-12·rapamycinbinding to mTOR, and generates a rapamycin-resistant form of mTOR(4Chen J.

Recent studies have provided significant insights into the growth factorand nutrient signaling pathway(s) upstream of mTOR. Stimulation of many growthfactor receptors leads to activation of the PI-3 kinase-AKT pathway, and itappears that this pathway is centrally involved in the coupling of mitogenicstimuli to mTOR. Moreover, loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN provides apowerful signal for tumor progression and simultaneously confers increasedsensitivity to the anti-proliferative effect of rapamycin(6Neshat M.S.

The proposed AKTphosphorylation site (Ser-2448) in mTOR lies within a C-terminal regulatoryregion, which, when deleted, results in elevated mTOR activity invitro and in cells (18Sekulic A.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5654-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that mTOR phosphorylation at Ser-2448 isblocked by rapamycin, and this effect is independent of the AKT activationstatus, which suggests that Ser-2448 phosphorylation is catalyzed by a proteinkinase other than AKT. We show that Ser-2448 is directly phosphorylated byp70S6 kinase in vitro and that expression of a rapamycin-resistantp70S6 kinase in cells maintains Ser-2448 phosphorylation in the presence ofrapamycin. Furthermore, changes in amino acid availability, which affectsp70S6 kinase activity, also modulates Ser-2448 phosphorylation. Finally,Ser-2448 phosphorylation is reduced in cells by siRNA-mediated depletion ofp70S6 kinase. Taken together, these data suggest that p70S6 kinase is themajor protein kinase responsible for Ser-2448 phosphorylation in mammaliancells.

Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidenedifluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Western blotting was carriedout essentially as described(21Chiang G.G. Abraham R.T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 281: 125-141PubMed Google Scholar). Bound antibodies weredetected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (AmershamBiosciences) for polyclonal antibodies or horseradish peroxidase-conjugatedgoat anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for monoclonal antibodiesfollowed by enhanced chemiluminescence using Western Lightning reagent(PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Rapamycin Blocks Serum-stimulated Ser-2448Phosphorylation—Previous reports demonstrated that mTOR wasphosphorylated in vitro by AKT at a serine residue (Ser-2448) locatedin a C-terminal “repressor domain” of mTOR(18Sekulic A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. CancerRes. 2000; 60: 3504-3513Google Scholar,19Nave B.T. Ouwens D.M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). In later studies, weunexpectedly observed that phosphorylation at the Ser-2448 site wasconsistently suppressed in cells treated with rapamycin. As short termexposure to rapamycin does not inhibit AKT, these results suggested thatSer-2448 phosphorylation was mediated by a rapamycin-sensitive protein kinasethat shared an overlapping substrate preference with AKT. To test thishypothesis, we cultured MCF-7 cells overnight in low serum (0.1%FCS)-containing medium. The cells were restimulated with 10% FCS in theabsence or presence of 100 nm rapamycin or 100 nmwortmannin (Fig. 1A).As previously shown, serum stimulation increased Ser-2448 phosphorylation,with a concomitant increase in AKT phosphorylation at Ser-473. Treatment ofthe cells with 100 nm wortmannin, a concentration that inhibitsPI-3 kinase, but not mTOR or other PI-3 kinase-related kinase family members(23Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. CancerRes. 1998; 58: 4375-4382Google Scholar), blocked theserum-dependent phosphorylation of mTOR, as well as the modification of AKT,consistent with the requirement for PI-3 kinase in AKT activation(24Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBOJ. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). As noted previously,Ser-2448 phosphorylation was also strongly suppressed by rapamycin; however,in contrast to wortmannin, rapamycin had no effect on the phosphorylation ofAKT at Ser-473. Thus, changes in the phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser-2448 werenot tightly correlated with the activation state of AKT in these cells. We next asked whether binding of FKBP-12·rapamycin to mTOR wasrequired for the observed decrease in Ser-2448 phosphorylation. To test this,we used HEK 293 cells that stably express a mTOR polypeptide bearing aSer-2035 → Ile mutation in the FKBP-12·rapamycin binding domain(SI mTOR). The SI mTOR protein exhibits markedly reduced binding affinity forFKBP-12·rapamycin and confers rapamycin resistance when transfectedinto mammalian cells (5Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Liu L.N. Shu L. Ashmun R.A. Germain G.S. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 886-894PubMed Google Scholar). Werepeated the experiments described above, this time with serum-starved HEK 293SI mTOR cells (Fig.1B). In these cells, serum stimulation provoked a clearincrease in the phosphorylation of the ectopically expressed SI mTOR proteinat Ser-2448. The increase in Ser-2448 phosphorylation was inhibited bywortmannin; however, rapamycin had little or no effect on the phosphorylationof the SI mTOR protein. These results indicate that, as is the case forendogenous wild-type mTOR (see Fig.1A), phosphorylation of the Ser-2448 site in SI mTORremains dependent on PI 3-kinase. However, in contrast to the endogenousprotein, phosphorylation of SI mTOR at Ser-2448 is resistant to rapamycin.This result confirms that the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on Ser-2448phosphorylation is dependent on the inhibition of mTOR-dependent signaling bythis drug. mTOR Kinase Activity Is Required for Ser-2448Phosphorylation—To test whether mTOR kinase activity was requiredfor Ser-2448 phosphorylation, we transiently transfected HEK 293 cells withAU1 epitope-tagged, WT, SI mTOR, or a rapamycin-resistant, kinase-inactivemTOR double mutant. After 48 h, the transfected cells were treated with 100nm rapamycin, and the phosphorylation of Ser-2448 was comparativelyexamined in the various AU1-tagged mTOR proteins(Fig. 1C). Rapamycintreatment strongly reduced the phosphorylation of both the WT andrapamycin-resistant, kinase-inactive mTOR polypeptides, whereasphosphorylation of the rapamycin-resistant SI mTOR was unaffected by the drug.Like SI mTOR, the rapamycin-resistant, kinase-inactive mTOR double mutant doesnot bind FKBP-12·rapamycin; however, this kinase-inactive mTOR mutantcannot confer rapamycin resistance when transfected into mammalian cells(18Sekulic A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. CancerRes. 2000; 60: 3504-3513Google Scholar). Thus, thephosphorylation of the Ser-2448 site depends on the expression ofcatalytically active mTOR. Because Ser-2448 is not a mTOR autophosphorylationsite (18Sekulic A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. CancerRes. 2000; 60: 3504-3513Google Scholar), this finding raisesthe possibility that a downstream target of mTOR directly or indirectlymediates the phosphorylation of Ser-2448 in intact cells. Phosphorylation of Ser-2448 by p70S6 Kinase in Vitro—Of theknown mTOR target proteins, p70S6 kinase represents a prime candidate for theputative mTOR-regulated Ser-2448 kinase. To test whether p70S6 kinasephosphorylates mTOR at Ser-2448 in vitro, we transfected HEK 293cells with an expression plasmid encoding a HA-tagged version of wild-typep70S6 kinase (WT) or a catalytically inactive p70S6 kinase mutant bearing aLys to Arg substitution in the catalytic domain (KR)(25Cheatham L. Monfar M. Chou M.M. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Immune complex kinasereactions were performed with α-HA immunoprecipitates as a source ofenzyme and a GST fusion protein containing mTOR amino acids 2405–2517(GST-mTOR RD) as substrate. Phosphate incorporation into the substrate wasvisualized with the α-phospho-Ser-2448 antibody, α-mTORp2(Fig. 2A).Immunoprecipitates containing the recombinant WT p70S6 kinase, but not thekinase-inactive KR mutant, mediated substantial phosphorylation of GST-mTOR RDat the Ser-2448 site. As a control for the specificity of the α-mTORp2antibody, we repeated the immune complex kinase assays with a GST-mTOR RDfusion protein containing a Ser-2448 → Ala substitution as the substrate.Incubation of this substrate with WT p70S6 kinase-containingimmunoprecipitates failed to increase the immunoreactivity of the mutated mTORRD fragment with the α-mTORp2 antibody (data not shown). We also examined whether p70S6 kinase phosphorylated full-length mTORin vitro. To generate this substrate, we serum-starved HEK 293 cellsto reduce Ser-2448 phosphorylation to basal levels and isolated mTOR byimmunoprecipitation. We then assayed the ability of a soluble FLAG-taggedp70S6 kinase to phosphorylate the mTOR immunoprecipitates. As described above,we visualized phosphate incorporation into Ser-2448 with the α-mTORp2antibody (Fig. 2B).Anti-mTOR immunoprecipitates incubated with ATP alone displayed a basal levelof Ser-2448 phosphorylation. The background phosphorylation of mTOR atSer-2448 was observed when the kinase reactions were performed in the absenceof Mg2+-ATP, indicating that the basal Ser-2448 phosphorylation hadoccurred prior to isolation of mTOR from the cells (data not shown). Inagreement with our previous result with our GST-RD fusion protein, Ser-2448phosphorylation of full-length mTOR was substantially increased upon additionof ATP and Flag-p70S6 kinase. Taken together, these results indicate p70S6kinase shares with AKT (18Sekulic A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. CancerRes. 2000; 60: 3504-3513Google Scholar,19Nave B.T. Ouwens D.M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) the ability tophosphorylate mTOR at Ser-2448, at least under in vitro assayconditions. Rapamycin-resistant p70S6 Kinase Restores Ser-2448Phosphorylation—If p70S6 kinase serves as an important Ser-2448kinase in intact cells, then phosphorylation of mTOR at this residue shoulddisplay resistance to rapamycin in cells transfected with a drug-resistantp70S6 kinase mutant. To test this hypothesis, we co-expressedAU1-epitope-tagged WT mTOR with either wild-type p70S6 kinase (WT) or a N- andC-terminally truncated p70S6 kinase mutant (ΔN/C) whose catalyticactivity is insensitive to rapamycin(25Cheatham L. Monfar M. Chou M.M. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As expected,phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser-2448 remained sensitive to rapamycin in cellstransfected with WT p70S6 kinase (Fig.2C). In contrast, rapamycin failed to suppress Ser-2448phosphorylation in the ΔN/C p70S6 kinase-expressing cells. These resultsstrongly suggest that p70S6 kinase is a major effector of Ser-2448phosphorylation in serum-stimulated cells. Ser-2448 Phosphorylation Is Stimulated by Amino Acids— Theactivity of p70S6 kinase is regulated by extracellular amino acids, as well aspolypeptide growth factors(26Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar,27Reinhard C. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4052-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). If p70S6 kinase is amajor contributor to the phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser-2448 in intact cells,then we would expect that readdition of amino acids to starved cells wouldlead to concomitant increases in p70S6 kinase activity and Ser-2448phosphorylation. To address this prediction, we deprived HEK 293 cells ofamino acids and then restimulated the cells with amino acids in the absence orpresence of rapamycin (Fig. 3).Amino acid starvation decreased Ser-2448 phosphorylation to a level comparablewith that observed in rapamycin-treated cells cultured underamino-acid-replete conditions. Readdition of amino acids to these cellsprovoked a strong increase in Ser-2448 phosphorylation, which was paralleledby the appearance of electrophoretically retarded forms of p70S6 kinase, awell established marker of kinase activation. Rapamycin exposure blocked thephosphorylation of p70S6 kinase and mTOR induced by cellular stimulation withamino acids, indicating that both responses were dependent on mTOR signalingfunctions. Importantly, neither amino acid stimulation nor rapamycin treatmentaltered the activation state of AKT, as monitored by changes in thephosphorylation of this protein kinase at Ser-473. Thus, these results arguethat p70S6 kinase, rather than AKT, plays the dominant role in the regulationof mTOR phosphorylation at Ser-2448 by amino acids. Depletion of p70S6 Kinase Expression in Cells Reduces Ser-2448Phosphorylation—To confirm whether p70S6 kinase was responsible forSer-2448 phosphorylation in cells, we used siRNA to down-regulate p70S6 kinaseexpression (Fig. 4).Transfection of HeLa cells with p70S6 kinase-specific siRNA reduced p70S6kinase expression with a corresponding decrease in Ser-2448 phosphorylation,whereas control siRNA-transfected cells were unaffected. In both control andp70S6 kinase siRNA-treated cells, AKT phosphorylation was unaffected. Thesedata provide compelling evidence that p70S6 kinase is responsible for Ser-2448phosphorylation in cells. Phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser-2448 has become a popular biomarker for theactivation state of the PI-3 kinase pathway as well as the activation statusof mTOR(28Altomare D.A. Wang H.Q. Skele K.L.

Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 2053-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).Based on the knowledge that AKT phosphorylates the Ser-2448 site, theoperative assumption is that changes in Ser-2448 phosphorylation reflectalterations in PI-3 kinase activity induced by endogenous factors or bytherapeutic agents. The present findings indicate that the regulation ofSer-2448 phosphorylation is more complex than originally proposed and thatthis phosphorylation event is not obligatorily linked to AKT. We haveconfirmed earlier findings that Ser-2448 phosphorylation iswortmannin-sensitive (18Sekulic A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. CancerRes. 2000; 60: 3504-3513Google Scholar,19Nave B.T. Ouwens D.M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Although the wortmanninresults are consistent with the earlier conclusion that AKT is an effector ofSer-2448 phosphorylation, an equally plausible conclusion is that Ser-2448phosphorylation is sensitive to wortmannin because another PI-3kinase-activated kinase, PDK-1(32Weng Q.P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), is required forphosphorylation of the critical Thr-229 residue in the p70S6 kinase activationloop (33Weng Q.P. Andrabi K.

Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggestthat, at least in the cell types examined in this study, Ser-2448phosphorylation primarily reflects a feedback signal to mTOR from itsdownstream target, p70S6 kinase. As mTOR activity is essential for theactivation of p70S6 kinase, we conclude that Ser-2448 phosphorylation is areasonable indicator of the level of mTOR signaling in cells or tissues. Several lines of evidence support the notion that p70S6 kinase is thedominant kinase responsible for mTOR phosphorylation at Ser-2448 in cells.Previous studies demonstrated that Ser-2448 phosphorylation was stimulated byamino acids, which regulate p70S6 kinase activity, but not AKT(35Reynolds IV, T.H.

For example, overexpression of TSC1 and TSC2decreased Ser-2448 phosphorylation and conversely, RNA interference-mediateddepletion of TSC2 increased Ser-2448 phosphorylation(15Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Rhebstimulates phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase and results in elevated Ser-2448phosphorylation (12Inoki K. Li Y. Xu T. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar).Treatment of cells with 2-deoxyglucose, which mimics glucose deprivation byinhibiting hexokinase, activates the TSC pathway via AMPK, decreases p70S6kinase activity, and results in a concomitant decrease in mTOR Ser-2448phosphorylation (Ref. 9Inoki K. Zhu T.Q. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3034) Google Scholar anddata not shown). Furthermore, the depletion of AKT-1 or AKT-2 isoforms byretrovirus-mediated RNA-interference did not affect mTOR Ser-2448phosphorylation in macrophage colony-stimulating factor-stimulated bone marrowmacrophages (37Sugatani T. Hruska K.A. J.Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3583-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It should benoted that other examples of feedback regulation by p70S6 kinase exist. InDrosophila, it has been recently described that phosphorylation ofthe IRS proteins by p70S6 kinase leads to their degradation(38Harrington L.S. Findlay G.M. Gray A. Tolkacheva T. Wigfield S. Rebholz H. Barnett J. Leslie N.R. Cheng S. Shepherd P.R. Gout I. Downes C.P. Lamb R.F. J.Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Similarly,hyperactivation of the mammalian p70S6 kinase pathway via loss of TSC1 or TSC2results in the inactivation and degradation of IRS proteins, and leads toinsulin resistance (39Shah O.J. Wang Z. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1650-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Our results help to explain the earlier finding that a mTOR Ser-2448 →Ala mutant retains the ability to signal to p70S6 kinase(18Sekulic A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. CancerRes. 2000; 60: 3504-3513Google Scholar). With AKT as the proposedeffector of Ser-2448 phosphorylation, it was difficult to explain why loss ofthe Ser-2448 site failed to disrupt signaling through the AKT → mTOR→ p70S6 kinase pathway. The current results indicate that Ser-2448phosphorylation is a consequence, rather than a cause of p70S6 kinaseactivation. Nonetheless, the functional significance of Ser-2448phosphorylation with regard to mTOR signaling remains elusive. When assayedin vitro, we did not observe any apparent differences in mTOR kinaseactivity with either mTOR Ser-2448 → Ala or Ser-2448 → Glu (a“phosphomimetic” substitution) mutants when compared withwild-type mTOR (data not shown). Furthermore, ectopic expression of eithermTOR Ser-2448 → Ala or Ser-2448 → Glu mutants that also containedthe rapamycin-resistant SI mutation fully supported mTOR-dependent cell sizeand proliferative activity in rapamycin-treated HEK 293 cells (data notshown). However, we note several limitations of this experimental approach.First, rapamycin is now known to inhibit only a subset of mTOR-dependentsignaling functions (22Edinger A.L. Linardic C.M. Chiang G.G. Thompson C.B. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8451-8460PubMed Google Scholar,40Sarbassov dos D. Ali S.M. Kim D.H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M.

Cell.Biol. 2004; 6: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). A second, related caveatis that ectopic expression of any catalytically active, rapamycin-resistantmTOR mutant in the cells confers rapamycin resistance to p70S6 kinase andreconstitutes the phosphorylation of Ser-2448 on the endogenous mTORpolypeptide (data not shown). A definitive evaluation of the functionalconsequences of Ser-2448 mutations will require that the mTOR Ser-2448 →Ala and Ser-2448 → Glu alleles be expressed in cells that completely lackendogenous mTOR. It is now apparent that the mTOR regulation through phosphorylation of the'repressor domain' is more complex than originally thought. In addition toSer-2448 phosphorylation catalyzed by p70S6 kinase and AKT, Thr-2446 isphosphorylated by AMPK (42Cheng S.W. Fryer L.G. Carling D. Shepherd P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15719-15722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation of Thr-2446 and Ser-2448 appears to be mutually exclusive andthe significance of AMPK phosphorylation within this region of mTOR remains tobe determined (42Cheng S.W. Fryer L.G. Carling D. Shepherd P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15719-15722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In summary, we conclude that mTOR phosphorylation at Ser-2448 is notcontrolled directly by AKT but rather occurs in a feedback fashion catalyzedby the downstream target of mTOR, p70S6 kinase. The presence of twojuxtaposed, inter-regulated phosphorylation sites in the mTOR “repressordomain” (18Sekulic A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. CancerRes. 2000; 60: 3504-3513Google Scholar,42Cheng S.W. Fryer L.G. Carling D. Shepherd P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15719-15722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) strongly hints that thesemodifications are functionally significant, although their roles in mTORsignaling remain elusive. Further studies are required to determine whetherfeedback phosphorylation of mTOR by p70S6 kinase amplifies or dampens mTORsignaling in nutrient- or growth factor-stimulated cells.

However, both also have important peripheral actions, including beneficial effects on the ischemic heart and increasing adipose tissue deposition, while ghrelin has direct effects on carbohydrate metabolism. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that functions as a fuel sensor to regulate energy balance at both cellular and whole body levels, and it may mediate the action of anti-diabetic drugs such as metformin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonists.

The beneficial effects of ghrelin on heart function, including reduction of myocyte apoptosis, and its effects on lipogenesis and carbohydrate metabolism, can also be explained by its ability to activate AMPK.

Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) ghrelin treatment increases appetite and body weight, with a direct stimulatory effect on adipose tissue deposition demonstrated in both in vivo and in vitro studies (9Choi K.

It has been suggested that ghrelin favors preservation of lipid stores and the catabolism of carbohydrate-derived fuel, thereby increasing the respiratory quotient (11Tschöp M. Smiley D.L.

Ghrelin levels are high during fasting and in subjects with low body mass index, while low ghrelin levels are observed after food intake and in patients with insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, or polycystic ovarian syndrome (8Korbonits M. Goldstone A.P. Gueorguiev M. Grossman A.B. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2004; 25: 27-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Both cannabinoids and ghrelin have been shown to have beneficial effects on the ischemic heart (13Chang L. Ren Y. Liu X. Li W.G. Yang J. Geng B. Weintraub N.L. Tang C. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2004; 43: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 14Hiley C.R. Ford W.R. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 2004; 79: 187-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that ghrelin and the endocannabinoid system interact, as subanorectic doses of rimonabant can inhibit the orexigenic effect of ghrelin (15Tucci S.A. Rogers E.K. Korbonits M. Kirkham T.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 143: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate a previously unrecognized interaction between cannabinoids and the AMPK system. The AMPK complex is an αβγ heterotrimer that acts as a sensor of cellular energy status (16Hardie D.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5479-5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 17Kahn B.B. Aliquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metabolism. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2308) Google Scholar). It is activated by any stress that depletes cellular ATP, with a concomitant rise in AMP, causing increased phosphorylation of the α subunit on Thr-172 by the upstream kinase, the tumor suppressor serine/threonine kinase LKB1 (18Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carlson M. Carling D. Curr.

Both metformin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonists have been shown to activate AMPK, and it is suggested that this effect is important in the anti-diabetic action of these compounds. As well as being involved in regulating energy balance at the cellular level, AMPK regulates energy intake by mediating the opposing effects of ghrelin and leptin on appetite in the hypothalamus (20Minokoshi Y. Alquier T. Furukawa N. Kim Y.B. Lee A. Xue B. Mu J. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Birnbaum M.J. Stuck B.J. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2004; 428: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 21Andersson U.

We speculated that ghrelin and the endocannabinoids might exert both their central and peripheral effects via AMPK. Here we report a stimulatory effect of both cannabinoids and ghrelin on AMPK in the hypothalamus and in heart muscle, together with a contrasting inhibitory effect in liver and adipose tissue, but no detectable effect on skeletal muscle. Experimental Setup—Male Lister hooded rats (Harlan, Blackthorn, UK) weighing between 220 and 250 g were used; each treatment group consisted of six rats. For i.c.v. treatment the lateral ventricle was cannulated, and the test substances or vehicle was injected in a volume of 5 μl/rat. Animals were killed 1 h later, the brain was dissected, and the hypothalamus was removed as a 2-mm thick coronal section from -2 to -4 from Bregma and from the supraoptic decussation to the dorsal end of the lower part of the third ventricle. Tissue samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. For the i.c.v. studies rat ghrelin (Tocris Cookson Ltd., Avonmouth, UK) was injected at a dose of 1 μg/rat, desacyl ghrelin at a dose of 5 μg/rat (a kind gift from M. Kojima, Kurume, Japan), and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) at a dose of 5 μg/rat (Tocris), which was shown previously to increase food intake in rats (24Kirkham T.C. Williams C.M. Fezza F. Di Marzo V. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). For intraperitoneal injection, doses of 100 μg/rat ghrelin and 2 mg/kg Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; Tocris) were used, in a volume of 1 ml/kg. Ghrelin and cannabinoid doses were chosen for their established effectiveness in earlier studies to promote eating (24Kirkham T.C. Williams C.M. Fezza F. Di Marzo V. Br. J.

Whole heart, liver, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and whole brain or hypothalamus were immediately removed and placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. All injections were performed between 09.00 and 10.00. The experimental procedures carried out in this study were in compliance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Immunoprecipitate Kinase Assays for AMPK and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitate kinase assays for AMPK, and analysis of Western blots using anti-peptide antibodies, have been described previously (19Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue samples were homogenized and the protein content was determined (BCA assay, Pierce). AMPK activity in the immune complex was determined by phosphorylation of SAMS, a synthetic peptide substrate of AMPK. 300 μg of protein was immunoprecipitated using protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences, Bucks, UK) and a mixture of α1 and α2 AMPK antibodies (2.5 μg/sample of each) (19Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitate was divided into three aliquots, and two were assayed for AMPK activity with a reaction solution containing 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1 μl of 100 mm cold ATP, 0.25 μl of 1 m MgCl2, 10 μl of 1 mm AMP, and 10 μl of SAMS 0.1 mm (Upsate Biotechnology, Dundee, Scotland) and the third aliquot with the same mixture except with Hepes-Brij buffer replaced by SAMS. The reaction was performed on a shaker for 20 min at 30 °C, and samples were pipetted onto paper squares (P81; Upstate Biotechnology). The reaction was stopped by placing the paper squares into 1% phosphoric acid, and after repeated rinsing the activity was counted using a scintillation counter. For separate α1 and α2 AMPK activity determination, 600 μg of protein was used and immunoprecipitation was performed sequentially for α1 and α2 AMPK. AMPK activity was calculated using the difference of the counts between SAMS containing and SAMS negative samples and expressed as nanomoles of ATP incorporated per minute per milligram of sample peptide. Western blotting was performed running 10-20 μg of protein on a 7.5 or 10% SDS-gel (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK) and transferring it to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; pore size 0.45 μm; Millipore UK Ltd., Watford, UK). Membranes were incubated with the primary antibody anti-phosphorylated AMPK (pAMPK) antibody (which recognizes the AMPK pan-α subunit phosphorylated at Thr-172), at a concentration of 1:1000 (19Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with anti-phospho acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) antibody (1:1000, Upstate Biotechnology) in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween overnight at 4 °C. To achieve cleaner bands, membranes for pAMPK were preincubated with unphosphorylated PT172 protein (27Sugden C. Crawford R.M. Halford N.G. Hardie D.G. Plant J. 1999; 19: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) for 60 min before incubation with the pAMPK antibody. Donkey anti-sheep IgG horseradish peroxidase, 1:2000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for secondary antibody. After stripping the membrane total AMPK (mixture of primary antibody α1 and α2 AMPK at 0.2 μg/ml for total AMPK (19Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), secondary donkey anti-sheep IgG horseradish peroxidase antibody, 1:2000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (primary antibody 1:2000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody 1:10,000 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark)) or β-actin (primary monoclonal antibody 1:5000 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), secondary goat anti-mouse antibody 1:10,000 (Dako)) antibodies were used to normalize for equal loading, and densitometric readings of the resulting bands were evaluated using the Scientific Imaging system (Eastman Kodak Co.). In Situ Hybridization—Quantitative in situ hybridization for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) was performed as described (28Nogueiras R. Tovar S. Mitchell S.E. Rayner D.V. Archer Z.A. Dieguez C. Williams L.M. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2552-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A CB1 cDNA fragment was cloned from mouse hypothalamic cDNA. The 422-bp fragment of CB1 was amplified using primers 5′-TGGGCAGCCTGTTCCTCACG-3′ and 5′-GGGTTTTGGCCAGCCTAATGTCC-3′ (GenBank accession number NM_007726) with 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. DNA fragments were ligated into PGEM-T cloning vector (Promega, Southampten, UK), and transformed into JM 109 cells (Promega), and automated sequencing was performed to verify the sequence. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Conover-Inman comparison. Significance was taken at p < 0.05. The data are expressed as means ± S.E., n = 6 in each treatment group. As both cannabinoids and ghrelin have central orexigenic effects, we first studied the hypothalamus. While leptin, which is associated with appetite suppression, inhibits α2 AMPK activity in the arcuate and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (20Minokoshi Y. Alquier T. Furukawa N. Kim Y.B. Lee A. Xue B. Mu J. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Birnbaum M.J. Stuck B.J. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2004; 428: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar), ghrelin has been shown to stimulate whole hypothalamic AMPK activity after peripheral administration (21Andersson U. Filipsson K. Abbott C.R. Woods A. Smith K. Bloom S.R. Carling D. Small C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12005-12008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). In the current study using a functional AMPK assay we observed that in whole hypothalamus total AMPK activity increased to 153 ± 8% of control after central 2-AG injection and to 156 ± 26% after i.c.v. ghrelin injection (Fig. 1A). Similar responses were also seen after peripheral injection of THC (174 ± 31% of control) and ghrelin (177 ± 12%, Fig. 1B). This increase in AMPK activity was, as expected, associated with an increase in Thr-172 phosphorylation of AMPK (Fig. 1, C and D), while total AMPK levels did not change in either of the tissues studied. One of the best established downstream targets of AMPK (and therefore a good marker for AMPK activation) is ACC. Phosphorylation by AMPK at the equivalent sites on the two isoforms ACC1 and ACC2 causes inhibition of fatty acid synthesis and stimulation of fatty acid oxidation, respectively (17Kahn B.B. Aliquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metabolism. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2308) Google Scholar). Using an antibody that detects phosphorylation of both isoforms, we detected an increase in phosphorylation of ACC after central cannabinoid and ghrelin treatment in the hypothalamus (Fig. 1E). We and others have described important peripheral effects of desacyl ghrelin (see Ref. 8Korbonits M. Goldstone A.P. Gueorguiev M. Grossman A.B. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2004; 25: 27-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar and references therein), although this form cannot activate the full-length, functionally active GHS-R1a receptor. In this study no change was observed in hypothalamic AMPK activity (Fig. 1F) or AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 1G) after i.c.v. administration of desacyl ghrelin. Intracerebroventricular 2-AG treatment stimulated CB1 mRNA expression in the ventromedial nucleus to 132 ± 5% of control, while CB1 was not detected in the arcuate nucleus. Ghrelin inhibited GHS-R expression to 55 ± 6% and 58 ± 6% of the control in the ventromedial and arcuate nuclei (Fig. 2, A-C). These nuclei were included in the whole hypothalamic tissue samples assayed for AMPK activity and pAMPK content. Cannabinoids and ghrelin markedly stimulated AMPK in the heart: total AMPK activity was increased to 388 ± 94% and 273 ± 17% of control, respectively (Fig. 3A). Specific assays for the α1 and α2 isoforms of AMPK showed similar activities at base line, although the increase after THC and ghrelin treatment was greater for α2 (Fig. 3B), which could be explained by the greater sensitivity of α2 AMPK to AMP (29Salt I. Celler J.W. Hawley S.A. Prescott A. Woods A. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting showed an increase in phosphorylation of the α subunit to 372 ± 25% of control in response to THC and to 373 ± 40% after ghrelin treatment (Fig. 3C). In contrast to the hypothalamus and myocardium, in liver tissue we found strong inhibitory effects of THC (62 ± 11% of control) and ghrelin (38 ± 7%) on AMPK activity (Fig. 4A) and on phosphorylation of Thr-172 of AMPK (74 ± 12% and 55 ± 16%, respectively; Fig. 4B). We also observed an inhibitory effect of endocannabinoids (75 ± 6% of control) and ghrelin (72 ± 6%) on combined subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue AMPK activity (p < 0.05). While the AMPK activity response was similar in the two adipose tissue types (Fig. 5A), more marked decrease was observed in visceral adipose tissue pAMPK content compared with subcutaneous adipose tissue: phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172 was 72 ± 10% of control in response to THC and 70 ± 8% in response to ghrelin in visceral adipose tissue and 108 ± 7% and 123 ± 23% of control in subcutaneous adipose tissue, respectively (Fig. 5B). In visceral adipose tissue the relative contribution of the α1 isoenzyme was more pronounced than that of the α2 isoenzyme (α1 THC 89 ± 11% of control, ghrelin 79 ± 9% p < 0.05; α2 THC 91 ± 11% of control, ghrelin 102 ± 9%, not significant) in accordance with previous data (30Lihn A.S. Jessen N. Pedersen S.B. Lund S. Richelsen B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). No effects of cannabinoids or ghrelin were observed on skeletal muscle AMPK, either on activity or phosphorylation of Thr-172 (Fig. 6, A and B).Fig. 4Ghrelin (100 μg, intraperitoneal) and THC (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) inhibited liver AMPK activity and Thr-172 phosphorylation of AMPK (mean ± S.E., n = 6 rats/group).

We propose that this effect of cannabinoids on AMPK represents an important pathway which mediates their orexigenic effect. As both ghrelin and endocannabinoids are synthesized in peripheral tissues (7Gnanapavan S. Kola B. Bustin S.A. Morris D.G. McGee P. Fairclough P. Bhattacharya S. Carpenter R. Grossman A.B. Korbonits M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 2988-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 31Gomez R. Navarro M. Ferrer B. Trigo J.M. Bilbao A. Del Arco I. Cippitelli A. Nava F. Piomelli D. Rodriguez d.F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9612-9617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we suggest that the effects we have observed after peripheral administration are physiologically important. The role of AMPK in appetite regulation has also been demonstrated using the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside, the fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75 (32Kim E.K. Miller I. Aja S. Landree L.E. Pinn M. McFadden J. Kuhajda F.P. Moran T.H. Ronnett G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19970-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and most recently, glucose (33Lee K. Li B. Xi X. Suh Y. Martin R.J. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We predict that other appetite-modulating agents will also have effects on hypothalamic AMPK. There is mounting evidence that endocannabinoids may play important roles in limiting damage to the heart and circulation in shock and in myocardial infarction (34Russell III, R.R. Li J. Coven D.L. Pypaert M. Zechner C. Palmeri M. Giordano F.J. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. Young L.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 35Hardie D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cannabinoids reduce infarct size associated with ischemia/reperfusion in rat isolated hearts, and the endogenous release of cannabinoids has been implicated in survival after coronary artery occlusion in rats via the CB1 receptor (14Hiley C.R. Ford W.R. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 2004; 79: 187-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36Joyeux M. Arnaud C. Godin-Ribuot D. Demenge P. Lamontagne D. Ribuot C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 55: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). AMPK is activated by ischemia in the heart, leading to increased glucose uptake and phosphorylation of the heart-specific 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, which activates production of ATP by glycolysis under anaerobic conditions. Activation of AMPK during ischemia (37Kudo N. Gillespie J.G. Kung L. Witters L.A. Schulz R. Clanachan A.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) also lowers malonyl-CoA and thus increases ATP generation via fatty acid oxidation during reperfusion (38Altarejos J.Y. Taniguchi M. Clanachan A.S. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 183-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recent results using mice expressing a dominant negative AMPK mutant in the heart suggest that the presence of AMPK protects cardiac ATP levels and reduces infarct size and damage to myocytes during ischemia (34Russell III, R.R. Li J. Coven D.L. Pypaert M. Zechner C. Palmeri M. Giordano F.J. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. Young L.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The lack of fat tissue cytokine adiponectin (known to stimulate AMPK activity) results in pressure overload and cardiac hypertrophy in “knock-out” animals, and this could be reversed by the reintroduction of adiponectin (39Shibata R. Ouchi N. Ito M. Kihara S. Shiojima I. Pimentel D.R. Kumada M. Sato K. Schiekofer S. Ohashi K. Funahashi T. Colucci W.S. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that long term cannabinoid treatment improves atherosclerosis via a CB2-mediated effect on immune cells (40Steffens S. Veillard N.R. Arnaud C. Pelli G. Burger F. Staub C. Zimmer A. Frossard J.L. Mach F. Nature. 2005; 434: 782-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Our present data suggest that the beneficial effects of cannabinoids could be mediated via activation of AMPK, although excessive activation of AMPK may be deleterious to the heart (38Altarejos J.Y. Taniguchi M. Clanachan A.S. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 183-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 41Arad M. Benson D.W. Perez-Atayde A.R. McKenna W.J.

We also found a large increase in the phosphorylation and activity of AMPK activity in response to ghrelin. There have been several previous studies describing the beneficial effects of ghrelin and its synthetic analogues on cardiovascular function (8Korbonits M. Goldstone A.P. Gueorguiev M. Grossman A.B. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2004; 25: 27-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 13Chang L. Ren Y. Liu X. Li W.G. Yang J. Geng B. Weintraub N.L. Tang C. J. Cardiovasc.

These seem to be direct effects that are independent of growth hormone release, as positive results were obtained both in hypophysectomized rats and in in vitro studies on embryonic (H9c2) and adult (HL-1) heart muscle cell lines (43Baldanzi G. Filigheddu N. Cutrupi S. Catapano F. Bonissoni S. Fubini A. Malan D. Baj G. Granata R. Broglio F. Papotti M. Surico N. Bussolino F. Isgaard J. Deghenghi R. Sinigaglia F. Prat M. Muccioli G. Ghigo E."

https://openalex.org/W2032261439,"When added to living cells, sterols such as cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol block the lateral movement of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) into COPII-coated vesicles on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and thereby prevent the SREBPs from reaching the Golgi complex for processing to the mature forms that activate cholesterol synthesis. Sorting of SREBPs into COPII vesicles is mediated by Sar1 and the coat proteins Sec23 and Sec24. Here, we explore the mechanism of sterol inhibition in vitro through use of protein pull-down assays. We show that addition of cholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol to microsomal membranes in vitro blocks Sar1-dependent binding of the Sec23/24 complex to Scap, the SREBP escort protein. This in vitro inhibition is dependent on the presence of Insig-1, an ER resident protein that is necessary for sterol-mediated inhibition of Scap/SREBP transport in intact cells. Sec23/24 binding to Scap requires the hexapeptide sequence MELADL located in a cytoplasmic loop of Scap. This hexapeptide acts as a sterol-regulated ER sorting signal. These studies define the biochemical parameters responsible for regulated sorting of an ER membrane protein into COPII-coated vesicles. When added to living cells, sterols such as cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol block the lateral movement of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) into COPII-coated vesicles on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and thereby prevent the SREBPs from reaching the Golgi complex for processing to the mature forms that activate cholesterol synthesis. Sorting of SREBPs into COPII vesicles is mediated by Sar1 and the coat proteins Sec23 and Sec24. Here, we explore the mechanism of sterol inhibition in vitro through use of protein pull-down assays.

How to Block Cholesterol Synthesis Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 280Issue 28PreviewWhen added to living cells, sterols can block the synthesis of cholesterol and other lipids by preventing several membrane-embedded transcription factors from being transported to the Golgi complex where they are activated. These sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi in a process that requires them to form complexes with the escort protein Scap. Subsequent clustering of the Scap/SREBP complex into transport vesicles involves binding to the coat proteins Sec23/24, which is mediated by the small GTPase Sar1. Full-Text PDF Open Access In mammalian cells the synthesis of cholesterol and other lipids is governed by the lateral movement of a membrane-embedded protein complex into coated vesicles that bud from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; TK, thymidine kinase; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HSV, herpes simplex virus; GMP-PNP, guanyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate. and move to the Golgi. This membrane sorting event is blocked selectively by cholesterol and related oxysterols, and it constitutes the only known instance in which ER-to-Golgi transport of a protein is regulated selectively by a small molecule (1Nohturfft A.

U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11694-11699Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). An understanding of this regulatory mechanism is therefore essential to a general understanding of regulated ER-to-Golgi transport as well as to an understanding of lipid metabolism. The crucial components of the sterol-regulated protein complex are sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are membrane-embedded transcription factors that are synthesized on ER membranes (3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). SREBPs are anchored to ER membranes by virtue of two transmembrane helices. To activate lipid synthesis, the SREBPs must be transported to the Golgi where proteases release the active domains that enter the nucleus. ER-to-Golgi transport requires that the SREBPs form complexes with Scap, an escort protein that contains eight membrane-spanning helices (4Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In sterol-depleted cells, the Scap/SREBP complex clusters laterally with other proteins into COPII-coated vesicles that bud from the ER (5Nohturfft A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Scheek S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Like other proteins that cluster into COPII-coated vesicles (6Lee M.C.S. Miller E.A. Goldberg J. Orci L. Schekman R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 2004; 20: 87-123Crossref Scopus (706) Google Scholar), clustering of the Scap/SREBP complex is initiated by Sar1, a small GTPase that binds to ER membranes in a GTP-dependent fashion (2Espenshade P.J. Li W.-P. Yabe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11694-11699Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Sar1 recruits a heterodimeric protein called Sec23/24, and this recruits another heterodimer, Sec13/31, which forms the coat of the COPII coated vesicle, thereby permitting vesicle budding. Using in vitro binding assays with purified COPII components, Espenshade et al. (2Espenshade P.J. Li W.-P. Yabe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11694-11699Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Sec23/24 binds to the Scap/SREBP complex in a fashion dependent upon Sar1-GTP. This binding did not occur when membranes were isolated from intact cells that were preincubated with sterols, a condition in which the Scap/SREBP complex does not move to the Golgi (5Nohturfft A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Scheek S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To gain a molecular understanding of the mechanism by which sterols block the binding of COPII proteins to the Scap/SREBP complex, it is necessary to establish an in vitro system in which binding can be blocked by addition of sterols to isolated membranes, rather than to preincubated cells. The feasibility of such an assay is increased by the recognition that sterol-mediated inhibition of Scap/SREBP transport requires Insigs, which are resident proteins of the ER that have an anchor function. Addition of sterols to intact cells or to isolated membranes triggers the binding of Scap to Insigs, an event that is required for sterol-mediated inhibition of Scap/SREBP transport (7Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The Insig requirement was first evident when the membrane domain of Scap was overexpressed in cells by transfection. Under these conditions the endogenous Insigs became saturated, and sterols no longer blocked ER-to-Golgi transport (7Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29881-29886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This deficiency was overcome by overexpression of Insig-1 or Insig-2 (7Yang T. Espenshade P.J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The Insig requirement was confirmed when Insig-deficient mutant CHO cells were shown to be resistant to sterol-mediated inhibition of Scap/SREBP transport (10Sever N. Lee P.C.W. Song B.-L. Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43136-43147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we demonstrate that sterols can block the Sar1-dependent binding of COPII proteins to the Scap/SREBP complex when added to isolated membranes in vitro and that this inhibition requires Insigs. Through mutagenesis studies, we identify a hexapeptide sequence (MELADL) in a cytoplasmic loop of Scap that is required for COPII binding in vitro and for ER-to-Golgi movement of the Scap/SREBP complex in intact cells. These studies demonstrate that cell membranes contain all of the components required for sterol-mediated regulation of Scap/SREBP transport and thereby for transcriptional regulation of lipid synthesis in animal cells.

GST-Sar1 and FLAG-Sec23/His-Sec24 were each passed through a PD-10 column equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.2, 250 mm sorbitol, 70 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium EGTA, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitor mixture (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 6 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal). All purified proteins were frozen quickly in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for up to 2 months without loss of activity. Preparation of Hamster Microsomal Membranes—Microsomal membranes from SRD-13A cells were isolated as described previously (1Nohturfft A. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) with the following buffer modifications. Cells were lysed in buffer B (50 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 6.8, 250 mm sorbitol, 10 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) plus protease inhibitor mixture. Microsomal membranes (16,000 × g pellet) were washed and resuspended in buffer A with protease inhibitor mixture. GST-Sar1 Pull-down Assay for Measuring Binding of COPII Proteins Binding to Scap—The assay was carried out as described previously (2Espenshade P.J. Li W.-P. Yabe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a bile acid-activated nuclear receptor. Hepatic FXR expression is regulated by glucose and insulin. Here we identify a role for FXR in the control of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism. When submitted to a controlled fasting-refeeding schedule, FXR-/- mice displayed an accelerated response to high carbohydrate refeeding with an accelerated induction of glycolytic and lipogenic genes and a more pronounced repression of gluconeogenic genes. Plasma insulin and glucose levels were lower in FXR-/- mice upon refeeding the high-carbohydrate diet. These alterations were paralleled by decreased hepatic glycogen content. Hepatic insulin sensitivity was unchanged in FXR-/- mice. Treatment of isolated primary hepatocytes with a synthetic FXR agonist attenuated glucose-induced mRNA expression as well as promoter activity of L-type pyruvate kinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, and Spot14. Moreover, activated FXR interfered negatively with the carbohydrate response elements regions. These results identify a novel role for FXR as a modulator of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism.

The liver plays a major role in maintaining plasma glucose homeostasis by controlling a delicate balance between hepatic glucose uptake/utilization and hepatic glucose production. In the fed state, the liver stores energy from glucose by synthesizing glycogen and fat. Conversely, when plasma glucose concentrations decrease during fasting, the liver produces glucose by the glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic pathways. This fasting-refeeding transition involves a highly coordinated adaptation of the expression of genes encoding key metabolic enzymes that is orchestrated by hormones and nutrients. In the fed state, insulin and glucose act in concert to promote the expression of genes controlling glucose utilization and fatty acid (FA) 1The abbreviations used are: FA, fatty acid; FAS, fatty acid synthase; LPK, L-type pyruvate kinase; Acc-1, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase-1; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c; ChoRE, carbohydrate-response elements; ChREBP, carbohydrate response element-binding protein; HNF4α, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; BA, bile acid; SHP, small heterodimer partner; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-coactivator 1α; IR, insulin receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; 8-CPT-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine-3′-5′-cyclic monophosphate.1The abbreviations used are: FA, fatty acid; FAS, fatty acid synthase; LPK, L-type pyruvate kinase; Acc-1, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase-1; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c; ChoRE, carbohydrate-response elements; ChREBP, carbohydrate response element-binding protein; HNF4α, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; BA, bile acid; SHP, small heterodimer partner; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-coactivator 1α; IR, insulin receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; 8-CPT-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine-3′-5′-cyclic monophosphate. synthesis, including glucokinase (hexokinase type IV), L-type pyruvate kinase (Lpk), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase-1 (Acc-1), and fatty acid synthase (Fas) (1Girard J. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). A primary action of insulin appears to be the induction of glucokinase expression, which catalyzes the first step of intracellular hepatic glucose metabolism and signaling (2Dentin R. Pegorier J.P.

The sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (Srebp-1c) has emerged as a major mediator of this insulin action (3Foufelle F. Ferre P. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 377-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). On the other hand, glucose also directly affects gene transcription via carbohydrate-response elements (ChoREs) that have been identified in both glycolytic (Lpk) and lipogenic (Acc, Fas, and Spot14) genes (4Shih H.M.

Recently, the transcription factor carbohydrate response element-binding protein (Chrebp) was identified based on its ability to bind the ChoRE of the Lpk promoter (6Yamashita H. Takenoshita M.

Horton J.D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7281-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Additionally, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) acts in concert with proteins that bind to ChoREs to elicit maximal Lpk promoter activity (8Vaulont S. Puzenat N. Levrat F. Cognet M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9Bergot M.O. Diaz-Guerra M.J. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the fasting state, the production of glucose by the liver is crucial for tissues unable to use FA as a source of energy, such as the brain and red blood cells. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck) is considered to be a rate-controlling enzyme of gluconeogenesis (10Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Pepck activity by insulin is considered an important physiological mechanism to repress hepatic glucose production in the early post-prandial state (11Granner D. Andreone T. Sasaki K. Beale E. Nature. 1983; 305: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor that is activated by bile acids (BAs) (12Wang H. Chen J.

FXR regulates BA synthesis from cholesterol by controlling the expression of several key enzymes (15Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol.

FXR also influences blood lipids because FXR-deficient (FXR-/-) mice display elevated serum levels of triglycerides and cholesterol (17Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that FXR expression in rat liver is regulated by glucose and insulin (18Duran-Sandoval D. Mautino G. Martin G. Percevault F. Barbier O. Fruchart J.C. Kuipers F. Staels B. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), suggesting that this nuclear receptor may also play a role in carbohydrate metabolism. In accordance with this hypothesis, FXR has been shown to regulate hepatic Pepck expression (19Stayrook K.R. Bramlett K.S. Savkur R.S. Ficorilli J. Cook T. Christe M.E. Michael L.F. Burris T.P.

To address this issue, we performed fasting-refeeding experiments in FXR wild-type (FXR+/+) and FXR-/- mice. Our results indicate that FXR interferes with glycolytic and lipogenic pathways in liver by controlling, among other genes, Lpk, Acc-1, and Spot14 transcription. These data suggest that FXR also functions as a molecular modulator of hepatic carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, which uncovers a novel physiological response to the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Materials—The LPK promoter plasmids -3014LPKpGL3 and -184LPKpGL3 were constructed by cloning the fragments -3014 to +4 or -184 to +4 relative to the transcriptional start site of rat Lpk, respectively, into pGL3 vector (Promega). L3L4-LPK-TkpGL3 was constructed by cloning 4 copies of fragment -168 to -146 of rat Lpk into TkpGL3 vector. pCDNA3-FXR and FXRE-pTALuc plasmids were kindly provided by Prof. P. Young. ACC-1-pGL3 and (ChoRE)x2-Spot14-pGL3 were kindly provided by Prof. H. Towle.

Rabbit polyclonal phospho-Akt (Ser473 and Thr308) and Akt antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Animals and Diets—All studies were approved by the institutional review boards for the care and use of experimental animals. Homozygous FXR-deficient (FXR-/-) mice (17Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M.

For the fasting-refeeding experiments, 8-12-week-old female mice were divided into three groups: non-fasted (NF), fasted (F), and refed (RF). The non-fasted group was fed standard chow diet ad libitum and killed at 9.00 a.m. The fasted group was fasted during 24 h (from 9:00 a.m to 9:00 a.m) before sacrifice, whereas the refed group was subjected to an additional refeeding with a high carbohydrate/low fat diet (Harlan Teklad TD88122, Madison, WI) for 6 or 24 h. The high carbohydrate diet contained 48.6% sucrose, 16.6% corn starch, 22.2% casein, 5.5% cellulose, 1% corn oil, 3.9% mineral, 1% vitamins. Blood and Tissue Sampling—Plasma glucose concentrations were determined using Glucotrend 2 (Roche Diagnostics); plasma insulin levels using a solid phase two-site enzyme immunoassay (Mercodia AB, Sweden); plasma triglyceride, free fatty acids, lactate, and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations using commercially available kits (BioMerieux, France; Wako Chemicals, Germany; Sigma Diagnostics; Randox Laboratories, France). Liver triglyceride, glycogen concentrations, and in vivo hepatic triglyceride production were measured as described (22van Dijk T.H. van der Sluijs F.H. Wiegman C.H. Baller J.F. Gustafson L.A.

Hyperinsulinemic Euglycemic Clamp—Male FXR-/- and age-matched wild-type mice (n = 5-6 mice/group) were equipped with a permanent catheter in the right atrium via the jugular vein and fasted during 9 h before the start of the experiment, as previously described (22van Dijk T.H. van der Sluijs F.H.

In Vivo Insulin Stimulation and Analysis of Insulin Signaling—Mice were starved during 24 h, anesthetized with pentobarbital, and injected with 1 IU/kg of human insulin (Actrapid, Novo Nordisk) into the portal vein. Livers were removed 5 min after injection and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Liver proteins were extracted in lysis buffer (20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter EDTA, 30 mmol/liter sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/liter sodium orthovanadate). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies in the presence of protein A-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were washed in lysis buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were subjected to immunodetection with the indicated antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were revealed using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Primary Hepatocytes—Rat primary hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion from livers of Wistar rats and cultured as previously described (18Duran-Sandoval D. Mautino G. Martin G. Percevault F. Barbier O. Fruchart J.C. Kuipers F. Staels B. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of fed mice by a modification of the collagenase method (24Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3625) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers from control and FXR-/- mice were perfused with Hanks' balanced salt solution (KCl, 5.4 mm; KH2PO4, 0.45 mm; NaCl, 138 mm; NaHCO3, 4.2 mm; Na2HPO4, 0.34 mm; glucose, 5.5 mm; HEPES, 1 m; EGTA, 50 mm; CaCl2, 50 mm; pH 7.4) at a rate of 5 ml/min via portal vein before addition of collagenase (Sigma) (0.025%) was added. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion test and was always higher than 60%. Hepatocytes were cultured as a monolayer in serumfree William's E medium (Invitrogen, France) supplemented with 2 mmol/liter glutamine, 25 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 nmol/liter dexamethasone (Soludecadron, MSD), 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 2% (v/v) Ultrocer G (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. After overnight culture, cells were incubated for the indicated time in fresh culture medium supplemented with different glucose or insulin concentrations as indicated. When indicated, GW4064 (5 μmol/liter) or Me2SO were added 12 h before the culture medium change. RNA Extraction and Quantitative PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from livers or primary hepatocytes using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA (3 μg) was reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (200 units; Invitrogen). mRNA were quantified by real-time quantitative PCR on a MX-4000 apparatus (Stratagene) using specific primers: Lpk forward: 5′-CGTGCGAGTGTGGCTCAACTGACCC-3′; Lpk reverse: 5′-GTCGTCAATGTAGATGCGGCCCCCC-3′; Acc-1 forward: 5′-AGGGCAAAGGGACTGGTGTTCAGAT-3′; Acc-1 reverse: 5′-GCCAACGGAGATGGTTCATCCATTA-3′; Fas forward: 5′-GGTATGTCCGGGAAATTGCC-3′; Fas reverse: 5′-ATTGTGTGTGCCTGCTTGGG-3′; Pepck forward: 5′-AGCCTCGACAGCCTGCCCCAGG-3′; Pepck reverse 5′-CCAGTTGTTGACCAAAGGCTTTT-3′; Fxr forward: 5′-CCAACCTGGGTTTCTACCC-3′; Fxr reverse: 5′-CACACAGCTCATCCCCTTT-3′; Shp forward: 5′-ACTGCCTGTGCCAGCAACAC-3′; Shp reverse: 5′-AGCCGTCGCTGATCCTCATG-3′; Srebp-1c forward: 5′-GTTACTCGAGCCTGCCTTCAGG-3′; Srebp-1c reverse: 5′-CAAGCTTTGGACCTGGGTGTG-3′; Chrebp forward: 5′-CTGGGGACCTAAACAGGAGC-3′; Chrebp reverse: 5′-GAAGCCACCCTATAGCTCCC-3′; Pgc-1α forward: 5′-TTCTGGGTGGATTGAAGTGGTG-3′; Pgc-1α reverse: 5′-TGTCAGTGCATCAAATGAGGGC-3′; Foxo-1 forward: 5′-TCGTCGCGCCGCAACGCGTG-3′; Foxo-1 reverse: 5′-CATCCACTCGTAGATCTGCG-3′; Hnf4α forward: 5′-GGCAATGACACGTCCCCATCTG-3′; Hnf4α reverse: 5′-GCCTGCAGTAACGACACTGGTTCC-3′; S14 forward: 5′-CGGTACTCGGCTGTGGTGCGG-3′; S14 reverse: 5′-GGTGAAGTAGGTATAGAGATCGG-3′; Glc-6-Pase forward: 5′-GAAGGCCAAGAGATGGTGTGA-3′; Glc-6-Pase reverse: 5′-TGCAGCTCTTGCGGTACATG-3′; 36B4 forward: 5′-CATGCTCAACATCTCCCCCTTCTCC-3′; 36B4 reverse: 5′-GGGAAGGTGTAATCCGTCTCCACAG-3′.

Diabetes. 2004; 53: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Transfection Assays—Primary rat hepatocytes were transfected overnight in a 24-well plate using the JetPEI reagent kit (Qiagen) with the indicated reporter plasmids (50-250 ng), pCMV-β-galactosidase (10 ng), and pCDNA3-FXR (30 ng). Cells were incubated for 24 h in fresh culture medium supplemented with vehicle (Me2SO) or GW4064 as indicated. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described (25Claudel T. Sturm E. Duez H. Torra I.P. Sirvent A. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Dallongeville J. Hum D.W. Kuipers F. Staels B. J. Clin.

In vitro FXR, RXRα, and HNF4α proteins were produced using the TnT kit (Promega). Proteins were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in electrophoretic mobility shift assay buffer and for a further 30 min at 4 °C after addition of the probe, prior to electrophoresis. For supershift experiments, anti-FXR antibody (0.2 μg, C-20; Santa Cruz) was preincubated for 20 min in the binding buffer before addition of the probe. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was assessed using analysis of variance followed by unpaired t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Fxr Deficiency Accelerates the Expression Response of Genes Involved in Hepatic Glycolysis and de Novo Lipogenesis upon Refeeding—To determine whether Fxr deficiency interferes with the physiological control of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism in vivo, FXR+/+ and FXR-/- mice were subjected to a 24-h fasting period followed by refeeding with a high carbohydrate diet (HCHO). There was no difference in food intake between genotypes (data not shown). Whereas plasma glucose levels were comparable between both strains during the non-fasted and fasted states, plasma glucose concentrations were significantly lower at 6 h after refeeding in FXR-/- mice (Table I). These differences were not associated to altered intestinal glucose absorption in FXR-/- mice, because an early blood glucose excursion curve after an oral glucose tolerance test was similar between FXR-/- and FXR+/+ (data not shown). Insulin concentrations in non-fasted and fasted states were not different between the two genotypes. However, plasma insulin levels were significantly lower in FXR-/- mice upon refeeding, reflecting either a pancreatic adaptative response to the relative hypoglycemia or an increased insulin sensitivity. Lactate concentrations were higher in non-fasted and refed FXR-/- mice, suggesting an increase of glucose utilization in these animals. In contrast, plasma concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate were not statistically different between both groups. Whereas plasma FFA concentrations were slightly higher in FXR-/- during the non-fasted state, FFAs did not differ in both fasted and refed states between both genotypes.Table IPlasma parameters in FXR−/− and FXR+/+ mice submitted to a controlled fasting-refeeding scheduleFXR+/+FXR−/−NF (n = 12)F (n = 13)RF (n = 8)NF (n = 14)F (n = 15)RF (n = 7)Glucose (mg/dL)161 ± 4103 ± 4177 ± 7157 ± 4100 ± 5148 ± 12*Insulin (μg/liter)1.24 ± 0.270.26 ± 0.041.14 ± 0.171.57 ± 0.400.18 ± 0.030.59 ± 0.10*Lactate (mg/dL)288 ± 31230 ± 17413 ± 37427 ± 56*163 ± 18*553 ± 55*β-Hydroxybutyrate (mmol/liter)0.13 ± 0.021.96 ± 0.110.30 ± 0.070.22 ± 0.072.17 ± 0.180.16 ± 0.05Free fatty acid (mmol/liter)0.52 ± 0.031.09 ± 0.060.41 ± 0.130.82 ± 0.06*1.26 ± 0.110.38 ± 0.08 Open table in a new tab To evaluate whether FXR plays a role in hepatic glucose metabolism, mRNA levels of several key enzymes of glycolysis, lipogenesis, and gluconeogenesis were measured. Hepatic mRNA levels of Lpk, a major enzyme of the glycolytic pathway, increased more rapidly in FXR-/- than in FXR+/+ mice in response to refeeding (Fig. 1A), being approximately 3-fold higher in FXR-/- after 6 h refeeding. However, the maximal increase of Lpk mRNA obtained after 24 h of refeeding did not differ between the two genotypes. On the other hand, the expression of glucokinase was not significantly different between both strains (data not shown). In the absence of Fxr, increased glycolysis may direct substrate flow toward hepatic de novo lipogenesis, because both Acc-1 and Fas mRNAs were induced more rapidly upon refeeding (Fig. 1, B and C). Concerning the gluconeogenesis pathway, the expression of Pepck appeared to be more rapidly down-regulated upon refeeding in FXR-/- mice, being already returned to its basal value after 6 h of refeeding (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the expression of the catalytic subunit of glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase) did not differ between both strains (data not shown). To determine the metabolic consequences of Fxr deficiency in the liver in vivo, glycogen and TG contents were measured after fasting-refeeding. Liver glycogen content was significantly reduced in both fed and refed FXR-/- mice (Fig. 2A). Hepatic expression of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase, two key enzymes of glycogen metabolism, were similar in both groups (data not shown). As previously described, FXR-/- mice displayed a higher liver TG content in the nonfasted state. Nevertheless, hepatic TG content did not differ after 6 (Fig. 2B) and 24 h (data not shown) of refeeding in both strains. Under fasting conditions, however, hepatic TG concentrations rose to a similar extent in FXR-/- and FXR+/+ mice. Therefore, hepatic TG concentrations followed the plasma FFA increase during fasting (Table I), likely reflecting the changes in adipose tissue lipolysis. As expected (17Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar), plasma TG concentrations were increased in FXR-/- mice in the non-fasted state (Fig. 2C). Whereas plasma TG concentrations decreased to a similar level in the two groups during fasting, they were significantly higher in FXR-/- mice upon refeeding. Plasm TG concentrations in FXR-/- mice upon refeeding is associated with increased export, because hepatic very low density lipoprotein production was significantly increased in FXR-/- mice after 6 h of refeeding (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results suggest that increased mRNA expression of lipogenic enzymes observed in FXR-/- mice during refeeding leads to increased triglyceride synthesis. Influence of Fxr Deficiency on the Expression of Hepatic Transcription Factors Controlling Fasting-Refeeding Transition—To investigate the molecular mechanism of Fxr deficiency on hepatic carbohydrate metabolism, mRNA levels of transcription factors controlling hepatic gene expression in response to nutritional changes were measured in FXR+/+ and FXR-/- mice. FXR mRNA was induced during fasting as reported previously (26Zhang Y. Castellani L.W. Sinal C.J. Gonzalez F.J. Edwards P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and its expression rapidly decreased upon refeeding (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, the expression of small heterodimer partner (Shp), a well characterized FXR target gene (16Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar), did not change upon fasting-refeeding in wild-type mice. As expected (17Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar), Shp was expressed at very low levels in FXR-/- mice (Fig. 3B). As previously reported (27Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), Srebp-1c mRNA expression decreased upon fasting and was induced upon refeeding (Fig. 3C). A similar, albeit less pronounced, response was observed for Chrebp (Fig. 3D). However, both genes responded similarly in FXR+/+ and FXR-/- mice. Taken together, these results suggest that the observed differences in glycolytic (LPK) and lipogenic (Fas and Acc-1) gene expression in FXR-/- mice are not mediated via alterations in the transcriptional regulation of Srebp-1c and Chrebp. Conversely, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) expression increased upon fasting and decreased upon refeeding, in line with previous reports (28Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). Pgc-1α mRNA levels were significantly lower in the basal (nonfasted) state, slightly increased during fasting, and more rapidly decreased after 6 h of refeeding in FXR-/- mice (Fig. 3E). Hnf4α mRNA also decreased more rapidly after 6 h of refeeding in FXR-/- mice (Fig. 3G). Finally, Foxo1 mRNA levels displayed a similar expression profile as Pgc-1α and Hnf4α, with a faster decrease upon refeeding in FXR-/- mice (Fig. 3F). However, the level of serine 256 phosphorylation of endogenous Foxo1 protein did not differ in liver of both strains after 6 h of refeeding (data not shown). Fxr Deficiency Does Not Alter Hepatic Insulin Signaling—Because insulin and glucose act synergistically to induce the transcription of lipogenic genes, we examined whether insulin or glucose signaling or both were altered in the liver of FXR-/- mice. Basal hepatic glucose production, assessed during an euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp, after a moderate fasting period of 9 h, was lower in FXR-/- compared with FXR+/+ mice (136 versus 103 μmol/kg/min; p < 0.05). In contrast, in the steady state condition, clamped hepatic glucose production was suppressed to a similar extent by insulin in both groups (FXR+/+, 54 ± 7 μmol/kg/min; FXR-/-, 48 ± 7 μmol/kg/min), indicating that hepatic insulin sensitivity was not altered in FXR-/- mice. To further investigate insulin receptor (IR)-mediated signaling in the liver, mice were fasted overnight and injected with either recombinant human insulin (1 IU/kg) or saline via the portal vein. Insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), the main IR-docking substrate in liver, were similar in both genotypes (Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, Fxr deficiency did not alter the binding of the p85α regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to IRS-2 nor the level of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 4, B and C). These data confirm that the changes in hepatic glucose metabolism observed in FXR-/- mice are not because of altered hepatic insulin signaling. Ligand-activated Fxr Modulates Glucose-induced, but Not Insulin-regulated Gene Expression in Primary Hepatocytes—To determine whether Fxr activation interferes with glucose signaling directly in the hepatocyte, the effect of Fxr activation on the regulation of gene expression by glucose and insulin was studied in vitro using the primary rat hepatocyte model. First, the effect of the specific Fxr ligand GW4064 on the transcriptional repression of Pepck by insulin was investigated (Fig. 5A). As expected, the PEPCK mRNA level was increased >20-fold by a combination of dexam"

Here, we show that PGE2 activated the β-catenin/T cell factor-dependent transcription in colon cancer cells through the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway. The expression of cyclin D1 and vascular endothelial growth factor was induced by PGE2 in LS-174T cells. Moreover, PGE2 and mutated β-catenin stimulated the transcription of cyclin D1 and vascular endothelial growth factor in a synergistic fashion. Mechanistically, PGE2 increased the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and consequently accumulated β-catenin. In addition, PGE2 induced the expression of T cell factor-4 transcription factor, which formed transcriptionally active complex with β-catenin. In animal experiments, administration of 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 strongly increased the expression of cyclin D1 and vascular endothelial growth factor in APCmin/+ mouse polyps. Thus, our results provide a novel mechanism, suggesting that cyclooxygenase-2/PGE2 may exert pro-oncogenic actions through stimulating the β-catenin/T cell factor-mediated transcription, which plays critical roles in colorectal carcinogenesis.

These data are supported by pharmacologic inhibition of the COX enzyme that achieves similar anti-neoplastic effects in APC-mutated mice (7Jacoby R.F. Seibert K. Cole C.E. Kelloff G. Lubet R.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5040-5044PubMed Google Scholar). Greater than 95% of APC mutations in colorectal cancers are truncations of the C termini (8Nagase H. Nakamura Y. Hum.

Growth of solid tumors requires a blood supply that is achieved through neoangiogenesis, which is controlled by a number of growth factors, including VEGF. Knock-out of EP2 receptor results in a decrease in the number and size of intestinal polyps in APCΔ716 mice that is associated with a dramatic reduction of VEGF expression (6Sonoshita M. Takaku K. Sasaki N. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1048-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Treatment with selective COX-2 inhibitors reduces levels of VEGF, particularly the membrane-bound form, in polyps of APCΔ716 mice (4Oshima M. Murai N. Kargman S. Arguello M. Luk P. Kwong E. Taketo M.M. Evans J.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1733-1740PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, PGE2 exposure induces the expression of VEGF in colon cancer cells (20Fukuda R. Kelly B. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2330-2334PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest a critical interaction between the COX-2/PGE2 pro-oncogenic pathway and the oncogenic APC/β-catenin/TCF pathway in colorectal neoplasia. In the present study, we demonstrated that PGE2 transactivated the β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 and induction of TCF-4 in colon cancer cells. In addition, PGE2 and mutated β-catenin induced the transcription of TCF target genes cyclin D1 and VEGF in a synergistic manner. These results suggest that COX-2/PGE2 may robustly enhance the oncogenic activity of the APC/β-catenin/TCF pathway, which play key roles in colorectal carcinogenesis.

RNA samples (20 μg/lane) were separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were hybridized with cDNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primer extension (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After hybridization and washes, the blots were subjected to autoradiography. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Levels of VEGF protein in cell culture media were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R & D System, Minneapolis, MN).

For transient transfection, cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.3 μg of the pRL-thymidine kinase plasmid, containing the Renilla luciferase gene (Promega), using the FuGENE 6 procedure (Roche Applied Science) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were lysed at the indicated times for luciferase assay. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a luminometer. Firefly luciferase values were standardized to Renilla values. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (26Shao J. Sheng H. Inoue H. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33951-33956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were cyclin D1 and TCF-4 from Upstate, VEGF from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-GSK-3α from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), and β-catenin from BD Transduction Laboratories. Animal Study—APCmin/+ mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine) and were housed in the Animal Care Facility according to National Institutes of Health and institutional guidelines for laboratory animals. 16,16-Dimethyl PGE2 (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) was dissolved in 10% EtOH and was administered by intraperitoneal injection (100 μg/kg of body weight). Intestinal polyps were collected for preparation of RNA and protein. Data Analysis—All statistical analyses were performed on a personal computer with the StatView 5.0.1 software (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC). Analyses between multiple groups were determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Analyses between two groups were determined using the unpaired Student's t test. Differences with a p value of <0.05 were considered as statistically significant. PGE2 Induced TCF-dependent Transcription—The Wnt signaling pathway stabilizes cytosolic β-catenin. Accumulated β-catenin binds and activates transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family, which, in turn, regulates target genes by binding to TCF/LEF elements within the promoter of the gene (27Roose J. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1424: 23-37PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PGE2 was able to stimulate TCF transcription, LS-174T cells were transfected with a TCF reporter vector, TOPflash, which contains a combination of TCF binding elements. Exposure to PGE2 increased the transcriptional activity of TOPflash ∼10-fold (Fig. 1A). As a positive control, co-transfection with a LEF-1 expression vector increased the activity of TOPflash ∼40-fold in LS-174T cells. In contrast, the reporter construct containing mutated TCF sites, FOPflash, had very low activity in LS-174T cells; treatment with PGE2 did not significantly increase luciferase activity. Furthermore, PGE2 induced TCF activity in a concentration-dependent fashion; as low as 1 nm, PGE2 clearly activated TCF elements and, at 0.1 μm, PGE2 reached the maximum effect (Fig. 1B). To investigate the effect of endogenous PGE2 on TCF activity, we treated HCA-7 cells with celecoxib at low concentrations. Previous studies have shown that HCA-7 cells express high levels of COX-2 and release PGE2 into culture media (26Shao J. Sheng H. Inoue H. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33951-33956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Treatment with 0.1 μm celecoxib is able to completely block PGE2 production but does not affect HCA-7 cell growth (28Williams C.S. Watson A.J.M. Sheng H. Helou R. Shao J. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6045-6051PubMed Google Scholar). TOPflash reporter vector was introduced into HCA-7 cells. 0.1 or 1 μm celecoxib was added immediately after the transfection procedure. Inhibition of COX-2 activity reduced TCF activity by ∼50% (Fig. 1C), suggesting that endogenous PGE2 was partially responsible for the TCF-mediated transcription in HCA-7 cells. PGE2 signals via activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway in LS-174T cells (21Shao J. Lee S.B. Guo H. Evers B.M. Sheng H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5218-5223PubMed Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 1D, a specific PKA inhibitor, H-89, inhibited the PGE2-induced TCF activation in a concentration-dependent manner. Because PGE2 may transactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling system (17Pai R. Soreghan B. Szabo I.L. Pavelka M. Baatar D. Tarnawski A.S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), we next tested whether PGE2-stimulated TCF activation involved EGFR-mediated signaling pathways. LS-174T cells were treated with PD-153035, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, LY-294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, or PD-98059, a MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, along with PGE2 exposure. Inhibition of EGFR signaling did not attenuate the PGE2-induced TCF transactivation (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway or the MEK/ERK MAPK pathway did not reduce the PGE2-induced TCF activation as well. PGE2 Induced the Expression of Cyclin D1—Although PGE2 greatly activated the artificial TCF reporter system; it was of importance to determine whether PGE2 truly induced the expression of TCF target genes. Cyclin D1 has been determined as a TCF-dependent gene, which contains a number of TCF elements within its promoter region; the expression of mutated β-catenin increases the activity of cyclin D1 promoter and levels of cyclin D1 mRNA (11Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). We treated LS-174T cells with PGE2 and found that levels of cyclin D1 protein were rapidly increased (Fig. 2A). To determine whether transcriptional regulation was involved in PGE2-induced cyclin D1 expression, LS-174T cells were transfected with a cyclin D1 promoter driving reporter vector. Exposure to PGE2 increased the luciferase activity ∼4.5-fold (Fig. 2B), indicating that PGE2 regulated cyclin D1 expression, at least partially, at a transcriptional level. In addition, activation of cAMP/PKA was required for PGE2-stimulated cyclin D1 transcription (Fig. 2C); treatment with H-89 completely attenuated the PGE2-induced activation of the cyclin D1 promoter. In contrast, PD-153035, LY-294002, and PD-98059 did not significantly alter the PGE2-induced cyclin D1 transcription. To further elucidate the potential interaction between the APC/β-catenin/TCF pathway and PGE2 signaling, we introduced wild type β-catenin or truncated β-catenin (Δ-89) into LS-174T cells. Although LS-174T cells express mutated β-catenin (29van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E. Coudreuse D. Haramis A.P. Tjon-Pon-Fong M. Moerer P. van den Born M. Soete G. Pals S. Eilers M. Medema R. Clevers H. Cell. 2002; 111: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar), expression of stabilized β-catenin (Δ-89) increased the activity of the cyclin D1 promoter ∼2-fold (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, PGE2 and mutated β-catenin (Δ-89) induced cyclin D1 transcription in a synergistic manner (Fig. 2D). PGE2 Induced the Expression of VEGF—Tumor angiogenesis plays critical roles in tumor growth, and VEGF is one of the major regulators for neoangiogenesis. The regulation of VEGF is thought to involve TCF activation, and there are seven TCF binding elements within the promoter of VEGF1 (13Easwaran V. Lee S.H. Inge L. Guo L. Goldbeck C. Garrett E. Wiesmann M. Garcia P.D. Fuller J.H. Chan V. Randazzo F. Gundel R. Warren R.S. Escobedo J. Aukerman S.L. Taylor R.N. Fantl W.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3145-3153PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with PGE2 increased VEGF1 mRNA in LS-174T cells, as analyzed by Northern blot (Fig. 3A). To determine whether PGE2 increased VEGF protein and its secretion in colon cancer cells, LS-174T cells were treated with either vehicle or PGE2. Levels of VEGF in cell culture medium were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The basal level of VEGF protein in LS-174T cell culture media was ∼120 pg/ml. PGE2 stimulation increased the levels of VEGF ∼2-fold (Fig. 3B). To determine whether PGE2 regulated VEGF1 expression at the transcriptional level, LS-174T cells were transfected with a VEGF1 promoter-driving reporter vector. As shown in Fig. 3C, PGE2 treatment increased the transcription of VEGF1 ∼5-fold (Fig. 3C). Although inhibition of PKA activity strongly blocked the PGE2-induced VEGF transcription, PD-153035 and PD-98059 also significantly reduced the PGE2-stimulated VEGF promoter activity. These results suggested that PGE2 induced VEGF transcription predominantly through activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway; however, transactivation of the EGFR system also contributed to PGE2-induced VEGF expression. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of stabilized β-catenin (Δ89) increased the activity of the VEGF1 promoter ∼3-fold, compared with the cells transfected with empty vector or wild type β-catenin (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, PGE2 synergistically enhanced the action of β-catenin and increased the activity of the VEGF1 promoter ∼12-fold. PGE2 Stimulated GSK-3 Phosphorylation—PGE2 increases the phosphorylation of GSK-3α in human embryonic kidney cells that ectopically express E-prostanoid receptors (30Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and in human neuronal cells (31Lee E.O. Shin Y.J. Chong Y.H. J. Neuroimmunol. 2004; 155: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of GSK-3 inhibits its kinase activity, which is required for phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin (32Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PGE2 increased the phosphorylation of GSK-3 in colon cancer cells, LS-174T cells were treated with PGE2. Levels of phosphorylated GSK-3α were rapidly elevated (Fig. 4A). An increase in the level of β-catenin was detected as well. The function of inhibition of the GSK-3 was next investigated. LS-174T cells were treated with LiCl, which is an established inhibitor of both GSK-3α and GSK-3β (33Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with LiCl at 10-20 mm increased the transcriptional activity of TOPflash reporter, cyclin D1 promoter, and VEGF promoter 2-4-fold (Fig. 4B). Because LiCl is not a selective inhibitor of GSK-3 (34Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar), we tested two more specific GSK-3 inhibitors for their ability to induce TCF-dependent transcription in LS-174T cells. SB-216763 and BIO are structurally distinct inhibitors of GSK-3α and GSK-3β (35Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A. Corcoran S.L. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S. Roxbee Cox L. Mills D. Brown M.J. Haigh D. Ward R.W. Smith D.G. Murray K.J. Reith A.D. Holder J.C. Chem.

Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Both SB-216763 and BIO at relatively low concentrations (0.1-1 μm) significantly induced the transcription of TOPflash reporter, cyclin D1 promoter, and VEGF promoter (Fig. 4C). PGE2 Induced TCF-4 Expression—The stimulatory effect of PGE2 on TCF-dependent transcription was significantly stronger than the effects of GSK-3 inhibitors, suggesting that PGE2 transactivation of TCF-mediated transcription involved additional mechanisms. TCF-4 is a member of the TCF transcription factor family, which is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (37Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. Wichen D.V. Weger R.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar). TCF-4 activates transcription of target genes when associated with β-catenin. Cyclin D1 and c-myc have been identified as targets of TCF-4 (11Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar, 12He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). To determine whether PGE2-stimulated TCF transcription involved the regulation of TCF-4 expression, levels of TCF-4 protein were examined in LS-174T cells. Exposure to PGE2 strongly increased the levels of TCF-4 protein in LS-174T cells (Fig. 5A). Previous studies have shown that TCF-4 plays critical role in TCF-dependent transcription in LS-174T cells (29van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E. Coudreuse D. Haramis A.P. Tjon-Pon-Fong M. Moerer P. van den Born M. Soete G. Pals S. Eilers M. Medema R. Clevers H. Cell. 2002; 111: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). We found that ectopic expression of wild type TCF-4 protein dramatically elevated the transcription of TOPflash; addition of PGE2 further increased TCF transcription in a synergistic manner (Fig. 5B, left panel). Similar results were observed when LS-174T cells were co-transfected with the TCF-4 expression vector along with the cyclin D1 promoter reporter (Fig. 5B, middle panel). Expression of TCF-4 increased cyclin D1 transcription ∼5-fold; addition of PGE2 further increased the TCF-4-induced cyclin D1 transcription in an additive manner. In contrast, expression of TCF-4 did not significantly alter VEGF transcription, and there were no collaborative actions between TCF-4 and PGE2 on VEGF transcription as well (Fig. 5B, right panel). It has been demonstrated that expression of a dominant negative TCF-4 protein (dnTCF-4), which does not bind to β-catenin and acts as a potent inhibitor of the β-catenin-TCF complex, strongly inhibits TCF-dependent transcription in LS-174T cells (29van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E. Coudreuse D. Haramis A.P. Tjon-Pon-Fong M. Moerer P. van den Born M. Soete G. Pals S. Eilers M. Medema R. Clevers H. Cell. 2002; 111: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). The expression of dnTCF-4 reduced the basal activity of TOPflash by ∼70%. Interestingly, dnTCF-4 almost completely attenuated the PGE2-induced TCF activation in LS-174T cells (Fig. 5C, left panel). Moreover, dnTCF-4 decreased the basal activity of cyclin D1 promoter by ∼50% but completely attenuated the PGE2-induced cyclin D1 transcription (Fig. 5C, middle panel). In contrast, expression of dnTCF-4 did not alter the basal transcriptional activity of VEGF and only slightly reduced the PGE2-induced VEGF transcription (Fig. 5C, right panel). Synergistic Action of β-Catenin and MEK-1 on VEGF Transcription—To further elucidate the molecular mechanism by which PGE2 synergistically enhanced β-catenin-induced VEGF transcription, we investigated the interaction between β-catenin/TCF signaling and other signaling pathway. Because PGE2-induced VEGF transcription involved the transactivation of EGFR/MEK signaling (Fig. 3C), collaborative action between β-catenin and MEK-1 was evaluated. LS-174T cells were co-transfected with β-catenin (Δ-89) and active MEK-1 expression vectors along with the VEGF promoter reporter. Expression of either β-catenin (Δ-89) or MEK-1 increased VEGF transcription; however, in combination, they stimulated the activation of VEGF promoter in a synergistic manner (Fig. 6). PGE2 Induced Cyclin D1 and VEGF in Vivo—Numerous studies demonstrate that inhibition of COX-2 enzyme results in decreased tumor cell proliferation in APCmin/+ mouse polyps, suggesting that COX-2-derived PGs are critical for tumor cell proliferation in germ line APC mutation-induced neoplasia (3Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar). To determine whether PGE2 was able to activate β-catenin/TCF signaling and stimulate the expression of TCF target genes in vivo, 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 was administered to APCmin/+ mice. Protein was extracted from the polyps of an APCmin/+ mouse intestine. The expression of cyclin D1 protein was barely detected in vehicle-treated APCmin/+ mouse tumors. In contrast, cyclin D1 was strongly expressed in all tumors collected from PGE2-treated mouse intestine (Fig. 7A). Disruption of COX-2 gene or inhibition of COX-2 enzyme decreases tumor angiogenesis and VEGF expression in APCΔ716 mouse adenomas (6Sonoshita M. Takaku K. Sasaki N. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1048-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). To determine whether PGE2 stimulated the expression of VEGF in vivo, 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 was administered to APCmin/+ mice. RNA and protein were extracted from polyps of APCmin/+ mouse ileum. Levels of VEGF mRNA (Fig. 7B) and protein (Fig. 7C) were dramatically elevated in APCmin/+ mouse tumors following administration of 16,16-dimethyl PGE2. COX-2 is expressed at low levels in normal intestinal mucosa; its activity increases dramatically following mutations of the APC gene, suggesting that COX-2-generated prostaglandins are involved in the oncogenic activity of the APC/β-catenin/TCF pathway. It has been shown that PGE2 transactivates the β-catenin/TCF pathway in human embryonic kidney-293 cells, which ectopically express EP2 or EP4 receptors (30Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that PGE2 activated TCF-dependent transcription in colon cancer cells at concentrations of 1-100 nm, which were similar to the levels of PGE2 detected either in APCmin/+ polyps or in colon cancer cells (5Reuter B.K. Zhang X.J. Miller M.J. BMC Cancer. 2002; 2: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Shao J. Sheng H. Inoue H. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33951-33956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In support with these results, inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity significantly reduced TCF activity in HCA-7 cells, suggesting that COX-2/PGE2 signaling may stimulate cell proliferation through transactivation of the TCF-dependent transcription. Mechanistically, we found that PGE2-stimulated TCF transcription involved phosphorylation of GSK-3 and induction of TCF-4 transcription factor, which formed a transcriptionally active complex with β-catenin. These results suggest a positive feedback loop between the APC/β-catenin/TCF pathway and the COX-2/PGE2 signaling system. APC mutation-activated TCF transcription increases the expression of COX-2 and production of PGE2 (3Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F.

Apparently, PGE2 induced oncogenic activity is crucial for tumor development in APC mutation-initiated colorectal carcinogenesis, as inhibition of COX-2, a key enzyme for conversion of arachidonic acid to PGs, results in a dramatic reduction of tumor number and size in humans and mice with germ line APC mutations (2Steinbach G.

Numerous studies demonstrate that expression of COX-2 is associated with a growth advantage in colon cancer cells (16Sheng H. Shao J. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol.

Med. 2002; 8: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which COX-2 promotes proliferation and growth of cancer cells are complex. Recent studies suggest that PGE2 may transactivate the EGFR signaling system through various mechanisms (17Pai R. Soreghan B. Szabo I.L. Pavelka M. Baatar D. Tarnawski A.S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 21Shao J. Lee S.B. Guo H. Evers B.M. Sheng H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5218-5223PubMed Google Scholar, 39Buchanan F.G. Wang D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 14287-14293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that PGE2 induced the transcription of cyclin D1, a TCF-4 target gene, through induction of both β-catenin and TCF-4. Progression through the mid to late G1 phase of the mammalian cell cycle is dependent upon the cyclin D1-mediated activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (41Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4977) Google Scholar). The activated cyclin D-dependent kinases phosphorylate and inactivate the retinoblastoma protein, thereby preventing its inhibition of transcription factors including the E2Fs that are essential for DNA synthesis. The expression of cyclin D1 is elevated in both the familial adenomatous polyposis patient tumor and APCmin/+ mouse polyp and is thought to be critical for APC mutation-induced neoplasia (42Zhang T. Nanney L.B. Luongo C. Lamps L. Heppner K.J. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 169-175PubMed Google Scholar). Given the critical roles of cyclin D1 in cell cycle progression and in colorectal carcinogenesis, our results provide an additional mechanism by which COX-2/PGE2 promotes the proliferation and growth of colon cancer cells. VEGF stimulates neoangiogenesis by inducing endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tubular organization. Seven consensus TCF binding sites have been mapped in the promoter of the human VEGF-1 gene (13Easwaran V. Lee S.H. Inge L. Guo L. Goldbeck C. Garrett E. Wiesmann M. Garcia P.D. Fuller J.H. Chan V. Randazzo F. Gundel R. Warren R.S. Escobedo J. Aukerman S.L. Taylor R.N. Fantl W.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3145-3153PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of VEGF-1 mRNA are significantly elevated in primary colon cancers, which contain a mutated APC gene in comparison with tumors that have a wild type APC gene, suggesting that VEGF-1 is an APC/β-catenin/TCF target gene. On the other hand, COX-2/PGE2 signaling plays critical roles in neoangiogenesis; homozygous deletion of the EP2 receptor significantly reduces the number and size of intestinal polyps in APCΔ716 mice, which is associated with a reduction of VEGF expression, suggesting that PGE2/EP2 signaling is critical for increased levels of VEGF in intestinal neoplasm (6Sonoshita M. Takaku K. Sasaki N. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1048-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In support with these observations, we found that administration of 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 strongly increased levels of VEGF mRNA and protein in APCmin/+ mouse polyps. Moreover, our data demonstrated that inhibition of GSK-3 or ectopic expression of mutated β-catenin significantly increased VEGF transcription, indicating that VEGF-1 is transcriptionally regulated by β-catenin/TCF. However, expression of TCF-4 did not increase VEGF promoter activity; additional experiments are required to identify which member(s) of the TCF/LEF family mediated the activation of VEGF transcription. It has been reported that PGE2 induction of VEGF in HCT-116 colon cancer cells is mediated by the transcriptional activator hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (20Fukuda R. Kelly B. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2330-2334PubMed Google Scholar). Our results showed that PGE2-increased VEGF transcription involved transactivation of the EGFR system and the MEK pathway synergistically enhanced the β-catenin-induced VEGF transcription. These findings suggest that regulation of VEGF expression by PGE2 is mediated by a complex mechanism and the synergistic actions of PGE2 on VEGF transcription involves both β-catenin/TCF-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Cumulative evidence suggests that the COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway plays critical roles in neoplasia of a variety of organs (43Williams C.S. Mann M. DuBois R.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7908-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 44Liu C.H. Chang S.H. Narko K. Trifan O.C. Wu M.T. Smith E. Haudenschild C. Lane T.F. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18563-18569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar); however, this pathway is not a putative oncogenic pathway. Understanding the molecular mechanism mediating COX-2/PGE2 tumor-promoting effects will help to design novel strategies for prevention and treatment of colon cancers. In the present study, we demonstrated synergistic actions of PGE2 signaling on the β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription through regulating levels of both β-catenin and TCF-4. In addition, PGE2 may synergistically enhance the transcriptional activity of the β-catenin/TCF pathway through transactivating other signaling systems. Previously, we have shown that PGE2 and the EGFR signaling system synergistically stimulate the growth and migration of colon cancer cells (40Shao J. Evers B.M. Sheng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14287-14293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, PGE2 and the Ras/MAPK pathway synergistically induce the expression of an EGF-like growth factor, amphiregulin. Our studies provide an interesting hypothesis that PGE2 exerts proneoplastic effects by stimulating critical oncogenic pathways, such as the β-catenin/TCF-4 pathway, the EGFR signaling system, and the Ras/MAPK pathway, in a collaborative fashion. Fujino et al. (30Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) have reported that the EP2 signaling pathway induces TCF activity through a cAMP/PKA-dependent mechanism, whereas EP4-mediated TCF activation is largely dependent on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3 is crucial for its degradation. Both PKA and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt can phosphorylate GSK-3 and inhibit its kinase activity and therefore activate the β-catenin/TCF pathway (45Regan J.W. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that LS-174T cells express both EP2 and EP4 receptors and that activation of the EP4 receptor is critical for PGE2-induced cell migration (16Sheng H. Shao J. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Additional studies are required to determine which EP receptor(s) is responsible for the PGE2-activated β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription in colon cancer cells. In summary, inactivation of GSK-3 by mutations of the APC gene, which stabilizes β-catenin and stimulates TCF-dependent transcription, is thought to be the earliest genetic event in colorectal carcinogenesis (46Kinzler W.K. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar). COX-2-derived PGE2 may enhance the APC/β-catenin/TCF pathway via various mechanisms (Fig. 8). 1) PGE2 activates the cAMP/PKA pathway, which phosphorylates GSK-3 and further increases levels of cytosolic β-catenin. 2) PGE2 increases the expression of TCF-4 transcription factor, which forms transcriptionally active complex with β-catenin. 3) PGE2 transactivates other signaling pathways, which enhances the β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription in a collaborative fashion. These findings provide a novel mechanism for the understanding of COX-2/PGE2 proneoplastic actions in colorectal neoplasia."

We found that TGR can catalyze isomerization of protein and interprotein disulfide bonds and localized this function to its thiol domain. TGR targets include proteins that form structural components of the sperm, including glutathione peroxidase GPx4/PHGPx. Together, TGR and GPx4 can serve as a novel disulfide bond formation system.

Two TRs, TR1 (also known as TrxR1 and Txnrd1) and TR3 (also known as TrxR2 and Txnrd2), have been characterized in detail and are components of cytosolic and mitochondrial thioredoxin systems, respectively. Both proteins have recently been shown to be essential for embryogenesis (6Jakupoglu C. Przemeck G.K. Schneider M. Moreno S.G. Mayr N. Hatzopoulos A.K. de Angelis M.H. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W.

Our search for new redox enzymes resulted in identification of thioredoxin (Trx)/glutathione (GSH) reductase (TGR) (8Sun Q.A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar), TGR contains a pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductase sequence and the Sec residue encoded by UGA (see Fig. 1) (8Sun Q.A.

However, compared with the 55-kDa subunit homodimeric TR1, TGR is composed of two 65-kDa subunits because it has an additional N-terminal glutaredoxin (Grx)-like domain (9Sun Q.A. Kirnarsky L. Sherman S. Gladyshev V.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3673-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). TGR was found to exhibit broad substrate specificity; it could act as TR, glutathione reductase, and Grx in in vitro assays (9Sun Q.A. Kirnarsky L. Sherman S. Gladyshev V.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3673-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A Grx-containing form of TR1 was recently identified (10Rundlöf A.K. Janard M. Miranda-Vizuete A. Arnér E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 641-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Su D. Gladyshev V.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12177-12188Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); however, it displayed no activities characteristic of TGR (11Su D. Gladyshev V.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12177-12188Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPx4/PHGPx) is another selenium-containing protein. It reduces lipid hydroperoxides with GSH (12Ursini F. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Biomed. Environ. Sci. 1997; 10: 327-332PubMed Google Scholar). This protein was found to also be a structural component of sperm (13Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). In elongating spermatids, the formation of the mitochondrial sheath in the sperm midpiece is thought to involve oxidative cross-links of structural proteins by GPx4, which itself becomes oxidatively cross-linked in mature sperm and changes its function from an enzyme to a structural protein of the mitochondrial capsule (13Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). In addition, structural features of the sperm flagella are stabilized by disulfide bonds, which appear to be regulated by testis-specific thioredoxins (14Sadek C.M. Damdimopoulos A.E. Pelto-Huikko M. Gustafsson J.A. Spyrou G. Miranda-Vizuete A. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1077-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15Miranda-Vizuete A. Ljung J. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Oko R.

In the spermatid nucleus, chromatin condenses, and histones are replaced with protamines, which are stabilized by disulfide bonds that are thought to be generated by the nucleus-specific isoform of GPx4 (16Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopoulos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As a result of these and other processes, various nuclear and accessory structures in mature sperm become cross-linked by specific intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds, which are preserved in the sperm until their reduction in fertilized eggs (17Sutovsky P. Tengowski M.W. Navara C.S. Zoran S.S. Schatten G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 47: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Despite the important roles that disulfide bond formation and isomerization play in sperm development, little is known about how these processes are accomplished or regulated and what cellular components are involved in redox-dependent sperm maturation. In the present work, a functional characterization and localization of TGR revealed its disulfide bond isomerization activity and its close functional relationship to GPx4. These data implicated TGR in the process of sperm maturation. Isolation of Proteins—Mouse and rat TR1 and TGR were isolated from liver and testes using a three-step procedure (8Sun Q.A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 18Sun Q.A. Gladyshev V.N. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The fragment encoding the Grx domain of mouse TGR was amplified with primers 5′-GAGATTCCATATGGCGTCGCCACCCGGCCGCCG-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTTAGTCATCTTGAAGGAGCTTCTGCA-3′ and cloned into pET28a (Novagen). The recombinant protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's manual. TGR Expression Analyses—Approximately 0.2 g of various mouse tissues was sonicated in 5 volumes of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A (buffer A). After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were analyzed by immunoblot assay using antibodies specific for the C-terminal extension of TGR. Polyclonal antibodies that were raised against a full-length mouse TGR were also used. Enrichment of Tissue TGR and TR1 on ADP-Sepharose—0.2-0.35 g of wild type mouse muscle, kidney, brain, prostate, lung, heart, liver, testes, and 1.0 ml of mouse blood was sonicated, and TGR was enriched on ADP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacture's manual. The ADP-Sepharose-eluted fractions were analyzed by immunoblot assays with antibodies specific for TR1, TGR C-terminal peptide, and the full-length TGR protein. Microscopy—Frozen sections (8 μm) were generated from wild type mouse testes and used for immunofluorescence labeling of TGR and GPx4. The sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, rinsed in PBS, and extracted with cold methanol at -20 °C for 5 min, followed by three washes in PBS and 1 h of blocking in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS in the presence of 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). The samples were then incubated for 2 h in PBST-containing 1% bovine serum albumin and primary antibodies against recombinant TGR and an internal peptide of mouse GPx4. The samples were washed three times in PBST, incubated in Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:100 dilution) (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, washed twice in PBST, and stained with 1 mm Sytox-green (Molecular Probes). After a 5-min rinse in PBS, they were mounted and examined on a Bio-Rad MRC1024ES confocal microscope using 488/647 nm excitation lasers and simultaneous display mode of the Bio-Rad LaserSharp imaging program. Regulation of TGR Expression by Dietary Selenium—To obtain selenium-deficient mice, wild type weanling mice were maintained on a selenium-deficient Torula yeast-based diet (Harlan Teklad). To obtain selenium-sufficient mice, wild type mice were placed on a selenium-deficient diet that was supplemented with 0.4 ppm selenium as sodium selenite. After the indicated time on the diets, the mice were sacrificed, and tissues were extracted. Transgenic mice overexpressing i6A- mutant Sec tRNA (19Moustafa M.E. Carlson B.A. El-Saadani M.A. Kryukov G.V. Sun Q.A. Harney J.W. Hill K.E. Combs G.F. Feigenbaum L. Mansur D.B. Burk R.F. Berry M.J. Diamond A.M. Lee B.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3840-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were maintained similarly on either selenium-deficient or selenium-sufficient diets. To label mice with 75Se, 0.5 mCi of [75Se]selenite was injected intraperitoneally, and mice were sacrificed 60 h later. Isomerization of Interprotein Disulfide Bonds Involving GPx4 by TGR—Mouse or rat epididymal spermatozoa were solubilized with 0.1m 2-mercaptoethanol and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, followed by removal of low molecular weight compounds according to Ursini et al. (13Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). GSH only, TR1 and NADPH, or TGR and NADPH at the indicated concentrations were added to the 20-μg aliquots of solubilized sperm mixture, followed by incubation of the mixtures with 80 μm H2O2 for 15 min. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions followed by immunoblot assays using anti-GPx4 antibodies. Formation and Isomerization of Disulfide Bonds in Ribonuclease A by GPx4 and TGR—Denatured reduced ribonuclease A was prepared as follows. Approximately 5 mg of native ribonuclease A was incubated in 1 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 120 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Low molecular weight compounds were removed using a PD-10 column that was pre-equilibrated with 0.1% acetic acid. RNase A and denatured reduced RNase A were quantified using absorbance coefficients ϵ275.5 = 9.8 mm-1·cm-1 and ϵ275.5 = 9.3 mm-1·cm-1, respectively. The RNase A activity was determined by following the hydrolysis of cCMP as an increase in absorbance at 296 nm (Δϵ296 = 0.19 mm-1·cm-1). 5 mm cCMP was incubated with 1 μm denatured reduced RNase A and 2 μm H2O2-oxidized recombinant Lycopersicon esculentum GPx4 homolog, 2 μm oxidized glutathione, or 2 μm H2O2, which were used as oxidants in the assay. The mixtures were also supplied with 1 μm TGR, 1 μm TR1, or 7 μm reduced recombinant Grx domain of TGR (which provided isomerization/reduction function) in 0.5 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, for 45-60 min, as shown in Fig. 4. The differences in absorbance at 296 nm were used to calculate RNase A activity. Analogous experiments in which one or more of the components were absent were negative controls, and native RNase A was used as a positive control in the activity assays. Isomerization of Disulfide Bonds by the Grx Domain of TGR in Escherichia coli Periplasm—The construct encoding the Grx domain of TGR targeted to periplasm (pPelTG) was cloned into a modified pET28 vector, in which the N-terminal His-tag sequence was removed and replaced with an N-terminal alkaline phosphatase periplasmic signal. The wild type strain and strains carrying pTrcStIItPA (expresses periplasmic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)), pPelTG, or both plasmids were grown in LB medium at 30 °C until A600 reached 0.8, arabinose was added to 0.2%, 30 min later isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm, and cells were grown for an additional 4 h. The periplasm was extracted according to the pET system manual (Novagen). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Plasminogen activation assay was performed as described (20Bessette P.H. Aslund F. Beckwith J. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13703-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Briefly, in a microtiter plate, 2.5 μg of a periplasmic protein fraction was added to wells containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.01% Tween 80, 0.04 mg/ml human glu-plasminogen, and 0.4 mm Spectrozyme PL (American Diagnostica), in a 260-μl final volume. The plate was incubated at 37 °C, and absorbance at 405 nm was read after 2 or 3 h. The activity was directly proportional to ΔA405 (absorbance after subtracting the background of a strain expressing an empty vector). Identification of TGR Substrates—The recombinant TGR Grx domain was immobilized on CNBr-activated-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Rat sperm was solubilized as described above, followed by the removal of denaturing and reducing agents by dialysis. The Grx resin was placed in a tube containing a sperm sample, rolling head to tail for 30 min at room temperature. The unbound proteins were removed, and the resin was washed 3 times with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. The bound proteins were then eluted with 10 mm DTT, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. The protein bands were cut, and protein identities determined by tandem mass spectrometry sequencing at the University of Nebraska mass spectrometry facility. TGR Is Abundant in Testes after Puberty and Expressed at Low Levels in Other Organs—TGR mRNA was previously detected in testes by Northern blot analyses (8Sun Q.A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We tested the expression of this protein by immunoblot assays (Fig. 2A). TGR was abundant in mouse testes but was not detected in crude extracts of brain, heart, kidney, liver, spleen, or stomach. To test whether TGR expression might be relevant to testis function, we examined its levels in mice at different ages. TGR was not detected in the testes of a 20-day-old mouse, whereas it was highly expressed in 7-month-old mouse testes (Fig. 2B). Control experiments with GPx4, a selenoprotein involved in male reproduction (13Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 21Foresta C. Flohe L. Garolla A. Roveri A. Ursini F. Maiorino M. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), also revealed puberty-dependent expression (Fig. 2B). Although these experiments suggested a possible exclusive presence of TGR in postpubertal testes, analyses of the NCBI EST data base revealed a number of human, mouse, and rat TGR ESTs from other organs and tissues, in addition to those from testes that accounted for the majority of TGR ESTs. To test whether TGR was present in other tissues at levels not detectable by Northern and immunoblot assays, we employed ADP-Sepharose affinity chromatography to enrich for possible TGR in each of the analyzed tissue samples. This procedure allows selective enrichment of NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases, including TRs (22Sun Q.A. Zappacosta F. Factor V.M. Wirth P.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3106-3114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). When the enriched fractions were tested for the presence of TGR by immunoblot assays, the enzyme was detected in heart, lung, and liver samples (Fig. 2C). Using this approach, we found TGR in all mouse tissues studied, including liver, kidney, brain, lung, heart, muscle, and prostate (detected as 65- or 70-kDa species on SDS-polyacrylamide gels) (Fig. 2D). As expected, TGR levels in the testes were dramatically higher than in any other examined tissues, and this enzyme could be seen as one of the major Coomassie Blue-stained bands in the ADP-Sepharose-enriched testis fraction (Fig. 2D). In contrast, TR1 was more uniformly distributed in mouse tissues. The pattern of low abundance of TGR in most tissues and its high expression in testes was reminiscent of that of GPx4 (23Roveri A. Casasco A. Maiorino M. Dalan P. Calligaro A. Ursini F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6142-6146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Effects of Selenium Deficiency and Defects in Sec Biosynthesis on TGR Expression—Because TGR is a selenoprotein, we tested the roles of dietary selenium and a defect in Sec biosynthesis in the regulation of TGR expression. Sec biosynthesis requires a unique tRNA[Ser]Sec, a cis-acting selenocysteine insertion sequence element, and several trans-acting components (24Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). We previously generated a mouse model of selenoprotein deficiency by overexpressing an i6A- mutant Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec that resulted in reduced selenoprotein expression under normal dietary levels of selenium (19Moustafa M.E. Carlson B.A. El-Saadani M.A. Kryukov G.V. Sun Q.A. Harney J.W. Hill K.E. Combs G.F. Feigenbaum L. Mansur D.B. Burk R.F. Berry M.J. Diamond A.M. Lee B.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3840-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TGR expression in testes appeared to be little affected, even when i6A- mice were maintained on the selenium-deficient diet for 3 months, and this pattern was again similar to that of GPx4 (25Lei X.G. Ross D.A. Parks J.E. Combs Jr., G.F. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1997; 59: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2E). However, a prolonged selenium-deficiency (6 months) of i6A- mice decreased both TGR and GPx4 levels in testes (Fig. 2F). Interestingly, sperm from i6A- mice that were maintained on the selenium-deficient diet for 6 months had lower motility and a higher proportion of abnormal morphology compared with sperm from control mice (∼75 versus ∼15% abnormal sperm, respectively), and the most common defects were seen in the midpiece region of the selenium-deficient i6A- sperm (Fig. 2G). These results were consistent with the previously suggested role of selenium in sperm motility and midpiece stability (26Maiorino M. Ursini F. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine whether TGR, similarly to GPx4 (13Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), was maintained after completion of spermiogenesis, we tested the presence of both enzymes in epididymal sperm. Immunoblot assays revealed the lack of TGR in sperm, whereas GPx4 was present in large quantities (Fig. 2, E and F). Spermatid Location of TGR—We further employed light (Fig. 3A) and confocal (supplemental Fig. S1) microscopy to determine the location of TGR in testes. Spermatids exhibited a strong TGR signal, but the enzyme was also detected in spermatocytes. Consistent with the immunoblot data, no TGR signal was detected in sperm. Control experiments with GPx4 revealed that this enzyme accumulated in spermatids; it was abundant in the midpiece of mature sperm (supplemental Fig. S1) as previously reported (13Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Thus, TGR and GPx4 accumulated during spermatid development. However, TGR was lost, and GPx4 remained after the spermatids differentiated into mature sperm. Light and confocal microscopy also revealed that TGR had a broad distribution, including the cytoplasm and nucleus, as previously reported for GPx4 (16Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopoulos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Roveri A. Casasco A. Maiorino M. Dalan P. Calligaro A. Ursini F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6142-6146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Borchert A. Savaskan N.E. Kuhn H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2571-2580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We next used electron microscopy to determine the specific location of TGR in late spermatids. The enzyme appeared very abundant in the cytoplasm of step 15-17 spermatids, at the time of mitochondrial sheath formation in the sperm tail midpiece. Moreover, in these spermatids TGR accumulated near the site of mitochondrial sheath assembly (Fig. 3B). Disulfide Bond Isomerization by TGR—Parallels in temporal and spatial expression patterns between TGR and GPx4, as well as dependence of these redox enzymes on selenium, suggested that functions of TGR and GPx4 might be linked. To test this hypothesis, we solubilized epididymal sperm and used H2O2 to induce oxidative cross-links between GPx4 and sperm proteins (13Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). GPx4 efficiently participated in oxidative cross-links, migrating as heterogeneous high molecular weight species in non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 4A, upper panel, first lane). However, in reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels, such cross-links were disrupted and GPx4 migrated as a ∼17-kDa monomeric protein (Fig. 4A, lower panel). Heterogeneous oxidative cross-links could be completely reduced by 5 mm GSH (Fig. 4A, lane 4). This observation provided an important control but was unlikely to be of physiological significance as GSH levels are extremely low in sperm (26Maiorino M. Ursini F. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Purified testis TR1 in the presence of NADPH had no effect on the GPx4 cross-links (Fig. 4A, upper panel, lane 2). However, TGR in the presence of NADPH dramatically affected the cross-linking pattern, generating a ∼46-kDa GPx4-containing species in place of the heterogeneous high molecular weight species (Fig. 4A, lane 3). This effect could not be attributed exclusively to GPx4 reduction by TGR, as no significant monomeric GPx4 was detected. The 46-kDa species also had a different mass than either a possible GPx4 dimer or a GPx4·TGR complex and were formed by TGR in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Therefore, these data suggested that TGR promoted isomerization of disulfide bonds formed between GPx4 and certain sperm protein(s), generating a 46-kDa species containing GPx4 from high molecular weight nonspecific cross-links. GPx4 was reported to be involved in disulfide bond formation in sperm proteins (13Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 26Maiorino M. Ursini F. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and its homologs and other thiol peroxidases were implicated in regulating cellular processes by H2O2-dependent disulfide bond formation. For example, yeast GPx4 homolog, Hyr1/Gpx3, formed a specific disulfide bond in transcription factor Yap1 in response to H2O2 treatment in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (28Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). However, for generation of correct disulfide bonds, both disulfide bond formation and isomerization processes are necessary, and the latter process is dependent on availability of an electron donor. GPx4 is unlikely to isomerize disulfide bonds because of its peroxidase function. In contrast, NADPH-dependent TGR would fit the disulfide bond isomerase function. We directly tested whether TGR had disulfide bond isomerization activity by using denatured reduced RNase A as substrate and a recombinant H2O2-oxidized L. esculentum GPx4 homolog as a thiol oxidant. When used separately, GPx4 and TGR had little effect on RNase A activation (Fig. 4C). However, the use of both of these enzymes resulted in RNase A activity, demonstrating that TGR indeed catalyzes disulfide bond isomerization (Fig. 4C). In contrast, TR1 alone, TR1 in combination with GPx4, oxidized glutathione, or H2O2 did not generate functional RNase A. The Grx domain of TGR in combination with GPx4 could also isomerize disulfide bonds in RNase A (Fig. 4D), suggesting that this domain directly attacked disulfides generated by GPx4 in RNase A and that it was responsible for the disulfide reshuffling activity of TGR. To test whether TGR could promote disulfide bond isomerization in an in vivo system, we expressed the Grx domain of TGR in E. coli and targeted it to the periplasm by using a signal peptide. To assay disulfide bond isomerization, we expressed human tPA, which has 17 disulfide bonds, in E. coli periplasm. Co-expression of tPA and an E. coli disulfide bond isomerase DsbC is known to increase tPA activity (29Qiu J. Swartz J.R. Georgiou G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Targeting mammalian protein disulfide isomerase to the E. coli periplasm also can partially stimulate tPA activity. We found that when coexpressed with the Grx domain of TGR, tPA had higher activity compared with cells expressing tPA only, consistent with the disulfide isomerase activity of the Grx domain (Fig. 4E). We further reasoned that in the absence of the natural electron donor (the TR portion of TGR), the mixed disulfides formed between the Grx domain and natural substrates would be stable. We explored this idea by using the Grx domain as a bait to trap and identify natural TGR targets. We prepared an affinity column containing the Grx domain and used it to bind proteins from a solubilized rat sperm extract. After extensive washing, the proteins were eluted with DTT, visualized by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A), and identified by mass spectrometry sequencing (Table I). Eight proteins were identified by this procedure. Interestingly, among these, mitochondrial capsule selenoprotein (30Nam S.Y. Maeda S. Ogawa K. Kurohmaru M. Hayashi Y. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 1997; 59: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), two outer dense fiber proteins (31Burmester S. Hoyer-Fender S. Mol. Reprod.

Reprod. 1995; 52: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) are known as structural components of the midpiece and tail regions of sperm, and expression of all identified target proteins except one (hemoglobin) dramatically increases in elongating spermatids. Consistent with our findings that GPx4 is a substrate of TGR, this enzyme was among the proteins trapped by the Grx affinity column (Fig. 5, A and B and Table I).Table ITGR targets in rat spermProtein bandBand sizeProtein sizeProtein IDkDakDa1∼8074.1Outer dense fiber of sperm tails 2 (ODF2)2∼2627Glutathione S-transferase M5 (GSTM5)∼2620.9Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein3∼2429.6Outer dense fiber protein (ODF1)∼2417.1Mitochondrial capsule selenoprotein41720Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPx4)61415.3Testis lipid-binding protein1416Hemoglobin β chain5 and 7-10Mouse TGR Grx domain (bait protein) Open table in a new tab Selenium has long been known to be necessary for male reproduction. Initial studies suggested that a mitochondrial capsule selenoprotein mediated this effect, whereas recent studies revealed that this effect is because of the antioxidant and structural functions of GPx4 (13Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 34Strauss E. Science. 1999; 285: 1339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study now indicates a role for an additional selenoprotein, TGR, in sperm maturation. We propose that this protein may isomerize disulfide bonds in spermatids thus promoting formation of structural components of sperm. Formation of disulfide bonds in proteins is a catalytic process that involves multiple designated redox proteins. Known pathways for disulfide bond formation operate in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells and bacterial periplasm (35Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), and an additional viral pathway has been described in infected mammalian cells (36Senkevich T.G. White C.L. Koonin E.V. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6667-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These pathways are similarly organized. In particular, in each pathway, the formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds in substrate proteins is catalyzed by a thiol/disulfide oxidoreductase that exhibits thioredoxin fold and possesses a catalytic CxxC motif. The disulfide bonds in thiol/disulfide oxidoreductases are further donated to adaptor redox proteins, which are often membrane-bound, and finally to an electron transport chain or directly to molecular oxygen (35Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The periplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum pathways of disulfide bond formation and isomerization, however, do not explain how disulfide bonds are formed in many other locations in cells and tissues. For example, in testes, the process of sperm development and maturation is dependent upon the formation of disulfide bonds in structural proteins. Our findings suggested a role of TGR in this process as a disulfide isomerase. The experiments also established that TGR and GPx4 may constitute a novel disulfide bond formation and isomerization system that operates during spermiogenesis. During later stages of spermiogenesis, mitochondria attach to outer dense fiber proteins of axoneme in the sperm midpiece region, and the structure is stabilized by numerous disulfide bonds in various proteins. Thereafter, the spermatid cytoplasm shrinks, and the plasma membrane is attached to the midpiece of the sperm. Two plasma membrane proteins, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein and lipid-binding protein, which are highly expressed in late spermatids, were found as TGR targets, suggesting that these proteins might also be involved in disulfide-linked sperm structures. Overall, our data suggested that the disulfide bond formation system involving GPx4 and TGR may play an important role in arranging a complex network of spermatid proteins via structural disulfide bonds. Our current view on the mechanism of disulfide bond formation and isomerization in substrate sperm proteins, which involves thiol peroxidase GPx4 and disulfide bond isomerase TGR, is shown in Fig. 6. This novel disulfide forming system is principally different from those operating in either eukaryotic ER (37Fassio A. Sitia R. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or bacterial periplasm (38Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), which employ CxxC motif-containing thiol/disulfide oxidoreductases for both disulfide bond formation and isomerization and oxygen or electron transport chain as electron acceptors (39Bardwell J.C. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 758-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity of the GPx4/TGR system also suggests a source of electron acceptors for disulfide bond formation (i.e. H2O2 or other hydroperoxides) and electron donors for disulfide bond isomerization/reduction (i.e. NADPH) in testes. Moreover, the presence of TGR and GPx4 in various tissues and cellular compartments points to possible roles of these proteins in disulfide bond formation, which are not limited to mitochondrial sheath assembly.

Lunt G.G. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). nAChRs play important roles in memory and learning processes (2Levin E.D. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and absence of functional receptors is associated with multiple diseases including schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, drug addiction, and the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis (3Lindstrom J.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 998: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). nAChRs are also involved in nicotine addiction in tobacco smokers (4Laviolette S.R. van der Kooy D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Taken together, these receptors have prominent roles in disease of the nervous system and are now major targets in drug discovery programs. nAChRs can be divided into muscular nicotinic receptors, which are found at the neuromuscular junction and have (α1)2β1δϵ subunit stoichiometry, and neuronal nAChRs, which exist as homopentameric (e.g. α7) or various heteropentameric (e.g. α2β4) protein assemblies. To date 10 α- and 4β-nAChR subunits have been identified in vertebrates that generate a large diversity of nAChRs with distinct pharmacological and ligand binding characteristics. nAChRs are composed of an N-terminal extracellular ligand binding domain and a transmembrane region that forms the ion channel. Agonist binding stabilizes the open state of the channel and allows ions to pass through the pore (5Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Ligand-binding sites are localized between two adjacent subunits, and residues from both subunits contribute to interaction with the ligand. An α subunit always contributes the principal side, and various subunits can contribute to the more variable complementary side of the interface. It has been very difficult to obtain detailed structural information about these receptors. Electron microscopy analysis has resulted in a 4-Å resolution model of the transmembrane part, which provided insight into the structural and functional aspects of channel opening (6Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Structural information about the ligand binding domains and the subunit interfaces has expanded upon discovery and crystallization of acetylcholine-binding protein from the snail Lymnaea stagnalis (Ls-AChBP) (7Smit A.B.

This crystal structure has been embraced as an excellent model for analyzing the ligand binding domains of nAChR (9Le Novere N. Grutter T. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2002; 19: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) receptors. The application of AChBP as a LGIC model is further supported by recent experiments showing that AChBP can be functionally coupled to the transmembrane region of a 5-HT3 receptor (17Bouzat C. Gumilar F. Spitzmaul G. Wang H.L. Rayes D. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Sine S.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structures of Ls-AChBP in complex with nicotine and carbamylcholine have elucidated the molecular contacts between ligand and protein and are in excellent agreement with biochemical data obtained from nAChR binding studies (18Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). These structures also emphasize the importance of obtaining different high resolution AChBP structures for improving modeling studies as they reveal movements within the protein that are difficult to infer from homology models. The discovery of AChBP has led to the identification and biochemical characterization of AChBP from the snail Aplysia californica (Ac-AChBP) that shows distinct ligand binding properties compared with that of Ls-AChBP (19Hansen S.B. Talley T.T. Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Here we present the pharmacology and x-ray structure of Bulinus truncatus AChBP (Bt-AChBP) and use it to analyze differences in sequence and the concomitant diversity in ligand binding characteristics. We noticed earlier that sequence diversity between subunits is most notable at the subunit interfaces, which lack conserved sites of interaction apart from the ligand-binding site (8Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Here we show that these differences in subunit interface have a significant effect on the stability of the AChBP pentamers. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we have analyzed ligand binding to Bt-AChBP and Ls-AChBP/Bt-AChBP substitution mutants to identify the residues that are responsible for differences in ligand binding affinity. Because the variations in interface contacts and ligand binding are similar to those observed between mammalian receptor sub-types, they provide an essential analysis to unravel the conserved scaffold of the LGIC ligand binding domains. Cloning of B. truncatus AChBP—Live B. truncatus specimens were obtained from the river Nile delta (Egypt) and subsequently cultured in the laboratory under standard (Lymnaea) freshwater conditions. Poly(A) RNA was isolated from the central nervous system. cDNA was generated by reverse transcription using the primer RoRi-(dT17) (5′-ATCGATGGTCGACGCATGCGGATCCAAAGCTTGAATTCGAGCTCT(dT17)-3′). For the identification of Bt-AChBP homologues, a nested PCR strategy was adopted using degenerate oligonucleotides designed to match conserved regions of Ls-AChBP and the nAChRa7 as well as to unique AChBP sequence features. Two nested primers were designed, BABP1 (5′-GA(A/G)AG(C/T)GGNGCNACNTG(T/C)(C/A)GNAT(A/T/C)AA-3′) and BABP2 (5′-CGGAATTCTG(T/C)(C/A)GNAT(A/T/C)AA(A/G)GTNGGNAG(C/T)TGG-3′). A first PCR was performed using 50 pmol of BABP1 primer in combination with 50 pmol of the first adaptor primer Ro (5′-ATCGATGGTCGACGCATGCGGATCC-3′) on the RoRi-generated cDNA template in a volume of 100 μl for 40 cycles (94 °C, 30 s; 63 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 2 min). To increase specificity, a second round of nested amplification was carried out on 1% of the previous PCR reaction mixture using 50 pmol of BABP2 in combination with 50 pmol of nested adaptor primers Ri (5′-GGATCCAAAGCTTGAATTCGAGCTCT-3′) under identical conditions as described above. PCR products from the reaction were separated on agarose gel, and DNA products of appropriate size were isolated, subcloned in pBluescript KS(+) (Stratagene), and sequenced. The full-length Bt-AChBP cDNA was obtained by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends on cDNA templates derived from Bulinus central nervous system using a cloning and sequence strategy as described earlier (20Spijker S. Smit A.B. Eipper B.A. Malik A. Mains R.E. Geraerts W.P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Possible DNA sequence errors introduced by PCR amplification were eliminated by sequence comparison of three independently generated PCRs products. In Situ Hybridization—Localization of Bt-AChBP mRNA was studied in sections of the central nervous system with in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-UTP-labeled cRNA probes. Tissue was fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and 1% acetic acid for 36 h and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5-μm thickness were adhered to SuperFrost-Plus slides (21Goldberg F. Grunewald B. Rosenboom H. Menzel R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 759-768Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After dewaxing, sections were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 4 min and 1% hydroxylammonium chloride in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Next, the slides were dehydrated in alcohol and air-dried. Digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes (sense and antisense) were made on 40 ng of a PCR fragment corresponding to positions 230-511 of the Bt-AChBP open reading frame that included T3 and T7 RNA polymerase promoters. In vitro transcription was performed using either T3 or T7 RNA polymerase containing 1 mm GTP/ATP/CTP, 0.65 mm UTP, and 0.35 mm digoxigenin-11-UTP. Reactions were stopped after 2 h of incubation, treated with 20 units of DNase I (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 10 min, hydrolyzed with 0.2 m NaOH on ice for 30 min, neutralized with Tris-HCl, and ethanol-precipitated. About 10% of the cRNA formed was added per slide. Hybridization was done in 60% formamide at 50 °C for 16 h, washed in 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 50% formamide for 15 min 55 °C, 100 ng/ml RNase A for 25 min, 2× SSC, 50% formamide at 55 °C for 3 × 15 min, and 2× SSC at room temperature for 2 × 5 min. Next, the digoxigenin was visualized using an alkaline phosphatase-labeled antibody directed to digoxigenin. Protein Preparation—The Bt-AChBP gene including its signal sequence was expressed in baculovirus using the pFastbac I vector according to Invitrogen protocols. Secreted AChBP was purified 72 h after infection of SF9 cells as described for Ls-AChBP (18Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The yield was 5 mg/liter, giving a single molecular species with an Mr of ∼250,000 in gel filtration and multi-angle laser light scattering experiments using a Wyatt Technology miniDAWN on-line with a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of a single subunit species (Mr 23,758), indicating that purified Bt-AChBP exists as a stable decamer. The calculated mass of the monomer is 22,938, suggesting that glycosyl groups of Mr ∼ 820 are attached to the potential glycosylation sites Asn-21 and Asn-26. Crystallization—Crystals of Bt-AChBP were grown at room temperature using the hanging drop method. The best crystals were obtained at relatively low protein concentrations (0.2-0.5 mg/ml). Orthorhombic crystals (C2221) of AChBP were grown in a solution of 2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 200 mm lithium sulfate, and 0.1 m CAPS, pH 10.5. Cell constants are: a = 76.95 Å, b = 219.02 Å, c = 166.97 Å, and 1 pentamer per asymmetric unit. Structure Solution and Refinement—We collected data at ID14 EH4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). MOSFLM (22CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) was used for indexing of data and designing the optimal data collection strategy. Data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Programs in the CCP4 suite were used to build and refine the model. An initial model was built with the AMORE molecular replacement program (22CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) using the HEPES-bound Ls-AChBP pentamer (18Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) as the search model. Automated model building was performed using ARP/wARP (24Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar). The structure was rebuilt in O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and refined with REFMAC, including TLS refinement (26Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). The final model has been refined without any non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. CAPS buffer molecules were built and refined at the final stages of refinement. A CAPS buffer molecule could be built within 4 ligand-binding sites in the asymmetric unit (56 atoms in total). In one of these sites the CAPS molecule was estimated to have ∼75% occupancy, whereas density in the 5th site indicated the presence of solute molecules rather than a CAPS molecule. Water molecules were found using the ARP/wARP program (24Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar) in combination with REFMAC cycles. Structure Analysis—Optimized multiple superposition was obtained with LSQMAN (27Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Structure analysis was performed with CCP4 programs (22CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) and central nervous system (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

Interface analysis was performed with CCP4 programs and the EBI web server. The figures were made with ESPript (29Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Metoz F. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar) and PyMol (W. L. DeLano, San Carlos, CA). Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded in the far UV range (195-260 nm) in quartz cells with a 1-mm path length and in the near UV range (250-320 nm) in 5-mm-path length cells on a Jasco (Tokyo, Japan) J-810 CD spectropolarimeter. Proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and diluted to 0.4 and 2 mg/ml for CD measurements in the far UV and near UV region, respectively. Thermal stability was monitored by collecting spectra at different temperatures between 25 and 90 °C. Solutions were equilibrated for 5 min at selective temperatures before spectra were recorded. Bungarotoxin Binding—Biotinylated bungarotoxin (16 μm) was incubated with AChBP (3 μm) in 50 μl of buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, for 1 h at room temperature. 25 μl of streptavidin beads were added to the solution to precipitate α-bungarotoxin-(AChBP). Supernatant was removed, and beads were washed 3 times with 100 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in sample buffer and subsequently loaded on SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie staining. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC experiments were performed with the VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.) in 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, as described previously (18Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Data points were fitted to a model describing a single type of binding site using software supplied by the ITC manufacturer. Identification and Cloning of B. truncatus AChBP—We analyzed B. truncatus central nervous system-derived cDNA templates for the presence of AChBP homologs using a PCR strategy and degenerate oligonucleotides designed to target potentially sequence-conserved regions in Ls-AChBP. The obtained sequences were made full-length by 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Two AChBP homologs, Bt-AChBP and Bt-AChBP-2, were identified with 96% sequence identity. Bt-AChBP is expressed in glial cells of the central nervous system of the animal (Fig. 1D), similar to the expression of Ls-AChBP (7Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J. Kits K.S. Lodder H. van der Schors R.C. van Elk R. Sorgedrager B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Geraerts W.P. Nature. 2001; 411: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1A a sequence comparison of the AChBPs and members of the Cys-loop family show that Bt-AChBP shares 41% sequence identity with Ls-AChBP, 29% with the recently characterized Ac-AChBP (19Hansen S.B.

The Bulinus protein and the other AChBPs contain a functionally conserved nAChR ligand-binding site. All residues on the principal side (loop A, Tyr-88; loop B, Trp-142; loop C, Tyr-X-Cys-Cys-X-Tyr motif) are present, and the residues on the complementary side are conserved (loop D, Trp-51 and Gln-53) or fall within the sequence variation that is observed in nicotinic receptors (loop E). Residues of the subunit interface, however, show very little conservation in Bt-AChBP and the other AChBPs. This variability is also found between members of the LGICs (8Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar), suggesting that the conserved ligand-binding site and the monomer interface have evolved as discrete parts during evolution. We produced Bt-AChBP and Bt-AChBP-2 in the yeast Pichia pastoris and in a baculovirus expression system in Sf9 insect cells. Although the two Bt-AChBPs share 96% sequence identity with conservative substitutions, Bt-AChBP-2 did not express well in a heterologous system, and we decided to focus on the characterization of Bt-AChBP. In solution, the purified protein behaves as a decamer, as shown by gel filtration and multi-angle laser light scattering (data not shown), in contrast to the Lymnaea protein, which behaves as a pentamer. However, the decamer observed in solution for the Bulinus protein is also seen for the Lymnaea protein in the crystallographic packing in most crystal forms. Crystal Structure of Bt-AChBP—The Bt-AChBP crystal structure was determined at 2.0 Å by molecular replacement with the Ls-AChBP structure as a search model (Fig. 2). In contrast to all Ls-AChBP structures, the crystallographic data were excellent and did not require non-crystallographic symmetry (Table I). Refinement resulted in an R-factor of 20.9% and free R-factor of 24.9%, in which residues Gln-1-Lys-203 from each subunit could be built into the electron density. There are two potential N-glycosylation sites at Asn-21 and Asn-26, but weak sugar density indicates that only Asn-26 is glycosylated. The r. m. s. deviation between subunits is between 0.25 and 0.45 Å on 196 Cαs, excluding the major varying region (residues 154-161) in the F-loop.Table ICrystallographic parametersSpace groupC2221Unit cell parametersa77.0b219.0c167.0Resolution (Å)50-2.0Redundancy5.1 (3.4)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution data shell (2.07-2.0 Å).Rmerge (%)bRmerge=∑|I−〈I〉|/∑〈I〉.12.9 (77.9)I/sigI12 (1.7)Mosaicity (°)0.74Completeness (%)98 (89)RefinementResolution (Å)12-2.0Reflections88,439Atoms8,566R factor (%)cR-factor=∑||Fobs|−|Fcalc||/∑|Fobs|.20.9Rfree (%)dRfree = R-factor for 5% of reflections that were not used in refinement.24.9r.m.s. bonds (%)0.013r.m.s. angle (°)1.523a Values in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution data shell (2.07-2.0 Å).b Rmerge=∑|I−〈I〉|/∑〈I〉.c R-factor=∑||Fobs|−|Fcalc||/∑|Fobs|.d Rfree = R-factor for 5% of reflections that were not used in refinement. Open table in a new tab Bt-AChBP was crystallized in the presence of CAPS buffer, pH 10.5, and a CAPS molecule could be built with confidence into the electron density in four of five binding sites. Three sites are fully occupied by CAPS, whereas the fourth site shows a lower occupancy (75%). The electron density at the fifth site indicates a low occupancy of CAPS and the presence of solute molecules. Interestingly, double conformations of Tyr-88 were observed in the two binding sites with the lower occupancy of CAPS, illustrating the movement of the tyrosine side chain upon ligand binding. This ligand-dependent change is similar to that observed for Tyr-89 in Ls-AChBP (18Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). After superposition of Bt-AChBP and Ls-AChBP with nicotine bound, CAPS and nicotine closely superimpose with positive nitrogen positions agreeing within 1.1 Å. No CAPS binding could be identified in bungarotoxin competition studies and ITC, indicating that the binding affinity is very weak. Contacts of the CAPS molecule are given in Fig. 3, showing hydrogen bond interactions with the carbonyl oxygen of Trp-142 to the positive charge in the buffer, as was observed for other agonists. Two additional hydrogen bonds are seen to the sulfate portion of the molecule. Structural Comparison to Ls-AChBP—The structure of Bt-AChBP is remarkably similar to that of Ls-AChBP despite the low sequence conservation. All secondary structure elements are conserved, and most of these are of equal length (Fig. 4A)in the two snail AChBPs. In automated superposition of the individual domains using LSQMAN, a core of 170-180 Cα atoms superimposes, with an r.m.s. density of 1.2 Å against each of the three high resolution structures of Ls-AChBP (18Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Comparison of the entire AChBP pentamers, based on a superposition of the Cα atoms of the core residues of each subunit, shows that differences between both AChBPs are limited to structural variation within each subunit itself rather than a change in the relative orientation of the subunits. The most pronounced differences are at the “top” of the molecule, furthest from the membrane interface in nAChRs (Fig. 2B). There the N-terminal helix is differently oriented, and the β2-β3 region is reorganized and includes a longer 310 helix. The decamer of the Bulinus protein is formed by a crystallographic 2-fold axis, stacking the pentamers with their N termini to each other. Residues that are responsible for decamer formation are not conserved in Ls-AChBP. These include 10 salt bridges between residues Arg-3 and Glu-13 in all Bt-AChBP subunits. The loop 9 (or F-loop region, residues 155-167) that is disordered in most of the Ls-AChBP subunits also has a different structure in the Bulinus protein. The most striking difference between Ls- and Bt-AChBP is the conformation of a series of critical loops on the side of the pentamer that would be close to the transmembrane region in the LGICs, loops 2 (residues 41-44) and 7 (Cys-loop, residues 122-135), and the C terminus (loop 11, residues 200-203) (Fig. 2B). All these loops are oriented differently with respect to the AChBP core between the two species due to rigid body shifts. These rigid body shifts are intriguing, and several explanations for this shift in orientation can be given. They could be an intrinsic feature of the Bt-AChBP structure, or alternatively, they could be due to the high pH of the crystallization buffer or the result from CAPS binding. Pentamer Interface and Stability—In our initial analysis of the Ls-AChBP structure we noticed that the interface between monomers was poorly conserved between different LGIC sub-families and that most of the conserved residues contribute to the hydrophobic core of the monomer (8Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). The availability of a second crystal structure provides the opportunity to analyze what the effect is of such a variable interface. This is essential because these interfaces harbor the conserved ligand-binding site. In the pentamer structure each monomer contributes to two separate interfaces. Thus, the A subunit contributes its so-called “principal side” to the AB interface and its “complementary side” to the EA interface. Below the alignment of Fig. 4A, an analysis of the monomer A residues in the AB (indicated by B) and the EA interface (indicated by E) are given for the two molluscan AChBP crystal structures. From this comparison it is clear that, although the same loops are involved in the protein-protein interface, the actual contacts are completely different. The only residues that make similar contacts are found in the binding site. The mapping of interface residues onto the surface of the monomer shows that indeed the interfaces are very different (Fig. 4, B-E). However, the overall characteristics of these interfaces are highly similar in terms of size, hydrophobicity, and accessible surface area. To obtain a better understanding of the stability of the interface, we used CD to compare the thermal stability of the molluscan AChBPs. As expected, spectra recorded for Bt-AChBP and Ls-AChBP at the far UV region show the characteristics of a structure that is largely composed of β-sheets (Fig. 5, A and B). They are similar to the spectrum obtained for the monomeric ligand binding domain of the muscle α-subunit from mouse (30West Jr., A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. J. Biol.

Here we use Xenopus and zebrafish as models to investigate the mechanism of action of a well-known teratogen, valproic acid (VPA). VPA is a drug used in treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder but causes spina bifida if taken during pregnancy. VPA has several biochemical activities, including inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). To investigate the mechanism of action of VPA, we compared its effects in Xenopus and zebrafish embryos with those of known HDAC inhibitors and noninhibitory VPA analogs. We found that VPA and other HDAC inhibitors cause very similar and characteristic developmental defects whereas VPA analogs with poor inhibitory activity in vivo have little teratogenic effect. Unbiased microarray analysis revealed that the effects of VPA and trichostatin A (TSA), a structurally unrelated HDAC inhibitor, are strikingly concordant. The concordance is apparent both by en masse correlation of fold-changes and by detailed similarity of dose-response profiles of individual genes. Together, the results demonstrate that the teratogenic effects of VPA are very likely mediated specifically by inhibition of HDACs."

Recently it has been found that JAK proteins may play important roles in regulating the cellular localization and traffic of their cognate receptors. In the case of the EpoR and oncostatin M receptor, expression of their cognate JAKs, JAK2 and JAK1, was found important for receptor cell surface localization, with enhanced endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi maturation. The overall cellular levels of these receptors were not changed by the presence or absence of JAKs (17Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 18Radtke S. Hermanns H.M. Haan C. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Gascan H. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11297-11305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Sequences encompassing the N-terminal domain JH7-JH6 regions of JAKs were required for these effects. Early on after the discovery of the JAK-STAT pathway, the IFNAR1 subunit of the type I IFN receptor complex was shown to require the expression of Tyk2 for stability at the cell surface (19Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uze G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11839-11844Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This effect was mediated by sequences in the JH7-JH6 region of Tyk2 (20Richter M.F. Dumenil G. Uze G. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24723-24729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Tyk2 expression leads to enhanced protein levels of IFNAR1 by preventing endosomal targeting (21Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Alcover A. Eid P. Uze G. Pellegrini S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). JAK3 was found to promote cell surface localization of the common gamma (γc) subunit of the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 receptor complexes (22Hofmann S.R. Lam A.Q. Frank S. Zhou Y.J. Ramos H.L. Kanno Y. Agnello D. Youle R.J. O'Shea J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5039-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of JAK1, but not of JAK2, Tyk2, or JAK3, leads to enhanced cell surface localization of IL-9Rα and IL-2Rβ, whereas JAK3 and not the other JAKs promotes enhanced cell surface localization of the γc. 2Y. Royer, P. J. Courtoy, and S. N. Constantinescu, unpublished observations. 2Y. Royer, P. J. Courtoy, and S. N. Constantinescu, unpublished observations.In these cases, it was the FERM domain of JAKs and not the kinase or pseudokinase domain that was required for mediating enhanced cell surface localization of receptors. Because the endogenous JAK1 was reported to be exclusively localized at the plasma membrane via interactions with cytokine receptors (23Behrmann I. Smyczek T. Heinrich P.C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Komyod W. Giese B. Muller-Newen G. Haan S. Haan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35486-35493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), it is now considered that receptor-JAK complexes function as one unit, equivalent with receptor tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, the plasma membrane localization of JAK3 depends on coexpressed γc (22Hofmann S.R. Lam A.Q. Frank S. Zhou Y.J. Ramos H.L. Kanno Y. Agnello D. Youle R.J. O'Shea J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5039-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Taken together these data indicate that JAKs may fulfill important roles other than triggering downstream signaling by cytokine receptors. The traffic of the TpoR to and from the cell surface is special among cytokine receptors for three reasons. First, TpoR was found to recycle to the membrane in hematopoietic cells after activation and withdrawal of ligand (24Dahlen D.D. Broudy V.C. Drachman J.G. Blood. 2003; 102: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Second, clearance of circulating Tpo may occur via binding, internalization of the ligand-receptor complex, and degradation of Tpo by platelets, which express high affinity receptors for Tpo (25Fielder P.J. Gurney A.L. Stefanich E. Marian M. Moore M.W. Carver-Moore K. de Sauvage F.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Fielder P.J. Hass P. Nagel M. Stefanich E. Widmer R.

TpoR apparently is not recycled in platelets, but its recycling in myeloid progenitors and hematopoietic cell lines may be relevant for Tpo functions in early hematopoiesis. Third and most interestingly, TpoR traffic, maturation, glycosylation, and stability were found to be altered in myeloproliferative diseases such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and idiopathic myelofibrosis (29Moliterno A.R. Hankins W.D. Spivak J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 30Moliterno A.R. Spivak J.L. Blood. 1999; 94: 2555-2561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether this defective maturation is linked to the pathogenesis of these diseases or is a sign of stress hematopoiesis (31Cohen-Solal K. Vitrat N. Titeux M. Vainchenker W. Wendling F. Blood. 1999; 93: 2859-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is not known, but all available evidence indicates that the study of TpoR traffic may reveal novel regulation mechanisms. Thus, we investigated whether the two JAKs can affect TpoR traffic and metabolism. Here we show that JAK2 and Tyk2, but not JAK1 or JAK3, strongly promote cell surface localization of the TpoR by stimulating recycling and enhancing the protein stability of the mature, Golgi-processed form of the TpoR. Expression of JAK2 or Tyk2 did not change the internalization kinetics of the TpoR, whereas it promoted recycling. Under cycloheximide treatment, which blocks protein synthesis, inhibitors of proteasome degradation prolonged the half-life of the mature TpoR band in the absence of overexpressed JAK2 or Tyk2, suggesting that a fraction of the mature TpoR is normally degraded via the proteasome. Confocal microscopy studies suggest that JAK2 and Tyk2 prevent degradation of an intracellular pool of TpoR, which partially colocalizes with recycling transferrin. By site-directed mutagenesis, we show that an intact FERM domain of JAK2 or of Tyk2 is required for this effect and that receptor sequences encompassing Box1 and Box2 are likely to make the first contact with JAK FERM domains. Although a hydrophobic motif preceding Box1 is not required for JAK2-dependent traffic effects, this motif is crucial, as for the homologous EpoR, for switching on JAK kinase activity upon ligand binding to the TpoR extracellular domain. We discuss the significance of our data for the mechanisms of signaling, down-modulation, and recycling of the TpoR. cDNA Constructs—Receptors were tagged after the cleavage site of the signal sequence as described (32Dumoutier L.

Viruses have been used to transduce Ba/F3 cells by centrifugation in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). The efficiency of infection was usually around 40-50%. Populations of cells expressing the marker above a predetermined level (top 10%) were isolated by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Surface Expression of HA-TpoR and HA-EpoR—Surface expression of receptors was measured in Ba/F3 cells by flow cytometry using 10 μg/ml monoclonal anti-HA antibody (HA.11, Covance) and 5 μg/ml R-phycoerythrin-conjugated donkey F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), as described previously (17Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The monoclonal HA.11 antibody was iodinated with Na125I to a specific activity of 15 Curies/g using IODO-GEN-precoated tubes (Pierce) following the recommendations of the manufacturer. 125I-Anti-HA binding was used to measure the cell surface localization of the TpoR. The cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 μg/ml 125I-anti-HA in the presence or absence of 200 μg/ml cold anti-HA and then separated from unbound antibodies by a centrifugation through a cushion of serum. Bound and unbound antibody fractions were measured using a gamma counter. All measurements were done in triplicate. Immunoprecipitation, Endoglycosidase H (Endo-H) Digestion, and Immunoblotting—Ba/F3 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer with sodium orthovanadate, sodium fluoride, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), as described previously (40Seubert N. Royer Y. Staerk J. Kubatzky K.F. Moucadel V. Krishnakumar S. Smith S.O. Constantinescu S.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1239-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The lysates were then incubated with antibodies against the HA tag (monoclonal HA.11). Immune complexes were recovered by binding to protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen). Proteins bound to the beads were then eluted with 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol and digested or not with Endo-H (New England BioLabs) for 1 h at 37 °C. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. Ba/F3 cells stably transduced were lysed directly in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and Western blot analysis was performed with anti-JAK1 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-JAK2 (C-20, Santa Cruz), anti-JAK3 (C-21, Santa Cruz), anti-Tyk2 (C-20, Santa Cruz), anti-CIS (N-19, Santa Cruz), anti-HA, or anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibodies. To investigate the phosphorylation of the TpoR signaling partners, the cells were starved in RPMI medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Roche Applied Science) for 4 h at 37 °C and were then stimulated with 10 ng/ml Tpo for 15 min. Phosphorylation was verified with specific anti-phosphorylated antibodies against JAK2 Tyr1007-Tyr1008, Tyk2 Tyr1054-Tyr1055, STAT1 Tyr701, STAT3 Tyr705, and STAT5 Tyr694 (all from Cell Signaling Technology). Bound primary antibodies were detected with secondary antibodies coupled to the horseradish peroxidase and with the enhanced chemoluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Measurements of TpoR Half-life, Degradation, and Recycling—Stably transduced Ba/F3 cells were incubated at 37 °C with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide for different periods of time to block protein synthesis. Control cells were kept nontreated to have 100% cell surface localization of the TpoR and γc at the same moment. Analysis of the surface pool of the TpoR or γc was performed by flow cytometry (HA.11) on the living cells because both receptors were tagged with HA at their N terminus. Three independent experiments were performed. An aliquot of each cell line was taken at each time point to verify the receptor expression by Western blot. For measuring the contribution of proteasome or lysosome-mediated degradation of the TpoR, stably transduced Ba/F3 cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3-20 h with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide and proteasome inhibitors MG132 (10 μm) or lactacystin (10 μm) (41Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar) or with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide and lysosome inhibitors chloroquine (200 μm) (42Wibo M. Poole B. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 63: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) or leupeptin (200 μm) (43Kirschke H. Langner J. Wiederanders B. Ansorge S. Bohley P. Broghammer U. Acta Biol. Med. Ger. 1976; 35: 285-299PubMed Google Scholar, 44Kirschke H. Langner J. Wiederanders B. Ansorge S. Bohley P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 74: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Cells were then lysed and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against HA for the relative levels of the mature and immature TpoR. Internalization Measurements—Ba/F3 cells expressing the HA-tagged TpoR or γc along with various JAKs were labeled for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 μg/ml 125I-anti-HA in the presence or absence of 200 μg/ml cold anti-HA. After three washes, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for different periods of time. Cell surface radioactivity was removed by acid wash for 1 h at 4 °C (250 mm sodium acetate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 0.5), and acid-resistant radioactivity was intracellular. The mean efficiency of the acid wash was ∼75%. Viability of Ba/F3 cells in this acidic buffer was verified at room temperature for 2 h. Separation between the cells and the supernatant was performed by centrifugation through a cushion of serum. Radioactivity was measured using a gamma counter. Counts that could not be stripped by the acid wash in the absence of internalization were subtracted from the overall counts. All measurements were done in triplicate, and three independent experiments were performed. Confocal Microscopy—Transferrin-Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) was absorbed and recycled by the cells for 25 min at 37 °C and then washed. Adherence of Ba/F3 cells was achieved by spinning the cells softly on poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.05% saponin (Sigma). Quenching of the fluorescence and blocking of the nonspecific labeling were realized by the addition of 50 mm glycine at all steps and 100 μg/ml goat γ-globulins during the 30-min blocking step. The cells were stained with monoclonal anti-HA followed by a goat anti-mouse IgG linked to Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes). The cells were treated with methanol/acetone at -20 °C to remove the GFP and mounted with ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes). The complete procedure was performed at room temperature. For the LAMP1 staining, the cells were incubated with anti-HA followed by a goat anti-mouse IgG linked to Alexa Fluor 647 (Molecular Probes) and anti-mouse LAMP1 (1D4B, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) followed by a goat anti-rat IgG linked to Alexa Fluor 568. Image acquisitions were made on a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal laser scanning imaging system associated with the Lasersharp 2000 (Bio-Rad) acquisition software. For the LAMP1 staining, similar experiments were performed with HeLa cells that were transiently transfected using ExGen500 with the cDNA coding for the HA-tagged TpoR or γc. The cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal HA.11 followed by a goat anti-rabbit IgG linked to Alexa Fluor 568 and anti-human LAMP1 (H4A3, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) followed by a goat anti-mouse IgG linked to Alexa Fluor 647. Assay for Tpo-dependent Proliferation—Ba/F3 cells expressing wild type TpoR or mutated TpoR were washed three times in RPMI 1640 medium to remove IL-3 completely. Washed cells were plated at 100,000 cells/well in a 24-well plate with 1 ng/ml Tpo in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Proliferation was measured after 3, 5, and 7 days using a Coulter Counter Z1. All experiments were done in triplicate. Dual Luciferase Assays—STAT1 and STAT3 transcriptional activation was assessed by measuring luciferase production in γ2A cells transfected with the pGRR5-Luc, which contains five copies of a GRR sequence (32Dumoutier L. Van Roost E. Colau D. Renauld J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10144-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). MAP kinase activation was assessed with the pSRE-Luc construct (45Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). As an internal control, we used the pRL-TK vector (Promega) containing the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter. γ2A cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 8 h and then stimulated or not with 50 ng/ml Tpo. The cells were lysed 16 h after transfection, and luciferase assays were performed in triplicate using the dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). Effect of JAK Proteins on Cell Surface Levels of TpoR—To study the effect of the different Janus kinases on the cell surface expression of the TpoR, we constructed four different Ba/F3 cell lines overexpressing JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, or Tyk2, as we have described previously for JAK2 (40Seubert N. Royer Y. Staerk J. Kubatzky K.F. Moucadel V. Krishnakumar S. Smith S.O. Constantinescu S.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1239-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This was achieved by retroviral transduction using bicistronic retroviral vectors, which code for the gene of interest separated from a marker (GFP, CD4, or CD2) by an IRES (33Liu X. Constantinescu S.N. Sun Y. Bogan J.S. Hirsch D. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The cells were sorted for high marker expression (CD4 or CD2), and the JAK protein levels were measured by Western blot (Fig. 1A). Compared with parental Ba/F3 cells, the transduced cells overexpressed 7-10-fold higher levels of JAKs. Parental Ba/F3 cells and the JAK-expressing cells were then transduced by a TpoR expressing an HA tag at the N terminus. Surface levels of TpoR were measured by FACS analysis using monoclonal HA.11 antibody. Fig. 1B shows that JAK2 and Tyk2 increased 3-4 times the TpoR cell surface levels, whereas JAK3 had no influence on the surface pool of TpoR. Although JAK2 and Tyk2 are the Janus kinases activated by TpoR, JAK1 was also found in a complex with the TpoR and other signaling molecules (i.e. SH-PTP2) (46Mu S.X. Xia M. Elliott G. Bogenberger J. Swift S. Bennett L. Lappinga D.L. Hecht R. Lee R. Saris C.J. Blood. 1995; 86: 4532-4543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although Tpo binding to the TpoR does not activate JAK1. In Fig. 1B we show that overexpression of JAK1 increases the cell surface levels of TpoR weakly, but this effect is much less significant than the effect of JAK2 or Tyk2. In all cases, the increases in cell surface receptor levels were detected for similar GFP levels, which indicate similar expression of the bicistronic constructs coding for the receptors in the absence or presence of JAK overexpression. Determination of the Structural Requirements of JAK2 and Tyk2 for Enhancing TpoR Cell Surface Levels—Next, we investigated whether these increases were linked to the kinase activity of JAK2. Wild type JAK2 and JAK2 K882D (kinase-inactive JAK2) were transduced in IL-9R-expressing Ba/F3 cells proliferating in 50 units/ml IL-9. The use of IL-9 allowed us to avoid the negative selection against JAK2 K882D observed in IL-3-proliferating Ba/F3 because IL-3 signaling requires JAK2 activity. Cell surface TpoR levels were enhanced in the presence of mutated JAK2 K882D, but not to the level induced by the wild type JAK2 (Fig. 1C). This is in opposition to the EpoR, where JAK2 K882D was able to promote the receptor cell surface expression to at least the same extent as the wild type JAK2 (Fig. 1C and Ref. 17Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and where JAK2 activity was shown to be required for targeting the receptor for degradation (47Walrafen P. Verdier F. Kadri Z. Chretien S. Lacombe C. Mayeux P. Blood. 2005; 105: 600-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For the TpoR, the kinase activity of the JAK2 JH1 domain could be involved in regulating receptor cell surface levels. Because the positive effects of JAKs on cytokine receptor cell surface levels involved the N terminus FERM domains of JAKs (17Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 18Radtke S. Hermanns H.M. Haan C. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Gascan H. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Biol.

We introduced mutations in the FERM domain of JAK2 and Tyk2 by replacing a conserved tyrosine residue by an alanine, singly (Tyr → Ala for JAK1, JAK2, and"

Those utilizing NAD+ are attractive drug targets because of the unique cofactor requirement for ligase activity. We report here the crystal structure of the adenylation domain of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis NAD+-dependent ligase with bound AMP. The adenosine nucleoside moiety of AMP adopts a syn-conformation. The structure also captures a new spatial disposition between the two subdomains of the adenylation domain. Based on the crystal structure and an in-house compound library, we have identified a novel class of inhibitors for the enzyme using in silico docking calculations. The glycosyl ureide-based inhibitors were able to distinguish between NAD+- and ATP-dependent ligases as evidenced by in vitro assays using T4 ligase and human DNA ligase I. Moreover, assays involving an Escherichia coli strain harboring a temperature-sensitive ligase mutant and a ligase-deficient Salmonella typhimurium strain suggested that the bactericidal activity of the inhibitors is due to inhibition of the essential ligase enzyme. The results can be used as the basis for rational design of novel antibacterial agents.

DNA ligases are vital enzymes in replication and repair and catalyze the formation of a phosphodiester linkage between adjacent termini in double-stranded DNA through similar mechanisms (1Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). These enzymes can be divided into two classes, viz. NAD+- and ATP-dependent ligases, based on the cofactor specificities (2Engler M.J. Richardson C.C. Boyer P.D The Enzymes. 15. Academic Press, New York1982: 3-29Google Scholar). NAD+-dependent DNA ligases, commonly called LigA, are found in bacteria and entomopox-viruses (3Wilkinson A. Day J. Bowater R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 20Sriskanda V. Moyer R.W. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36100-36109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas ATP-dependent ligases are ubiquitous (3Wilkinson A. Day J. Bowater R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although there is little sequence homology between the eubacterial and eukaryotic enzymes, they exhibit some structural homology in specific domains (4Timson D.J. Singleton M.R. Wigley D.B. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 301-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5Doherty A.J. Suh S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The mechanistic steps involved in enzymatic action are also broadly conserved. Briefly, in the first step, the mode of action involves an attack on the α-phosphorus of ATP or NAD+ by the enzyme, releasing pyrophosphate or NMN and forming a ligase-adenylate intermediate. In the second step, the bound AMP is transferred to the 5′-end of DNA to form a DNA-adenylate intermediate. AMP is released in the third step, where the protein catalyzes the joining of the 3′-nicked DNA to the DNA-adenylate intermediate. These steps involve large conformational changes and also encircling and partial unwinding of the nicked DNA substrate (6Pascal J.M. O'Brien P.J. Tomkinson A.E. Ellenberger T.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis codes for at least three different types of ATP-dependent ligases and a NAD+-dependent ligase (10Gong C. Martins A. Bongiorno P. Glickman M. Shuman S. J. Biol.

No LigA structure from mycobacterial sources is available to date. However, the crystal structure of the full-length protein is available for the Thermus filiformis enzyme (TfiLigA), 1The abbreviations used are: TfiLigA, T. filiformis LigA; EfaLigA, E. faecalis LigA; MtuLigA, M. tuberculosis LigA; MICs, minimum inhibitory concentrations; EcoLigA, E. coli LigA. whereas structures of the adenylation domain are available for the Bacillus stearothermophilus and Enterococcus faecalis (EfaLigA) enzymes (7Gajiwala K.C. Pinko C. Structure (Camb). 2004; 12: 1449-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J.K. Kim H.-K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W.

Structure (Camb.). 1999; 7: 35-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The structures have shown that the enzyme has a modular architecture consisting of distinct domains. The adenylation domain contains the cofactor-binding site and can be divided further into two subdomains. Subdomain 1a contains the NMN-binding pocket, whereas subdomain 1b contains the AMP-binding site. The EfaLigA structures show that the NAD+-binding site is generated by a specific spatial disposition of the two subdomains where subdomain 1a is in close proximity to the AMP-binding site in subdomain 1b (7Gajiwala K.C. Pinko C. Structure (Camb). 2004; 12: 1449-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Structure-based mutagenesis experiments have also led to the identification of residues important for NAD+ recognition and support systematic active-site remodeling in different reaction steps (17Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12137-12144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). With the problem of multiple drug resistance spreading across the world, it is important to find inhibitors from different chemical classes with new modes of action. In this context, specific inhibitors for NAD+-dependent ligases are being identified, as no drug is known to act against this enzyme so far. Other groups have very recently identified compounds belonging to arylamino and pyridochromanone classes as specific inhibitors of NAD+-dependent DNA ligases (18Ciarrocchi G. MacPhee D.G. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2766-2772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Brőtz-Oesterhelt H. Knezevic I. Bartel S. Lampe T. Warnecke-Eberz U. Ziegelbauer K. Häbich D. Labischiinski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39435-39442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). New inhibitors can also be potentially used as broad bactericidal agents, as NAD+-specific enzymes have not been identified in eukaryotic genomes and are exclusively found in eubacteria (3Wilkinson A. Day J. Bowater R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and some viruses (20Sriskanda V. Moyer R.W. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36100-36109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this work, we report the crystal structure of the adenylation domain of the M. tuberculosis NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (MtuLigA) bound to AMP. The structure captures a new spatial disposition of the two subdomains in the protein. The AMP conformation in the crystal structure is different from that observed in the TfiLigA structure, but is similar to the AMP part of NAD+ in its co-crystal structure with Efa-LigA. Based on the crystal structure and in silico docking studies, we have identified glycosyl ureides as a new class of DNA ligase inhibitors. In vitro assays and bactericidal activities assayed using specific E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium strains demonstrated that the compounds are able to distinguish between NAD+- and ATP-dependent ligases. Although the M. tuberculosis enzyme was inhibited in the low micromolar range, human DNA ligase I was inhibited only at much higher concentrations. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The adenylation domain of MtuLigA (Rv3014c) consists of residues 1-328. The DNA sequence encoding this domain was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA of M. tuberculosis H37Rv using forward primer 5′-GGAATTCCATGGGCTCCCCAGACGCCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATCGGATCCCTCGGGCGGGTACTTGTAGG-3′ containing NcoI and BamHI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The amplified PCR product was digested and ligated into pQE60 (Qiagen Inc.) digested at same site. Incorporation of NcoI into the forward primer leads to replacement of the first two amino acids in the sequence: valine and serine to methionine and glycine, respectively. The integrity of the insert was verified by sequencing. The construct was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) and grown in LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin to A600 ∼ 0.5. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.8 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 28 °C for 8 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation; resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole (buffer A); and lysed by sonication. The crude lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-iminodiacetic acid column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A, and protein was eluted using a 10-500 mm imidazole gradient. Purified fractions were pooled, precipitated using ammonium sulfate (45% saturation), redissolved in a minimum volume of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol), and loaded onto a Superdex S-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B. Purified protein was pooled and concentrated to 15 mg/ml using a Centricon concentrator (10-kDa cutoff; Amicon, Inc.). Protein concentrations were determined with Bradford reagent (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of the MtuLigA adenylation domain were grown by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method. A drop containing 2 μl each of 12 mg/ml protein solution in buffer B containing 4 mm NAD+ and reservoir solution containing 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m Na-HEPES (pH 7.6), and 1.5 m (NH4)2SO4 kept for 1 week at 24 °C yielded crystals of typical dimensions (0.7 × 0.5 × 0.2 mm). These were mounted on capillaries, and x-ray data were collected at room temperature on a MAR imaging plate mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode generator. The crystals diffracted weakly to 3.15 Å, and the data were overall complete to 99.4% with an average redundancy of 8.7. Data integration, reduction, and scaling were performed using the DENZO/SCALEPACK suite of programs (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) with models derived from the T. filiformis structure (Protein Data Bank code 1V9P) after stripping it of cofactors and solvent molecules. The two subdomains of the adenylation domain were placed independently in the asymmetric unit. Refinements were carried out using XPLOR (25Brünger A.T. Karplus M. Petsko G.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1989; 45: 50-61Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar), whereas model building was carried out using Turbo-Frodo (26Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Inc., Mountain View, CA1989: 77-78Google Scholar). Rounds of model building and simulated annealing refinement were continued until R and Rfree values converged to 25.3 and 31.4%, respectively. The final model consists of residues 8-328, AMP, and 4 water molecules. More than 91% of all residues are in the core regions of the Ramachandran map (27Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). The geometric parameters are also well within acceptable values for a model at this resolution. The refinement and model statistics are summarized in Table I. The coordinates have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank with code 1ZAU (28Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27937) Google Scholar). In Silico Docking—The current crystal structure and also that of NAD+-bound EfaLigA (Protein Data Bank code 1TAE) were used as models in in silico ligand docking calculations using the programs AutoDock Version 3.0 (29Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9301) Google Scholar) and Gold Version 2.2 (30Verdonk M.L. Cole J.C. Hartshorn M.J. Murray C.W. Taylor R.D. Proteins. 2003; 52: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). We used a Perl/Python-based script to add the capability of automated docking against a ligand data base to AutoDock. A computer cluster consisting of Silicon Graphics Origin 350 servers and Silicon Graphics Octane workstations was used for the computation and analysis of docked complexes. The NAD+-binding site in MtuLigA was generated by superposing subdomain 1a onto the orientation observed in the NAD+-bound structure of EfaLigA (Protein Data Bank code 1TAE). The docked ligands form part of an in-house collection of ∼15,000 compounds whose synthesis expertise is also available. It can be filtered for activity against tuberculosis, etc., based on prior in-house experiments. Control docking runs to optimize the docking parameters were carried out using AMP and NAD+, whose cocrystal structures with LigA were available in the Protein Data Bank for comparison. Selected compounds from the best 10% docked complexes (as observed from the AutoDock scoring and Gold fitness scores) were taken up further for in vitro and in vivo ligase assays. In Vitro Activity—In vitro assays for ligase activity were performed using a 40-bp double-stranded DNA substrate carrying a single-strand nick between bases 22 and 23 (31Timson D.J. Wigley D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This substrate was created in Tris/EDTA buffer by annealing a 22-mer (5′-CCT GGA CAT AGA CTC GTA CCT T-3′) and a 18-mer (5′-AGC TGG ATC ACT GGA CAT-3′) to a complementary 40-mer (5′-ATG TCC AGT GAT CCA GCT AAG GTA CGA GTC TAT GTC CAG G-3′). The 18-mer was radiolabeled at the 5′-end by incubating 10 μg of the oligonucleotide with 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology) and 30 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase for 1 h, followed by 10 min at 70 °C (32Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11083-11089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The unincorporated label was removed using a Sephadex G-25 column. The labeled 40-bp nicked DNA substrate was used to assay the in vitro inhibitory activity of different compounds against MtuLigA, bacteriophage T4 ligase, and human DNA ligase I. The full-length MtuLigA protein was cloned into the NdeI/NcoI-digested pET41a vector (Novagen). After expression in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, the C-terminally His-tagged protein was purified according to standard procedures. The assays were done with 2 ng of the purified protein. Reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% Me2SO, 2 μm NAD+, 2 pmol of 32P-labeled nicked duplex DNA substrate, and different concentration of compounds were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Reactions were quenched with formamide and EDTA. The reaction products were resolved electrophoretically on 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in 90 mm Tris borate and 2.5 mm EDTA. Autoradiograms of the gels were developed, and the extent of ligation was measured by scanning the gel using ImageMaster 1D Elite software (Amersham Biosciences). All the compounds were dissolved in 100% Me2SO. The compound solutions comprised 0.1 volume of the ligation reaction mixture; thus, 10% Me2SO was included in all the control reactions. The activity assay was performed in the same way for T4 ligase in a volume of 15 μl containing 0.05 unit of enzyme (Amersham Biosciences), 2 pmol of labeled template, and 66 μm ATP in 66 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 6.6 mm MgCl2,10mm dithiothreitol, and 10% Me2SO. The human DNA ligase I expression plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified as described previously (33Mackenney V.J. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11550-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Purified protein was concentrated to 2 mg/ml. 2 μg protein was used for assay in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2,5mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm ATP as described above. The IC50 values were determined by plotting the relative ligation activity versus inhibitor concentration and fitting to equation Vi/V0 = IC50/(IC50 + [I]) using GraphPad Prism®. V0 and Vi represent the rates of ligation in the absence and presence of inhibitor, respectively, and [I] refers to the inhibitor concentration. Antibacterial Activity and Inhibition of Ligase in Vivo—The recombinant plasmid pRBL (34Ren Z.J. Baumann R.G. Black L.W. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 195: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) containing the gene for T4 DNA ligase in pTrc99A was transformed into the E. coli GR501 ligAts mutant (35Lavesa-Curto L. Sayer H. Bullard D. MacDonald A. Wilkinson A. Smith A. Bowater L. Hemmings A. Bowater R.P. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4171-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To have the same genetic background, the M. tuberculosis ligA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using primers containing sites for NcoI and HindIII, cloned into NcoI- and HindIII-digested pTrc99A (36Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 69: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), and transformed into E. coli GR501. In growth experiments, the strains expressing MtuLigA or T4 DNA ligase were compared with a control GR501 strain carrying empty pTrc99A without any gene insertions at 37 °C. As reported previously (19Brőtz-Oesterhelt H. Knezevic I. Bartel S. Lampe T. Warnecke-Eberz U. Ziegelbauer K. Häbich D. Labischiinski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39435-39442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and reproduced by us, the E. coli GR501 ligAts strain grows well at 30 °C, whereas it is strongly delayed at 37 °C. Complementation with either MtuLigA or T4 ligase restores the growth of the mutant strain. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the inhibitors were determined for MtuLigA and T4 DNA ligase in the E. coli GR501 ligAts mutant and in S. typhimurium LT2 (37Park U.E. Olivera B.M. Hughes K.T. Roth J.R. Hillyard D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2173-2180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its DNA ligase-null mutant derivative, which had been rescued with a plasmid (pBR313/598/8/1b) encoding the T4 DNA ligase gene (38Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 132: 471-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), to check the specificity of compounds for NAD+-dependent ligases from other sources as well. Antimicrobial activity was monitored in microtiter plates using a microdilution assay technique in a volume of 200 μl. Approximately 105 colony-forming units/ml in the case of the E. coli ligAts mutant and 106 colony-forming units/ml in the case of S. typhimurium LT2 and its LigA- mutant strain, rescued with T4 DNA ligase, were incubated with different compound concentrations under ambient conditions for 20 h, and MICs were determined on the basis of the presence of any visible growth. The E. coli mutant strain was grown in LB medium, whereas the S. typhimurium strains were grown in nutrient broth. The media contained 20 μg/ml polymyxin B nonapeptide to facilitate passage of the inhibitors across the outer membrane. Growth Inhibition Studies—To investigate the specificity and sensitivity of the compounds to NAD+-dependent ligase, exponentially growing cultures of S. typhimurium LT2 and its DNA ligase-null mutant derivative in nutrient broth were treated at A600 = 0.4 with increasing compound concentrations. The effect on the growth and viability of both the strains was compared by monitoring A600 and the number of colony-forming units for 4-5 h after addition of the compound. Serially diluted culture aliquots of both strains in phosphate-buffered saline were plated on nutrient agar, and visible colonies were counted after incubating the plates for 15 h at 37 °C. DNA-Inhibitor Interaction—In this assay, the DNA intercalating properties of the inhibitors were measured by the ability to compete with ethidium bromide for DNA binding. Detection of ethidium bromide displacement from DNA, if any, is based on the strong loss of fluorescence that should occur upon its detachment from DNA (39Le Pecq J.-B. Paoletti C. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 27: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained, in a volume of 100 μl, 5 μg of calf thymus DNA, 5 μm ethidium bromide, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Upon addition of the inhibitor at increasing concentrations, ethidium bromide fluorescence was immediately detected at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 612 nm. The adenylation domain of LigA contains all the residues necessary for AMP/NAD+ binding. This domain (consisting of residues 1-328 in MtuLigA) was cloned, expressed, and purified as described. The adenylation domain itself consists of two subdomains. Subdomain 1a is known to be flexible and adopts different spatial dispositions relative to subdomain 1b (7Gajiwala K.C. Pinko C. Structure (Camb). 2004; 12: 1449-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J.K. Kim H.-K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We therefore carried out independent molecular replacement calculations for the subdomains. The cofactor was not used in the calculations (Fig. 1). Clear connectivity was observed in the initial electron density maps between the two subdomains. We added NAD+ under the crystallization conditions, but well defined density only for noncovalently bound AMP was observed in the initial electron density map itself (Fig. 2). The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I.Fig. 2An initial 2Fo - Fc electron density map calculated after molecular replacement at 3.15 Å contoured at 1.2σ around the AMP-binding site. The cofactor was not included in the calculations. The refined coordinates are superposed onto the map. AMP (pink) and interacting residues (violet) are labeled for clarity. Polar interactions within 3.5 Å are also indicated by dotted lines. The figure was made using Turbo-Frodo.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Subdomain 1a consists of residues 1-76 and contains residues involved in NMN recognition. This subdomain consists mainly of two helical stretches (Figs. 1 and Fig. 3A). Subdomain 1b contains bound AMP in the crystal structure and consists of residues 77-328. The two domains adopt a novel relative spatial disposition in the structure (Fig. 3). Subdomain 1a in the B. stearothermophilus LigA structure is at one end of the conformation spectrum, whereas in TfiLigA, it is at the other end (Fig. 3B). In EfaLigA, this domain comes in close proximity to the AMP-binding site and generates the complete NAD+-binding site. This subdomain in MtuLigA adopts a new spatial disposition between the above two extremes. Adenylation Site and AMP Conformation—The adenylation domain contains five of six conserved sequence motifs in NAD+ ligases (40Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These mainly line the AMP/NAD+-binding pocket. The active-site lysine (Lys123 in MtuLigA), which covalently binds AMP to form the ligase-adenylate intermediate in the first step of the reaction, is part of the conserved motif I, whereas a Glu residue (Glu184 in MtuLigA), which apparently discriminates between AMP conformations, is part of motif III (17Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12137-12144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in the present structure, AMP is not observed to form the phosphoamide adduct with the motif I lysine. In fact, the side chain of this residue appears to be more mobile as evidenced by weaker electron density. The only other AMP-bound LigA structure is that of TfiLigA, whereas an NAD+-bound structure is available for EfaLigA. Although the model used for molecular replacement calculations was derived from TfiLigA, the AMP molecule adopts a conformation similar to that of the AMP part in the NAD+-bound EfaLigA structure (Protein Data Bank code 1TAE). In the TfiLigA structure, the adenylation domain is in an “open” state (Fig. 3B), and the adenosine nucleoside moiety of the covalently bound AMP adopts an anti-conformation. In the NAD+-bound EfaLigA structure, the adenylation domain is observed to be in a “closed” state, and the adenosine nucleoside moiety adopts a syn-conformation (41Shuman S. Lima C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the present structure, although the adenylation domain adopts an open conformation, the adenosine nucleoside moiety adopts a syn-conformation. Residues that are <4 Å from the AMP moiety in MtuLigA are Leu90, Ser91, Leu92, Asn94, Glu121, Leu122, Lys123, Ala124, Ala128, Arg144, Glu184, His236, Val298, and Lys300. The possible hydrogen bonds with AMP are indicated in Fig. 2. Lys123 is the residue that should covalently bind to AMP to form the adenylate intermediate, although it is not cova"

Of the five human RecQ helicases identified, three are associated with genetic disorders characterized by an elevated incidence of cancer or premature aging: Werner syndrome, Bloom syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome. Although the biochemical properties and protein interactions of the WRN and BLM helicases defective in Werner syndrome and Bloom syndrome, respectively, have been extensively investigated, less information is available concerning the functions of the other human RecQ helicases. We have focused our attention on human RECQ1, a DNA helicase whose cellular functions remain largely uncharacterized. In this work, we have characterized the DNA substrate specificity and optimal cofactor requirements for efficient RECQ1-catalyzed DNA unwinding and determined that RECQ1 has certain properties that are distinct from those of other RecQ helicases. RECQ1 stably bound to a variety of DNA structures, enabling it to unwind a diverse set of DNA substrates. In addition to its DNA binding and helicase activities, RECQ1 catalyzed efficient strand annealing between complementary single-stranded DNA molecules.

The enzymatic properties of the RECQ1 helicase and strand annealing activities are discussed in the context of proposed cellular DNA metabolic pathways that are important in the maintenance of genomic stability. Cellular processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and repair often involve steps that require unwinding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; SDSA, synthesis-dependent strand annealing; RPA, replication protein A; HJ, Holliday junction; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). 1The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; SDSA, synthesis-dependent strand annealing; RPA, replication protein A; HJ, Holliday junction; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). to form transient single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) intermediates. Helicases are a class of enzymes that unwind DNA duplexes with a distinct directional polarity, either 3′ to 5′ or 5′ to 3′ with respect to the strand on which the helicase is presumed to translocate, deriving energy from the hydrolysis of ATP (1Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2002; 35: 431-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 2Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). An essential “caretaker” role of helicases in DNA metabolic processes is suggested by a number of genetic disorders that have been linked to defects in DNA helicases (3Harrigan J.A. Bohr V.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 5Thompson L.H. Schild D. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 49-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).The RecQ family of DNA helicases, named after the Escherichia coli RecQ DNA helicase, is highly conserved from bacteria to humans (4Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). RecQ helicases share a centrally located helicase domain of ∼450 residues containing the seven conserved helicase motifs and an additional conserved region of ∼80 amino acids located C-terminal to the helicase domain designated RecQ-Ct (4Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 6Morozov V. Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 417-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The conserved helicase domain couples nucleotide hydrolysis to DNA unwinding, whereas the RecQ-Ct domain is suggested to be involved in protein interaction (7Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and DNA binding (8von Kobbe C. Thoma N.H. Czyzewski B.K. Pavletich N.P. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52997-53006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In all organisms, RecQ helicases play critical roles in maintaining genomic stability as evidenced by the hyper-recombination phenotype observed in recQ mutants (for review, see Ref. 9Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).There are five human helicases with the defined region of homology in the conserved RecQ helicase motifs: 1) WRN, defective in Werner syndrome; 2) BLM, defective in Bloom syndrome; 3) RTS, defective in Rothmund-Thomson syndrome; 4) RECQ1; and 5) RECQ5 (3Harrigan J.A. Bohr V.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Werner syndrome, Bloom syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome are all characterized as genomic instability disorders with an elevated cancer incidence and/or premature aging. Human diseases have not yet been genetically linked to mutations in RECQ1 or RECQ5; however, these proteins are likely to have important roles in nucleic acid metabolism based on the biological significance of other RecQ helicases.The biological importance of RECQ1 cannot be clearly evaluated at present because there is little information on the phenotypes of human RECQ1 mutant cells. Recent genetic complementation studies using the chick DT40 cell-based system indicate that RECQ1-/- cells do not display a growth deficiency, sensitivity to DNA damage, or elevated sister chromatid exchange; however, RECQ1-/- BLM-/- cells grow more slowly compared with BLM-/- cells due to an increased population of dead cells, indicating that RECQ1 is involved in cell viability under the BLM-impaired condition (10Wang W. Seki M. Narita Y. Nakagawa T. Yoshimura A. Otsuki M. Kawabe Y. Tada S. Yagi H. Ishii Y. Enomoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3527-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, the double mutant RECQ1-/- BLM-/- cells exhibit elevated mitomycin C-induced sister chromatid exchange compared with the BLM-/- cells, suggesting that RECQ1 may have some redundant functions with the BLM helicase (10Wang W. Seki M. Narita Y. Nakagawa T. Yoshimura A. Otsuki M. Kawabe Y. Tada S. Yagi H. Ishii Y. Enomoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3527-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Recent studies of BLM function in Drosophila suggests a role of the helicase in double-strand break repair by a homologous recombination pathway known as synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) (11Adams M.D. McVey M. Sekelsky J.J. Science. 2003; 299: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 12McVey M. Adams M. Staeva-Vieira E. Sekelsky J.J. Genetics. 2004; 167: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This pathway exploits the cellular recombination machinery to rejoin double-strand breaks through a series of strand invasion, DNA synthesis, and re-annealing steps. Although the precise details of BLM function in SDSA are not well understood, the ability of BLM to unwind D-loop structures (13van Brabant A.J. Ye T. Sanz M. German III, J.L. Ellis N.A. Holloman W.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14617-14625Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), a key intermediate of the SDSA pathway, is likely to be relevant. Consistent with this, the Drosophila genetic data support a model in which BLM acts down-stream of strand invasion (12McVey M. Adams M. Staeva-Vieira E. Sekelsky J.J. Genetics. 2004; 167: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular functions of RECQ1 might provide some insight as to how the enzyme has at least partially redundant or synergistic functions with BLM in a pathway such as SDSA.Recent biophysical and biochemical characterization of the purified recombinant RECQ1 helicase provided evidence that RECQ1 forms dimers in solution (14Cui S. Arosio D. Doherty K.M. Brosh Jr., R.M. Falaschi A. Vindigni A.

In the course of this work, we determined that RECQ1 has the ability to form stable protein complexes with either ssDNA or dsDNA, suggesting that RECQ1 may utilize its physical interaction with DNA for functions other than duplex DNA unwinding. A novel strand annealing activity of human RECQ5β helicase was reported recently (16Garcia P.L. Liu Y. Jiricny J. West S.C. Janscak P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2882-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Because RECQ1 is able to efficiently bind ssDNA, we became interested in the possibility that RECQ1 might utilize its ssDNA binding activity to bridge the complementary ssDNA molecules and to promote strand annealing. The results presented here provide evidence that RECQ1 can efficiently catalyze DNA unwinding of model recombination/repair DNA intermediates or promote strand annealing of complementary ssDNA molecules and that these processes are modulated by nucleotide availability, which alters RECQ1 protein conformation. The dual catalytic functions of RECQ1 are likely to be important in a cellular DNA metabolic pathway important for maintenance of genomic stability.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteins—Recombinant His-tagged RECQ1 protein was overexpressed using a baculovirus/Sf9 insect system and purified to near homogeneity as described previously (14Cui S. Arosio D. Doherty K.M. Brosh Jr., R.M. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2158-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A baculovirus encoding mutant recombinant His-tagged RECQ1-K119A protein was constructed as described (17Doherty K.M. Sharma S. Uzdilla L. Wilson T.M. Cui S. Vindigni A. Brosh Jr., R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28085-28094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the RECQ1-K119A protein was purified using the same procedure as described for wild-type recombinant RECQ1 protein. Purified recombinant human RPA was kindly provided by Dr. Mark Kenny (Albert Einstein Medical Center, Bronx, NY). Purified recombinant RuvA protein was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Cox (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). E. coli ssDNA-binding protein was purchased from Promega.DNA Substrates—PAGE-purified oligonucleotides used for preparation of DNA substrates were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co. 5′-32P-Labeled duplex DNA substrates were prepared as described previously (18Brosh Jr., R.M. Waheed J. Sommers J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23236-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Synthetic Holliday junction HJ(X12) was made by annealing four 50-mer oligonucleotides (X12-1, X12-2, X12-3, X12-4) as described previously (19Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). D-loop substrates were prepared as described previously (13van Brabant A.J. Ye T. Sanz M. German III, J.L. Ellis N.A. Holloman W.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14617-14625Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).DNA Helicase Assays—Helicase reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP (unless indicated otherwise), 10% glycerol, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 nm DNA substrate, and the indicated RECQ1 concentrations. Reactions were initiated by the addition of RECQ1 unless noted otherwise, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C. In kinetic experiments, 200-μl reactions containing forked duplex substrate (0.8 or 3.2 nm, as specified) and either 10 or 20 nm RECQ1 were initiated with 5 mm ATP, and 20-μl aliquots were removed at 0-180 s. Unless indicated otherwise, helicase reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of stop buffer (35 mm EDTA, 0.6% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, and 0.04% xylene cyanol) with a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide to prevent re-annealing of the unwound ssDNA products. Unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was not included in the quench for helicase reactions with D-loop or HJ substrates. Reaction products were subsequently incubated with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K for 15 min at 37 °C, and the products of standard duplex and D-loop substrates were resolved on nondenaturing 12% polyacrylamide gels. Products of the HJ branch migration reactions were resolved on native 10% polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled DNA species on polyacrylamide gels were visualized with a PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The percent of helicase substrate unwound was calculated by the following formula: percent unwinding = 100 × (P/(S + P)), where P is the product and S is the residual substrate. The values of P and S were corrected after subtracting background values in controls with no enzyme and heat-denatured substrate, respectively. Helicase data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments, with mean ± S.D. indicated by error bars.DNA Binding Assays—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained the indicated amounts of RECQ1 and 0.5 nm32P-end-labeled DNA substrates in DNA binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 mm ATPγS or no nucleotide. The reactions were incubated at 24 °C for 15 min after the addition of RECQ1. After incubation, 3 μl of loading dye (74% glycerol, 0.01% xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue) was added to each reaction, and samples were loaded onto native 5% polyacrylamide gels (19:1 cross-linking ratio) and electrophoresed at 200 V for 2.5 h at 4 °C using 1× Tris borate/EDTA as the running buffer. The resolved radiolabeled species were visualized with a PhosphorImager and analyzed using ImageQuant software.DNA Strand Annealing Assays—The DNA strand annealing activity of RECQ1 was measured using partially or fully complementary synthetic oligonucleotides (each at a concentration of 0.5 nm), one of which was labeled at the 5′-end using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Annealing of a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (0.5 nm) to M13mp18 ssDNA (1 nm) was also measured. Strand annealing reactions (20 μl) were carried out in helicase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2) and contained the indicated RECQ1 concentrations. Where specified, RPA (0.19-96 nm), E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein (0.75-768 nm), ATP (2 or 5 mm), ATPγS (2 or 5 mm), and ADP (2 mm) were also present. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the unlabeled DNA strand, followed by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. In kinetic experiments, 200-μl reactions were initiated, and 20-μl aliquots were removed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 min. A control reaction mixture was set up in an identical manner to determine the level of spontaneous annealing of oligonucleotides in the absence of RECQ1. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of stop buffer. Reaction products were subsequently incubated with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K for 15 min at 37 °C, and the products were resolved on native 12% polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled DNA species on polyacrylamide gels were visualized with a PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuant software.Immunodepletion—One microgram of rabbit anti-RECQ1 polyclonal antibody or normal rabbit IgG (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 40 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) that had been equilibrated in helicase reaction buffer (see above). Beads were subsequently washed three times with helicase reaction buffer. Antibody-bound beads were then incubated with 20 nm RECQ1 in helicase reaction buffer (40 μl) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was again incubated with antibody-bound beads for 10 min at 4 °C for a second immunodepletion step. Following centrifugation, supernatants were collected and divided into two equal aliquots, one to be assayed for strand annealing activity as described above and the other to assess the efficiency of RECQ1 depletion by Western blot analysis. In control experiments, protein G-agarose beads lacking any bound antibody were incubated either with or without RECQ1 (20 nm), and the resulting supernatants were tested for strand annealing.Partial Proteolytic Digestion of RECQ1—For the limited proteolysis studies, purified recombinant RECQ1 (2 μg) was incubated with chymotrypsin (0.1 μg; Sigma) in the presence or absence of Mg2+ (3 mm) and ATP or ATPγS (3 mm) in a 20-μl reaction mixture at 37 °C for 45 min. An equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (126 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol) was added to the proteolytic digestion mixture, and samples were boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved on denaturing SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining.RESULTSAlthough the effect of duplex length on RECQ1 helicase activity has been determined (15Cui S. Klima R. Ochem A. Arosio D. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1424-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we characterized the unwinding activity of purified recombinant RECQ1 helicase on a variety of DNA substrates that are proposed intermediates of various pathways of cellular DNA metabolism. In addition, we characterized how RECQ1 acts upon unwound ssDNA molecules to convert them to duplex strands by a strand annealing activity.DNA Substrate Specificity of RECQ1 Helicase—To determine the DNA substrate preference for RECQ1 helicase activity, we examined a series of B-form duplex DNA substrates with a variety of combinations of ssDNA or dsDNA tails flanking the 19-bp duplex region. These DNA substrates, characterized by a related nucleotide sequence, were incubated with increasing concentrations of purified recombinant RECQ1 helicase in the presence of ATP, and the reaction products were analyzed on native polyacrylamide gels. The results demonstrate that RECQ1 unwound these substrates to different extents depending on the presence and nature of the 3′- and 5′-tails (Fig. 1). Of the substrates tested, a forked duplex with 5′- and 3′-ssDNA arms of 26 and 25 nucleotides, respectively, was unwound relatively efficiently (Fig. 1, A and C). As expected from the unwinding polarity of RECQ1 (15Cui S. Klima R. Ochem A. Arosio D. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1424-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), a DNA substrate flanked by only a 3′-ssDNA tail was also unwound by RECQ1; however, significantly less unwinding of this substrate was detected compared with the forked duplex with 3′- and 5′-ssDNA arms throughout the RECQ1 protein titration. The greatest difference (2.5-fold) was observed at a RECQ1 concentration of 10 nm (Fig. 1C).The observation that RECQ1 unwound a forked DNA duplex with non-complementary 3′- and 5′-ssDNA tails significantly better than the simple 3′-ssDNA tailed duplex suggested that RECQ1, like WRN and BLM (18Brosh Jr., R.M. Waheed J. Sommers J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23236-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), might unwind other DNA structures with junctions. Forked DNA substrates with either one or both of the arms in the double-stranded state are intermediates of cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and recombination. We therefore tested this substrate class, which includes a 3′-flap, a 5′-flap, and a synthetic replication fork with 3′- and 5′-duplex arms. Interestingly, the 3′-flap substrate was unwound the best of all the substrates tested. A significantly greater percent of the 3′-flap substrate (as much as 3.5-fold) was unwound by RECQ1 compared with the forked duplex with 3′- and 5′-ssDNA arms at the lowest RECQ1 protein concentrations tested (0.6, 1.2, and 2.5 nm) (Fig. 1C). The 5′-flap substrate was also unwound by RECQ1, but not nearly to the extent as either the forked duplex with ssDNA arms or the 3′-flap substrate. Despite the absence of a 3′-ssDNA tail, RECQ1 unwound the 5′-flap substrate as efficiently as the 3′-ssDNA tailed duplex, resulting in release of ∼40% of the 5′-flap oligonucleotide at the highest RECQ1 concentration tested (10 nm) (Fig. 1C).We next tested a forked duplex in which both the 5′- and 3′-tails of the fork were double-stranded. This three-way junction structure resembles a stalled replication fork where both the leading and lagging strands have been converted to duplex DNA. As shown in Fig. 1B, the synthetic replication fork was unwound by RECQ1 in a protein concentration-dependent manner. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that nearly the same percent of the synthetic replication fork and 5′-flap substrate was unwound by RECQ1 at a given helicase concentration, suggesting that the enzyme is indifferent to the single- or double-stranded character of the 5′-arm of these substrates. Gel analysis of the unwound products of the RECQ1 helicase reaction with the synthetic replication fork revealed that the substrate was unwound in the direction of the fork, primarily yielding a product with the duplex arm intact (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that RECQ1 recognized and bound the junction and translocated in a 3′ to 5′ direction along the bottom strand toward the direction of the fork, thus generating the partial duplex product. This activity is similar to that observed for the WRN helicase (18Brosh Jr., R.M. Waheed J. Sommers J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23236-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but is distinct from that of Drosophila RECQ5β, which was shown to unwind the lagging strand duplex of the synthetic replication fork structure (20Ozsoy A.Z. Ragonese H.M. Matson S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1554-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Notable, the results suggest that RECQ1 unwinds conventional duplex DNA substrates that completely lack ssDNA character and that its unwinding properties have both similarities to and differences from the unwinding properties of other RecQ helicases (see “Discussion”).RECQ1 Helicase Activity Is Sensitive to Free Magnesium Cation—The overall duplex DNA unwinding reaction catalyzed by a helicase is an energy-requiring process, and helicases utilize energy from the hydrolysis of ATP or other NTPs, allowing them to translocate and unwind DNA duplexes (1Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2002; 35: 431-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 2Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). As the ATP·Mg2+ complex is the source of chemical energy for the RECQ1 helicase-catalyzed unwinding, we sought to determine the optimal concentrations of Mg2+ and ATP for RECQ1 helicase activity. Initially, we varied the Mg2+ concentrations at a fixed ATP concentration (5 or 1 mm) to estimate the ratio between ATP and Mg2+ at which the greatest level of RECQ1 unwinding could be detected and then to determine the optimal concentration of the ATP·Mg2+ complex. As shown in Fig. 2A, RECQ1 helicase activity in the presence of 5 mm ATP increased fairly linearly with Mg2+:ATP ratios up to 0.5, but decreased with greater Mg2+:ATP ratios, particularly evident at ratios >1. A steep decrease in RECQ1 helicase activity was observed at a Mg2+:ATP ratio of 1.25, resulting in a 2-fold reduction in the percent of forked duplex substrate unwound. Additional increases in the Mg2+:ATP ratio resulted in a greater reduction in unwinding by RECQ1. At a Mg2+:ATP ratio of 2, only 10% of the substrate molecules were unwound by RECQ1 compared with 80% at a Mg2+:ATP ratio of 0.5. To confirm the effect of free Mg2+ on RECQ1 helicase activity, we carried out the same set of experiments using 1 mm ATP, which also resulted in a steady increase in RECQ1 helicase activity as a function of the Mg2+:ATP ratio up to 0.5. Inhibition of RECQ1 helicase activity at Mg2+:ATP ratios >0.5 was observed; however, the decrease in RECQ1 unwinding did not display as great a dependence on the Mg2+:ATP ratio as observed at 5 mm ATP. These data indicate that RECQ1 helicase is sensitive to the ratio of Mg2+ to ATP, with maximal activity exhibited at Mg2+:ATP ratios of ∼0.5-1.0. Beyond this optimum, the unwinding activity steadily declined with increasing Mg2+:ATP ratios, suggesting that free Mg2+ ion is inhibitory to RECQ1 helicase activity. Sensitivity to free Mg2+ ion has also been reported for the E. coli RecQ helicase (21Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 232-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); however, WRN helicase activity, which displays optimal unwinding at an Mg2+:ATP ratio of 1, is not adversely affected by greater Mg2+:ATP ratios up to 4 (22Choudhary S. Sommers J.A. Brosh Jr., R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34603-34613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Dependence of RECQ1 helicase activity on ATP and Mg2+ ion concentrations.A, RECQ1 helicase activity is inhibited by free Mg2+ ion concentration. Helicase reaction mixtures contained 0.5 nm forked DNA substrate, 10 nm RECQ1, and either 5 mm ATP with increasing concentrations of MgCl2 from 0 to 20 mm (○) or 1 mm ATP with increasing concentrations of MgCl2 from 0 to 4 mm (•).

Because RECQ1 is inhibited by free Mg2+, RECQ1 helicase assays were performed in which the concentration of the ATP·Mg2+ complex (maintained at either a 1:1 or 0.5:1 ratio of Mg2+ to ATP) was increased. The percent of forked DNA substrate unwound was plotted as a function of ATP concentration (Fig. 2B). RECQ1 unwinding activity increased linearly with ATP concentration up to ∼4-5 mm ATP, at which a plateau was approached for either fixed Mg2+:ATP ratio (Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W1972297566,"We have reported that ceramide mediates binding of atypical protein kinase C (PKC) ζ to its inhibitor protein, PAR-4 (prostate apoptosis response-4), thereby inducing apoptosis in differentiating embryonic stem cells. Using a novel method of lipid vesicle-mediated affinity chromatography, we showed here that endogenous ceramide binds directly to the PKCζ·PAR-4 complex. Ceramide and its analogs activated PKCζ prior to binding to PAR-4, as determined by increased levels of phosphorylated PKCζ and glycogen synthase kinase-3β and emergence of a PAR-4-to-phosphorylated PKCζ fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal that co-localizes with ceramide. Elevated expression and activation of PKCζ increased cell survival, whereas expression of PAR-4 promoted apoptosis. This suggests that PKCζ counteracts apoptosis, unless its ceramide-induced activation is compromised by binding to PAR-4. A luciferase reporter assay showed that ceramide analogs activate nuclear factor (NF)-κB unless PAR-4-dependent inhibition of PKCζ suppresses NF-κB activation. Taken together, our results show that direct physical association with ceramide and PAR-4 regulates the activity of PKCζ. They also indicate that this interaction regulates the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3β and NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W2061841529,"Escherichia coli DnaA protein, a member of the AAA+ superfamily, initiates replication from the chromosomal origin oriC in an ATP-dependent manner. Nucleoprotein complex formed on oriC with the ATP-DnaA multimer but not the ADP-DnaA multimer is competent to unwind the oriC duplex. The oriC region contains ATP-DnaA-specific binding sites termed I2 and I3, which stimulate ATP-DnaA-dependent oriC unwinding. In this study, we show that the DnaA R285A mutant is inactive for oriC replication in vivo and in vitro and that the mutation is associated with specific defects in oriC unwinding. In contrast, activities of DnaA R285A are sustained in binding to the typical DnaA boxes and to ATP and ADP, formation of multimeric complexes on oriC, and loading of the DnaB helicase onto single-stranded DNA. Footprint analysis of the DnaA-oriC complex reveals that the ATP form of DnaA R285A does not interact with ATP-DnaA-specific binding sites such as the I sites. A subgroup of DnaA molecules in the oriC complex must contain the Arg-285 residue for initiation.

The protein forms a homomultimer on the replication origin oriC to form an initiation complex. When the ATP-bound form of DnaA is included in the initiation complex, a region within oriC containing AT-rich 13-mers is specifically unwound, resulting in open complex formation. ADP-DnaA forms a multimeric complex on oriC that does not promote open complex formation.

DnaG primase forms a complex with DnaB that promotes DNA duplex unwinding and RNA primer synthesis, which allow loading of the DNA polymerase (pol) III holoenzyme. The pol III holoenzyme consists of the β clamp subunit, which is directly loaded onto the primed site, and the pol III* subassembly, which binds to the β clamp. Pol III* includes the clamp-loader γ complex and the pol III core complex, which contains the catalytic center of the polymerase. After synthesis of an Okazaki fragment, pol III* is released from DNA, leaving the β clamp loaded on the synthesized DNA (2Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev.

This mechanism, termed RIDA (regulatory inactivation of DnaA), involves the hydrolysis of DnaA-bound ATP through its association with the DNA-loaded clamp and Hda protein, yielding the inactive ADP-DnaA.

ATP-DnaA preferentially binds the single-stranded ATP-DnaA box sequence, thereby promoting unwinding of the 13-mer region. Third, Leonard and co-workers (15McGarry K.C. Ryan V.T. Grimwade J.E. Leonard A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These sites are located between the DnaA M and R4 boxes and stimulate the formation of an open complex. The I2 and I3 sites, and the I1 site, were reported to be integration host factor-dependent DnaA-binding sites that differ from the DnaA box consensus sequence by 3-4 bases (16Grimwade J.E. Ryan V.T. Leonard A.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Integration host factor binds to a specific site within oriC, but the low affinity binding of ATP-DnaA to the I2 and I3 sites is integration host factor-independent (15McGarry K.C. Ryan V.T.

Domains I and II play a role in DnaA-DnaA self-interactions and in interactions with DnaB helicase, the initiation modulator DiaA, and the Hda-clamp complex (9Su'etsugu M. Shimuta T. Ishida T.

The AAA+ domain contains motifs related to nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) interaction in addition to Walker-type NTP-binding motifs (23Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 25Davey M.J.

Biol. 2004; 146: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Moreover, typical AAA+ proteins such as the γ subunit of the clamp-loader complex and the bacterial proteasome subunit HslU can oligomerize. Detailed structure-function relationship analyses of some AAA+ proteins indicate that in the oligomeric forms, the side chain of a specific arginine residue is exposed on the protomer surface and recognizes ATP that is bound to the adjacent protomer (25Davey M.J. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 26Ogura T. Whiteheart S.W. Wilkinson A.J. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This specific arginine motif is called the arginine finger. For example, the arginine finger of HslU plays a role in homohexamer formation and ATP hydrolysis in this HslU multimer (27Song H.K. Hartmann C. Ramachandran R. Bochtler M. Behrendt R. Moroder L. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14103-14108Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Analyses of AAA+ protein sequences and of the crystal structure of domains III-IV of the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus DnaA homolog suggest that arginine 281 or 285 of E. coli DnaA corresponds to the arginine finger (23Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Struct.

In this study, we reveal that the E. coli DnaA arginine 285 residue is uniquely required for the ATP-dependent activation of the DnaA initiator. Whereas oriC unwinding activity is specifically impaired in the DnaA R285A mutant, the protein retains DnaA box binding, ATP/ADP binding, DnaB loading, multimer formation on oriC, and RIDA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activities. Footprint analysis indicates that ATP-DnaA R285A does not recognize ATP-DnaA-specific motifs such as the I sites within oriC. We thus suggest that arginine 285 plays a crucial and unique role in the recognition of ATP bound to DnaA in the initiation complex and in the ATP-dependent conformational activation of this complex.

Briefly, KA450 cells bearing pKW24-1 were incubated at 37 °C in 7.2 liters of LB medium containing thymine (50 μg/ml) and ampicillin (50 μg/ml), expression of mutant dnaA genes was induced by adding 1% arabinose to log phase cells, and incubation was continued for 2 h. KA450 cells bearing pKW23-2 were similarly incubated, except at 30 °C, the growth rate of this strain was normal at 30 °C, but significantly reduced at 37 °C. Protein was precipitated from cleared lysates with ammonium sulfate (0.22 g/ml) and dialyzed against buffer C. Insoluble materials were collected, washed with buffer C containing 0.6 m ammonium sulfate, and dissolved in buffer C containing 0.6 m ammonium sulfate, 4 m guanidine, and 10 mm magnesium acetate. Proteins were separated on a Superose 12 HR10/30 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer D, and fractions containing DnaA monomers were pooled (fraction IV). Wild-type DnaA was purified from KA450 cells bearing pKA234 that were incubated at 30 or 37 °C. All activities tested were essentially the same for wild-type DnaA samples purified from cells grown at 30 or 37 °C (data not shown). Gel Mobility Retardation Assays—Experiments using a 15-bp DNA fragment were performed essentially as previously described (12Schaper S. Messer W. J. Biol.

Briefly, the indicated amounts of DnaA were incubated for 30 min on ice in buffer (12.5 μl) containing 0.8 mm ATP and 2.5 pmol of a 15-bp DNA fragment containing the DnaA R1 box. Reaction products were subjected to 8% PAGE at 4 °C, stained with Gel-Star (Cambrex), and quantified densitometrically with the NIH Image program.

DnaA protein was incubated for 3-5 min at room temperature in HKM150 buffer containing 64 μm ATP. A portion was then injected into the Biacore X flow cells filled with HKM150 buffer at 22 °C at a flow rate of 40 μl/min.

After incubation for 1 min at 38 °C, reactions were further incubated for 30 s at 38 °C in the presence of ATP-DnaA or ADP-DnaA, followed by incubation with P1 nuclease (12 units; Yamasa Co.) for 50 s at the same temperature. Reactions were stopped by the addition of a solution (20 μl) containing 1% SDS and 50 mm EDTA, and DNA was purified with a QIA-quick spin column (Qiagen).

The oriC fragment (419 bp) was prepared by PCR with the primers 5′-CCCGGGCCGTGGATTCTAC and 32P-end-labeled 5′-GAAGATCAACATTCTTGATCACG. The indicated amounts of DnaA were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C or for 30 min on ice in buffer (20 μl) containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 2.75 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm calcium acetate, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 11 ng (40 fmol) of end-labeled oriC fragment, and 3 mm ATP or ADP.

DnaA R285A Is Inactive for in Vivo Initiation—To determine whether a specific DnaA arginine residue corresponds to the AAA+ family-specific arginine finger motif, we constructed DnaA R281A- and DnaA R285A-overproducing plasmids. Sequence comparison suggests that DnaA arginine 285 is an arginine finger (23Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and homology modeling supports this idea as this residue is exposed on the protein surface (22Nishida S. Fujimitsu K.

Because DnaA arginine 281 is widely conserved among eubacterial DnaA homologs and is another arginine finger candidate (24Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Struct.

First, we performed a plasmid complementation test in a temperature-sensitive dnaA46 mutant to ask if the DnaA Arg-281 and Arg-285"
https://openalex.org/W2094096789,"Evidence from in vivo studies suggests that some inputs to cardiac hypertrophy are opposed by the actions of estrogen. However, the mechanisms of E2 action in this respect are mainly unknown. An important pathway that is utilized by multiple hypertrophic stimuli involves the activation of the tyrosine phosphatase, calcineurin (PP2B). Here we show that 17β-estradiol (E2) significantly prevents angiotensin II (AngII)- or endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced new protein synthesis, skeletal muscle actin expression, and increased surface area in cultured rat cardiomyocytes. ET-1 stimulated calcineurin phosphatase activity, resulting in new protein synthesis, and both were prevented by E2. E2 induced the MCIP1 gene, an inhibitor of calcineurin activity, via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, transcriptional, and mRNA stability mechanisms. Small interfering RNA for MCIP1 significantly reversed both the E2 restraint of protein synthesis and the inhibition of AngII-induced calcineurin activity. AngII-induced the translocation of the hypertrophic transcription factor, NF-AT, to the nucleus of the cardiomyocyte and stimulated NF-AT transcriptional activity. Both were prevented by E2. AngII also stimulated the activation of ERK and protein kinase C, contributing to cardiac hypertrophy. E2 inhibited these pathways, related to the stimulation of atrial natriuretic peptide production and secretion. Thus, restraint of calcineurin and kinase signaling to the hypertrophic program underlie these important effects of E2."
https://openalex.org/W2105295949,"Keratocytes of the corneal stroma produce a transparent extracellular matrix required for vision. During wound-healing and in vitro, keratocytes proliferate, becoming fibroblastic, and lose biosynthesis of unique corneal matrix components. This study sought identification of cells in the corneal stroma capable of assuming a keratocyte phenotype after extensive proliferation. About 3% of freshly isolated bovine stromal cells exhibited clonal growth. In low-mitogen media, selected clonal cultures displayed dendritic morphology and expressed high levels of keratan sulfate, aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1, and keratocan, molecular markers of keratocyte phenotype. In protein-free media, both primary keratocytes and selected clonal cells aggregated to form attachment-independent spheroids expressing elevated levels of those marker molecules. The selected clonal cells exhibited normal karyotype and underwent replicative senescence after 65-70 population doublings; however, they continued expression of keratocyte phenotypic markers throughout their replicative life span. The progenitor cells expressed elevated mRNA for several genes characteristic of stem cells and also for genes expressed during ocular development PAX6, Six2, and Six3. PAX6 protein was detected in the cultured progenitor cells and a small number of stromal cells in intact tissue but was absent in cultured keratocytes and fibroblasts. Cytometry demonstrated PAX6 protein in 4% of freshly isolated stromal cells. These results demonstrate the presence of a previously unrecognized population of PAX6-positive cells in adult corneal stroma that maintain the potential to assume a keratocyte phenotype even after extensive replication. The presence of such progenitor cells has implications for corneal biology and for cell-based therapies targeting corneal scarring."
https://openalex.org/W2053248846,"Type IV secretion systems mediate the translocation of virulence factors (proteins and/or DNA) from Gram-negative bacteria into eukaryotic cells. A complex of 11 conserved proteins (VirB1-VirB11) spans the inner and the outer membrane and assembles extracellular T-pili in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Here we report a sequence of protein interactions required for the formation of complexes between VirB2 and VirB5, which precedes their incorporation into pili. The NTPase Walker A active site of the inner membrane protein VirB4 is required for virulence, but an active site VirB4 variant stabilized VirB3 and VirB8 and enabled T-pilus formation. Analysis of VirB protein complexes extracted from the membranes with mild detergent revealed that VirB2-VirB5 complex formation depended on VirB4, which identified a novel T-pilus assembly step. Bicistron expression demonstrated direct interaction of VirB4 with VirB8, and analyses with purified proteins showed that VirB5 bound to VirB8 and VirB10. VirB4 therefore localizes at the basis of a trans-envelope interaction sequence, and by stabilization of VirB8 it mediates the incorporation of VirB5 and VirB2 into extracellular pili.

Gram-negative bacteria use secretion systems to translocate macromolecules across their cell envelope of two membranes and the murein cell wall. The term type IV secretion system (T4SS) 1The abbreviations used are: T4SS, type IV secretion system; AS, acetosyringone; ARA, arabinose; DDM, dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. was introduced for a group of protein machineries, which translocate proteins or protein-DNA complexes from donor to recipient cells. T4SSs are used by many bacterial pathogens for the translocation of virulence factors, e.g. by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Bartonella henselae, Bordetella pertussis, Brucella suis, Helicobacter pylori, and Legionella pneumophila (1Cascales E. Christie P.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 2Christie P.J. Biochim. Biophys.

T4SSs from different bacteria translocate a wide variety of macromolecules to different types of recipients (bacteria, fungi, mammalian, and plant cells) (4Ding Z. Atmakuri K. Christie P.J. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 527-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the basic mechanism and structure of the translocation machinery are likely conserved (5Yeo H.-J. Waksman G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1919-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The best-characterized model is the plant pathogen A. tumefaciens. The T4SS of the closely related animal pathogen B. suis is encoded by an operon of similar organization, and it is essential for survival and multiplication inside mammalian cells (6Celli J. Gorvel J.P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The T4SSs of these bacteria share 11 proteins, which can be divided into three groups. The first group comprises two inner membrane-associated NTPases (VirB4 and VirB11), which reside mainly in the cytoplasm but may traverse the inner membrane and contact periplasmic T4SS components (7Cascales E. Christie P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17228-17233Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8Dang T.A. Zhou X.-R. Graf B. Christie P.J. Mol.

They contain Walker A nucleotide-binding motifs and are believed to energize T4SS assembly or substrate transfer. The second group consists of inner membrane VirB6 and periplasmic VirB7, VirB8, VirB9, and VirB10. They form the T4SS core and may constitute the translocation channel (10Cascales E. Christie P.J.

The third group comprises the major T-pilus component VirB2, the minor component VirB5, and the pilus-associated protein VirB7 (14Jakubowski S.J. Krishnamoorthy V. Christie P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2867-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Schmidt-Eisenlohr H. Domke N. Angerer C. Wanner G. Zambryski P.C. Baron C. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22548-22555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). VirB3 has not been firmly assigned, but its outer membrane localization and binding to VirB5 suggest that it is a pilus-associated protein (18Shamaei-Tousi A. Cahill R. Frankel G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4796-4801Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Jones A.L. Shirasu K. Kado C.I. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5255-5261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments based on extraction of VirB proteins with a mild detergent followed by separation under native conditions led to a model for T-pilus assembly (20Krall L. Wiedemann U. Unsin G. Weiss S. Domke N. Baron C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11405-11410Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This model is refined here based on improved separation methods and the analysis of the contribution of VirB4. VirB4 is the largest T4SS component (A. tumefaciens, 87 kDa; B. suis, 94 kDa) and exhibits the highest degree of conservation among T4SS components (31% identity and 52% similarity between A. tumefaciens and B. suis). It is homodimeric or homomultimeric and is essential for virulence (8Dang T.A. Zhou X.-R. Graf B. Christie P.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1239-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Watarai M. Makino S. Shirahata T. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1439-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An important feature is its Walker A nucleotide-binding site, which is essential for virulence and plasmid transfer (22Sagulenko E. Sagulenko V. Chen J. Christie P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5813-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 23Fullner K. Stephens K.M. Nester E.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 704-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ATPase activity of purified A. tumefaciens VirB4 was previously reported (24Shirasu K. Koukolikova-Nicola Z. Hohn B. Kado C.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but a more recent study argues against such an activity of the purified protein (25Rabel C. Grahn A.M. Lurz R. Lanka E. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1045-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Coordinated action of VirB4 with VirB11 and VirD4 was proposed to mediate the early DNA transfer reactions (26Atmakuri K. Cascales E. Christie P.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, VirB4 stabilized VirB3 and was required for its localization in the outer membrane (19Jones A.L. Shirasu K. Kado C.I. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5255-5261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A study using the yeast two-hybrid system suggested that VirB4 binds to VirB1, VirB8, VirB10, and VirB11, but this was not substantiated with biochemical methods (27Ward D. Draper O. Zupan J.R. Zambryski P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11493-11500Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the VirB4 NTPase active site is essential for virulence, but it is not required for interactions with VirB11 and VirD4, for self-association, and for the stimulation of IncQ plasmid transfer into A. tumefaciens by the T4SS in the recipient (8Dang T.A. Zhou X.-R. Graf B. Christie P.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1239-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To unravel the role of VirB4, we constructed a virB4 deletion mutant and assessed the complementation with A. tumefaciens and B. suis VirB4 and NTPase active site variants. We refined the protocol for the separation of detergent-extracted VirB proteins and identified a novel step in T-pilus assembly. Purified components were used to study interactions in vitro, and this revealed an interaction sequence from the VirB4-VirB8 complex to the pilus component VirB5 and the core component VirB10. This work gives fundamental insights into the contribution of VirB4 to T4SS complex stabilization and T-pilus assembly. Cultivation of Bacteria—The strains and plasmids used in this study are given in Table I. Cultures of Escherichia coli JM109 for cloning experiments were grown at 37 °C in LB (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl). Antibiotics were added for plasmid propagation (50 μg/ml spectinomycin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml carbenicillin). Overnight cultures of A. tumefaciens were grown in YEB (0.5% beef extract, 0.5% peptone, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.5% sucrose, 2 mm MgSO4) in the absence of antibiotics (wild-type strains) or with spectinomycin (300 μg/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) for the propagation of pVSBADNco and pVSBAD, followed by virulence gene induction in liquid AB glycerol minimal medium (0.5% glycerol, 0.4% morpholinoethansulfonic acid, 1 mm sodium potassium phosphate, 0.1% NH4Cl, 0.03% MgSO4 × 7H2O, 0.001% CaCl2, 0.00025% FeSO4 × 7H2O, pH 5.5) for 18 h or on AB agar plates for 3 days at 20 °C in the presence of acetosyringone (AS; 200 μm) and arabinose (ARA, 0.2%). For protein overproduction, E. coli strain GJ1158 was grown under aerobic conditions at 37 °C in LBON medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract) to an A600 of 0.4-0.8, followed by the addition of NaCl at 0.3 m. Cultivation under aerobic conditions proceeded at different temperatures and times to assure maximal solubility and yield of the fusion proteins (VirB4s and its bicistron constructs, VirB5sp, VirB9sp, and VirB10sp: 16 h, 26 °C; VirB8sp: 4 h, 37 °C).Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsGenotype or descriptionSource/ref. no.StrainsE. coli JM109endA1 gyr96 thi hsdR71 supE44 recA1 relA1 (Δlac-proAB) (F' traD36 proAB+ lacIq lacZΔM15)45E. coli GJ1158ompT hsdS gal dcm ΔmalAp510 malP::(proUp-T7 RNAP) malQ::lacZhyb11 Δ(zhf-900::Tn10ΔTet)46A. tumefaciens C58Wild type, pTiC5847A. tumefaciens A348Wild type, pTiA6NC47A. tumefaciens CB1004pTiC58 carrying an in-frame deletion of virB4This workA. tumefaciens PC1004pTiA6NC carrying an in-frame deletion of virB448A. tumefaciens UIA143(pTiA6)A348, eryr, recA ery14035S. cerevisiae AH109MATa trp1-901 leu2-3 ura3-52 his3-200 gal4Δ gal80Δ LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3 GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2 URA3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZClontechPlasmidspVSBADNcostrr, spcr, pVS1 origin, AraC-controlled promoter expression vector49pVSBADstrr, spcr, pVS1 origin, AraC-controlled promoter expression vector49pT7-7StrepIIcarr, T7 promoter expression vector for N-terminal StrepII affinity peptide fusions34pT7-H6TrxFuscarr, T7 promoter expression vector, for N-terminal H6 TrxA affinity peptide fusions33pLS1carr, IncQ plasmid for VirB/D4-mediated conjugative transfer experiments50pGK217carr, pUC18 with 11-kb virB fragment from A. tumefaciens51pUCvirBcarr, pUC18 with 12-kb virB fragment from B. suis52pVSBADVirB4pVSBAD carrying a 2.4-kb Acc65I/PstI virB4 fragment from A. tumefaciens C58This workpVSBADVirB4K439RpVSBADVirB4, mutated A. tumefaciens virB4 gene, encoding Walker A site K439R variantThis workpVSBADNcoVirB4spVSBADNco carrying 2.5-kb NcoI/XbaI virB4 fragment from B. suisThis workpVSBADNcoVirB4sK464RpVSBADNcoVirB4s, mutated B. suis virB4 gene, encoding Walker A site K464R variantThis workpT7-7StrepIIVirB4spT7-7StrepII carrying 2.5-kb Acc65I/EcoRI virB4 fragment from B. suisThis workpT7-7StrepIIVirB4s-VirB8sppT7-7StrepIIVirB4s bicistron with 492-bp EcoRI/PstI virB8 fragment from B. suis (encoding 163-amino acid periplasmic domain)This workpT7-7StrepIIVirB4s-VirB8spT7-7StrepIIVirB4s bicistron with 720-bp EcoRI/PstI virB8 fragment from B. suis (encoding 239-amino acid, full-length protein)This workpT7-7StrepIIVirB5sppT7-7StrepII carrying 666-bp Acc65I/PstI virB5 fragment from B. suis (encoding 221-amino acid periplasmic domain)This workpT7-7StrepIIVirB8sppT7-7StrepII carrying 492-bp Acc65I/PstI virB8 fragment from B. suis (encoding 163-amino acid periplasmic domain)53pT7-7StrepIIVirB9sppT7-7StrepII carrying 813-bp Acc65I/PstI virB9 fragment from B. suis (encoding 271-amino acid periplasmic domain)This workpT7-7StrepIIVirB10sppT7-7StrepII carrying 1020-bp Acc65I/PstI virB10 fragment from B. suis (encoding 339-amino acid periplasmic domain)This workpT7-H6TrxVirB5sppT7-H6TrxFus carrying 666-bp Acc65I/PstI virB5 fragment from B. suis (encoding 221-amino acid periplasmic domain)54pT7-H6TrxVirB8sppT7-H6TrxFus carrying 492-bp Acc65I/PstI virB8 fragment from B. suis (encoding 163-amino acid periplasmic domain)54pT7-H6TrxVirB9sppT7-H6TrxFus carrying 813-bp Acc65I/PstI virB9 fragment from B. suis (encoding 271-amino acid periplasmic domain)This workpT7-H6TrxVirB10sppT7-H6TrxFus carrying 1020-bp Acc65I/PstI virB10 fragment from B. suis (encoding 339-amino acid periplasmic domain)This workpGADT7carr, GAL4 AD fusion vector, LEU2 marker for selection in yeastClontechpGBKT7kanr, GAL4 DNA-BD fusion vector, TRP1 marker for selection in yeastClontechpGADT7-TpGADT7 construct; encodes fusion of GAL4 AD and SV40 T-antigen; positive controlClontechpGBKT7-53pGBKT7 construct; encodes fusion of GAL4 DNA-BD and mouse-p53, positive controlClontechpGADT7-VirB5sppGADT7 carrying 657-bp NdeI/BamHI virB5 fragment from B. suis (encoding 218-amino acid periplasmic domain)This workpGADT7-VirB8sppGADT7 carrying 510-bp NdeI/BamHI virB8 fragment from B. suis (encoding 170-amino acid periplasmic domain)This workpGADT7-VirB10sppGADT7 carrying 1020-bp NdeI/BamHI virB10 fragment from B. suis (encoding 339-amino acid periplasmic domain)This workpGBKT7-VirB5sppGBKT7 carrying 657-bp NdeI/BamHI virB5 fragment from B. suis (encoding 218-amino acid periplasmic domain)This workpGBKT7-VirB8sppGBKT7 pGADT7 carrying 510-bp EcoRI/PstI virB8 fragment from B. suis (encoding 170-amino acid periplasmic domain)This workpGBKT7-VirB9sppGBKT7 carrying 816-bp NcoI/PstI virB9 fragment from B. suis (encoding 272-amino acid periplasmic domain)This workpGBKT7-VirB10sppGBKT7 carrying 1020-bp EcoRI/PstI virB10 fragment from B. suis (encoding 339-amino acid periplasmic domain)This work Open table in a new tab Plasmid and Strain Constructions and Mutagenesis—DNA manipulations followed standard procedures (28Maniatis T.A.

Wiedemann U. Unsin G. Weiss S. Domke N. Baron C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11405-11410Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Blue native gradient gel electrophoresis (7-14% acrylamide, 16-cm-long gel) was performed for 20 h and 5 mA at 4 °C. Alternatively, for separation of small proteins, blue native gel electrophoresis was performed in a linear 15% polyacrylamide gel for 5-6 h and 5 mA at 4 °C in a mini-gel system (10-cm-long gel). Calibration was achieved by separation of reference proteins of known molecular masses: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (14 kDa, Amersham Biosciences). For gel filtration, 100 μl of 2% DDM-solubilized membrane proteins were applied to a Superdex 200 or Superdex 75 (XK 16/40; Amersham Biosciences), and chromatography was performed in 6-amino-caproic acid buffer (750 mm 6-amino-caproic acid, 50 mm BisTris, pH 7) containing 0.03% DDM performed at 4 °C with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in an Äkta fast protein liquid chromatography purifier (Amersham Biosciences). 100 μl of calibration kit proteins (ferritin, 1 mg/ml; all other proteins, 10 mg/ml) were separated in 6-amino-caproic acid buffer with 0.03% DDM. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cells were incubated in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min at 100 °C followed by SDS-PAGE. Chromatography samples were incubated in Laemmli sample buffer buffer for 30 min at 37 °C to avoid aggregate formation followed by SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli (for proteins larger than 20 kDa) or the Schägger and von Jagow system (for proteins smaller than 20 kDa) (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar, 31Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed following standard protocols (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), with VirB protein-specific antisera. Purification of Fusion Proteins—N-terminally hexahistidyl-thioredoxin (H6TrxA)-tagged proteins were overproduced in GJ1158 using pT7-H6TrxFus constructs (33Kromayer M. Wilting R. Tormay P. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cells from 400-ml cultures were suspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by a French Pressure Cell (Aminco) at 18,000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged twice (SS34 rotor, 30 min, 13,000 rpm at 4 °C), and the supernatant was applied to a high pressure liquid chromatography system (Äkta Purifier; Amersham Biosciences) with a Ni2+-charged IMAC column (Talon™ Superflow; Clontech). Tagged proteins were eluted using a step gradient. At a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, the column was first washed for 5 column volumes in buffer A (50 mm Hepes, 0.3-1 m NaCl, pH 7.5), followed by washing with buffer A with 20 mm imidazole (2.5 column volumes) and elution with buffer B (buffer A with 400 mm imidazole). The fractions were dialyzed overnight in H1B (50 mm Hepes, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), followed by a second dialysis overnight in H2B (H1B with 50% glycerol and 2 mm dithiothreitol) and storage at -20 °C. N-terminally StrepII-tagged proteins were overproduced in GJ1158 using pT7-7StrepII (34Balsinger S. Ragaz C. Baron C. Narberhaus F. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6824-6829Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and 400-ml cultures were lysed in 10 ml of S2B (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were lysed, and the supernatant was collected as described above. Fusion proteins were purified with a 1-ml Strep-Tactin Superflow® column (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) following the instructions of the manufacturer using 2.5 mm desthiobiotin in the elution buffer. The fractions were subsequently purified by size exclusion chromatography using S2B at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Superdex 75 or Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) was used, depending on the molecular mass of the protein. The proteins were then dialyzed overnight in PSB (S2B buffer with 50% glycerol and 2 mm dithiothreitol) and stored at -20 °C. Assays for Protein-Protein Interactions: Pull-down and Cross-linking Experiments—For pull-down experiments, 10 μl each of purified StrepII- and H6TrxA-tagged proteins concentrated at 5 pmol/μl in PSB were mixed, followed by the addition of 80 μl of S2B and incubation for 30 min at 22 °C. Next, 20 μl of Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads (50% suspension in S2B; IBA) were added, followed by a 15-min incubation at 22 °C. The Sepharose beads were subsequently sedimented by centrifugation and washed three times with 200 μl of S2B. Bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of S2B with 1 mm biotin, mixed with 1 volume of Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For chemical cross-linking, 5 μl each of 10 pmol/μl stock solutions of purified StrepII-tagged proteins in PSB (or 5 μl of PSB as negative control) were mixed for 5 min at 22 °C, 90 μl of CLB (50 mm MES-KOH, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min. The cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate (10 mm stock in Me2SO; Pierce) was added in different concentrations (0.05 and 0.1 μm), and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 22 °C, followed by the addition of 1 volume of Laemmli sample buffer and analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The Matchmaker 3 system (Clontech) was used for the analysis of protein-protein interactions with the yeast two-hybrid system following the manufacturer's protocols. The genes encoding the periplasmic domains VirB5sp, VirB8sp, VirB9sp, and VirB10sp were cloned into pGADT7 (GAL4 activation domain fusion) and pGBKT7 (DNA binding domain fusion) as described above. The plasmids were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 using the lithium acetate method (Clontech Manual; Clontech), and plasmid-carrying cells were selected on minimal medium without leucine and tryptophan. Interactions between VirB proteins, which tethered both domains of GAL4 together, were identified by growth of plasmid-carrying cells on minimal medium without histidine and adenine and by β-galactosidase activity. VirB4 Stabilizes VirB3 and VirB8—To study the role of VirB4, we deleted virB4 in the Ti plasmid of wild-type C58, resulting in strain CB1004 (ΔvirB4). Next, virulence genes were induced by cultivation on acidic minimal medium with acetosyringone followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Specific antisera were applied to compare the VirB protein levels in cells of non-induced and virulence gene-induced C58 (controls) and in CB1004. The levels of most VirB proteins were comparable in C58 and CB1004 (Fig. 1B), but VirB3, VirB8, and VirB4 were not detected or were detected only in very small quantities in CB1004 (Fig. 1A). Whereas the absence of VirB4 was expected, and reduced levels of VirB3 had been reported previously (19Jones A.L. Shirasu K. Kado C.I. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5255-5261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the reduced levels of VirB8 showed that VirB4 plays a role for the accumulation of this protein. A previous study in a different A. tumefaciens strain suggested that the structure of VirB4, but not its NTPase activity, is required for VirB protein stabilization (8Dang T.A. Zhou X.-R. Graf B. Christie P.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1239-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To assess this possibility, A. tumefaciens virB4 was cloned behind the tightly controlled E. coli arabinose (BAD) promoter of broad host range vector pVSBAD. An active site change was engineered, and the cloning vector pVSBAD and constructs encoding VirB4 and its Walker A derivative (VirB4K439R) were introduced into CB1004. Analysis of the resulting strains demonstrated that production of VirB4 as well as production of VirB4K439R restored the levels of VirB3 and VirB8 (Fig. 1A). To further study the requirement of VirB4 sequence and structure, we cloned the gene encoding the B. suis VirB4 homolog (VirB4s) into pVSBADNco and engineered an active site change (VirB4sK464R). The production of both VirB4s and VirB4sK464R fully restored levels of VirB3 and VirB8 (Fig. 1A). When CB1004 complemented with plasmids encoding VirB4 or VirB4s (data not show"
https://openalex.org/W1973769128,"Twelve phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes have been cloned so far, and they are divided into six classes, β-, γ-, δ-, ϵ-, ζ-, and η-type, on the basis of structure and activation mechanisms. Here we report the identification of a novel PLC isozyme, PLCη2. PLCη2 is composed of conserved domains including pleckstrin homology, EF-hand, X and Y catalytic, and C2 domains and the isozyme-specific C-terminal region. PLCη2 consists of 1164 amino acids with a molecular mass of 125 kDa. The PLC activity of PLCη2 was more sensitive to calcium concentration than the PLC activity of the PLCδ-type enzyme, which is thought to be the most calcium-sensitive PLC. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that PLCη2 was localized predominantly to the plasma membrane at resting state via the pleckstrin homology domain. This observation was supported by Western blot analysis of cytosol and membrane fractions. In addition, expression of PLCη2 was detected after birth and showed a restricted distribution in the brain; it was particularly abundant in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and olfactory bulb. The pattern was similar to that of the neuronal marker microtubule-associated protein 2 by Western blot. Furthermore, in situ hybridization showed positive signals for PLCη2 in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. Finally, we found that PLCη2 was expressed abundantly in neuron-containing primary culture but not in astrocyte-enriched culture. These results indicate that PLCη2 is a neuron-specific isozyme that may be important for the formation and/or maintenance of the neuronal network in the postnatal brain.

Phosphoinositide metabolism contributes an important intracellular signaling system that is involved in a variety of cell functions such as hormone secretion, neurotransmitter signal transduction, cell growth, membrane trafficking, ion channel activity, and regulation of the cytoskeleton (1Fukami K.

All of the PLC isozymes contain catalytic X and Y domains as well as various regulatory domains, including the protein kinase C conserved region 2 (C2) domain, EF-hand motif, and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain.

Recent data base information suggests the existence of an additional PLC-like protein in the mouse and human genomes. Therefore we attempted to isolate the cDNA for PLC-like protein, PLCη2, from mouse brain by reverse transcription-PCR. We found PLCη2 to be much enriched in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and olfactory bulb, beginning after birth. In addition, PLCη2 was abundant in primary cultured neurons but not in astrocytes. These results suggest that PLCη2 may be important for the formation and maintenance of the neuronal network in the postnatal brain. Isolation and Construction of Mouse PLCη2 cDNA—The open reading frame of PLCη2 was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from mouse brain RNA. Primers used were: full-length PLCη2, forward, 5′-agatctatgcctggtccccagccgtc-3′, and reverse, 5′-gtcgacgtctcaatccctaacggtgg-3′; N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔN), forward, 5′-agatctatgagtgccatgcaagaggg-3′; PH-truncated mutant (ΔPH), forward, 5′-cgcagatctatggctggcatcagcga-3′; and PH fragment, reverse, 5′-gcggtcgacgatgccagccatgagg-3′. BglII and SalI sites in the forward and reverse primers, respectively, are underlined. PCR was carried out for 35 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 10 s at 55 °C, and 3.5 min at 68 °C. Correct sequences were confirmed with a BigDye Terminator sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). For an analysis of subcellular localization, PLCη2 and ΔPH mutants were cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen), and the PH fragment was cloned into the pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Sigma). Antibodies and Western Blot Analysis—A rabbit polyclonal antibody against a His6-tagged region between the X and Y domains (X-Y region) of PLCη2 was developed. Affinity-purified anti-PLCη2 antibody was prepared by passing the serum over a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged antigen-coupled Hi-Trap™ NHS-activated HP column (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Sigma, and fluorescent secondary antibodies and Alexa 594-phalloidin were from Molecular Probes. Anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), anti-myelin basic protein (MBP), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and anti-actin antibodies were from Neomarkers, BD Biosciences, DAKO, and Sigma, respectively. Brain and other tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 120 mm KCl, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g to remove insoluble debris. The resulting supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed with antibodies against PLCη2 or actin (Chemicon) and incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO), and immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and Measurement of PLC Activity in Vitro— Brain was homogenized as described above. Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with nonimmune IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PLCδ1 (a gift from Dr. Pann-Ghill Suh, POSTECH, Pohang, Korea), or PLCδ4 antibody (16Fukami K. Nakao K. Inoue T. Kataoka Y. Kurokawa M. Fissore R.A. Nakamura K. Katsuki M. Mikoshiba K. Yoshida N. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 292: 920-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences). PLC activity of the precipitates was measured as described elsewhere (17Nagano K. Fukami K. Minagawa T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki C. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, precipitates were incubated in a reaction mixture of 50 μm phosphatidylethanolamine (Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories), 40 μm PIP2 (Sigma), 1 μCi/ml (100 nm) [3H]PIP2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 76 mm KCl, 100 μm Ca2+, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was terminated by adding chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). Resulting [3H]IP3 was extracted by adding 1 n HCl and measured with a liquid scintillation counter. For mutation analysis and assay of calcium dependence and pH dependence, GST-tagged PLCη2 and GST-tagged PLCδ1 were prepared with a baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system (Invitrogen). For mutation analysis and pPH dependence, assays were performed in the presence of 10 μm Ca2+, and then the amounts of [3H]IP3 production by these enzymes in vitro were measured. Northern Blot Analysis—Mouse multiple Northern blot membrane was purchased from Clontech. The membrane was probed with radiolabeled probe comprising 426 bp of the following region of the C2 domain (nucleotides 2623–3048 of the open reading frame) as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol. Cell Culture and Immunostaining—HeLa S3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For immunostaining, HeLa S3 cells were transfected with various plasmids with the use of Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature for 5 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% skim milk. Then the cells were incubated with anti-PLCη2 polyclonal antibody or anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody and treated with the appropriate Alexa 488-conjugated goat secondary antibody. To visualize the actin cytoskeleton, Alexa 594-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used. Hippocampal primary culture and cortical astrocyte-enriched culture were carried out as described previously (18Tsuchiya R. Yoshiki F. Kudo Y. Morita M. Brain Res. 2002; 956: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Morita M. Higuchi C. Moto T. Kozuka N. Susuki J. Itofusa R. Yamashita J. Kudo Y. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10944-10952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the hippocampal cells were prepared from embryonic day 18 or 19 Wistar rats by enzymatic treatment and plated onto 12-mm polyethyleneimine-coated coverslips in DMEM containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 5% horse serum, and 5% FBS. The day after plating, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing B27 supplement (Invitrogen), and cells were cultured for 14–21 days. To obtain astrocytes, cortical cells were prepared from postnatal day 1 rat by enzymatic treatment and cultured for 12 days in basal Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS with a medium change every 3 days, and the resulting mixed glia culture was shaken at 260 rpm for 18 h at 37 °C and then rinsed with medium to remove nonastrocytic cells. Adherent cells were subcultured in DMEM containing 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, and 10% FBS. After 48 h, if necessary the medium was changed to astrocyte-defined medium (ADM), and culture continued for an additional 48–96 h. Cultures were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% skim milk. Cells were then incubated with anti-MAP2 monoclonal antibody and anti-GFAP polyclonal antibody and treated with the appropriate Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-conjugated goat secondary antibodies. Cells were observed with confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica Microsystems). In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed with digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes (Roche Applied Science). Probes for a 401-base pair fragment were designed from position 1482 to 1882 of the open reading frame of PLCη2. Hybridization was carried out as described previously (20Abe S. Katagiri T. Saito-Hisaminato A. Usami S. Inoue Y. Tsunoda T. Nakamura Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 72: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), under contract by Genostaff. The probes were hybridized at 60 °C with 60% formamide. Sections were treated with anti-digoxigenin antibody at room temperature and visualized with diaminobenzidine. Isolation of Mouse PLCη2 cDNA—The mouse genome-sequencing project has recently been completed. We searched the Celera, Inc. data base and found two genes on mouse chromosomes 3 (mCG6375) and 4 (mCG3920) that encode PLC-like proteins. The former gene was recently reported as PLCη (21Hwang J.I. Oh Y.S. Shin K.J. Kim H. Ryu S. Suh P.G. Biochem. J. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The latter gene encoded five PLC-specific functional domains, including PH, EF-hand, PLCX, PLCY, and C2, and a long extension at the C terminus, but unfortunately this gene lacked the N-terminal sequence. We then carried out a BLAST search analysis of mCG3920 and found a clone that might contain the N-terminal region of this protein (RIKEN cDNA A930027K05). With this putative full-length sequence, a complete open reading frame region was isolated from mouse brain by reverse transcription-PCR, and correct nucleotide and amino acid sequences were confirmed (Fig. 1A). The five PLC-specific domains, PH, EF-hand, PLCX, PLCY, and C2, are shown boxed in Fig. 1A. Because there were two N-terminal methionine residues that could be used as the first methionine, we attempted to determine which was the correct one. First, we developed a rabbit polyclonal antibody against this PLC-like protein. The antigen was designed against the linker region between PLCX and PLCY (underlined in Fig. 1A). This antibody showed no cross-reaction with other PLC isozymes (data not shown). With this antibody, we immunoprecipitated the endogenous protein from mouse brain, and the molecular mass was compared with the molecular mass of ectopically expressed short-type (ΔN) or long-type (Full) novel PLC-like protein (Fig. 1B). The molecular mass of the endogenous protein coincided with that of long-type PLC-like protein. The estimated number of amino acids was 1164, and the predicted molecular mass was 125 kDa. The domain structures of PLC subtypes PLCβ, -γ, -δ, -ϵ, -ζ, and -η1 and the novel PLC-like protein are illustrated in Fig. 1C. Although the novel protein appeared to be a member of the PLCβ family with a long C terminus, amino acid comparison showed that it is similar to PLCδ and has the highest similarity to PLCη1 (Fig. 1D). Therefore, we named the protein PLCη2 (GenBank™ accession number AY966876). We could not find any similarity against the PH domain and EF-hand motif of PLCβ and ϵ. A dendrogram based on total amino acid similarity is shown in Fig. 1E, in which PLCη2 locates closer to the PLCδ than to the PLCβ family. Distribution of PLCη2 in Various Tissues by Western and Northern Analysis—We examined the distribution of PLCη2 in various mouse tissues. First, Western blot analysis with PLCη2 antibody was carried out. As shown in Fig. 2A, a 125-kDa protein was specifically detected in mouse brain. We occasionally detected a degraded protein of ∼95 kDa. No bands were detected in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, small intestine, lung, testis, or spleen. Actin was used as a loading control. Northern blot analysis also showed a specific signal of ∼6.5 kb in brain (Fig. 2B), indicating that expression of PLCη2 is limited to the brain. Activity of PLCη2 Is Very Sensitive to the Calcium Concentration—Two PLC-like proteins (PLC-L-type) that lack PLC activity (PIP2-hydrolyzing activity) have been reported (22Kanematsu T. Takeya H. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Yoshida M. Koga T. Iwanaga S. Hirata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6518-6525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Otsuki M. Fukami K. Kohno T. Yokota J. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether PLCη2 possesses PLC activity. Endogenous PLCη2 immunoprecipitated from mouse brain with anti-PLCη2 antibody showed relatively high activity (Fig. 3A). The activity of PLCη2 was similar to that of PLCδ4 and lower than that of PLCδ1, which possesses high PLC activity. Immunoprecipitate with normal IgG (Fig. 3A, N) showed little activity. The PLCX and PLCY domains, which confer PLC activity, are highly conserved among PLC isozymes. It is well known that a histidine residue in the PLCX domain is essential for PLC activity (Fig. 3B); substitution of histidine with alanine resulted in a dramatic reduction of enzyme activity (24Ellis M.V. U S. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine whether histidine 341 in the PLCX domain of PLCη2 is essential for PLC activity, we constructed a mutant in which this histidine is substituted with alanine (H341A). GST-fused recombinant PLCη2 expressed in a baculovirus system showed specific activity of 54 nmol/min/mg protein, whereas the H341A mutant showed activity similar to that of the GST control (Fig. 3C), indicating that histidine 341 in the PLCX domain of PLCη2 is essential for PLC activity. PLCη2 resembles PLCδ, which is very sensitive to [Ca2+] (25Kim Y.H. Park T.J. Lee Y.H. Baek K.J. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Kim K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26127-26134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the dependence of PLC activity on [Ca2+]. PLC activity was measured at [Ca2+] between 10-8 and 10-4 m for PLCη2 and PLCδ 1 (Fig. 3D). Whereas PLCδ 1 showed maximal PLC activity at 10–100 μm Ca2+, PLCη2 showed maximal PLC activity at 1 μm Ca2+ and was sensitive to Ca2+ at a concentration as low as 10 nm, indicating that the PLC activity of PLCη2 is more sensitive to [Ca2+] than is the PLC activity of PLCδ1. We also measured PLC activity under various pH conditions. Maximal PLC activity of PLCη2 and PLCδ1 was obtained at pH 7.0 (Fig. 3E), similar to that observed for other PLC isozymes. The N-terminal Region of PLCη2 Contains a Localization Signal for the Plasma Membrane—Most PLC isozymes exist in the cytosol and translocate to the plasma membrane in response to cell stimulation through isozyme-specific anchoring mechanisms (26Flesch F.M. Yu J.W. Lemmon M.A. Burger K.N. Biochem. J. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.S. Kim S.R. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Commun. 1999; 254: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PLCδ1 expressed in HeLa S3 cells was localized predominantly in the cytosol (Fig. 4B, j). However, PLCη2 was localized predominantly at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B, a). Because the PH domain of PLCδ provides a trigger for membrane targeting (26Flesch F.M. Yu J.W. Lemmon M.A. Burger K.N. Biochem. J. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fujii M. Ohtsubo M. Ogawa T. Kamata H. Hirata H. Yagisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we next examined whether membrane binding of PLCη2 occurs via the PH domain. A deletion mutant of PLCη2 PH domain (Fig. 4A, ΔPH) localized predominantly to the cytosol (Fig. 4B, d), whereas the FLAG-tagged PH region was restricted to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B, g). Distribution of these proteins to the cytosol or plasma membrane in cell populations is shown in Fig. 4C. Approximately 85% of full-length PLCη2 and 97% of FLAG-tagged PH protein localized to the membrane, whereas less than 6% of ΔPH localized to the membrane. More than two-thirds of PLCδ1 was detected in the cytosol. These results strongly suggest that the N-terminal PH region of PLCη2 contains a targeting signal for the plasma membrane. To confirm these results, membrane and cytosol fractions were separated, and Western blot analysis was performed (Fig. 4D). Bands of full-length PLCη2 and FLAG-tagged PH protein were detected in the membrane fraction, whereas bands of ΔPH and PLCδ1 were detected mainly in the cytosol. Increased Expression of PLCη2 in Postnatal Brain— Although expression of PLCη2 was abundant in adult brain, we did not detect it in embryos (data not shown). To understand the physiological function of PLCη2, we examined the change in expression of PLCη2 during brain development (Fig. 5A). At 1 week after birth, PLCη2 was barely detected, and expression was first observed at 2 weeks after birth. Expression of PLCη2 gradually increased during brain development and was similar to that of MBP, a marker of mature oligodendrocytes. PLCη2 Is Abundant in the Hippocampus, Cerebral Cortex, and Olfactory Bulb—To further evaluate the distribution of PLCη2, we examined the specific localization of PLCη2 in the brain. PLCη2 was detected at a high level in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and olfactory bulb and weakly in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and cerebellum. No expression was observed in the pons, medulla oblongata, or spinal cord (Fig. 5B). Comparison of the expression pattern of PLCη2 with that of MAP2 (a marker of neurons), GFAP (a marker of astrocytes), and MBP showed that the expression pattern of PLCη2 was very similar to that of MAP2, implying that PLCη2 expression is correlated with neural function. Olfactory organs function in odor discrimination, pheromone perception, and odor and pheromone memory. To determine whether PLCη2 is coupled to the odor or pheromone receptor, we separated olfactory organs into regions and determined the distribution of PLCη2 (Fig. 5C). We could not detect PLCη2 in the olfactory epithelium or vomeronasal organs, where odor and pheromone receptors exist. However, PLCη2 was abundant in the main olfactory bulb and subolfactory bulb, indicating that PLCη2 is not coupled to odor or pheromone receptors but is involved in odor and pheromone signal transduction. In situ hybridization supported the expression pattern of PLCη2 detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6). Antisense signals for PLCη2 were observed in the olfactory bulb (Fig. 6, A–C), cerebral cortex (G–I), and hippocampus (M–O). The enlarged image of the hippocampus (Fig. 6, N and O) showed that pyramidal cells strongly express PLCη2. The diencephalon, mesencephalon, pons, and medulla oblongata were not stained (data not shown). No positive signal was obtained with sense probes (Fig. 6, D–F, J–L, and P–R). PLCη2 Is a Neuron-specific Enzyme—The distinct expression of PLCη2 in the brain and during development implies that PLCη2 plays a role in nerve tissues. We attempted to confirm this in primary cultured neurons and astrocytes. Neuron-containing primary cultures in defined medium (B27) and astrocyte-enriched cultures in conventional serum-containing medium (FBS) or ADM were used. Cell population was verified by the expression of MAP2, GFAP, or MBP by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 7A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 7B). Although astrocytes were observed in all of these cultures, neurons were detected only in primary cultures (B27). As shown in Fig. 7B, PLCη2 was detected only in primary cultures (B27) but not in astrocyte-enriched cultures (FBS and ADM). Oligodendrocytes were not detected in these cultures. These results indicate that PLCη2 is expressed specifically in neurons and may have important functions postnatally. Herein we report the isolation of a novel PLC isozyme, PLCη2, from mouse brain. The primary sequence of PLCη2 suggests that it should be classified as a PLCβ-type enzyme because it includes the basic domains of PLC and an additional 290 amino acids at the C terminus (Fig. 1C). However, sequence comparison showed a similarity to PLCδ (Fig. 1, D and E). Recently, a novel class of PLC isozyme, PLCη, was reported (21Hwang J.I. Oh Y.S. Shin K.J. Kim H. Ryu S. Suh P.G. Biochem. J. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Because PLCη2 has the highest homology to PLCη, we named this enzyme PLCη2. One of the specific characteristics of PLCη2 is the high sensitivity of PLC activity to [Ca2+], which is similar to the sensitivity of PLCη. PLCη2 is activated at [Ca2+] as low as 10 nm, indicating a sensitivity 10 times greater than that of PLCδ (Fig. 3D). PLCδ is known as the most calcium-sensitive PLC and is activated only by calcium. Therefore, it is possible that the increased calcium dependence of PLCη2 allows it to act as a calcium sensor and to be activated by small increases in intracellular calcium concentration under physiological conditions. It is also noteworthy that PLCη2 is localized predominantly to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B, a) in contrast to most other PLC isozymes, which commonly exist in the cytosol and translocate to the plasma membrane in response to receptor activation. We showed by analysis of cell staining and subcellular fractionation that the PH domain of PLCη2 is essential for membrane anchoring. Constitutive PH domain-mediated localization of PLCη2 to the plasma membrane suggests a novel role of PLCη2 as an early response molecule. We further found that the expression of PLCη2 is restricted to the brain (Fig. 2) and occurs after birth (Fig. 5A). The expression continues throughout the life of the adult (Fig. 5B). Robust synapse formation occurs during a short period of postnatal development. Thus, it is likely that PLCη2 functions in the formation and maintenance of the neuronal network in the brain. Detailed examination by Western blot and in situ hybridization revealed that PLCη2 is particularly abundant in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and olfactory bulb (Figs. 5B and 6). These organs are known to contribute to memory formation, suggesting that PLCη2 may be involved in this function. PLCη2 is also expressed in olfactory organs (Fig. 5C). Although PLCη2 is not apparently coupled to odor or pheromone receptors, we detected expression of PLCη2 in the main olfactory bulb and subolfactory bulb, in which sensory neurons synapse with projection neurons, indicating that PLCη2 may be involved in odor and pheromone signal transduction. Finally, we detected PLCη2 abundantly in neuron-containing primary cultures but not in astrocytes (Fig. 7B). These observations indicate that PLCη2 may have important functions in neurons, such as neuronal network formation, a process that extends continuously from late embryogenesis to adulthood. The importance of calcium in the brain has been widely reported, including involvement of axon growth and retraction, growth cone guidance, synapse formation, and responses of various neurotransmitters. Because PLC is a key enzyme in cellular calcium mobilization, PLCη2 may play a specific role in calcium detection and mobilization in neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2133011371,"The agonist-stimulated metabolism of membrane lipids produces potent second messengers that regulate phagocytosis. We studied whether human ceramide kinase (hCERK) activity and ceramide 1-phosphate formation could lead to enhanced phagocytosis through a mechanism involving modulation of the membrane-structural order parameter. hCERK was stably transfected into COS-1 cells that were stably transfected with the FcγRIIA receptor. hCERK-transfected cells displayed a significant increase in phagocytic index in association with increased ceramide kinase activation and translocation to lipid rafts after activation with opsonized erythrocytes. When challenged with opsonized erythrocytes, hCERK-transfected cells increased phagocytosis by 1.5-fold compared with vector control and simultaneously increased ceramide 1-phosphate levels 2-fold compared with vector and unstimulated control cells. Control and hCERK-transfected cells were subjected to cellular fractionation. Utilizing an antibody against hCERK, we observed that CERK translocates during activation from the cytosol to a lipid raft fraction. The plasma membrane-structural order parameter of the transfectants was measured by labeling cells with Laurdan. Cells transfected with hCERK showed a higher liquid crystalline order than control cells with stimulation, conditions that are favorable for the promotion of membrane fusion at the sites of phagocytosis. The change in the structural order parameter of the lipid rafts probably contributes to phagocytosis by promoting phagosome formation.

The change in the structural order parameter of the lipid rafts probably contributes to phagocytosis by promoting phagosome formation. The second messengers produced by membrane lipids through agonist stimulation include not only glycerolipids but also sphingolipids. Sphingolipids are comprised of lipids that contain a long chain sphingoid base. Sphingolipids, in addition to being structural components of membranes, regulate cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions, proliferation, and differentiation. Members of this diverse group of lipids have emerged as a novel class of signaling molecules that also regulate phagocytosis. The mechanisms by which sphingolipids exert these effects remain incompletely defined. More than a decade ago, it was found that ceramide can be phosphorylated to ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P) 1The abbreviations used are: C1P, ceramide 1-phosphate; hCERK, human ceramide kinase; CERK, ceramide kinase; EIgG, erythrocytes; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; mβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin. 1The abbreviations used are: C1P, ceramide 1-phosphate; hCERK, human ceramide kinase; CERK, ceramide kinase; EIgG, erythrocytes; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; mβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin.

C1P is found in brain synaptic vesicles, and it is thought to play a role in regulating the secretion of neurotransmitters by promoting the fusion of vesicle membranes (4Shinghal R. Scheller R.H. Bajjalieh S.M. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2279-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ceramide kinase activity exists in HL-60 cells where C1P is derived from ceramide released from sphingomyelin (5Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14917-14921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human ceramide kinase (hCERK) was recently cloned based on the homology to two isoforms of mice and human sphingosine kinase (6Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The expressed kinase displayed specific ceramide phosphorylating activity. BLAST search analyses using the hCERK sequence revealed that a series of putative CERKs exist in a variety of cellular organisms, including plants, nematodes, insects, and vertebrates. CERKs represent a new class of lipid kinases that are clearly distinct from sphingosine and diacylglycerol kinases (6Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 7Hinkovska-Galcheva V.T. Boxer L.A. Mansfield P.J. Harsh D. Blackwood A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33203-33209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). C1P shares structural homology with phosphatidic acid, a lipid shown to be highly fusogenic (8Blackwood R.A. Transue A.T. Harsh D.M. Brower R.C. Zacharek S.J. Smolen J.E. Hessler R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In an earlier study, the generation of C1P was also observed to occur through the activation of a ceramide kinase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (7Hinkovska-Galcheva V.T. Boxer L.A. Mansfield P.J. Harsh D. Blackwood A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33203-33209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this model, C1P was found to be a potent fusogen. The addition of C1P to liposomes shifted the rate and extent of calcium-dependent fusion (7Hinkovska-Galcheva V.T. Boxer L.A. Mansfield P.J. Harsh D. Blackwood A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33203-33209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus C1P was postulated to play a role in phagosome formation. Subsequently, it was reported that the CERK mediates Ca2+-dependent degranulation in mast cells (9Mitsutake S. Kim T.J. Inagaki Y. Kato M. Yamashita T. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17570-17577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Others have also found that A549 cells transfected with the hCERK can induce arachidonate release and prostanoid synthesis (10Pettus B.J. Bielawska A. Spiegel S. Roddy P. Hannun Y.A. Chalfant C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38206-38213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Neutrophils are difficult to maintain in vitro for prolonged periods of time and are not amenable to transfection. Therefore, other model systems are often employed to probe the mechanism of phagocytosis and phagosome formation. COS-1 cells are one such model system. COS-1 cells acquire a phagocytic phenotype when transfected with the FcγRIIA receptor. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of transfecting COS-1 cells expressing FcγRIIA with the cDNA for hCERK on phagocytosis. Using the fluorescent probe Laurdan, we employed high-speed microspectrophotometry to examine the mechanism by which C1P enhances phagocytosis. We found that C1P increased during phagocytosis and that a distinct gel-like order lipid phase (Lo) was formed within the cell membrane at sites of C1P formation in the hCERK-transfected cells.

To create double expression transfectants with FcγRIIA and hCERK, COS-1 cells transfected stably with FcγRIIA were cultured in 35-mm dishes. At ∼80% confluence, the cells were transfected with 1 μg/ml pcDNA-hCERK expression vector using Lipofectamine Plus in 1 ml of Opti-MEM medium. 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added after 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2. To establish stable transfectants, cells were cultured with medium containing 200 μg/ml G-418 and 200 μg/ml Zeocin to select double transfectants. Sheep Erythrocytes—Sheep red blood cells were sensitized with rabbit IgG anti-sheep erythrocyte antibody as previously described (12Suchard S.J. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Mansfield P.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phagocytosis assays were conducted as previously described (13Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Kjeldsen L. Mansfield P.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Suchard S.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4761-4769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). hCERK Expression Vector—A plasmid carrying the hCERK gene was kindly provided by Dr. Takafumi Kohama (Sankyo Co, Ltd.). PCR amplifications were employed for 35 cycles with steps at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and CERK plasmid as templates. Primers used for PCR included hCERK-HindIII (5′-TTATATTTATCCCAAGCTTGGGATGGGGGCGACGGGGGCGGCGGA-3′) and hCERK-XhoI (5′-ATACCGCTCGAGCGGTGACTCTTCCTCCTCGATTCCCCGAGCAAA-3′). PCR products were ligated into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) followed by cloning, purification of plasmids, and sequencing. The entire open reading frame of the hCERK was excised at HindIII and XhoI sites from the plasmid described above. The open reading frame was then subcloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of a pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen) vector, which was modified to encode a C-terminal c-Myc tag to express a c-Myc-hCERK fusion protein. Construction of Catalytically Inactive hCERK—A search of the hCERK amino acid sequence for signaling domains using the SMART search tool revealed a similarity in residues 132-278 of hCERK to the putative diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) catalytic domain. One region of the hCERK sequence showing highest similarity corresponded to the proposed ATP-binding site of the DGK catalytic domain. This region in DGK displays some resemblance to the glycine-rich loop within the ATP-binding site of many protein kinases but is more divergent in hCERK. The glycine residue in this region is known to be essential for DGK catalytic activity, because mutation of this residue to aspartate ablates activity in all of the DGK family members examined, including the DGK region of sphingosine kinase. Therefore, in an attempt to produce a catalytically inactive hCERK, the corresponding glycine (Gly198) was mutated to aspartate in hCERK. A mutation was introduced in Myc-tagged hCERK in the pcDNA3 expression vector via mutagenic oligonucleotides using primers G198D-F (forward, 5′-CGGAGATGATATGTTCAGCGAG-3′) and G198D-R (reverse, 5′-GCTGAACATATCATCTCCGCCGAC-3′) by overlap extension methodology. Ceramide Kinase Activity Assay—Ceramide kinase activity was measured as described by Bajjaleih et al. (1Bajjalieh S.M. Martin T.F. Floor E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14354-14360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sonicated cells were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in a reaction mixture containing 5 μm ceramide (solubilized in 7.5% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 5 mm cardiolipin in 1 mm diethylenetraminepentaacetic acid), 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (4 Ci/mmol), and 3 mm CaCl2. The reaction was terminated with 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and 1 ml of 1 mm NaCl. An equal volume of the chloroform phase was removed and dried under nitrogen. Lipids were resolved by high performance thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel G60 with chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (40/16/12/8/4, v/v) solvent system. The products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Radiolabeling of COS-1 Cells—In order to measure C1P, COS-1 cells transfected with hCERK were labeled with d-erythro-[3H]sphingosine. Stably transfected COS-1 cells were labeled with d-erythro-[3H]sphingosine (2 mCi/ml) for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were removed with trypsin EDTA. The reaction was terminated by the centrifugation of the COS-1 cells, removal of the supernatant, and the addition of 2 ml of methanol. After transferring the samples to a glass tube, methanol and chloroform were added and the samples were sonicated and centrifuged for 30 min at 3000 × g. The supernatant was saved, and the pellets were reextracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The supernatants were combined with those of the first extraction, and 1 m NaCl was added. After centrifugation at 2000 × g, the lower layer was transferred to another tube and subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis. The lipids were dried under nitrogen, dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1), applied to high performance TLC plates, and developed using the system described above. The corresponding spots for C1P were identified with a radiolabeled standard. Cells were labeled with d-erythro-[3H]sphingosine for 24 h. Following phagocytosis, the medium was changed with phosphate-buffered saline containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ and cells were challenged with erythrocytes (EIgG). The extraction was performed as outlined for phosphate labeling. Lipid Raft Isolation—FcγRIIA, FcγRIIA/vector, and FcγRIIA/hCERK-transfected COS-1 cells were challenged with opsonized EIgG and the EIgG not ingested were lysed. COS-1 cells were harvested by scraping into buffer containing 20 mm Tricine (pH 7.8), 0.25 m sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA. The cells were washed and then disrupted in the same buffer with 30 strokes in a Wheaton tissue grinder. The postnuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation of the cell lysates at 100 × g for 10 min. The plasma membrane fraction was removed from 30% Percoll 0.25 m sucrose buffer after centrifugation at 84,000 × g for 30 min. Caveolae membrane fractions were isolated from the purified plasma membrane fractions using Opti-Prep gradients as previously described (14Shu L. Lee L. Chang Y. Holzman L.B. Edwards C.A. Shelden E. Shayman J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Aliquots of membrane fractions and the caveolae/lipid raft fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to Western blotting using anti-caveolin-1, anti-c-Myc antibodies, and an antibody against hCERK. Ceramide Assay—Lipids were extracted by the method of Van Veldhoven et al. (15Van Veldhoven P.P. Bishop W.R. Yurivich D.A. Bell R.M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 21-30PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular ceramide was assayed by the method of Preiss et al. (16Preiss J.E. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. Niedel J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Antibody Generation and Immunoblotting—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with vector or V5-CERK using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were lysed after 24 h in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transblotted to nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against a C-terminal hCERK peptide (RLFARGIEENPKPDSHS, 1:1000). After washing, the blots were incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature and immunopositive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. Treatment of COS-1 Cells with Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβCD)—COS-1 cells were treated with mβCD as described by Ottico et al. (17Ottico E. Prinetti A. Prioni S. Giannotta C. Basso L. Chigorno V.

The medium was discarded, and the dishes were washed three times with 1 ml of Locke's balanced saline solution (156 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Mg Cl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) prewarmed at 37 °C. The cells were incubated with 2 ml of Locke's solution in the presence or absence of 5 mm mβCD at 37 °C for 30 min. Measurement of Membrane Fluidity—Excitation microscopy shows coexisting regions of different generalized polarization in red blood cells, in a renal tubular cell line, and in purified renal brush border labeled with a fluorescent probe, 2-dimethylamino-6-lauroylnaphthalene (Laurdan) (18Parasassi T. Gratton E. Yu W.M. Wilson P. Levi M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2413-2429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells, transfected with FcγRIIA, FcγRIIA/hCERK, FcγRIIA/vector, and FcγRIIA/G198DhCERK, were labeled with Laurdan. Following EIgG binding, microspectrophotometry was performed to assess local changes in membrane fluidity. As a control, regions of the Laurdan emission spectrum that are not sensitive to membrane fluidity were evaluated. The labeling of the COS-1 cells followed the methods of Parasassi et al. (18Parasassi T. Gratton E. Yu W.M. Wilson P. Levi M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2413-2429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Laurdan emission spectra were collected from specific regions of single cells using an imaging spectrophotometer system. Cells were labeled with 2.5 μm Laurdan for 25 min at room temperature and then washed at least three times with buffer. To increase light collection efficiency, the bottom port of the microscope was fiber-coupled optically to the input side of an Acton-150 (Acton Instruments, Acton, MA) imaging spectrophotometer. The exit side was connected to a liquid nitrogen-cooled intensifier attached to a Peltier-cooled I-MAX-512 camera (approximately -20 °C) (Princeton Instruments) (19Kindzelskii A.L. Petty H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9207-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Worth R.G. Kim M.K. Kindzelskii A.L. Petty H.R. Schreiber A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4533-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The camera was controlled by a high-speed Princeton ST-133 interface and a Stanford Research Systems (Sunnyvale, CA) DG-535 delay gate generator. Microspectrophotometry used a 355-nm bandpass discriminating filter for excitation and a 405-nm long-pass dichroic mirror. Winspec software (Princeton Instruments) was used to analyze the data. hCERK distinct from that of diacylglycerol kinase was recently cloned (6Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In a preliminary study following transient transfection of FcγRIIA-expressing COS-1 cells with hCERK plasmid, a 40% increase of FcγRIIA-mediated phagocytosis of EIgG compared with control cells and 20% compared with vector control cells was observed (data not shown). The efficiency of the transient transfection was between 40 and 50% as detected by cotransfection with a β-galactosidase expression construct. These results raised the possibility that C1P potentiates phagocytosis. To test this possibility, stable transfectants simultaneously carrying FcγRIIA and hCERK or FcγRIIA and a catalytically inactive mutant, G198DhCERK, were created. CERK activity in control FcγRIIA cells was 0.39 ± 0.11 pmol/min/106 cells. The CERK activity was significantly increased in hCERK-transfected cells (0.7 ± 0.2 pmol/min/106 cells, p < 0.03). However, the activity was not elevated in the G198DhCERK mutant-transfected cells (0.12 ± 0.04 pmol/min/106 cells). The stably transfected cells revealed a marked increase in ingested red cells compared with the FcγRIIA control (Fig. 1A). Stably transfected cells containing hCERK displayed a 2.5-fold increase in their phagocytic index compared with control cells and a 1.5-fold increase compared with vector control cells at 30 min following challenge with EIgG (Fig. 1B). There was no increase in phagocytosis in FcγRIIA/G198DhCERK-transfected cells beyond that observed for the other controls. The percentage of COS-1 cells ingesting at least one EIgG increased from the control value of 43 ± 11 in the FcγRIIA cells to 70 ± 9 (p < 0.001; n = 6) in the hCERK-transfected cells. The percent of control vector-transfected cells ingesting EIgG was 50 ± 11, and the percent of FcγRIIA/G198DhCERK mutant was 45 ± 9 (Fig. 1C). Ceramide kinase activity was measured to ascertain whether hCERK transfectants would exhibit enhanced activity during phagocytosis. Ceramide kinase activity increased to maximal levels by 7 min following challenge with EIgG (Fig. 2A). Ceramide kinase activity increased in the FcγRIIA control cells from a resting value of 0.39 ± 0.1 to 0.86 ± 0.1 pmol/min/106 cells. Ceramide kinase increased from 0.29 ± 0.1 to 0.82 ± 0.4 in the vector control cells. However, in hCERK-transfected cells, the CERK activity increased from a resting value of 0.7 ± 0.2 to 1.46 ± 0.24 pmol/min/106 cells (p < 0.05) during the phagocytic challenge. Ceramide kinase activity (pmol/min/106 cells) of the catalytically inactive mutant G198D was 0.12 ± 0.04 at rest, 0.16 ± 0.1 at 7 min, and 0.097 ± 0.07 at 30 min with a phagocytic challenge. These differences were not statistically significant. The CERK activity rapidly fell by 10 min to levels approaching the basal-inactivated state in both the FcγRIIA and FcγRIIA/hCERK-transfected cells, but the activity rose significantly by 30 min in the FcγRIIA/hCERK-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). Previous work has demonstrated the existence of phagocytosis-dependent ceramide formation in FcγRIIA-transfected COS-1 cells (11Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Boxer L. Mansfield P.J. Schreiber A.D. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 974-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Ceramide mass was measured to determine whether the changes in ceramide kinase activity might secondarily lower ceramide levels in hCERK transfectants. There were no significant differences in ceramide levels between vector and CERK-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). Because ceramide levels were no lower in the hCERK transfectants, these data support the view that changes in C1P and not ceramide accounted for differences in phagocytic response. To ascertain whether C1P was also formed during phagocytosis, hCERK COS-1 cells were labeled with the ceramide precursor d-erythro-[3H]sphingosine. The lipids were then extracted, and the product profile was evaluated in several thin layer chromatography solvent systems by comparison to known standards. High performance thin layer plates were activated with 2% sodium borate for 1 h at 100 °C. Using a solvent system consisting of chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (40/16/12/8/4, v/v), a labeled product comigrating with C1P (Rf 0.50) was detected. The product was resistant to alkaline hydrolysis and was clearly separable from sphingosine (Rf 0.56), phosphatidic acid (Rf 0.80), and lysophosphatidic acid (Rf 0.27). C1P radioactivity increased by 3-fold in the hCERK-transfected cells compared with the vector control and non-transfected FcγRIIA cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Labeling stably transfected COS-1 cells with d-erythro-[3H]sphingosine and challenging them with EIgG for 30 min resulted in a further increase in the C1P formed. The phagocytic challenge increased C1P levels by 2-fold in the hCERK-transfected cells compared with FcγRIIA or FcγRIIA/vector control cells (Fig. 3B). d-Erythro-[3H]sphingosine-labeled hCERK-transfected COS-1 cells were also challenged with EIgG for different periods of time, and C1P formation was evaluated. C1P increased significantly at 7 min simultaneously with the increase of ceramide kinase activity and remained elevated to a 30-min time point (Fig. 4). Assuming that the cell sphingolipids were labeled to equilibrium by 24 h, the change in C1P activity would represent an increase in C1P from 11.52 ± 0.9 to 20.67 ± 6 pmol/106 cells at 7 min and to 21.1 ± 8 pmol/106 cells at 30 min. There was a significant difference for C1P levels at the 7- and 30-min time points.Fig. 4Time course of ceramide 1-phosphate generation from COS-1 cells bearing FcγRIIA/hCERK. Stably transfected COS-1 cells with hCERK were labeled with d-erythro-[3H]sphingosine (specific activity 20 Ci/mmol) for 24 h. The cell medium was changed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were challenged with EIgG (1 × 109/ml) at 37 °C for different periods of time. The lipids were extracted as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” C1P was measured before and after phagocytosis at 7 and 30 min. The values represents the mean ± S.D.

Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). Due to the high degree of saturated fatty acyl content of these sphingolipids, lipids rafts are thought to form a distinct gel-like ordered lipid phase within cell membranes. These domains have been reported to contain a variety of signaling molecules. Therefore, it was next confirmed that lipid rafts could be identified and isolated from COS-1 cells. Lipid rafts were subsequently identified by a caveolin-1 marker (Fig. 5A). Caveolin-1 was expressed in the lipid rafts but only weakly in non-membrane raft fractions obtained from FcγRIIA, vector control, and hCERK-transfected cells. Utilizing an antibody to c-Myc, c-Myc-tagged hCERK was identified in the appropriate raft fraction generated from Myc-tagged hCERK vector but not from cells generated with the control vector. An anti-hCERK antibody was employed to evaluate the subcellular distribution of hCERK. Immunoblots yielded bands consistent with the known molecular weight of hCERK (Fig. 5C). Using this antibody, the intracellular localization of CERK during activation was evaluated. COS-1 cells transfected with hCERK were stimulated with EIgG for different periods of times and then subjected to fractionation. Immunoblots revealed that, under resting conditions, CERK was distributed within the cytosol and only weakly in the raft fraction. With stimulation, CERK was translocated to the raft fraction and diminished in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 5C). The ceramide kinase activity was higher in the cytosolic fraction at the zero time point (11.23 ± 0.05 pmol/min/mg protein). As time progressed, the activity in the raft fraction increased from 4.95 ± 0.1 to 8.76 ± 0.07 pmol/min/mg protein at 7 min and to 14.86 ± 0.2 pmol/min/mg protein at 30 min following stimulation (Fig. 5D). Correspondingly, ceramide kinase activity was enriched in the caveolar fractions generated from non-stimulated transfected cells. The activity in hCERK-transfected cells was 4.9 ± 0.1 pmol/min/mg protein compared with 1.0 ± 0.08 pmol/min/mg protein for FcγRIIA controls and 1 ± 0.04 pmol/min/mg protein from caveolae obtained from vector control-transfe"

Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins occur in all living organisms wherein they assist a wide array of distinct biological processes, including metabolism, photosynthesis, or gene regulation (1Barras F. Loiseau L. Py B. Adv. Bacterial Physiol. 2005; 50 (in press)Google Scholar, 2Beinert H. Killey P.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 3Frazzon J.

As a general rule proteins make use of these cofactors to have their activity and/or their conformation controlled by changes in surrounding redox potentials. In the last decade tremendous progress has been made in our understanding of how apoproteins acquire Fe-S clusters in living cells. Early investigations showed that iron, sulfide, and reducing conditions were sufficient to promote Fe-S cluster assembly in proteins in vitro. Seminal work by Dean and co-workers (6Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) in their study of nitrogenase maturation in Azotobacter vinelandii uncovered the existence of a protein machinery that was instrumental in Fe-S biogenesis. In particular, NifS cysteine desulfurase was shown to provide sulfur from cysteine (6Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Subsequently, study of NifU led to the concept of scaffold protein, i.e. proteins that allow transient assembly of Fe-S cluster before their transfer to apoproteins (7Yuvanyama P. Agar J.N. Cash V.L. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Subsequent work in Escherichia coli revealed the existence of a second machinery, referred to as ISC (8Krebs C. Agar J.N. Smith A.D. Frazzon J. Dean D.R. Huynh B.H. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14069-14080Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition to IscS, the NifS-like cysteine desulfurase, and IscU, a scaffold acting as a sulfur acceptor, the ISC system comprises five additional proteins. IscA has been demonstrated to be a second scaffold, although a role as iron donor has recently been proposed (9Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol.

HscB and HscA constitute a Hsp40-Hsp70 co-chaperone/chaperone system, which is thought to assist Fe-S transfer from IscU to apoproteins (13Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In E. coli, the ISC system is synthesized under normal growth conditions and is viewed as fulfilling a housekeeping function. Defects in this system, and particularly in iscS, alter functioning of several Fe-S enzymes, leading to mutated phenotypic traits including, among others, nicotinamide and vitamin B1 auxotrophies (18Schwartz C.J.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The SUF system comprises a NifS-like cysteine desulfurase, SufS, and a scaffold related to IscA, SufA (31Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Nachin L. Sanakis Y. Loiseau L. Barras F. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

Yet recently an unexpected high level of structural similarity was observed between SufE and IscU (33Goldsmith-Fischman S. Kuzin A. Edstrom W.C. Benach J. Shastry R. Xiao R. Acton T.B. Honig B.

Last, the SufBCD proteins constitute an atypical cytoplasmic ABC-type complex (35Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Gene replacement strategy showed that with the possible exception of sufD, all suf genes are essential for the functioning of the SUF system (21Tokumoto U. Kitamura S. Fukuyama K. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). At first, the E. coli SUF system was viewed as playing a minor role, potentially backing up deficiencies of the ISC system. This view arose from the fact that mutations in the suf genes conferred no mutant phenotype under routine laboratory growth conditions. Also, synthetic lethality of iscS sufS mutations led credence to the idea that both systems were redundant. Subsequent work, however, revealed that the SUF system plays a major role in numerous organisms. In fact, E. coli makes use of the SUF system when growing under harsh conditions such as iron limitation or oxidative stress, i.e. conditions that are highly detrimental for building stable Fe-S clusters (35Nachin L.

Moreover, full virulence of the plant pathogen E. chrysanthemi was found to rely on a functional SUF system to invade its host (35Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Last, a crucial role of the SUF system in plants was illustrated by embryo lethal phenotypes of SufC mutant and reduced viability of SufB and SufD mutations in A. thaliana (29Xu X.M. Moller S.G.

Indeed, the CsdA protein was found to exhibit enzymatic activity very close from those of IscS and SufS cysteine desulfurases (39Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, CsdA was found to promote Fe-S cluster insertion into apoproteins in vitro (41Kurihara T. Mihara H. Kato S. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1647: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cognate structural csdA gene lies immediately upstream of a gene referred to as ygdK, of unknown function. The primary sequence of csdA shares 45% identity with sufS. Sequence comparison shows that ygdK shares 35% identity with sufE, and recently a remarkable structural similarity was observed between IscU, SufE, and YgdK (33Goldsmith-Fischman S. Kuzin A.

As we shall see in this study, YgdK provides a sulfur acceptor function for CsdA as does SufE for SufS, and we, therefore, propose to rename ygdK, csdE. In this study we carried a thorough investigation of the CSD system of E. coli. By using biochemical, biophysical, genetic, and physiological approaches, we show that the csdA-cdsE genes can substitute for the housekeeping iscS in promoting Fe-S biogenesis in vivo. The remarkable simplicity of this system and its potential particular link with NAD biosynthesis are discussed. Chemicals—All chemicals were of reagent grade and were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Fluka unless otherwise stated. Cysteine was from Roche Applied Science. Strains and Culture Conditions—All strains used are described in Table I. E. coli strains were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani (LB) rich medium or in M9-based minimal medium as previously described (35Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F.

S. cerevisiae strains were grown in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose or appropriate minimal dropout media (CM) in which 2% (w/v) glucose or 2% (w/v) galactose and 2% (w/v) raffinose were added (34Ramelot T.A.

Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). A fragment containing the iscS gene was amplified by PCR from E. coli MG1655 chromosomal DNA. Oligonucleotides Is and Ias used for the amplification are given in Table II. PCR product was subsequently inserted into pGEMT vector (Promega) by the T/A cloning method. The iscS gene was disrupted by inserting an aphA3 cassette between nucleotides 156 and 849 of the coding region. The resulting iscS::apha3 containing a DNA fragment was excised by restriction and electroporated into the E. coli BW251113/pKD46 strain, and KanR clones were selected. The E. coli Δ(csdA csdE)::apha3 mutant strains were constructed using the same protocol as described above. The aphA3 cassette was inserted between nucleotide 617 in csdA and nucleotide 233 in csdE. P1 transduction was used to move mutations from E. coli BW251113/pKD46 strains in MG1655 background yielding strains LL101 (iscS) and LL203 (csdA csdE).Table IIOligonucleotides used for plasmid and strain constructionAs5′-CCTAGGAATTCATGAACGTTTTTAATCCCG-3′Aas5′-GCCTTCTCGAGTTAATCCACCAATAATTCCAGC-3′Ks5′-CCTAGGAATTCATGACAAACCCGCAATTCG-3′Kas5′-GCCTTCTCGAGTTAAACCTGCTTCGTCGCAG-3′Is5′-GCATGAATTCATGAAATTACCGATTTATCTCG-3′Ias5′-GCCTCTCGAGTTAATGATGAGCCCATTCGATGC-3′S5′-GCATGAATTCATGATTTTTTCCGTCGACAAAGTGC-3′Eas5′-GTTCTCGAGTTAGCTAAGTGCAGCGGCTTTGGC -3′NdeI csdA5′-CCGCATATGAACGTTTTTAATCCCG-3′XhoI Δstop CsdA5′-GTTCTCGAGATCCACCAATAATTCCAGC-3′NdeI csdE5′-CCGCATATGACAAACCCGCAATTCG-3′XhoI Δstop csdE5′-GTTCTCGAGAACCTGCTTCGTCGC-3′3′C61ScsdE5′-GCTAAAGAGATTGCCGGATCCGAAAACCGCGTCTGG-3′5′C61ScsdE5′-CCAGACGCGGTTTTCGGATCCGGCAATCTCTTTAGC-3′ Open table in a new tab Plasmid Construction—For two-hybrid analysis, DNA fragments of interest were fused to the LexA (DNA binding domain), encoding DNA from the pEG202 vector, or to the transcriptional activation motif, B42, encoding DNA from pJG4 –5 vector (43Finley R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 44Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). The csdA and csdE gene-containing fragments were amplified using MG1655 chromosomal DNA as a template and primer As/Aas and Ks/Kas, respectively (Table II). The csdA and csdE PCR products were digested by EcoRI and XhoI and inserted into pEG202 and pJG4 –5 plasmids, digested by the same endonucleases, yielding the pB42 and pLexA series. To overproduce CsdAhis6 and CsdEhis6 proteins, the csdA and csdE genes were cloned into pET22b+. We used PCR to generate DNA fragments corresponding to the csdA and csdE coding sequences with, in both cases, an upstream NdeI site and downstream XhoI site (Table II). PCR was run as follows. Genomic DNA was denatured for 10 min at 94 °C. The DyNAzyme EXT DNA pol (Finzymes), deoxynucleoside mix (0.2 mm each), and the primers (0.5 mm final concentration) were added, and 29 cycles (94 °C 30 s; 50 °C 30 s; 72 °C 1 min) were then performed followed by a final 10-min elongation step at 72 °C. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the PCR products were inserted into pET22b+ vector digested by the same enzymes, yielding plasmids pLEC-A and pLEC-E. Plasmid pLEC-EC61S, encoding a mutated version of CsdE, was obtained as follows. Mutagenesis of csdE was performed in two steps. First, two complementary mutagenic oligonucleotides, 3′C61ScsdE and 5′C61ScsdE (Table II), were each used in combination with an oligonucleotide complementary to the 5′ end (NdeI csdE) and 3′ end (XhoI Δstop csdE) of csdE, respectively. The mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed such that cysteine 61 is changed to a serine residue. Oligonucleotides 3′C61ScsdE and NdeI csdE and oligonucleotides 5′C61ScsdE and XhoI Δstop csdE yielded the DNA fragments csdE1 and csdE2, respectively. The matrix used was pLEC-E. In the second step csdE1 and csdE2 were hybridized and used as templates for PCR amplification with the pair of oligonucleotides NdeI csdE/XhoI Δstop csdE. The resulting NdeI-XhoI fragment was cloned into pET22b+, yielding the plasmid pLEC-EC61S. Plasmid pLEC-AE was obtained as follows. We used Nde CsdA primer and XhoI Δstop csdE primers (Table II) to generate by PCR DNA fragments covering the whole csdA-csdE region. After NdeI and XhoI hydrolysis, the PCR products were inserted into pET22b+ vector digested by the same enzymes. A similar PCR-based strategy was used to produce pBAD derivatives carrying iscS, csdA, csdA-csdE, or sufS-sufE genes (45Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar). PCR products containing iscS, csdA, csdA-csdE, or sufS-sufE genes were obtained by using the Is/Ias, As/Aas, As/Kas, and Ss/Eas oligonucleotides pairs, respectively. PCR products were eventually inserted at the EcoRI and SalI sites in the pBAD vector, giving rise to pLBI-S, pLBC-A, pLBC-AE, and pLBS-SE plasmids, respectively. Purification of CsdAhis6, CsdEhis6, and CsdEC61Shis6 Proteins—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with plasmids pLEC-A, pLEC-E, pLEC-AE, or pLEC-E61S. Overexpression was induced in cells at mid-log phase by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. After 3 h of expression at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation. All of the cells were disrupted by passage twice through a French pressure cell at 1200 p.s.i. in buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8). After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, soluble proteins were loaded onto a 5 ml of nickel Hi-trap column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was subsequently washed with buffer A to remove nonspecifically bound E. coli proteins. The desired His6 protein was eluted from the Ni2+ column with a linear imidazole gradient from 40 to 500 mm. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The purified fractions were pooled, and imidazole was removed using a BIOMAX-5K device (Millipore) equilibrated with buffer A. Concentrated proteins were run on a gel filtration column (Superdex 75 HR 10/30 Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A at 30 ml/h. Fractions containing pure protein (estimated to be >98% on SDS-PAGE Coomassie) were pooled and concentrated onto a BIOMAX-5K. Samples were then separated into aliquots and stored at –80 °C. Yeast Two-hybrid System—The yeast two-hybrid assay was performed as previously described (43Finley R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 44Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity from diploid cells, obtained by mating of strains EGY48 and RF206 carrying the appropriated plasmid, was detected on plates and was quantified from liquid culture. β-Galactosidase activity was expressed as nmol of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein (with ϵ = 4.5 103 m–1). Diploid cells were also assayed for the expression of the Leu reporter gene as described (43Finley R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 44Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Hybrid proteins were detected in cell extracts by immunoblots using primary antibody raised against the hemagglutinin epitope or LexA. Assay for Cysteine Desulfurase Activity—Cysteine desulfurase activity was quantitated by assaying the amount of alanine formed from cysteine or selenocysteine. Selenocysteine solution was obtained after reduction of a 60 mm selenocystine-HCl solution with 10 mm DTT. 1The abbreviation used is: DTT, dithiothreitol. The standard reaction mixture in a final volume of 100 μl of buffer B (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 30 mm KCl) contained either 0.1 nmol of CsdA, 1 molar eq of CsdE, and variable amounts of either selenocysteine or cysteine. The reaction was monitored at 37 °C. At timed intervals (from 0 to 30 min) an aliquot was withdrawn, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10% (v/v) 1 m trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed for alanine production. For that procedure, supernatant was dried on a SpeedVac, and the residue was dissolved into 150 μl of a citrate buffer, pH 2.2. A ninhydrin derivative was generated and analyzed at 570 nm by high performance liquid chromatography on a 7300 Beckman apparatus working with an ion exchange column S101036 calibrated with pure amino acid standards. The cysteine desulfurase activity is in units (μmol alanine/min)/mg of protein. Sulfur Transfer Assays—All of the experiments were done under anaerobic conditions inside a glove box (<2 ppm O2, 18 °C). Both CsdAhis6 and CsdEhis6 were pretreated with 10 mm DTT and then repurified by gel filtration before use. For turnover experiments, CsdAhis6 (500 μm) was incubated with 4 mm cysteine for 30 min at 37 °C in order to load the protein with sulfur and to generate the persulfide intermediate. Excess of cysteine was removed by desalting the protein over a Micro Bio-spin 6 column. The resulting protein (100 μm) was incubated with CsdEhis6 (100 μm, wild-type or mutant protein) for different times at 37 °C in a final volume of 50 μl buffer F (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The reaction was stopped by freezing in liquid nitrogen, and proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra of proteins were obtained by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry on a Q-TOF Micro mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with a Z-spray ion source, operating with a needle voltage of 3 kV. Sample cone and extraction voltage were 70 and 3.5 V, respectively. Samples were infused continuously at 5 μl/min flow rate with a concentration between 400 and 900 nm in water/acetonitrile (1/1 (v/v)) with 0.2% formic acid. The mass spectra were recorded in the 700–1600 range of mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) with a 1-s scan time. A 1 μm solution of Glu-fibrinopeptide B was used to calibrate the instrument in the tandem mass spectroscopy mode. Spectra were acquired and processed with MassLinx 4.0 (Micromass). 35S Transfer Assay—All the experiments were done under anaerobic conditions inside a glove box (<2 ppm O2, 18 °C). Both CsdAhis6 and CsdEhis6 were pretreated with 10 mm DTT and then repurified by gel filtration before use. Sulfur transfer reactions were carried out at 18 °C for 30 min. 150 μm CsdA were incubated with 3 mm [35S]cysteine (123 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). The spin column eluant (persulfide form of CsdA) was mixed with an equimolar amount of CsdEhis6 in buffer E in a final volume of 25 μl. The resulting solution was mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer devoid of reductant. Samples were immediately analyzed by gel electrophoresis using a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS but in the absence of added reducing agent. 35S was visualized by exposure on a phosphor screen and analyzed using a PhosphorImager, and relative intensities were calculated using ImageQuant software supplied with the instrument. Reconstitution of NadA Holoenzyme—ApoNadA (50 μm) pretreated with 5 mm DTT was incubated in buffer B with 3 mm cysteine, a 10 m excess of ferrous iron, and different cysteine desulfurase enzymes (CsdAhis6, CsdAhis6/CsdEhis6, SufShis6/SufEhis6, and IscShis6).

https://openalex.org/W2138808082,"Escherichia coli contains a number of antitoxin-toxin modules on its chromosome, which are responsible for cell growth arrest and possible cell death. ChpBK is a toxin encoded by the ChpBIK antitoxin-toxin module. This module consists of a pair of genes, chpBI and chpBK encoding antitoxin ChpBI and toxin ChpBK, respectively. ChpBK consists of 116 amino acid residues, and its sequence shows 35% identity and 52% similarity to MazF, another E. coli toxin. MazF has been shown to be a sequence-specific (ACA) endoribonuclease that cleaves cellular mRNAs and effectively blocks protein synthesis and is thus termed as an mRNA interferase. Here we demonstrate that ChpBK is another mRNA interferase in E. coli whose induction effectively blocks cell growth in a manner similar to that of MazF. The protein synthesis as judged by incorporation of [35S]methionine was, however, reduced by only 60% upon ChpBK induction. We demonstrate that ChpBK is a new sequence-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves mRNAs both in vivo and in vitro at the 5′-or3′-side of the A residue in ACY sequences (Y is U, A, or G). The ChpBK cleavage of a synthetic RNA substrate generated a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate group at the 3′-end of the 5′-end product and a 5′-OH group at the 5′-end of the 3′-end product in a manner identical to that of MazF.

The existence of toxin or suicidal genes on bacterial chromosomes is intriguing. Escherichia coli contains five such genes, relE, mazF, chpBK, yoeB, and yafQ (1Christensen S.K. Maenhaut-Michel G. Mine N. Gottesman S. Gerdes K. Van Melderen L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1705-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). All these genes exist in an operon together with their cognate antitoxin genes: relB for relE (2Gotfredsen M. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), mazE for mazF (3Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6850-6856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yefM for yoeB (1Christensen S.K. Maenhaut-Michel G. Mine N. Gottesman S. Gerdes K. Van Melderen L. Mol.

Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1705-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These antitoxin-toxin operons are often termed as “addiction modules,” since the antitoxins are unstable as compared with their cognate toxins and therefore their continuous expressions are essential to prevent cell growth arrest caused by their respective toxins. Recently, PemK, a homologue of MazF encoded by plasmid R100 (5Tsuchimoto S. Ohtsubo E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), was demonstrated to be another sequence-specific endoribonuclease which preferentially cleaves single-stranded RNA at the 5′-or3′-side of the A residue in the UAH sequence (where H is C, A, or U) (6Zhang J. Zhang Y. Zhu L. Suzuki M. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20678-20684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These results suggest that bacteria seem to use a general strategy to block cell growth by interfering with mRNA function by cleaving them at specific sequences. Thus a term, mRNA interferase, was coined for these sequence-specific endoribonucleases (6Zhang J. Zhang Y. Zhu L. Suzuki M. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20678-20684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Among these E. coli toxins, the RelB-RelE and the MazE-MazF systems have been most extensively studied (7Gerdes K. Christensen S.K. Lobner-Olesen A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 8Engelberg-Kulka H. Sat B. Reches M. Amitai S. Hazan R. Trends Microbiol. 2004; 12: 66-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Recently the x-ray structure of the RelB-RelE complex from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 has been determined, consisting two molecules of RelB and RelE each (9Takagi H. Kakuta Y. Okada T. Yao M. Tanaka I. Kimura M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). RelE has been initially proposed to be a ribosome-dependent endoribonuclease preferentically cleaving at termination codons in mRNA (10Pedersen K. Zavialov A.V. Pavlov M.Y. Elf J. Gerdes K. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2003; 112: 131-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). However, RelE appears to be a factor that stimulates the intrinsic endoribonuclease activity of ribosomes (11Hayes C.S. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 903-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the MazE-MazF complex has also been determined, which consists of two MazF dimers and one MazE dimer (12Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of MazE dimer has also been determined (13Lah J. Marianovsky I. Glaser G.

When MazF expression was induced using an inducible vector, cell growth was completely blocked as a result of inhibition of protein synthesis (16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G.

Further studies revealed that MazF is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves ACA sequences in mRNAs or single-stranded RNAs (16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). This in turn very effectively reduces cellular protein synthesis. It has been shown that cell growth arrested by MazF can be recovered if MazE is induced in these cells (17Pedersen K. Christensen S.K. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus, these authors concluded that MazF toxin is bacteriostatic but not bactericidal. On the other hand, other researchers argue that MazF induction causes programmed cell death in E. coli as MazE induction cannot rescue cell viability after a certain period of time (a point of no return) (8Engelberg-Kulka H. Sat B. Reches M. Amitai S. Hazan R. Trends Microbiol. 2004; 12: 66-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Amitai S. Yassin Y. Engelberg-Kulka H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8295-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recently we demonstrated that MazF-induced cells stay in the quasi-dormant state (19Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) as these are fully capable of energy metabolism, amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis, and RNA and protein synthesis, although their growth is completely blocked (19Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Indeed, the MazF-induced cells in the quasi-dormant state are able to synthesize a single protein of interest at a high level for a long time if ACA sequences in its coding region are altered to make it resistant to degradation by MazF (19Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that ChpBK, which is 35% identical and 52% similar to MazF (see Fig. 1A), also functions as an mRNA interferase by cleaving RNA at the ACY (Y is U, A, or G) sequences. Strains and Plasmids—E. coli BL21(DE3) and BW25113 cells (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar) were used. The chpBIK operon was amplified by PCR and cloned into the XbaI-XhoI sites of pET21c (Novagen) by the same method as that used for cloning the mazEF operon (16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). This construction created an in-frame translation fusion with a His6 tag at the ChpBK C-terminal end. The plasmid was designated as pET21c-ChpBIK(His)6. The chpBK gene was cloned into pBAD (21Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar) creating pBAD-ChpBK. The E. coli mazG gene was cloned into the NdeI-BamHI sites of pET11a (New England Biolabs), creating pET11a-MazG (22Zhang J. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5323-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which was used for the production of the mazG mRNA. The mazG gene was cloned into a pINIII vector, creating pIN-MazG, which was used to identify the in vivo mazG mRNA cleavage sites by the primer extension (16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The E. coli era gene was cloned into the ScaI-XhoI sites of pET28a, creating pET28a-Era, which was used for the production of the era mRNA (23Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hara H. Kato I. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3143-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The era gene was also cloned into pINIII vector to create pIN-Era, which was used to identify the in vivo era mRNA cleavage sites by the primer extension (23Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hara H. Kato I. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3143-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—For purification of ChpBK(His)6, pET21c-ChpBIK(His)6 was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). The co-expression of ChpBI and ChpBK(His)6 was induced in the presence of 1 mm IPTG for 6 h. The ChpBI-ChpBK(His)6 complex was purified with use of Ni-NTA 1The abbreviations used are: Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; ORF, open reading frame; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. (Qiagen). To purify ChpBK(His)6 from the purified ChpBI-ChpBK(His)6 complex, ChpBI in the purified ChpBI-ChpBK(His)6 complex was dissociated from ChpBK(His)6 in 6 m guanidine HCl. Denatured ChpBK(His)6 was retrapped on Ni-NTA resin, then eluted and refolded by stepwise dialysis as carried out for purification of MazF (16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). ChpBK(His)6 is referred to as ChpBK in the text. Assay of Protein Synthesis in Vivo—E. coli BW25113 cells containing pBAD-ChpBK were grown in M9 medium with 0.5% glycerol (no glucose) and all the amino acids except methionine and cysteine (1 mm each). When the A600 value of the culture reached 0.45, arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.2% to induce ChpBK expression. Cell cultures (0.6 ml) were taken at time intervals as indicated in Fig. 2C and mixed with 20 μCi of [35S]methionine. After 1-min incubation at 37 °C, the rate of protein synthesis was determined as described previously (16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To prepare the samples for SDS-PAGE analysis of the total cellular protein synthesis, samples were removed from the [35S]methionine incorporation reaction mixture (500 μl) at time intervals indicated in Fig. 2C and added into a chilled test tube containing 100 μg/ml each of non-radioactive methionine and cysteine. Cell pellets collected by centrifugation were dissolved into 50 μl of loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by auto radiography. Primer Extension Analysis in Vivo and in Vitro—For primer extension analysis of mRNA cleavage sites in vivo, pIN-MazG or pIN-Era plasmid was transformed into E. coli BW25113 cells containing pBAD-ChpBK. The mazG or era mRNA transcription was induced by the addition of 1 mm IPTG. After 1-h induction, ChpBK was induced by the addition of arabinose (a final concentration of 0.2%). Total RNA was isolated at time intervals as indicated in Fig. 3. Primer extension was carried out using different primers as described previously (16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). For in vitro primer extension analysis, the full-length mazG and era mRNAs were synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase from the DNA fragment containing a T7 promotor sequence and mazG or era ORFs using the RiboMAX™ T7 large-scale RNA production system (Promega). The mazG and era ORFs were cloned into pET-11a and pET-28a, respectively, as described previously (22Zhang J. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5323-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hara H. Kato I. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3143-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The mazG and era DNA fragments were amplified using the forward primer (CCCGCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAG, T7 promotor) and the reverse primers starting from the 3′-end of the mazG or era ORFs, respectively. The mazG mRNA thus produced is 860 bases in length and the era mRNA 977 bases. The 151-base mazG mRNA fragment used as a ChpBK substrate in Figs. 4B and 9 was synthesized in vitro as described previously (16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). This fragment consisted of a 71-base sequence from pET-11a and an 80-base sequence from the mazG ORF from Met1 to the second base of Gln27. RNA substrates were partially digested with purified ChpBK at 37 °C for 15 min. The digestion reaction mixture (10 μl) consisted of 2 μg of RNA substrate, 1 μg of ChpBK(His)6 and 0.5 μl of RNase inhibitor in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). Partial digestion products were purified with the RNeasy column (Qiagen) to remove ChpBK protein. Primer extension was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h in 20 μl of the reaction mixture as described previously. The reactions were stopped by adding the 12 μl of sequence loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol EF). The samples were incubated at 90 °C for 5 min prior to electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide and 36% urea gel. The primers G1 (GCCCAGTTCACCGCGAAGATCGTC), G2 (CATTTCCTCCTCCAGTTTAGCCTGGTC), and G3 (TGCTCTTTATCCCACGGGCAG) were used for primer extension analysis of the mazG mRNA; the primers E1 (CAGTTCAGCGCCGAGGAAACGCAT), E2 (GATCCCCACAATGCGGTGACGAGT), and E3 (ATGACCATCTTCTTCTGCCCTT CA) were used for primer extension analysis of the era mRNA. The primers were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase.Fig. 4Primer extension analysis of ChpBK cleavage sites in the mazG and era mRNAs in vitro.

The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS at the final concentration of 0.5%.

The position of RNA molecular weight markers is shown at the left hand side of the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cleavage of Synthetic RNA by ChpBK—Oligoribonucleotides (11 base in length; see Fig. 6) were commercially synthesized and 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Endoribonuclease activity was assayed in 10 μl of the reaction mixture containing 0.5 μl (20 units) of ribonuclease inhibitor, 1 μg of ChpBK and 32P-labeled oligonucleotides in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by adding the sequence loading buffer as described above. The reaction mixtures were then subjected to 20% sequence gel electrophoresis followed by auto radiography. Note that under the present condition for the cleavage reaction, the RNA substrate concentrations are lower than the enzyme concentration. However, the synthetic RNA substrates were cleaved linearly in an enzyme concentration-dependent manner and also in a time-dependent manner (Figs. 8 and 9A).Fig. 8ChpBK cleavage reaction with two different 11-base RNA substrates. RB-11-1 and RB-11-2 (see Fig. 6A) were used as substrates. Endoribonuclease activity was assayed in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 20 units of Protector RNase Inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), different amounts of ChpBK, and 2 pmol of 32P-labeled 11-base RNA in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by adding 4 μl of the sequencing loading buffer.

One microliter of an RNA (4 μm) sample with or without ChpBK in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) was spotted onto a stainless steel sample plate, and the sample was dried at room temperature. The saturated matrix solution (0.5 μl) was then spotted on the dried sample. After the sample was completely dried, mass measurements were carried out using a Voyager DE PRO MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). The Effect of ChpBK on Cell Growth and Protein Synthesis in Vivo—The chpBK gene was cloned into an arabinose inducible pBAD plasmid (21Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar). E. coli BW25113 cells carrying pBAD-ChpBK could not form colonies on glycerol-M9-casamino acids agar plates in the presence of arabinose (0.2%) (Fig. 1B). Fig. 2A shows growth curves of E. coli BW25113 cells carrying pBAD-ChpBK in glycerol-M9 medium containing all amino acids except methionine and cysteine (1 mm each). Arabinose was added to exponentially growing cells at a final concentration of 0.2% (closed squares). Addition of arabinose severely inhibited the cell growth. At 30 min after the addition of arabinose, cell growth was almost completely blocked. Next we examined the effect of ChpBK induction on protein synthesis as measured by [35S]methionine incorporation (Fig. 2B). Within 10 min of ChpBK induction, the total protein synthesis was reduced by ∼60% (closed squares). Interestingly, there was no significant further reduction of [35S]methionine incorporation after 15 min. These samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the result in Fig. 2B, ChpBK did not completely block incorporation of [35S]methionine into cellular proteins, and a low level of cellular protein synthesis is observed even at 60 min after ChpBK induction. It should be noted that a new band appeared 5 min after ChpBK induction as indicated by an “arrow a” (Fig. 2C), of which molecular mass was consistent with the calculated molecular mass of ChpBK (12.5 kDa). The production of this protein continued for 60 min, although the rate of its synthesis was reduced after 20 min. Induction of MazF under a similar condition almost completely blocked [35S]methionine incorporation (at 15 min after the addition of arabinose (16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar)), indicating that ChpBK is less detrimental to the cells than MazF, although the induction of both ChpBK and MazF results in inhibition of colony formation on agar plates. In Vivo Cleavage of the mazG and era mRNAs by ChpBK—As ChpBK has a sequence very similar to that of MazF (Fig. 1A), we speculate that the observed inhibition of protein synthesis by ChpBK is due to its mRNA interferase function. To test this, the ChpBK-mediated cleavage of the era and mazG mRNAs was examined by primer extension experiments. For this purpose, E. coli BW25113 cells overproducing these mRNAs were used as described previously (6Zhang J. Zhang Y. Zhu L. Suzuki M. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20678-20684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The primer extension analyses of era (Fig. 3, A–E) and mazG mRNAs (Fig. 3, F–I) using different primers clearly demonstrate that distinct bands exhibiting the specific cleavage sites in each mRNA appeared at 5 min after ChpBK induction (Fig. 3, A–I, lane 2). In most cases, the band intensities further increased from 10 to 90 min after ChpBK induction (Fig. 3, B and D and F–I). Importantly, all these bands were very faint or hardly detected at 0 min (Fig. 3, A–I, lane 1). All cleavage sites (XACY) share an AC dinucleotide and the cleavage occurred before or after the A residue, indicating that similar to MazF, ChpBK cleaves mRNAs at specific sequences in vivo. Notably, the C residue was not found in X and Y positions in these cleavage sites. In Vitro Cleavage of the mazG and era mRNAs by ChpBK—To further prove that the in vivo cleavage of mazG and era mRNAs observed above was due to the mRNA interferase activity of ChpBK, the in vitro cleavage of these mRNAs was tested with purified ChpBK. To purify ChpBK, the purified ChpBI-ChpBK(His)6 complex was denatured using 6 m guanidine HCl. Denatured ChpBK was then retrapped on Ni-NTA resin, eluted, and refolded by stepwise dialysis described previously for MazF (Fig. 4A, lane 3) (16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Note that the ChpBI-ChpBK complex did not show any endoribonuclease activity (Fig. 4B, lane 2). On the other hand, purified ChpBK cleaved the 151-base mazG mRNA at the UAC sequence as shown by an arrowhead in lane 3, Fig. 4B. The in vitro activity of purified ChpBK on full-length mazG and era mRNAs was also analyzed by primer extension using the same primers used in the in vivo experiment. The primer used in Fig. 3, A and B, was identical to that used in Fig. 4, C and D; the primer used in Fig. 3D was identical to that used in Fig. 4E; the primer used in Fig. 3, in both F and G, was identical to that used in Fig. 4F; the primer used in Fig. 3, in both H and I, was identical to that used in Fig. 4G. The mazG and era mRNAs were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase in vitro as described previously (16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The in vitro cleavage sites were found to be identical to those cleaved in vivo (compare Fig. 3A with Fig. 4C, Fig. 3B with Fig. 4D, Fig. 3D with Fig. 4E, Fig. 3F with Fig. 4F, and Fig. 3H with Fig. 4G). These results demonstrate that ChpBK also cleaves mRNAs at the XACY sequences (X and Y are G, A, or U) in vitro as observed in our in vivo experiment. To further pinpoint the cleavage specificity of ChpBK, an U1A2C3A4 sequence in the mazG mRNA was mutated to all possible bases at each position. These mutated RNAs were tested for ChpBK cleavage (Fig. 5). Any base change of the AC sequence (A2 and C3 in Fig. 5, B and C, respectively) completely blocked the cleavage of the RNA by ChpBK. On the other hand, the U1 position may be any bases for ChpBK cleavage, although U or C is more preferred than A or G. Interestingly, these mutations cause the appearance of a new cleavage site (an ACA), which is located in the mazG mRNA upstream to the site that is cleaved in the wild type. This new cleavage is observed because primer extension goes beyond the mutated cleavage site as a result of less effective cleavage at this site. When A4 was mutated to a U residue, RNA cleavage was observed (Fig. 5D, lane 2). When A4 was mutated to a G residue, RNA cleavage occurred but at a significantly reduced level (Fig. 5D, lane 6). However, when A4 was mutated to a C residue, no cleavage was observed (Fig. 5D, lane 4). These results further support that ChpBK is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves mRNAs at the ACY sequences (Y is G, A, or U but not C). Cleavage of Short RNAs by ChpBK—To further characterize the ChpBK cleavage specificity and cleavage products, four 11-base synthetic RNA, RB-11-1, RB-11-2, RB-11-3, RB-11-4 shown in Fig. 6A, were used as substrates. These RNA substrates are identical except for 1 base in the underlined residues. They were labeled at the 5′-end and treated with purified ChpBK. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 6B, RB-11-1 was efficiently cleaved by ChpBK, while RB-11-2 and RB-11-4 were partially cleaved (50 and 20%, respectively). When UACA in RB-11-1 was changed to UAGA (RB-11-3), ChpBK was unable to cleave the substrate, indicating that the C residue is essential for ChpBK endoribonuclease activity, confirming the mutagenesis experiment shown in Fig. 5C. The cleavage products of RB-11-1 were further analyzed by a MALDI mass spectrometer to determine the precise cleavage reaction (Fig. 6C). The results clearly demonstrated that ChpBK cleaved the substrate at the 5′-end of the A residue in AC in RB-11-1, yielding a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate at the 3′-end of the 5′-end product (Fig. 6B, lane 2, at position a) and a 5′-OH group at the 5′-end of the 3′-end product in a manner identical to that demonstrated for MazF (23Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hara H. Kato I. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3143-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The cleavage product at position b was not detectable by MALDI mass spectrometry because of its low yield but probably resulted from the hydrolysis of product a. Comparison of Cleavage Specificities of ChpBK and MazF—To compare the enzymatic specificity of ChpBK with that of MazF, the in vivo primer extension experiment was carried out using the mazG mRNA. Both ChpBK and MazF were induced using the pBAD vector in BW 25113 cells harboring pIN-MazG. After the addition of arabinose (0.2%), cells were removed at time intervals shown in Fig. 7 for RNA extraction, and primer extension was carried out with the same primer used in Fig. 3, F and G. As seen in Fig. 7, the ChpBK cleavage specificity is distinctly different from that of MazF. The cleavage of mazG mRNA by ChpBK resulted in two bands at sites “a” and “2” (Fig. 7B), which correspond to the bands in Fig. 3, F and G, respectively. On the other hand, MazF did not cleave the mazG mRNA at the site “a” at all, while it cleaved the RNA at sites “1” and “2” (Fig. 7, A and C). These results indicate that both enzymes are able to cleave UA↓CA (site 2), while UA↓CG can be cleaved only by ChpBK but not by MazF. On the other hand, G↓ACA can be cleaved by MazF but not by ChpBK. When the nucleotide sequences of the mazG mRNA and era mRNA were examined within the regions covered by the primer extension experiments (Fig. 3), ACY sequences were not always cleaved (Table I). ACC sequences were not cleaved as predicted from the mutagenesis experiment (Fig. 5), and interestingly a number of supposedly cleavable ACY sequences such as ACU, ACA, and ACG were not cleaved, suggesting that even among cleavable ACY sequence in mRNAs, there are preferential cleavage sites as found with MazF (23Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hara H. Kato I. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3143-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The reason for this preferential cleavage is not known at present; however, the secondary structures and sequence contexts around the ACY sequences may influence RNA cleavage by ChpBK.Table ImRNA sequences around the ChpBK cleavage sites Open table in a new tab It is interesting to note that complete cleavage of the mazG mRNA by MazF was observed by 5 min after induction as judged from the density of the band of the full-length mRNA (Fig. 7A), while the cleavage by ChpBK was much slower and a substantial amount of the full-length mRNA was visible even 90 min after induction (Fig. 7B). This appears to be consistent with the fact that ChpBK only partially inhibited [35S]methionine incorporation even 60 min after its induction (Fig. 2C) in contrast to MazF, which almost completely inhibited [35S]methionine within 20 min after its induction (16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The reason for this weaker endoribonuclease activity of ChpBK compared with that of MazF is not clear at present. It is possible that ChpBK is intrinsically a less potent toxin than MazF. Interestingly, the pI value of ChpBK is 5.2 in contrast to basic pI values of MazF (8.3) and PemK (11.0); the basic pI may be more favorable for RNA cleavage enzymes. The weaker toxic effect of ChpBK may be at least partially attributed by its acidic pI and important for its physiology role in the cells as ChpBK may arrest the cell growth in a less damaging manner than MazF. Quantitative Enzyme Analysis of ChpBK—In our RNase analysis, the concentrations of RNA substrates are lower than the enzyme concentrations. This is because the RNA substrates are not readily accessible in a lager quantity. However, the cleavage reaction under the condition used is linear to the enzyme concentration (Fig. 8). In this experiment, we used two substrates, RB-11-1 and RB-11-2 (see Fig. 6A), which were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP at the 5′-end. The reaction products at 30 min were analyzed by 20% acrylamide sequence gel electrophoresis (Fig. 8A for RB-11-1 and Fig. 8B for RB-11-2). With use of 0.44 μg of ChpBK, about 90% of RB-11-1 was cleaved, while only about 20% of RB-11-2 was hydrolyzed (see Fig. 8, A and B, lane 4, and also Fig. 8C), indicating that there is a preferred base for ChpBK cleavage at the X base in the XACY cleavage site (U > G). This is consistent with the mutational analysis of the cleavage site shown in Fig. 5A. Fig. 9 shows time courses of the ChpBK cleavage reaction with use of RB-11-1 (Fig. 9A) and the 151-base mazG mRNA (Fig. 9B). Both substrates were cleaved linearly in a time-dependent manner, and the cleavage reaction with a longer RNA substrate is much faster (∼5-fold) than that with a shorter RNA substrate. Note that the 151-base mazG mRNA was separated into two bands (zero time in Fig. 9B), and only the lower band was completely digested into two products (84 and 67 bases). At present the nature of the upper band is unknown. As the refolding efficiency of ChpBK used in the present study is unknown, the reaction with both substrates might be faster than that in Fig. 9. Conclusion—In the present paper, we demonstrated that ChpBK, the toxin encoded by the chpBI-chpBK addiction module, is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease functioning as an mRNA interferase. ChpBK cleaves preferentially at the 5′ side or 3′-side of the A residue in ACY (Y is U, A, or G) sequences and generates a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate group at the 3′-end of the 5′-end product and a 5′-OH group at the 5′-end of the 3′-end product. This suggests that both ChpBK and MazF (16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) cleave single-strand RNAs in a manner similar to that of ribonuclease A. Our results also show that the RNA cleavage by ChpBK is independent of ribosomes, a characteristic distinctly different from RelE (10Pedersen K. Zavialov A.V. Pavlov M.Y. Elf J. Gerdes K. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2003; 112: 131-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), the toxin encoded by the relBE addiction module. RelE cannot cleave free RNAs but appears to be a ribosome-associated factor that stimulates mRNA cleavage at the ribosome A site with a high codon specificity (11Hayes C.S. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 903-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of the MazE-MazF complex has been determined, which consists of two MazF homodimers and one MazE homodimer (MazF2-MazE2-MazF2) (12Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of MazE has also been solved, and the mechanism of its interaction with the MazE-MazF promotor region has been proposed (13Lah J. Marianovsky I. Glaser G. Engelberg-Kulka H. Kinne J. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14101-14111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Loris R. Marianovsky I. Lah J. Laeremans T. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28252-28257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because of high sequence similarities between ChpBK and MazF (52%; in Fig. 1A) and between ChpBI and MazE (54%), ChpBK likely forms a complex with ChpBI in a manner similar to that of the MazE-MazF complex. Interestingly, the conserved loops between β strands S1 and S2 (termed the S1-S2 loops) in the MazE-bound MazF homodimer project into solvent and are mostly disordered (12Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), while in the Kid (PemK) homodimer the two corresponding loops are in a “closed” conformation (24Hargreaves D. Santos-Sierra S. Giraldo R. Sabariegos-Jareno R. de la Cueva-Mendez G. Boelens R. Diaz-Orejas R. Rafferty J.B. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1425-1433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The S1-S2 loops of the Kid (PemK) homodimer form a cavity-like structure covering a basic surface and a conserved hydrophobic pocket. The conserved hydrophobic pocket plays an essential role in the recognition of MazE in the MazE-MazF complex formation (12Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the highly negatively charged C-terminal extension of MazE may mimic single-stranded RNA substrates (16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). We also speculate that the S1-S2 loop in the MazF homodimer may play an essential role in the enzymatic specificity. Notably there are four amino acid residues in the 11-residue loop different between any two enzymes in Fig. 1A, which may be responsible for cleavage specificities. The present study reveals that E. coli contains at least two different mRNA interferases, MazF and ChpBK. Another toxin, YoeB, has also been reported from E. coli (1Christensen S.K. Maenhaut-Michel G. Mine N. Gottesman S. Gerdes K. Van Melderen L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1705-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). As judged by an in vivo experiment, YoeB may also function as an mRNA interferase. These toxins clearly function as inhibitors for cell growth. Recently, we proposed that MazF expression induces the quasi-dormant state in living cells, a previously unknown physiological state of bacteria, which may play an important role in bacterial survival under stress conditions in nature (19Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Further characterization of these toxins and their gene expression will provide clues to how to regulate cell growth of not only E. coli but also pathogenic bacteria.

Exposure of intact rat islets and INS-1 pancreatic β-cells to 11 mm glucose for minutes to hours results in an enhancement in the rate of insulin gene transcription assessed with a reporter linked to the insulin gene promoter. In contrast, chronic exposure of rat islets or β-cells to 11 mm glucose results in loss of the glucose responsiveness of the insulin gene promoter. By 48 h, glucose inhibits insulin gene promoter activity. Here we show that not only the acute effect of elevated glucose to stimulate the insulin gene promoter but also the chronic effect of elevated glucose to inhibit the insulin gene promoter depend on ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. In examining the underlying mechanism, we found that acute exposure to 11 mm glucose resulted in the binding of the transcription factors NFAT and Maf to the glucose-responsive A2C1 element of the insulin gene promoter. An NFAT and C/EBP-β complex was observed in cells chronically exposed to 11 mm glucose. Formation of NFAT-Maf and NFAT-C/EBP-β complexes was sensitive to inhibitors of ERK1/2 and calcineurin, consistent with our previous finding that activation of ERK1/2 by glucose required calcineurin activity and the well documented regulation of NFAT by calcineurin. These results indicate that the ERK1/2 pathway modulates partners of NFAT, which may either stimulate or repress insulin gene transcription during stimulatory and chronic exposure to elevated glucose.

Pancreatic β-cells of the islets of Langerhans produce and store insulin in response to physiological demand. Elevated glucose concentrations result in the activation of a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways that trigger β-cells to release insulin and coordinate an increase in the rate of insulin biosynthesis to replenish its supply (1Welsh M.

This is achieved not only by increased stability of prepro-insulin mRNA, increased translation of the mRNA, and processing of the protein product, but also by increased transcription of the insulin gene (3Leibiger B.

These include PDX-1 and a heterodimer containing an E2A gene product (E12, E47) and Beta2 (also known as NeuroD1), which bind to A and E boxes of the insulin promoter to provide a synergistic effect on insulin gene transcription. Negative regulators of insulin promoter activity have also been identified, including the CAAT enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBP-β), 1The abbreviations used are: C/EBP-β, CAAT enhancer-binding protein β; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: C/EBP-β, CAAT enhancer-binding protein β; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase.which is expressed in β-cells during prolonged exposure to high glucose concentrations (16Lu M.

Investig. 1998; 101: 2528-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The highly conserved A2-E1A1 region of the insulin promoter is most responsive to glucose and contains binding sites for each of these factors (18Odagiri H. Wang J. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1909-1915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interactions among factors binding to composite A2-E1 or E1A1 sites of the A2-E1A1 region are sufficient for a potent glucose response in human islets (18Odagiri H. Wang J. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1909-1915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The response is ablated when the E-box is not present; therefore, E47/Beta2 is critical for glucose-induced insulin gene transcription. Although it has been demonstrated that PDX-1 can bind to A1 and A3/4 sites of the insulin promoter, it is still unclear if there are conditions in which PDX-1 will bind to A2 (19Harrington R.H. Sharma A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 104-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The A2 site does overlap with binding sites of the RIPE3b region of the insulin promoter including an NFAT binding site (A2), a Maf binding site (C1), and an inverted CEB element, which is embedded within the A2C1 composite site (see Fig. 5B). Each of these factors has been shown to bind to these sites when β-cells are exposed to glucose. Synergistic effects of composite sites, compared with individual sites alone, on transcription implies the existence of interactions among factors that bind to the RIPE3b region and E47/Beta2 as well as between E47/Beta2 and PDX-1 to provide maximal glucose responsiveness to the insulin gene promoter (19Harrington R.H. Sharma A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 104-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Evidence for the latter has also been reported for E2A3/4 (14Ohneda K. Mirmira R.G. Wang J. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 20Qiu Y. Guo M. Huang S. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Glick E. Leshkowitz D. Walker M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2199-2204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The upstream signaling that regulates these factors begins with glucose metabolism in β-cells. Glucose is the central regulator of β-cell function and underlies effects elicited by circulating fuels and hormones to which β-cells respond. One rapid consequence of glucose metabolism in β-cells is cell depolarization and a subsequent rise in intracellular calcium (22German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 23Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Intracellular calcium metabolism is integrated into multiple signaling pathways that orchestrate insulin release and biosynthesis. One such pathway is the ERK1/2 cascade. We and others have previously demonstrated that ERK1/2 are activated in pancreatic β-cells by stimulatory concentrations of glucose, and determined that this activation is calcium dependent (24Frödin M. Sekine N. Roche E. Filloux C. Prentki M. Wollheim C.B. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7882-7889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 25Khoo S. Cobb M.H.

Diabetes. 2003; 52: 974-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of ERK1/2 by glucose is sensitive to inhibitors of calmodulin and the class 2B calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin (27Arnette D. Gibson T.B. Lawrence M.C. January B. Khoo S. McGlynn K. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32517-32525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Hence, calcineurin is an upstream regulator of the ERK1/2 pathway in pancreatic β-cells. Analysis of mRNA levels showed that blockade of ERK1/2 activity using kinase-defective ERK2 resulted in a substantial reduction in prepro-insulin mRNA content after 24 h, which along with insulin gene promoter reporter assays, suggested a role for ERK1/2 in insulin gene transcription (28Khoo S. Griffen S.C. Xia Y. Baer R. German M.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32969-32977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Possible actions of this signaling pathway on other key steps of the biosynthetic process have not yet been thoroughly explored. ERK1/2 can phosphorylate and modulate the activity of several factors that may regulate the A2-E1A1 region of the insulin promoter. Beta2 and E47 are phosphorylated by ERK1/2 to promote heterodimerization and binding to E-box sites (28Khoo S. Griffen S.C. Xia Y. Baer R. German M.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32969-32977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). ERK2 has also been reported to phosphorylate and activate the bZIP transcription factors MafA and C/EBP-β (29Benkhelifa S. Provot S. Nabais E. Eychene A. Calothy G. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4441-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Hanlon M. Sturgill T.W. Sealy L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 35668-35677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); however, evidence for physiological roles for ERK1/2 in regulating Maf in β-cells is lacking, and C/EBP-β has been shown to inhibit not activate insulin transcription. In addition to regulating ERK1/2 in response to glucose, calcineurin also activates NFAT to enhance insulin gene transcription (12Lawrence M.C. Bhatt H.S. Easom R.A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32Lawrence M.C. Bhatt H.S. Watterson J.M. Easom R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1758-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Here we report that NFAT and Maf both bind to the A2 and C1 elements within the insulin promoter in response to an acutely elevated glucose concentration in an ERK1/2-dependent manner. In β-cells chronically exposed to high glucose, C/EBP-β binds to NFAT on the promoter, but the NFAT-Maf complex is lost; this suggests that one action of C/EBP-β is to reduce the effect of NFAT on insulin gene transcription. We conclude that prolonged exposure of β-cells to glucose results in an ERK1/2-dependent change in factors associated with the insulin gene promoter. Materials—Early passages and subclones selected for increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of the rat pancreatic β-cell line INS-1 were kindly provided by Chris Newgard (Duke) (33Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). NFAT expression vectors were kindly provided by Chi-Wing Chow (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). Antibodies were as described or from the following sources: ERK1/2 (Y691 (34Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar)), phospho-ERK1/2 (Sigma), NFATc3 (Santa Cruz), c-Maf (Santa Cruz), and C/EBP-β (C19, Santa Cruz; Cell Signaling). Cell Culture and Isolation of Islets—INS-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 5.5 or 11 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10.2 mm l-glutamine, 50 mm sodium pyruvate, 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Pancreatic islets were isolated from Zucker nondiabetic and diabetic rats as described (32Lawrence M.C. Bhatt H.S. Watterson J.M. Easom R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1758-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Constructs—Vector constructs harboring the full-length 410-bp region (pSYNT) and the A2E1 region (pFOXCAT-4XA2E1) of the rat I insulin promoter and a plasmid encoding MafA were kindly provided by Michael German (University of California, San Francisco). The –410 rInsI and 4XA2E1 fragments were amplified by PCR with primers incorporating 5′-XhoI and 3′-HindIII restriction sites and directionally cloned into the pGL3-Basic luciferase promoter-reporter mammalian expression vector (Promega). The MafA coding sequence was subcloned into pCMV5. The plasmid MSV-C/EBP-β was obtained from Fred Robinson (University of California, San Diego). Transfections and Reporter Assays—INS-1 cells were grown in 6-well plates to 60–80% confluence in 5.5 mm glucose and co-transfected with either pGL3-rInsI or pGL3-A2E1 and pRL-SV40 using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Eighteen h after transfection, the cells were placed in fresh 5.5 mm glucose or stimulated with 11 mm glucose and harvested at the indicated times (2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h). For inhibitor studies, 25 μm U0126, 1 μm FK506 or FK520, 1 μm rapamycin, or 0.1% Me2SO control was added to the medium 30 min prior to cell stimulation. Cells were harvested with passive lysis buffer (Promega) that was supplemented with 100 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 100 mm NaF. The lysates were vortexed for 30 s and the supernatants were collected following centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The supernatants were stored at –80 °C. Samples were then assayed for promoter activity by the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega, WI) using a TD-20/20 bioluminometer (Turner Designs) or for ERK1/2 activation by immunoblotting. Immunoblotting—Extracts from INS-1 cells were prepared by boiling for 5 min in SDS electrophoresis sample buffer. Lysate proteins (30 μg) were resolved on polyacrylamide gels in SDS. The proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blotted with the indicated antibodies. Blocking was typically in 1× Tris-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% milk, and 0.1% polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20) and washes were in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was used as the method of detection by secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated onto 24-well dishes and exposed to glucose under conditions described above. Cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol, washed with 1 ml of PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5 ml in cold PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Prior to addition of antibodies, cells were incubated with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 4% bovine serum albumin overnight. Primary antibody (1:250) in the same solution was incubated with cells overnight. After washing, cells were incubated with secondary antibody (1:5000) in cold PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Complementary oligonucleotides containing wild type (A2C1) (WT) A2C1 (5′-GTGTTTGGAAATTACAGCTTCAGCCCCT) and mutated (m) NFATm (5′-GTGTTGTTCCATTACAGCTTCAGCCCCT), MAREm (5′-GTGTTTGGAAATTACAGCTGACTACCCT), NFATm/MAREm (5′-GTGTTGTTCCATTACAGCTGACTACCCT), C/EBP-βm (5′-GTGTTTGGAAATTAAAGCTTCAGCCCCT) NFATm/C/EBP-βm/MAREm (5′-GTGTTGTTCCATTAAAGCTGACTACCCT) consensus sites of the rat I insulin gene promoter were synthesized (IDT Integrated DNA Technologies). The oligonucleotides were hybridized, and end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. INS-1 cells were lysed in buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) supplemented with 0.6% Nonidet P-40. The pellets were washed with buffer A and collected by centrifugation for 2 min at 14,000 × g. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in buffer B (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 205 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) to harvest nuclear extracts. Equal amounts of nuclear extract proteins (20 μg) were incubated for 30 min with double-stranded 32P-labeled A2C1 probe (20,000 cpm) in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6% glycerol). Where indicated, antibodies were added 15 min after the labeled probe. The reactions were subjected to electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels and bands were detected on film by autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitation—INS-1 lysate proteins (300 μg) were incubated with indicated antibodies (1:100 dilution) and 50 μl of 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were centrifuged and washed in buffer A and resuspended in 50 μl of 1× SDS electrophoresis sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting as described. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—The standard conditions for treatment of INS-1 cells were exposure to 5.5 mm glucose for 30 min (basal), exposure to 11 mm glucose for 30 min (stimulated), or exposure to 11 mm glucose for at least 48 h (chronic). INS-1 cells were then exposed to 1% formaldehyde and rocked for 8 min for protein-chromatin cross-linking. Glycine (final concentration, 125 mm) was added, and the plates were rocked for an additional 2 min. The medium was removed and the cells were washed 2 times with ice-cold PBS and harvested in passive lysis buffer. Chromatin was sheared by ultrasonication using a microtip probe (Sonics and Materials, Inc.) with an amplitude setting of 30 for 10 1.5-s pulses. The cross-linked lysates were cleared by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C. Samples (300 μg of protein) were adjusted to a volume of 0.3 ml with lysis buffer. The input control contained 50 μg of protein adjusted to 0.3 ml with lysis buffer. The samples were precleared with 20 ml of protein A-Sepharose beads and immunoprecipitations used 1 μl of the indicated antibodies, 1 μl of purified IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) corresponding to host animal antibodies, or no antibody. The reactions were incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose beads that had been preincubated with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The protein A-Sepharose beads were sedimented and washed with: 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, for 5 min; again with the same buffer only containing 0.5 m NaCl for 5 min; 250 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, for 5 min; 1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, for 5 min; and finally with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA twice for 5 min each. The immunoprecipitates were eluted from the beads with 0.5 ml of 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. To reverse cross-linking, samples were adjusted to 0.2 m NaCl and incubated at 65 °C for 5 h. Chromatin was extracted with phenol/CHCl3 and precipitated with NaOAc/EtOH. DNA precipitates were used as templates for detecting the presence of a rInsI promoter segment (–329 to –90) by PCR using primers 5′-CTGGGAAATGAGGTGGAAAA and 5′-AGGAGGGGTAGGTAGGCAGA. Statistical Analyses—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. determined from at least three independent experiments, unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance was calculated by one-tailed unpaired Student's t test. ERK1/2 Stimulate and Repress the Activity of the Insulin Gene Promoter—We compared the ability of different concentrations of glucose to stimulate insulin transcription and found that there was little stimulation of transcription of a reporter linked to the rat I insulin gene promoter observed from 3.8 to 5.5 mm glucose. As the glucose concentration was increased to 11 mm glucose, increased activity of the reporter was observed; no further increase was noted at 16 mm glucose (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Thus, for these experiments we cultured INS-1 cells at 5.5 mm glucose and used this as the control or basal condition. As reported in the literature (17Seufert J. Weir G.C. Habener J.F. J. Clin.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), chronic exposure (24 h or longer) to a high glucose concentration inhibits insulin gene transcription. Because ERK1/2 are required for stimulation of insulin gene transcription by glucose, we examined the potential functions of ERK1/2 in this inhibitory process. To examine effects on insulin gene transcription, cells were exposed to 11 mm glucose for 2–48 h and the activity of the reporter was measured (Fig. 2, A–D). Glucose-enhanced insulin gene promoter activity was observed for up to 6 h of exposure to 11 mm glucose; as expected, this stimulation was blocked by inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway with U0126. These results are in agreement with our earlier work showing that K52R ERK2 (a dead mutant that blocks activation of endogenous ERK1/2) and another pharmacological inhibitor with similar specificity decreases prepro-insulin mRNA content and inhibits the insulin gene promoter (28Khoo S. Griffen S.C. Xia Y. Baer R. German M.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32969-32977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). U0126 inhibits the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases MEK1/2, the two enzymes that activate ERK1/2, and at higher concentrations also MEK5, the enzyme that activates ERK5 (40Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2747) Google Scholar). It is one of the most selective protein kinase inhibitors because, unlike the majority of such drugs, U0126 is not an ATP competitor (41Duncia J.V. Santella J.B. Higley C.A. Pitts W.J. Wityak J. Frietze W.E. Rankin F.W. Sun J.H. Earl R.A. Tabaka A.C. Teleha C.A. Blom K.F. Favata M.F. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Horiuchi K. Copeland R.A. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. Magolda R.L. Trainor G.L. Wexler R.R. Hobbs F.W. Olson R.E. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 2839-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). We have found no effect of glucose on the activity of ERK5 in INS-1 cells (data not shown); thus the events inhibited by U0126 are not because of preventing activation of ERK5. Within 12 h, the effect of glucose on the insulin gene promoter-reporter was reduced to near basal levels, by 24 h glucose inhibited insulin gene promoter activity, and at 48 h, glucose repressed insulin gene transcription to approximately half that of transcription at the control glucose concentration of 5.5 mm at the same time (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, the repression of transcription below basal activity by chronic exposure to 11 mm glucose was also reversed by U0126; activity in the presence of the inhibitor was consistently close to that observed at 5.5 mm glucose. These findings suggest that ERK1/2 are required not only for the stimulatory but also for the inhibitory effect of glucose on insulin gene transcription. As we showed previously, activation of ERK1/2 by glucose is dependent upon calcineurin (27Arnette D. Gibson T.B. Lawrence M.C. January B. Khoo S. McGlynn K. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32517-32525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of the calcineurin inhibitors FK506 and FK520, as well as rapamycin, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR, on glucose-regulated insulin promoter activity. All three agents inhibited the acute increase in insulin gene reporter activity induced by glucose (Fig. 2, B–D). Rapamycin does not inhibit ERK1/2 activation; thus, rapamycin controls events required for promoter activity that are independent of ERK1/2-regulated signal transduction pathways. Both the MEK inhibitor and the calcineurin inhibitors (FK506 and FK520, Fig. 2B) also reversed glucose-induced repression of basal insulin promoter activity at 48 h, indicating that inhibition by glucose requires ERK1/2. In contrast, rapamycin, which does not block ERK1/2 activation, had no effect on the repressed transcription (see model of Fig. 5A). Lysates from each sample of transfected cells were immunoblotted to examine the activation state of ERK1/2 using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies (Fig. 2E). ERK1/2 was phosphorylated and activated in cells treated with both 5.5 and 11 mm glucose; in both cases activation was blocked by the addition of either U0126 or FK520. Consistent with our earlier findings, rapamycin had no effect on ERK1/2 activation by glucose (27Arnette D. Gibson T.B. Lawrence M.C. January B. Khoo S. McGlynn K. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32517-32525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine whether these findings using β-cell lines are representative of the behavior of β-cells in intact islets, we examined pancreatic islets isolated from wild type and Zucker fatty diabetic rats. After isolation, islets were transfected with the rat insulin promoter construct and then incubated in medium containing either 5.5 or 11 mm glucose for 6 or 48 h (Fig. 3). The stimulatory effect of glucose observed in islets from normal animals exposed to 11 mm glucose for 6 h was lost after 48 h of incubation in 11 mm glucose. The stimulatory effect observed at 6 h was blocked by U0126 and FK520. The inhibitory effect of 48 h of incubation in 11 mm glucose was alleviated with the MEK and calcineurin inhibitors, supporting the findings in β-cell lines. Promoter activity was substantially lower in islets from Zucker diabetic rats, which also displayed no glucose-stimulated activity (Fig. 3, right). Howeve"

We have designed a targeted library of compounds from which we identified a novel molecule, GFB-204, that binds PDGF and VEGF, blocks binding of PDGF and VEGF to their receptors (200–500 nM) and subsequently inhibits PDGFR and Flk-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and stimulation of the protein kinases Erk1, Erk2 and Akt and the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT3. GFB-204 is selective for PDGF and VEGF and does not inhibit EGF, IGF-1 and FGF stimulation of Erk1/2, Akt and STAT3. GFB-204 inhibits endothelial cell migration and capillary network formation in vitro. Finally, treatment of mice with GFB-204 suppresses human tumor growth and angiogenesis. Thus, inhibition of VEGF and PDGF receptor binding with a synthetic molecule results in potent inhibition of angiogenesis and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1997865085,"P2X receptors are ATP-gated ion channels made up of three similar or identical subunits. It is unknown whether ligand binding is intersubunit or intrasubunit, either for agonists or for allosteric modulators. Zinc binds to rat P2X2 receptors and acts as an allosteric modulator, potentiating channel opening. To probe the location of this zinc binding site, P2X2 receptors bearing mutations of the histidines at positions 120 and 213 were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Studies of H120C and H213C mutants produced five lines of evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the residues in these positions bind zinc. Mixing of subunits containing the H120A or H213A mutation generated receptors that showed zinc potentiation, even though neither of these mutant receptors showed zinc potentiation on its own. Furthermore, expression of trimeric concatamers with His → Ala mutations at some but not all six positions showed that zinc potentiation correlated with the number of intersubunit histidine pairs. These results indicate that zinc potentiation requires an interaction across a subunit interface. Expression of the H120C/H213C double mutant resulted in the formation of ectopic disulfide bonds that could be detected by changes in the physiological properties of the receptors after treatment with reducing and oxidizing agents. Immunoblot analysis of H120C/H213C protein separated under nonreducing conditions demonstrated that the ectopic bonds were between adjacent subunits. Taken together, these data indicate that His120 and His213 sit close to each other across the interface between subunits and are likely to be key components of the zinc binding site in P2X2 receptors.

Taken together, these data indicate that His120 and His213 sit close to each other across the interface between subunits and are likely to be key components of the zinc binding site in P2X2 receptors. P2X receptors are oligomeric, ATP-gated cation channels that are distributed widely throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems of mammals and are known to be involved in fast excitatory synaptic transmission (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). P2X receptors are structurally distinct from the nicotinic receptor and ionotropic glutamate receptor channel superfamilies. In mammals, the P2X family has seven members encoded by different genes (P2X1–7) that can associate as homo- and heteromeric channel assemblies (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). P2X receptors are thought to be trimers (2Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) with subunits that have intracellular N and C termini, two transmembrane domains, and a large extracellular loop (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). Colocalization of zinc with P2X2 receptors in the nervous system suggests a physiological role for this divalent cation in modulating ATP-evoked currents (3Kanjhan R. Housley G.D. Burton L.D.

Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). The potentiating effect of zinc on P2X2 receptors results from a decrease in the EC50 for ATP without a concomitant change in the maximum response to ATP (5Wildman S.S. King B.F. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 1214-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Clyne J.D. LaPointe L.D. Hume R.I. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have previously identified two molecular determinants of zinc potentiation for the rat P2X2 subunit (6Clyne J.D. LaPointe L.D. Hume R.I. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); mutation of either His120 or His213 to alanine eliminated potentiation by zinc. Direct participation of these residues in zinc binding is consistent with the established role of histidines in structurally defined zinc binding sites of proteins (7Auld D.S. Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). However, a role for these residues in binding zinc has been called into question by a report that a treatment expected to modify histidines did not alter zinc potentiation (5Wildman S.S. King B.F. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 1214-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the first part of this paper we demonstrate that His120 and His213 are exposed on the extracellular surface and have a number of characteristics expected of residues directly involved in zinc binding. We then present experiments that used mixtures of subunits, each bearing one mutation, to demonstrate that zinc potentiation requires an interaction at the interface between adjacent subunits and that these two histidines are indeed at the subunit interface. Taken together, these data implicate His120 and His213 as participants in an intersubunit binding site for zinc. Mutagenesis and Concatamer Construction—Rat P2X2 cDNA (encoding a 472-amino acid protein) in pcDNA1 was obtained from Dr. D. Julius, University of California, San Francisco. Mutations were generated using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Concatamers were made using methods similar to those described previously (8Stoop R. Thomas S. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In brief, to allow linkage of multiple subunits, the N-terminal sequence was modified from MVRRLAR to MVRSIAR to add an MfeI site, and the C-terminal sequence was modified from DPKGLAQL to DPKGILAQL to add an EcoRI site. The H120A, H213A, or the H120A/H213A double mutation was then introduced into these modified monomers. The first subunit of each concatamer was prepared by digestion with EcoRI and ligated to the MfeI-EcoRI digest product of the plasmid encoding the desired second subunit. The resulting dimer was then digested with EcoRI and ligated to the MfeI-EcoRI digest product of the plasmid encoding the desired third subunit. All concatamers thus have splice junctions consisting of DPKGIAR. The sequences of mutant monomers and splice junctions of the concatamers were confirmed by a combination of restriction analysis and DNA sequencing (University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core). Each concatamer also had a T336C mutation in the third subunit. For all four concatamers studied, we verified that 1 mm MTSET 1The abbreviations used are: MTSET, (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl) methanethiosulfonate bromide; DEPC, diethylpyrocarbonate; DTT, dithiothreitol. (Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, ON, Canada) inhibited the current to an extent similar to that demonstrated previously for other trimeric concatamers (8Stoop R. Thomas S. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Expression of P2X2 Receptors—P2X2 receptors were expressed in defolliculated stage V-VI Xenopus laevis oocytes. Oocytes were harvested using procedures approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Vertebrate Animals and have been described in detail previously (9Zhou Z. Hume R.I. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). RNAs encoding wild type and mutant P2X2 receptor monomers and concatamers were synthesized using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Each oocyte was injected with 50 nl of RNA (5–10 ng/μl for monomers, 30 ng/μl for concatamers). Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed 2–5 days after RNA injection. All recordings were made at a holding potential of –50 mV. Recording electrodes were pulled from thin walled borosilicate glass and had resistances of 0.5–1 megohms. Currents were recorded with a Turbo TEC-03 voltage clamp amplifier (npi electronic GmBH, Tamm, Germany). Data acquisition was performed using a Digidata 1322A interface controlled by pCLAMP 8 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Subsequent data analysis was done using Clampfit and Excel. The significance of differences between groups was tested using the two-tailed, unpaired t test function of Excel, with significance taken to be p < 0.01. Solutions—The external recording solution contained (in mm): 90 NaCl, 1 KCl, 1.3 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.5. Electrodes were filled with an internal solution of 3 m KCl and 400 mm EGTA, pH 7.5. Disodium ATP (Sigma) was prepared as a 100 mm stock in double-distilled H2O and stored at –20 °C. For recording, ATP solutions were made by diluting the stock in external recording solution. The ATP concentrations of all recording solutions were verified by spectroscopic measurement at 260 nm (BioPhotometer, Brinkmann, New York). Zinc chloride was prepared as a 100 mm stock in double-distilled H2O that was acidified with 0.01 m HCl to prevent precipitation. The pH of ATP solutions with and without zinc was adjusted to 7.5 prior to recording. All ATP recording solutions were used within 48 h. The histidine-modifying agent diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) was diluted to a final concentration of 4 or 7 mm in a phosphate-buffered incubation solution. The 7 mm solution contained (in mm) 94 NaCl, 1.5 NaH2PO4, 6.7 Na2HPO4, 1.0 KCl, 1.7 MgCl2 and was set to pH 7.5. The 4 mm solution contained (in mm) 85 NaCl, 8.75 NaH2PO4, 1.25 Na2HPO4, 2.7 KCl, 1.3 MgCl2 and was set to pH 6.0. Because DEPC degrades rapidly when exposed to air and in physiological salt solutions, we used an experimental protocol that minimized the time between when the solutions were prepared and the oocytes were exposed. A series of oocytes were first characterized for their base-line response to ATP, and each was then placed in a separate well of a 48-well plate. DEPC prepared from a freshly opened bottle was then added rapidly to each well. The time from opening the bottle to exposing the oocytes was typically less than 2 min. After a 10-min incubation in DEPC, the oocytes were washed with incubation solution, returned to the standard HEPES-buffered recording solution, and then retested for their response to ATP. The sulfhydryl-reactive reagent MTSET was prepared as a 1 m stock in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored in 10-μl aliquots at –20 °C. For continuous recording, MTSET in external recording solution was added to the recording chamber for a 5-min incubation period to produce a final concentration of ∼1mm. However, we more commonly incubated cells in batches, as was done for the DEPC experiments. MTSET was added in the standard HEPES-buffered recording solution. For each construct, pilot experiments were carried out to find the combination of concentration and exposure time which produced a maximal response, and this duration of exposure was used in subsequent experiments. For the cysteine-substituted residues we tested, it required no more than 1 min of exposure to 100 μm MTSET to produce a maximal effect. The reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) was prepared as a 100 mm stock in external solution. DTT was added to the recording chamber for 5–10 min to produce a final concentration of 10 mm. DTT was washed out of the chamber for at least 5 min before recording. The oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was applied at 0.1% in external solution for 5 min and was washed out of the chamber for at least 5 min before recording. In the zinc protection experiments shown in Fig. 5, oocytes were either treated with a submaximal level of MTSET or preexposed to 100 μm zinc for 1 min and then incubated in 100 μm zinc plus MTSET. Selection of ATP Concentration and Data Analysis—To compare the magnitude of zinc potentiation between groups of cells, it is essential that all cells be studied at similar points on the ATP concentration-response relation because as the concentration of ATP increases, potentiation decreases so that there is no zinc potentiation when a saturating concentration of ATP is present (5Wildman S.S. King B.F. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 1214-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Clyne J.D. LaPointe L.D. Hume R.I. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the EC50 for ATP of different oocytes expressing the same construct can vary significantly (10Clyne J.D. Brown T.C. Hume R.I. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 44: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the experiments shown in Figs. 6 and 8, we dealt with these complications by testing each oocyte first with a low concentration of ATP, which we expected would be close to the EC10 based on the average concentration-response relation for each construct, and then with 200 μm ATP, which was a maximal concentration for all constructs used in this study. Only oocytes for which it was verified that the low ATP concentration used was between the EC5 and the EC20 (so that at least a 5-fold increase in current was possible) were included in the data presented in these figures.Fig. 8Concatameric constructs suggest an intersubunit zinc binding site. A, predicted number of intrasubunit and intersubunit binding sites in four different concatameric receptor constructs. The format of this figure is similar to Fig. 6A, except that the concatameric constructs have only one N terminus and one C terminus. B, responses of Xenopus oocytes expressing the indicated subunits to a low concentration of ATP, the same low concentration of ATP plus 20 μm zinc, and then a high concentration of ATP that produced a maximal response in all of these constructs (200 μm). The concentration of ATP was selected to produce a response to ATP in the absence of zinc which was ∼10% of the maximal response in the same cell (see C). The low ATP concentration was 7.5 μm for trimer HH-HH-HH, 5 μm for HA-AH-HH, 10 μm for P2X2, and 12.5 μm for AA-AA-HH and HA-AA-AH. C, potentiation to high ATP was calculated as in Fig. 6. These data are taken from the same oocytes used to test zinc potentiation in D. Each bar is the mean ± S.E. for 7–10 oocytes. There was no significant difference among the five constructs tested. D, zinc potentiation was calculated as in Fig. 6. A single asterisk indicates that the mean was significantly different from oocytes expressing P2X2 and from oocytes expressing trimers HH-HH-HH, HA-AH-HH and HA-AA-AH. A double asterisk indicates that the mean was significantly different from oocytes expressing P2X2 and from oocytes expressing trimers HH-HH-HH, HA-AH-HH, and AA-AA-HH. A triple asterisk indicates that the mean was significantly different from oocytes expressing P2X2 and from oocytes expressing trimers HH-HH-HH, HA-AA-AH, and AA-AA-HH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We defined potentiation to high ATP as (current in high ATP/current in low ATP) – 1 and potentiation to zinc as ((current in low ATP + 20 μm zinc)/current in low ATP) –1. Thus, a cell that showed no increase in current in response to zinc had zinc potentiation equal to 0, and a cell studied at its EC10 had potentiation to high ATP of 9. Concentration-response relations for ATP were fit to the three-parameter Hill equation using the nonlinear curve fitting program of Sigmaplot 8.0. For displaying average data, the points from each cell were normalized to between 0 and 100% based on the maximum value of the fitted curve. The scaled data were then averaged and plotted with error bars indicating the S.E. The lines fit to the data indicate the average parameters of the individual fits. To estimate the concentration-response relation for zinc, it was necessary to correct the data for the inhibition of current by zinc which occurs at high zinc concentrations. This was done using the same methods as in Clyne et al. (6Clyne J.D. LaPointe L.D. Hume R.I. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In brief, the currents in the presence of ATP but no zinc were subtracted from the currents in the presence of ATP plus zinc. These offset data were then scaled up based on the inhibitory zinc concentration-response relation determined from the H120A and H213A mutations. The offset and scaled data were then fit by the same approach as was used to fit ATP concentration-response relations. Western Blot Analysis—Xenopus oocytes were injected with 50 nl of RNA (10–100 ng/μl). After 1–5 days, oocytes were homogenized in buffer H (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with the Complete Mini protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Homogenates were agitated for 15 min at 4 °C and then spun for 10 min (20,000 × g) at 4 °C. Laemmli sample buffer (6×) was added at a 1:5 ratio to each sample. Reducing samples contained 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and nonreducing samples contained 16 mm iodoacetamide. Prior to loading on precast Tris-glycine gradient gels (Cambrex, Rockland, ME), protein samples were boiled for 5 min. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose. Blots were then probed with either a goat polyclonal antibody directed against an extracellular epitope of the human P2X2 receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against residues 460–472 of the rat P2X2 receptor (Neuromics, Bloomington, MN) and visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Evidence that His120 and His213 Are in the Zinc Binding Site of P2X2 Receptors—In zinc-binding proteins with structures that have been solved using x-ray crystallography, histidines are among the most common residues that participate in zinc binding (7Auld D.S. Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Because the H120A and H213A mutations completely eliminate zinc potentiation of P2X2 receptors (6Clyne J.D. LaPointe L.D. Hume R.I. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), an appealing hypothesis is that these two residues are directly involved in zinc binding. However, a study that used DEPC, a compound that would be expected to modify accessible histidines covalently in a way that would make them unable to bind to zinc, reported that DEPC treatment did not attenuate zinc potentiation in wild type P2X2 receptors (5Wildman S.S. King B.F. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 1214-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because DEPC is reported to have a very short half-life once exposed to air or saline solutions and to react more selectively with histidines at acidic pH (11Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), we reexamined the effect of DEPC on P2X2 receptors. The significant differences of these new experiments from previous experiments are 2-fold. First, we began the exposure to DEPC within 2 min of opening a fresh bottle. Second, all solutions used to treat oocytes with DEPC had a phosphate buffer to control pH because the 10 mm HEPES used previously as a pH buffer might have been able to bind to the DEPC and make it unable to interact with cellular proteins. After DEPC exposure for 10 min, the oocytes were returned to our standard HEPES-buffered external solution for recording because zinc precipitated in phosphate-buffered solutions. We found that when 7 mm DEPC was applied to oocytes expressing wild type P2X2 at pH 7.5, there were dramatic decreases in the responses to ATP. On average the currents were less than 5% of control, and many cells that gave large responses prior to DEPC treatment did not respond at all, whether the ATP was applied alone or in the presence of zinc (Fig. 1, A and B). In retrospect, this dramatic effect of DEPC should not have been a surprise, because at pH 7.5 DEPC is known to react with lysine, arginine, cysteine, and tyrosine residues as well as histidines (11Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), and several lysines and an arginine are believed to be essential elements of the ATP binding site of P2X receptors (12Jiang L.H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 13Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1078-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). At more acidic pH levels, the action of DEPC is expected to be somewhat more selective for histidines (11Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), so we carried out similar experiments on oocytes exposed to 4 mm DEPC at pH 6.0. For oocytes exposed to DEPC at this pH, the maximal ATP-activated currents (elicited by 200 μm ATP) were significantly attenuated in both wild type and the H120A/H213A double mutant (to 33 ± 9% and 45 ± 23% of pretreatment levels, respectively; n = 5 for wild type and 6 for mutant), confirming that much of the inhibitory effect of DEPC was caused by its actions on residues other than His120 and His213 (Fig. 1, C and D). However, there were sufficient ATP-activated currents remaining to test for zinc potentiation after DEPC treatment at pH 6.0. To maximize the ability to detect zinc potentiation, we used 5 μm ATP in these experiments, which was at approximately the EC5 for the wild type both before and after DEPC treatment (the percent of maximal response before was 4% ± 1% and after was 4% ± 2%). Zinc potentiation (as defined under “Experimental Procedures”) of wild type P2X2 was greatly attenuated after DEPC treatment under these conditions (pre-DEPC potentiation was 16.3 ± 3.1, post-DEPC potentiation was 3.2 ± 1.0, n = 4). In summary, our results demonstrate that under suitable conditions, DEPC attenuates zinc potentiation of P2X2 and are therefore consistent with the possibility that His120 and His213 are part of the zinc binding site. However, these experiments do not demonstrate that the inhibitory effect we observed required DEPC binding to these particular histidines. His120 and His213 Are Accessible on the Cell Surface—For His120 and His213 to be candidates for participating in zinc binding, they must be accessible on the extracellular surface. As a test of surface accessibility of positions 120 and 213, we made cysteine mutants at each position because cysteines are also competent to coordinate zinc (7Auld D.S. Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) and because many cysteine-reactive reagents are available. We then tested for the ability of the sulfhydryl-reactive reagent MTSET to modify the ATP-activated currents. These two mutants had ATP concentration-response relations relatively similar to wild type (EC50 values in μm were 19.6 ± 1.1 for wild type, 24.9 ± 1.9 for H120C, and 32.8 ± 1.6 for H213C; n = 5, 13, and 16, respectively), and wild type and both mutants had peak currents to saturating ATP of ∼10 μA. When the concentration of ATP was selected so that the response to ATP alone was just detectable (2 μm for wild type and H120C and 5 μm for H213C), the maximal potentiation that could be obtained with 20 μm zinc was significantly larger in oocytes expressing wild type P2X2 than in oocytes expressing the mutants (Fig. 2). After oocytes were incubated with 5 mm MTSET for 1 min (which was more than 50 times the exposure required to produce maximal modification), there was a dramatic decrease in the zinc potentiation of the responses of H120C- and H213C-expressing oocytes but no change in zinc potentiation in the oocytes expressing wild type P2X2 (Fig. 2, A and B). For H120C-expressing oocytes, the responses to low ATP alone were also decreased significantly after MTSET treatment, whereas for H213C-expressing oocytes only the responses in ATP plus zinc were attenuated (Fig. 2B). The effect of MTSET on zinc potentiation of these mutants was quite specific because the EC50 for ATP after MTSET treatment was not changed for the wild type or either mutant (p > 0.1, Fig. 3), and there was little change in the peak response to a saturating concentration (500 μm) of ATP (as a percentage of the peak response prior to MTSET, the responses after MTSET were 90.6 ± 9.6, 95.9 ± 4.6, and 91.1 ± 2.4, respectively, for wild type, H120C-, and H213C-expressing oocytes).Fig. 3ATP concentration-response relations for wild type, H120C-, and H213C-expressing oocytes in the presence and absence of 20 μm zinc. For each condition, the average of normalized data from at least five oocytes are shown. The error bars are the S.E. The smooth curves are drawn based on the average of the EC50 and Hill coefficients to the individual fits. In these experiments the MTSET treatment was at least 10 times higher than the amount sufficient to produce a maximal change in the response. For all three constructs, the average EC50 was significantly left shifted by 20 μm zinc, both before and after MTSET treatment, but for H120C and H213C the left shift was significantly smaller after MTSET treatment. The average EC50 in the absence of zinc was not shifted significantly by MTSET for any of the three constructs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In wild type P2X2 receptors, zinc potentiation is an allosteric process that shifts the concentration-response relation for ATP to the left with little if any change in the Hill coefficient or maximum response. The magnitude of the zinc potentiation observed therefore varies greatly depending on the concentration of ATP used, with the largest potentiation obtained at 2 μm, a concentration that produces about 1% of the maximal current in the absence of zinc. When the amount of potentiation to 20 μm zinc was plotted as a function of ATP concentration, there was no effect of MTSET on oocytes expressing wild type P2X2 at any concentration of ATP, but both H120C- and H213C-expressing oocytes showed less zinc potentiation after MTSET treatment at all concentrations of ATP that gave zinc potentiation prior to application of MTSET. The effect of MTSET was particularly apparent when these data were plotted on log-log coordinates (Fig. 2C). A second way to quantify the ATP dependence of zinc potentiation was to measure the change in the EC50 to ATP when zinc was present (Fig. 3). The extent of the shift in the EC50 was calculated as (EC50 without zinc/EC50 with zinc). The oocytes expressing wild type receptors showed a substantial left shift to 20 μm zinc, and there was no change in the magnitude of left shift after MTSET treatment (before, 5.6 ± 0.8-fold; after, 5.5 ± 0.3-fold). The two mutants were less sensitive to 20 μm zinc than the wild type receptors, and both were even less sensitive after MTSET treatment. The left shift in the EC50 for H120C was 2.4 ± 0.1-fold before MTSET and 1.2 ± 0.1-fold after, whereas for H213C the left shift was 1.8 ± 0.1-fold before MTSET and 1.3 ± 0.1-fold after. However, there was a small residual potentiation to 20 μm zinc after maximal MTSET treatment in both mutants. In summary, the residues at both positions 120 and 213 are accessible to MTSET, and MTSET modification of cysteines substituted at these positions attenuates zinc potentiation, as would be expected if the native histidines at these positions participate in binding zinc. H120C and H213C Changed Receptor Properties in Ways Expected for Zinc Binding Site Mutants—If the residues at positions 120 and 213 are in the zinc binding site, it is unlikely that substituting a cysteine for one of the native histidines would produce a site of identical zinc affinity. We therefore determined the zinc concentra"

The N-glycan profile of each developmental stage (Larva 1, Larva 2, Larva 3, Larva 4, and Dauer and adult) appears to be unique. The pattern of complex N-glycans was stage-specific with the general trend of number and abundance of glycans being Dauer ≈ L1 > adult ≈ L4 > L3 ≈ L2. Dauer larvae contained complex N-glycans with higher molecular masses than those seen in other stages. MALDI-QoTOF MS/MS of Hex4HexNAc4 showed an N-acetyllac-tosamine substitution not previously observed in C. elegans. Phosphorylcholine (Pc)-substituted glycans were also found to be stage-specific.

C. elegans-specific fucosyl and native methylated glycans were found in all developmental stages. Taken together, the above results demonstrate that in-depth investigation of the role of the above N-glycans during C. elegans development should lead to a better understanding of their significance and the ways that they may govern interactions, both within the organism during development and between the mobile nematode and its pathogens.

Carbohydrate-mediated interactions between cells and their environment are important in differentiation, embryonic development (1Haltiwanger R.S. Lowe J.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 491-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), inflammation and immunity (2Lowe J.B. Curr. Opin. Cell.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2001; 20: 245-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Errors of glycosylation manifest themselves throughout cell lineages, resultant tissue formation, and cell-interactive processes such as those enumerated above. In humans and mice, mutations that prevent proper formation of N-glycans result in multisystem defects that can be traced to developmental processes and, thus, demonstrate that appropriate glycosylation is essential for development. Caenorhabditis elegans is a genetically and developmentally well characterized multicellular eukaryote with a short life cycle, invariant cell lineage, and distinct stages of development in which growth, reorganization, and switching between vegetative and developmentally arrested states occur.

N-Glycans released from glycoproteins from mixed stages will naturally be enriched in glycans from the largest and most represented developmental stages, and will, thus, likely contain little glycan originating from stages that are less represented. The most abundant oligosaccharides observed are high mannose type (Man3–9GlcNAc2) with minor amounts of C. elegans fucosyl-type (Me0–3Fuc1–4-Hex0–2Man3GlcNAc2, where Hex = Gal or Man), mammalian-type hybrid and complex (Fuc1Man3–5GlcNAc3–8), and phosphorylcholine-substituted glycans (Pc1–5Man3GlcNAc3–7). The higher order Pc and complex-type oligosaccharides have very low abundance and have only been observed by two groups (6Cipollo J.F. Costello C.E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49143-49157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 9Haslam S.M. Gems D. Morris H.R. Dell A. Biochem. Soc.

Genetic and biochemical evidence exists to suggest that complex oligosaccharides other than those detected thus far exist in this metazoan. For example, the in vitro characterization of C. elegans glycosyltransferases Ceβ4GalNAcT and Ceα3FucT suggests that LacdiNAc (14Kawar Z.S. Van Die I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34924-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), fucosylated LacNAc, and possibly Lewis X-containing oligosaccharides may exist in this organism (15DeBose-Boyd R.A. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In genetic terms, C. elegans has retained the biosynthetic components required for the formation of high mannose and the abbreviated mammalian-type complex glycans.

A homologue of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II also appears to exist (17Chen S. Tan J. Reinhold V.N. Spence A.M. Schachter H. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, no strong homologies to N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases III, IV, or VI have been identified, although some structural studies suggest that GlcNAc is present in linkages identical to those catalyzed by these enzymes (6Cipollo J.F. Costello C.E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49143-49157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 7Cipollo J.F. Awad A. Costello C.E. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B.

Symp. 2002; 69: 117-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). C. elegans also possesses insect-like pathways to process glycans (20Zhang W. Cao P. Chen S. Spence A.M. Zhu S. Staudacher E. Schachter H. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insect cell lines have a Golgi N-acetylglucosaminidase, which has been shown to remove N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-added GlcNAc, thus preventing formation of complex glycan, and this activity appears to be developmentally related (21Tomiya N. Narang S. Lee Y.C. Betenbaugh M.J. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 343-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The presence of insect-like pathways suggests that the low abundance of complex glycans seen in C. elegans N-glycans may be related to the activity of this enzyme. Therefore, it is possible that, during some stages of glycoconjugate biosynthesis, enzyme balance is shifted to favor the formation of more complex glycans in some tissues. Here, we present the N-glycan structures correlated to the developmental stages of C. elegans. These findings may provide important clues derived from the glycosylation patterns of these developmentally distinct stages, which should be relevant to differentiation, embryonic development, inflammation, and immunity in this nematode. Isolation of Developmental Stages of C. elegans—The temporal progression of life stages was approximated using synchronized cultures by the observation of the cessation of pharyngeal pumping, which precedes each cuticle molt (22Epstein H.F. Shakes D.C. Caenorhabditis elegans: Modern Biological Analysis of an Organism. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995Google Scholar). Nematodes were grown in liquid culture and harvested when 90–95% of individuals were of the desired developmental stage, as observed by light microscopy. Isolation of N-Glycans—The glycoprotein-rich fraction was isolated from 2-g batches of C. elegans, as previously described (6Cipollo J.F. Costello C.E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

Briefly, following treatment of extracted proteins with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone trypsin, N-glycans were released from 0.5-ml samples with 8000 units/ml of PNGase F 1The abbreviations used are: PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; PSD, post source decay; Pc, phosphorylcholine; LeX, Lewis X; Man, mannose; Gal, galactose; QoTOF, quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight; 2-AB, 2-aminobenzamide.

Biochem. 2000; 278: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with 50% methanol at pH 5.5 followed by centrifugation at 3500 × g. The solutions, containing free glycans and some peptides, were subjected to rotary evaporation, and the resulting precipitate was suspended in distilled water and applied to Sep Pak C-18 cartridges (Waters). Glycans were collected by elution with distilled water. Adsorbed peptides were eluted with isopropanol and then combined with those that had precipitated in 50% methanol. Free glycans were quantitated using the phenol sulfuric assay for neutral hexose standardized with mannose (24Duboius M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Biochem. 1956; 28: 350-356Google Scholar). Permethylation of Oligosaccharides—Permethylation was carried out using a slight modification of the method of Ciucanu (25Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3189) Google Scholar) as previously described (6Cipollo J.F. Costello C.E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49143-49157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Reductive Amination and Chromatographic Separation—Oligosaccharides were dried in a Savant speed evacuation device and reconstituted in 15 μl of Me2SO. To the reconstituted samples were added 100 μl of 2 m cyanoborohydride and 35 μl of 0.5 m 2-amino benzamide, both of which were solubilized in Me2SO. Glacial acetic acid (50 μl) was added. The reaction was performed at 65 °C for 2 h. The aminated glycans were applied to chromatography paper (Whatman), dried, and separated from reaction products by ascent in a chromatography tank containing 100 ml of acetonitrile. The aminated products were visualized using a BLAK-RAY 366 nm UV lamp and eluted into a 4% butanol solution. The glycan products were filtered by centrifugation, dried by speed evacuation, reconstituted in 4% butanol, and chromatographed on a Waters high-performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a fluorescence detector and Breeze™ software. The aminated glycans were separated on a Varian C18 column using a gradient of 10 mm ammonium acetate 0.1 to 1% butanol applied over 72 min. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—MALDI-TOF MS was performed on a Bruker Reflex IV mass spectrometer in positive reflectron mode. Between 20 and 50 pmol of sample dissolved in 20% acetonitrile was applied to the MALDI target with an equal volume of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (20 mg/ml) in 20% acetonitrile in 10 mm sodium acetate. The spectrum resulting from 150 and 200 shots from a 337 nm nitrogen laser were summed. The laser pulse was 3 ns. Each analysis was performed in duplicate. The intensities of the molecular ion signals were averaged and the mean ± S.E. was calculated. Post source decay (PSD) experiments were performed using the Bruker Reflex IV mass spectrometer in positive reflectron mode with the same sample application described above. Between 13 and 17 segments were collected for each experiment depending on the selected m/z value. The signal generated by exactly 150 shots from a 337 nm nitrogen laser was summed for each segment. Concatenation was performed using X-TOF software. Collision induced dissociation fragmentation data were collected using a MALDI (nitrogen laser, 337 nm) source on a QStar Pulsar i quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). The MALDI matrix was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and typically the signal from 50–200 laser shots was summed for each spectrum. The laser power used was 30–33 μJ. Nitrogen (3 psi) was used as the collision gas for MS/MS experiments. The range of operator-controlled collision voltages was 35–90 V. Nomenclature is that of Domon and Costello unless otherwise indicated. General Workup Strategy—Profiling of permethylated oligosaccharides was initially undertaken to compare amounts of high mannose-, complex-, and C. elegans-specific fucosyl N-glycans of different developmental stages of C. elegans. This was achieved with MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Although this procedure does not distinguish among isomers, it allows relative quantitation of individual isobars based on their spectral intensities. Standard errors of the mean of individual isobar peaks were typically less than 5% of peak intensity. More detailed analyses of N-glycans, from different developmental stages, were carried out following derivatization of the glycans with 2-aminobenzamide (2AB). This allowed detection of glycans after their separation by C18 high-performance liquid chromatography. Thereafter, samples were pooled and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, PSD MS, and MALDI-QoTOF MS/MS. The combination of these analytical techniques has proven useful for glycan identification (26Routier F.H. Hounsell E.F. Rudd P.M. Takahashi N. Bond A. Hay F.C. Alavi A. Axford J.S. Jefferis R. J.

This approach led to the detection of a broader range of C. elegans oligosaccharides than had been previously described. In the next section we first present an overview of the N-glycan patterns of the different C. elegans developmental stages and follow this with in-depth analyses of the different glycan species. Overview of N-Glycan Patterns in C. elegans Developmental Stages—The general patterns of 2-aminobenzamide-labeled N-glycans of different developmental stages can be seen in Fig. 1. These results led to two general conclusions: 1) the N-glycan profile of each developmental stage is unique and 2) the profile from mixed worms resembles that of adults, a not-too-surprising result, because the mixed animal population is enriched in adults, on the basis of mass. In all stages abundant ions correspond to Man3GlcNAc2-2AB, [M+Na]+ m/z 1053.5 (50–52 min), Man5GlcNAc2-2AB, [M+Na]+ m/z 1377.6 (46–48 min), Man7–9GlcNAc2-2AB, [M+Na]+ m/z 1701.7, 1863.7, and 2025.8 (38–40 min), Hex6GlcNAc2-2AB, [M+Na]+ m/z 1539.6 (42–44 min), and Fuc1Man3GlcNAc2-2AB, [M+Na]+ m/z 1199.5 (66–68 min). All the above glycans are consistent with those seen by the permethylation analyses described below. The pattern of complex N-glycans was stage-specific, as shown in Fig. 2. The general trend of the number and abundance of complex N-glycan ions was Dauer ≈ L1 > adult ≈ L4 > L3 ≈ L2. Detailed listings of all detected glycans are shown in Tables I, II, III, IV, whereas important glycan molecular ions of each developmental stage are discussed under “Results” (see “Detailed Analyses of Complex Oligosaccharides,” “Detailed Analyses of Phosphorylcholine Oligosaccharides,” and “Detailed Analyses of C. elegans-specific Fucosyl and Methylated Oligosaccharides” below).Table I2-AB-derivatized phosphocholine oligosaccharides from C. elegans developmental stages detected by MALDI-TOF MSAssignmentObservedCalculatedm/zPc1dHex2Hex2HexNAc21348.71348.5Pc1dHex1Hex3HexNAc21364.71364.5Pc1Hex3HexNAc3 [M+H+]1399.5aIndicates the presence of a glycan of the same mass in an adjacent pool.,bIndicates the presence of a glycan of the same mass in a non-adjacent pool.1399.5Pc1Hex3HexNAc31421.6aIndicates the presence of a glycan of the same mass in an adjacent pool.,bIndicates the presence of a glycan of the same mass in a non-adjacent pool.1421.5Pc1Hex4HexNAc31583.81583.6Pc2Hex3HexNAc4 [M+H]+1602.6bIndicates the presence of a glycan of the same mass in a non-adjacent pool.1602.6Pc1Hex3HexNAc41624.7bIndicates the presence of a glycan of the same mass in a non-adjacent pool.1624.6Pc2dHex1Hex4HexNAc21691.71691.6Pc2Hex4HexNAc31748.51748.6Pc2Hex4HexNAc3 [M(Na)+Na]+1770.41770.6Pc2Hex3HexNAc41790.01790.7Pc1Hex3HexNAc51827.91827.7Pc2Hex4HexNAc41952.61952.7Pc2Hex3HexNAc5 [M+H]+1970.81970.8Pc1dHex1Hex3HexNAc51973.61973.7Pc2Hex3HexNAc51993.01993.7Pc1dHex1Hex5HexNAc42095.02094.8Pc1dHex2Hex3HexNAc52119.72119.8Pc1dHex1Hex4HexNAc52136.0aIndicates the presence of a glycan of the same mass in an adjacent pool.2135.8Pc2Hex3HexNAc6 [M+H]+2173.72173.8Pc1dHex2Hex4HexNAc52280.92280.8Pc1dHex1Hex4HexNAc62338.92338.9Pc1dHex2Hex4HexNAc62484.92484.9Pc2dHex1Hex4HexNAc62504.12503.9Pc1Hex4HexNAc82598.62698.0Pc1dHex2Hex5HexNAc62646.82646.0Pc2dHex2Hex4HexNAc62650.02650.0a Indicates the presence of a glycan of the same mass in an adjacent pool.b Indicates the presence of a glycan of the same mass in a non-adjacent pool.

Open table in a new tab Phosphorylcholine oligosaccharides were found in all developmental stages, and selected spectra containing some of these glycans are shown below in Fig. 4. The general trend of the number and abundance of the glycan species eluting between 52 and 54 min of the chromatograms shown in Fig. 1 was Dauer ≈ L1 > adult ≈ L4 > L3 ≈ L2. These glycans were observed as both the [M+H]+ and [M+Na]+ forms despite doping of the sample matrix with sodium acetate. This is most likely the result of the zwitterionic nature of phosphorylcholine. Detailed descriptions of the different structures, including novel high molecular mass species and some glycoforms not previously described in any organism, are presented under “Detailed Analyses of Complex Oligosaccharides.” Ions corresponding to C. elegans-specific fucosyl and (naturally) methylated oligosaccharides were detected in all developmental stages, with the general trend in number and abundance being Dauer > L1 > adult ≈ L4 > L3 ≈ L2. The majority of these glycans eluted between 40 and 46 min of chromatograms shown in Fig. 1 and are indicated with a triangle in Fig. 4. Detailed analyses of these structures are discussed under “Detailed Analyses of C. elegans-specific Fucosyl and Methylated Oligosaccharides.” In all developmental stages, permethylation profiling revealed that high mannose glycans were the most abundant class (76–78%), followed by C. elegans-specific fucosyl (18–21%) and complex glycans (3–5%). The abundance of each class was expressed as percentage of total N-glycans released. In the Dauer stage the high mannose compounds were decreased to 64%, whereas C. elegans-specific fucosyl was 29% and complex was 7%. High mannose glycans included ions consistent with Man3–5GlcNAc2 and Glc0–1Man7–9GlcNAc2, C. elegans-specific fucosyl N-glycans included ions consistent with Fuc1–2Hex3–5-GlcNAc2, and complex N-glycans included ions consistent with Man3GlcNAc3–4. Detailed Analyses of Complex Oligosaccharides—The pattern of complex glycans was stage-specific (Fig. 1), the general trend of the number and abundance being Dauer ≈ L1 > adult ≈ L4 > L3 ≈ L2. All stages contained a Hex3HexNAc3-2AB, [M+Na]+ m/z 1256.5, in the 48–50 min fraction except for L2 were it was found in an adjacent pool (not shown). A dHex1Hex4HexNAc4-2AB, [M+Na]+ m/z 1767.7, component was seen in the spectra of L1, L4, adult, and Dauer larvae, whereas L4 and Dauer larvae spectra also contained ions for dHex1Hex4HexNAc5-2AB, [M+Na]+ m/z 1970.8, as shown in Fig. 2. Hex3HexNAc5-2AB[M+Na]+ m/z 1663.2, was only observed in L4 larvae. We detected higher molecular weight complex glycans in Dauer larvae than in other stages. Fig. 5B shows the MALDI-TOF MS spectrum of fractions collected at 58–60 min, which included ions consistent with dHex2Hex4HexNAc5-2AB, [M+Na]+ m/z 2116.8, dHex2Hex4HexNAc5-2AB, [M+Na]+ m/z 2279.1, dHex2Hex4HexNAc6-2AB, [M+Na]+ m/z 2319.9, and dHex2Hex4HexNAc7-2AB, [M+ Na]+ m/z 2522.9. Hex4HexNAc4-2AB, [M+Na]+ m/z 1621.7, observed in Fig. 5D, was subjected to MALDI-QoTOF MS/MS analysis, and the structure deduced for this glycan will be shown to be a structure not previously observed in C. elegans (Fig. 3). Evidence for two structures was obtained: one contained a lacNAc substitution, whereas the other had a core bisecting GlcNAc substitution. Evidence for the former structure is supported by the following fragments: 1) B3α, C4/Z3α, and B4/Y3α ions at m/z 550.20. These ions cannot originate from Structure II, whose presence is supported by ion B2γ at m/z 347.11. Further support for the presence of Structure II comes from the observation that a biantennary Gal1Man3GlcNAc4 standard, prepared from bovine IgG, did not give rise to ions of m/z 347.11. Other possible isomers that by composition must contain a chito-, LacdiNAc, or HexNAc-Hex-HexNAc-Hex moiety would produce ions of m/z 429.16 and 592.21 for the first two and 591.21 and 753.26 for the latter two. None of these ions was detected. It is possible that the higher mass Pc oligosaccharides found within the sample fraction (Pc1deoxy1HexHex5HexNAc4 [M+H]+ m/z 2095.0 and Pc1deoxyHex2Hex4HexNAc5 [M+H]+ m/z 2280.9) may have contributed to some ions isolated at m/z 1621.7 through prompt decay. However, because the Gal1Man3-GlcNAc4 standard did not show evidence of prompt decay under the experimental conditions such fragmentation seems unlikely. Detailed Analyses of Phosphorylcholine Oligosaccharides— As mentioned above, phosphorylcholine oligosaccha-rides were observed in all developmental stages with a generalized composition of Pc1–2Fuc0–2Hex2–5HexNAc2–8 (Table I). While all stages contained Pc1Hex3NAc3-2AB, [M+H]+ m/z 1399.5, L1, L4, adult, and Dauer larvae spectra showed ions consistent with Pc1Hex3-HexNAc4–2AB, [M+H]+ m/z 1602.6, and Pc1Hex3HexNAc5-2AB, [M+H]+ m/z 1970.8 (Fig. 4, A–D, filled triangles). Higher molecular weight Pc glycans (Fig. 5, filled triangles), including those with Fuc, were most abundant in L1 and Dauer larvae. Difucosyl Pc glycans such as Pc1dHex2Hex5HexNAc6-2AB, [M+Na]+ m/z 2646.8 (Fig. 5B), were also observed in the ab"

Biallelic expression of H19 hasbeen observed in renal disease patients with hyperhomocysteinemia, acardiovascular disease risk factor. The present study determined whetherhyperhomocysteinemia produces decreased tissue methylation capacity,hypomethylation of the H19 DMD, and altered expression ofH19 and Igf2 in adult mice. Mice heterozygous for disruptionof the gene for cystathionine-β-synthase (Cbs+/–) andC57BL/6 (Cbs+/+) mice were fed a hyperhomocysteinemic or controldiet, respectively, from weaning until 9–12 months of age. Higher plasmatotal homocysteine (p < 0.001) was found in hyperhomocysteinemicmice than in control mice (95 ± 12 versus 5.0 ± 0.3μmol/liter). Hyperhomocysteinemia was accompanied by higher levels ofS-adenosylhomocysteine (p < 0.05) and lowerS-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratios(p < 0.001) in liver and brain. The effect of hyperhomocysteinemiaon H19 DMD methylation was tissue-specific. In liver,hyperhomocysteinemic mice had decreased H19 DMD methylation(p < 0.001).

Homocysteine ismetabolically linked to methylation reactions through the methionine cycle.Within the cycle, methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine(AdoMet), which serves as a methyl donor for numerous methyl acceptors,including DNA (7Finkelstein J.D.

Nutr.Biochem. 1990; 1: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar).S-Adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) is produced as a byproduct of methyldonation, and homocysteine is formed through the (reversible) liberation ofadenosine from AdoHcy. In human subjects with hyperhomocysteinemia,intracellular AdoHcy levels may increase, resulting in a lower AdoMet/AdoHcyratio, diminished methylation capacity, and global DNA hypomethylation(8Yi P.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1908-1919PubMed Google Scholar).On the maternal allele, the H19 DMD is generally unmethylated, whichallows binding of the zinc finger DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor(CTCF) (14Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar,15Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). CTCF is thought to allowdistal enhancers to activate H19 transcription while blockingenhancer access to Igf2. On the paternal allele, the H19 DMDremains methylated, which prevents CTCF binding and enhancer activation ofH19 transcription. Biallelic expression of H19 has beenobserved in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of human subjects withhyperhomocysteinemia and renal disease(17Ingrosso D. Cimmino A. Perna A.F. Masella L.

The vascular consequences of altered expression ofH19 and Igf2 are unknown, but increased expression ofH19 transcripts has been observed in a rat model of carotid arteryinjury (18Kim D.K. Zhang L.

The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that reducedmethylation capacity in Cbs+/– mice with hyperhomocysteinemiais accompanied by hypomethylation of the H19 DMD and alteredexpression of H19 and Igf2. Cbs-deficient mice were chosenas an animal model for homocysteine-related vascular pathology because theyare susceptible to diet-induced increases in plasma tHcy and havehomocysteine-related endothelial dysfunction(11Dayal S.

Our findings demonstratethat hyperhomocysteinemic mice have tissue-specific alterations in methylationof the H19 DMD and in expression of H19 and Igf2.The relationship between changes in DMD methylation and expression ofH19 and Igf2 was stronger in brain than in liver or aorta.Hyperhomocysteinemia produced a 2.5-fold increase in H19 expressionin the aorta, which suggests a possible role for H19 in the vascularpathology of hyperhomocysteinemia. Mice and Experimental Protocol—Mice heterozygous fortargeted disruption of the Cbs gene (Cbs+/–)(23Watanabe M. Osada J. Aratani Y. Kluckman K. Reddick R. Malinow M.R. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), on a C57BL/6 background,and their wild-type C57BL/6 littermates (Cbs+/+) were used in thestudy. Genotyping for the wild-type Cbs allele was conducted by PCRusing the following primers: CbsI3, 5′-AAGAGCCCAGCAGAATGAACA-3′,and P10, 5′-GGTCTGGAATTCACTATGTAGC-3′. Genotyping for thedisrupted Cbs allele, Cbstm1Unc, was accomplishedby PCR using the P10 primer and a primer corresponding to the neo cassetteused in the targeted disruption(23Watanabe M. Osada J.

At weaning,Cbs+/– and Cbs+/+ mice were fed either a control diet(LM485, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) or a hyperhomocysteinemic (HH) diet (TD00205, Harlan Teklad). The HH diet contained double the amount of methionine,minimal folic acid, and lower choline, pyridoxine, cobalamin, and riboflavin(Table I). The diets containedadequate levels of all nutrients except for folate in the HH diet(12Devlin A.M. Arning E. Bottiglieri T. Faraci F.M. Rozen R. Lentz S.R. Blood. 2004; 103: 2624-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The HH diet alsocontained succinyl sulfathiazole to inhibit growth of intestinal bacteria,another source of folic acid. We have shown previously thatCbs+/– fed a control diet and Cbs+/+ mice fed an HHdiet have only moderately elevated levels of plasma tHcy(11Dayal S. Bottiglieri T. Arning E. Maeda N. Malinow M.R. Sigmund C.D. Heistad D.D. Faraci F.M. Lentz S.R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We chose, therefore, toperform comparisons between Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet andCbs+/– mice fed the HH diet to maximize the difference inplasma tHcy between groups. After 9–12 months on the diets, mice wereanesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg intraperitoneally), andblood was collected by cardiac puncture. Samples of liver and brain wereimmediately deproteinized in ice-cold 0.4 mol/liter perchloric acid,homogenized, and centrifuged. The supernatant fraction was immediately frozenand stored at –80 °C for later AdoMet and AdoHcy analysis.Additional samples of liver and brain were flash-frozen and stored at–80 °C for later extraction of genomic DNA and RNA. The aortas wereremoved, flash-frozen, and stored at –80 °C for later extraction ofgenomic DNA and RNA. The protocol was approved by the University of Iowa andVeterans Affairs Animal Care and Use Committees.Table IMethionine, cysteine, choline, and B-vitamin content of experimentaldietsDietNutrientControlHHaThe HH diet also contained 5.0 g/kg of succinyl sulfathiazole to preventintestinal bacterial growth, a potential source of folic acid.l-Methionine (g/kg)4.08.2l-Cysteine (g/kg)3.03.0Choline (mmol/kg)17.27.9Folic acid (mg/kg)6.70.2Pyridoxine (mg/kg)16.98.5Cobalamin (μg/kg)91.025.0Riboflavin (mg/kg)13.76.0a The HH diet also contained 5.0 g/kg of succinyl sulfathiazole to preventintestinal bacterial growth, a potential source of folic acid.

Genomic DNAsamples (1–2 μg) were denatured by incubation with 0.2 mol/liter NaOHfor 10 min at 37 °C. Samples were treated with 3 m sodiumbisulfite, 0.5 mmol/liter hydroquinone for 16 h at 50 °C. Thebisulfite-treated DNA samples were purified with the DNA Wizard clean-up kit(Promega, Madison, WI) and desulfonated with 0.3 mol/liter NaOH followed byprecipitation with ethanol and 6 mol/liter NH4Ac using glycogen (20μg) as a carrier. Precipitated bisulfite-treated DNA samples wereresuspended in water and stored at –20 °C Amplification of the H19 DMD and Sequencing—A region of theH19 DMD shown to be heavily methylated on the paternal allele andhypomethylated on the maternal allele in normal mouse liver(13Thorvaldsen J.L.

This region is located between –1968 and–2555 relative to the transcriptional start site (based on accessionnumber AF049091) and contains 26 CpG sites and one CTCF-binding site(14Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar,15Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). The reaction wasperformed using HotStar TaqDNA polymerase (Qiagen). The primers(H19DMD2, 5′ATGGTTCCCTTACACACTGAACCAGA-3′, and H19DMD3,5′CAGCCTCTGCTTTTATGGCTATGGGG-3′) were designed such that onlybisulfite-treated genomic DNA would amplify to produce a 588-bp band. Cyclingconditions were 95 °C for 15 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min with a final extension of 10min at 72 °C. PCR products were cloned into pCR-TOPO vector (Invitrogen),and plasmid DNA from the clones was purified using the Miniprep spin kit(Qiagen) followed by automated DNA sequencing using an Applied Biosystemsmodel 3730 DNA analyzer (Foster City, CA) available through the DNA CoreFacility of the University of Iowa. Twenty to forty clones containing theamplified H19 DMD PCR products were analyzed from brain, liver, andaorta from each animal. Reverse Transcription of H19 and Igf2 Transcripts—Total RNAwas extracted from liver, brain, and aorta using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).Samples were treated with DNase I (Promega), in the presence of RNaseinhibitor (Promega), to remove contaminating genomic DNA. Integrity of the RNAwas assessed by confirming the presence of 18 S and 28 S rRNA on agarose gels.For synthesis of cDNA, DNase I-treated RNA samples from liver (1.5 μg),brain (2.0 μg), or aorta (2.0 μg) were incubated with 1.25 units/μlMultiscribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems), 0.4 units/μl RNaseinhibitor, 2.5 μmol/liter random hexamers, 500 μmol/liter each dNTPs,5.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, and TaqMan reverse transcription buffer in afinal reaction volume of 80 μl. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 10min for annealing of random hexamers followed by incubation at 48 °C for30 min for reverse transcription and 95 °C for 10 min for inactivation ofreverse transcriptase. Real-time PCR—Reverse-transcribed cDNA from liver (150 ng),brain (200 ng), or aorta (200 ng) was incubated with TaqMan Universal PCR mix(Applied Biosystems). For quantification of H19 transcripts,commercially designed PCR primers and TaqMan minor groove binder probes (FAMdye-labeled) specific for H19 (Mm00469706, Applied Biosystems) wereused. For quantification of Igf2 transcripts, PCR primers and TaqManminor groove binder probes (FAM dye-labeled) were designed by AppliedBiosystems to amplify a region of the coding sequence of the Igf2mRNA (accession number NM_010514). Samples were incubated at 50 °C for 2min followed by incubation at 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95 °Cfor 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min using the Applied Biosystems 7700 sequencedetection system. Samples were run in triplicate. Amplicon-specific standardcurves generated by serial dilution of cDNA were used to quantify the amountof H19 and Igf2 in each sample. For each unknown sample,cycle threshold values were determined, and the relative amount of cDNA wascalculated using linear regression analysis from its respective standardcurve. Data were analyzed using Sequence Detection software version 1.6.3(Applied Biosystems). Levels of 18 S rRNA were determined using TaqManribosomal RNA control reagents (Applied Biosystems). Data for H19 andIgf2 are expressed as a ratio to levels of 18 S rRNA. Statistical Analysis—One-way analysis of variance was usedto compare values for tHcy, AdoMet, AdoHcy, and AdoMet/AdoHcy ratios, thelevels of H19 and Igf2 transcripts, and the extent ofH19 DMD methylation between Cbs+/+ mice fed the control dietand Cbs+/– fed the HH diet. Linear regression, followed byone-way analysis of variance to determine significance levels, was used todetermine the relationship of plasma tHcy with liver and brain AdoMet/AdoHcyratios and with aorta H19 transcript levels. These analyses wereaccomplished by SigmaStat version 3.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Plasma tHcy and Methylation Capacity in Liver and Brain—Feeding the HH diet to Cbs+/– mice produced plasma tHcy levelsof 94.7 ± 11.9 μmol/liter, almost 20-fold higher (p <0.001) than the levels of 5.0 ± 0.3 μmol/liter in Cbs+/+mice fed the control diet (Fig.1). The elevation in plasma tHcy in the Cbs+/– micefed the HH diet was accompanied by a reduction in tissue methylation capacity,with lower AdoMet/AdoHcy ratios (p < 0.001) in liver and brainwhen compared with Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet(Fig. 2, A andB). These differences in methylation capacity were dueprimarily to higher levels of AdoHcy (p < 0.05) in the liver andbrain of Cbs+/– mice fed the HH diet than Cbs+/+ micefed the control diet. No significant differences in levels of AdoMet in liveror brain were observed between Cbs+/– mice fed the HH diet andCbs+/+ mice fed the control diet. Overall, there was a negativecorrelation between plasma tHcy and AdoMet/AdoHcy ratios in liver (p< 0.01, r = 0.568) and brain (p < 0.05, r =0.501).Fig. 2Reduced methylation capacity in liver and brain of mice withhyperhomocysteinemia.

Sequencing PCR productsamplified from the H19 DMD of bisulfite-treated DNA indicated whetherthe cytosine residues at each of the 26 CpG sites were methylated(Fig. 3A). In theliver, the percentage of H19 DMD CpG sites that were methylated wasless (p < 0.001) in Cbs+/– mice fed the HH dietthan in Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet(Fig. 3B). InCbs+/– mice fed the HH diet, on average, 53.0 ± 0.7% ofthe CpGs (2757 of 5200 CpGs analyzed) were methylated when compared with 60.6± 0.6% (2615 of 4316 CpGs analyzed) in Cbs+/+ mice fed thecontrol diet. The converse effect on H19 DMD methylation was observed in thebrain and aorta, where the percentage of CpG sites that were methylated washigher (p < 0.001) in Cbs+/– mice fed the HH dietthan in Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet(Fig. 3, C andD). The magnitude of the difference in H19 DMDmethylation was highest in the brain, where an average of 70.5 ± 0.2%of the CpGs (2109 of 2990 CpGs analyzed) were methylated inCbs+/– mice fed the HH diet when compared with 46.1 ±0.3% (1355 of 2938 CpGs analyzed) in Cbs+/+ mice fed the controldiet. In the aorta, an average of 77.8 ± 0.2% of the CpGs (2085 of 2678CpGs analyzed) were methylated in Cbs+/– mice fed the HH dietwhen compared with 72.6 ± 0.4% (1869 of 2574 CpGs analyzed) inCbs+/+ mice fed the control diet. Levels of H19 and Igf2 Transcripts—To determine whether thechanges in tissue methylation capacity and methylation profile of theH19 DMD in hyperhomocysteinemic mice were accompanied bytissue-specific alterations in the expression of H19 orIgf2, levels of H19 and Ifg2 transcripts werequantified by real-time PCR (TableII). In the liver and brain, levels of H19 transcriptsdid not differ significantly between Cbs+/+ mice fed the control dietand Cbs+/– mice fed the HH diet. In the aorta, higher levels ofH19 transcripts (p = 0.02) were found inCbs+/– mice fed the HH diet than in Cbs+/+ mice fedthe control diet. Overall, there was a positive correlation (p <0.05, r = 0.619) between levels of H19 transcripts in aortaand plasma tHcy concentration.Table IITissue-specific changes in H19 and Igf2 transcript levelsTissueCbs +/+ Control dietCbs +/- HH dietpvalueaValues shown are mean ± S.E. p value determined by one-wayanalysis of variance.H19 transcripts (Igf2/18 S × 106)Liver160 ± 44 (n = 13)114 ± 35 (n = 12)0.43Brain0.035 ± 0.014 (n = 4)0.048 ± 0.020 (n = 7)0.66Aorta0.56 ± 0.09 (n = 7)1.39 ± 0.31 (n = 7)0.02Igf2 transcripts (Igf2/18 S × 106)Liver70.9 ± 11.2 (n = 13)44.8 ± 6.2 (n = 12)0.06Brain1.06 ± 0.34 (n = 5)2.38 ± 0.67 (n = 7)0.15Aorta0.56 ± 0.13 (n = 7)0.72 ± 0.21 (n = 6)0.51a Values shown are mean ± S.E. p value determined by one-wayanalysis of variance. Open table in a new tab Levels of Igf2 transcripts tended to be lower in the liver andhigher in the brain of Cbs+/– mice fed the HH diet whencompared with Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet, but these differencesdid not reach statistical significance(Table II). No differences inlevels of Igf2 transcripts were seen in the aortas of Cbs+/+mice fed the control diet versus Cbs+/– mice fed the HHdiet. Because H19 and Igf2 are reciprocally imprinted in themouse, we compared the ratios of H19 transcripts with those ofIgf2 transcripts in liver, brain, and aorta in each group of mice.The ratio of H19/Igf2 transcripts in liver and aorta did notdiffer significantly between Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet andCbs+/– mice fed the HH diet(Fig. 4, A andC). In the brain, which exhibited a large increase inH19 DMD methylation in Cbs+/– mice fed the HH dietwhen compared with Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet(Fig. 3C), there was acorresponding decrease in the ratio of H19/Igf2 transcriptsin Cbs+/– mice fed the HH diet (p = 0.006)(Fig. 4B). This work sought to determine whether the reduced methylation capacity inhyperhomocysteinemic mice is accompanied by hypomethylation of theH19 DMD and altered expression of H19 and Igf2transcripts. We chose to study the effects of hyperhomocysteinemia in theliver because it is the primary site of homocysteine metabolism, and also inthe aorta and brain, which are sites of pathology in humans withhyperhomocysteinemia (6Collaboration Homocysteine Studies J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 288: 2015-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). There are three major findings of this study. First, we found that theeffect of hyperhomocysteinemia on H19 DMD methylation istissue-specific. In the liver, the reduced tissue methylation capacity(AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio) in Cbs+/– mice with hyperhomocysteinemiawas accompanied by a significant decrease in methylation of the H19DMD. In the brain, hyperhomocysteinemia also produced a decrease in theAdoMet/AdoHcy ratio, but the lower methylation capacity was paradoxicallyassociated with an increase in methylation of the H19 DMD.Hyperhomocysteinemia in Cbs+/– mice was also associated with asignificant increase in H19 DMD methylation in the aorta. The secondmajor finding is that the reduced methylation capacity and increasedH19 DMD methylation in the brain of mice with hyperhomocysteinemiawas associated with a significant decrease in the ratio ofH19/Igf2 transcripts, which suggests that DNA methylationplays a major role in regulating H19 and Igf2 expression inthe brain. The third major finding is that hyperhomocysteinemia inCbs+/– mice produced a 2.5-fold increase in the expression ofH19 transcripts in aorta. This finding suggests a possible role forH19 transcripts in the vascular pathology associated withhyperhomocysteinemia. We used an animal model that combined a genomic approach(Cbs+/–) with a dietary intervention (the HH diet) to inducehyperhomocysteinemia. The level of plasma tHcy achieved inCbs+/– mice fed the HH diet (95 ± 12 μmol/liter) wassimilar to that seen in human patients with hereditary CBS deficiency(28Yap S. Naughten E.R. Wilcken B. Wilcken D.E. Boers G.H. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2000; 26: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As expected,Cbs+/– mice fed the HH diet had decreased AdoMet/AdoHcy ratiosin both liver and brain (Fig.2), indicative of reduced methylation capacity. The effect ofhyperhomocysteinemia on AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio was principally caused by asignificant increase in the level of AdoHcy in both liver and brain. We hadpredicted that the reduced methylation capacity in hyperhomocysteinemia mightresult in decreased methylation of the H19 DMD and loss of imprintingat the H19 locus. In the liver, the hyperhomocysteinemic animals didhave a modest but significant decrease in methylation of the H19 DMD(Fig. 2B). In thebrain, however, these animals had a large increase in H19 DMDmethylation (Fig. 2C).It was not possible to determine whether there was differential loss ofH19 genomic imprinting because the Cbs+/+ andCbs+/– mice were of the same background strain (C57BL/6). Thisquestion could be addressed in future studies using control andhyperhomocysteinemic mice that differ in a sequence polymorphism at theH19 locus. Interestingly, the increase in H19 DMD methylation in the brainwas accompanied by a significant decrease in the ratio of H19transcripts to Igf2 transcripts(Fig. 4B). Thisobservation fits well with the boundary/insulator model of the H19DMD in which CTCF binds to the unmethylated H19 DMD, allowing distalenhancers to activate H19 transcription whereas simultaneouslyinhibiting access of these enhancers to Igf2(14Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 15Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1908-1919PubMed Google Scholar).The mice with hyperhomocysteinemia did not, however, have an altered ratio ofH19 transcripts to Igf2 transcripts in liver. This findingsuggests that control of H19 and Igf2 expression in liverinvolves other regulatory factors besides H19 DMD methylation. We also found a significant increase in the levels of H19transcripts in aorta from Cbs+/– mice fed the HH diet. Theincreased expression of H19 transcripts was likely unrelated to themethylation status of the H19 DMD because these mice had a modestincrease in methylation of the H19 DMD in aorta. The effect ofhyperhomocysteinemia on levels of H19 transcripts in aorta may be aconsequence of homocysteine-related changes in the expression and/or abilityof CTCF to bind to the H19 DMD, changes in the methylation status ofother sites within the imprinting control region, or an effect on some otheryet uncharacterized factor required for H19 transcription. The finding of increased levels of H19 transcripts in aorta ofCbs+/– mice fed the HH diet may have implications for thevascular pathology of hyperhomocysteinemia. H19 belongs to a familyof imprinted genes that encode untranslated RNA transcripts. Some studiessuggest that H19 mRNA may function as a tumor suppressor, whereasothers have shown increased expression of H19 in tumors(29Hao Y. Crenshaw T. Moulton T. Newcomb E. Tycko B.

In summary, this study demonstrated that Cbs+/– mice withhyperhomocysteinemia have reduced tissue methylation capacity accompanied bytissue-specific changes in the methylation and expression of H19. Inthis model, changes in methylation of the H19 DMD did not strictlycorrelate with changes in the expression of H19 or Igf2transcripts. These findings suggest that other factors besides H19DMD methylation contribute to the regulation of H19 and Igf2expression in hyperhomocysteinemia. The tightest correlation betweenH19 DMD methylation and regulation of H19 and Igf2expression was seen in the brain, which suggests that H19 DMDmethylation is a stronger regulator of H19 expression in the brain.Despite the variable relationship between H19 DMD methylation andH19 expression in different tissues, it is clear thathyperhomocysteinemia can have profound effects on the methylation andexpression of imprinted genes in adult animals. Additional work will berequired to define the exact mechanism(s) by which homocysteine affectsexpression of H19 and the role of H19 in the vascularpathology of hyperhomocysteinemia.

https://openalex.org/W1965865579,"FeoB is an atypical transporter that has been shown to exclusively mediate ferrous ion transport in some bacteria. Unusually the genome of the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis has two genes (feoB1 and feoB2) encoding FeoB homologs, both of which are expressed in bicistronic operons. Kinetic analysis of ferrous ion transport by P. gingivalis W50 revealed the presence of a single, high affinity system with a K(t) of 0.31 microM. FeoB1 was found to be solely responsible for this transport as energized cells of the isogenic FeoB1 mutant (W50FB1) did not transport radiolabeled iron, while the isogenic FeoB2 mutant (W50FB2) transported radiolabeled iron at a rate similar to wild type. This was reflected in the iron content of W50FB1 grown in iron excess conditions which was approximately half that of the wild type and W50FB2. The W50FB1 mutant had increased sensitivity to both oxygen and hydrogen peroxide and was avirulent in an animal model of infection whereas W50FB2 exhibited the same virulence as the wild type. Analysis of manganous ion uptake using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry revealed a greater than 3-fold decrease in intracellular manganese accumulation in W50FB2 which was also unable to grow in manganese-limited media. The protein co-expressed with FeoB2 appears to be a novel FeoA-MntR fusion protein that exhibits homology to a manganese-responsive, DNA-binding metalloregulatory protein. These results indicate that FeoB2 is not involved in iron transport but plays a novel role in manganese transport."
https://openalex.org/W2148922987,"Increasing evidence suggests that the folding and maturation of monomeric proteins and assembly of multimeric protein complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may be inefficient not only for mutants that carry changes in the primary structure but also for wild type proteins. In the present study, we demonstrate that the rat luteinizing hormone receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, is one of these proteins that matures inefficiently and appears to be very prone to premature degradation. A substantial portion of the receptors in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells existed in immature form of Mr 73,000, containing high mannose-type N-linked glycans. In metabolic pulse-chase studies, only ∼20% of these receptor precursors were found to gain hormone binding ability and matured to a form of Mr 90,000, containing bi- and multiantennary sialylated N-linked glycans. The rest had a propensity to form disulfide-bonded complexes with a Mr 120,000 protein in the ER membrane and were eventually targeted for degradation in proteasomes. The number of membrane-bound receptor precursors increased when proteasomal degradation was inhibited, and no cytosolic receptor forms were detected, suggesting that retrotranslocation of the misfolded/incompletely folded receptors is tightly coupled to proteasomal function. Furthermore, a proteasomal blockade was found to increase the number of receptors that were capable of hormone binding. Thus, these results raise the interesting possibility that luteinizing hormone receptor expression at the cell surface may be controlled at the ER level by regulating the number of newly synthesized proteins that will mature and escape the ER quality control and premature degradation.

This elimination of newly synthesized receptors may result, at least to some extent, from limitations in the folding kinetics, because a proteasomal blockade was found to lead to enhanced ER export and maturation of wild type δ opioid (16Petäjä-Repo U.E.

These data led us to hypothesize that inefficient processing and maturation might be a more common property among GPCRs than has been thought before and may provide a means to control the number of receptors at the cell surface. In an attempt to test this notion, we set out to examine processing and maturation of the rat LHR in stably transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells in more detail and determine, whether the newly synthesized receptors are prone to premature ERAD. The results demonstrate that the LHRs that gain hormone binding ability are exported out of the ER and reach the cell surface. However, a substantial portion of the newly synthesized receptors does not appear to fold correctly and tends to form disulfide-bonded heterocomplexes and are eventually targeted for degradation in proteasomes. Furthermore, proteasomal blockade was found to lead to enhanced maturation of the receptor. Thus, proteasomal degradation appears to modulate the efficiency of LHR maturation and in doing so may control the expression of mature receptors at the cell surface.

Tissue samples were removed immediately, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. The use of animals was approved by the University of Oulu Committee for the Care of Experimental Animals. DNA Constructs—The full-length rat LHR cDNA (GenBank™ accession M26199) was subcloned into the EcoRI restriction site of the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The DNA construct encoding the rat LHR with a cleavable influenza hemagglutinin signal peptide (KTIIALSYIFCLVFA), N-terminal Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) and C-terminal FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) was created by amplifying the cDNA by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides 5′-CAGCTGATCGATCGAGAGCTGTCAGGGTCG-3′ and 5′-AATTCCTAGGCTAGTGAGTTAACGCTCTCG-3′, digested with ClaI/BlnI, ligated into the modified pcDNA5/FRT/TO© vector (Invitrogen) (called pFT-SMMF) and transformed into Escherichia coli JM109. An accidentally included Stop-codon was removed by digesting with HpaI/BlnI and inserting an adapter without TAG-codon. The pFT-SMMF vector was created by ligating the HindIII/KpnI-digested pcDNA5/FRT/TO© vector, inserting the DNA sequence 5′-AAGCTTGCCACCATGAAGACGATCATCGCCCTGAGCTACATCTTCTGCCTGGTATTCGCCGAGCAAAAGCTCATTTCTGAAGAGGACTTGGCTAGCATCGATCCCGGGATGCATCCTAGGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTGAGGTACC-3′, and transforming into E. coli JM110. Cell Culture and Transfection—Cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml (complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), and the appropriate selection antibiotics in a humidified atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2 at 37 °C. HEK-293S cells were transfected with the full-length rat LHR cDNA in pcDNA3 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), and clones of stably transfected cells were selected using 400 μg/ml of G-418 (Calbiochem). HEK-293 cells stably expressing the epitope-tagged rat LHR under tetracycline induction were prepared as described elsewhere. 2T. T. Leskelä, P. M. H. Markkanen, E. M. Pietilä, J. T. Tuusa, and U. E. Petäjä-Repo, manuscript in preparation. For a few experiments, a stably transfected HEK-293 cell line obtained from Dr. Rolf Sprengel (Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, Heidelberg, Germany) was used (see Figs. 1, 2, 3). For these cells, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was replaced with minimum essential medium with Earle's salts. The level of receptor expression was estimated by Western blotting. Cells were subcultured in 25-cm2 or 75-cm2 culture flasks or 60-mm culture plates, grown to 70-90% confluency prior to experiments, harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm NEM, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C.Fig. 2Characterization of oligosaccharides of the Mr 90,000 LHR. Receptors from stably transfected HEK-293 cells were purified by hCG-affinity chromatography, radioiodinated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE.

The dried gel was exposed to x-ray film to obtain the fluorograph shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Isolation of the LHR species expressed at the cell surface. Stably transfected HEK-293 cells were labeled for 16 h with 150 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine and incubated with or without hCG (1 mg/ml) for 60 min on ice, as indicated. Crude cellular membranes were solubilized and subjected to immunoprecipitation using either a polyclonal receptor-specific antibody or anti-hCG antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Metabolic Pulse-Chase Labeling with [35S]Methionine/Cysteine—For pulse-chase labeling, cells were first preincubated in methionine and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 60 min at 37 °C and then labeled in fresh medium containing 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine. After an incubation of 60 min at 37 °C, the pulse was terminated by washing the cells twice with the chase medium (complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5 mm methionine) and chased for different periods of time as specified in the figures. When labeling was performed in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, the reagents were added 2 h before the pulse labeling at a final concentration of 10 μm. Isolation of Cell Surface Receptors—For steady state labeling, [35S]methionine/cysteine (150 μCi/ml) was added to the culture medium for 16 h. Cells were then cooled on ice and incubated for 60 min in the presence of hCG (1 mg/ml) before harvesting. The cell surface receptors were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal anti-hCG antibody, as described below. Preparation and Solubilization of Crude Membrane Particles and Cellular Lysates—Ovarian (1.7 g) and testicular samples (8 mg) and cell pellets were suspended in buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm NEM, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax T-25, Janke and Kunkel) or by squeezing several times through a 26-gauge needle. Cells expressing the epitope-tagged LHR were homogenized in buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NEM, 2 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml benzamidine). Homogenates were centrifuged at 180 × g for 5 min, and the pellets were rehomogenized and recentrifuged. The combined supernatants were further centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 30 min, and after washing once with buffer A or B, the crude membrane pellets were used either immediately or quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C. Alternatively, the metabolically labeled cells were sonicated in buffer C (buffer A containing 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml benzamidine). Protein was measured using a Bio-Rad DC assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The membrane particles were solubilized in SDS-sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue) at 22 °C for 30 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE after pelleting the unsolubilized fraction at 16,000 × g for 30 min (see Fig. 1A). Alternatively, the membranes were solubilized by stirring on ice for 60 min in buffer D (buffer C containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 20% (v/v) glycerol) or buffer E (buffer B containing 0.5% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and 140 mm NaCl) and centrifuging at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The cellular lysates were prepared by solubilizing the thawed cells directly in buffer D. After centrifugation, the soluble fractions were supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and subjected to immunoprecipitation or ligand affinity chromatography. Immunoprecipitation and Ligand Affinity Chromatography—Immunoprecipitation was performed using a receptor-specific polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal domain of the receptor (purified antibody 5 μg/ml, antiserum 1:50) or a polyclonal anti-hCG antiserum (1:100). Samples were first precleared for 60 min using 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and after adding the antibody and protein G-Sepharose they were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The resin was washed twice with buffer D, twice with buffer F (buffer A containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.36 m NaCl) and twice with buffer G (buffer A containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 20% (v/v) glycerol). The receptors were eluted by incubating the resin for 5 min at 95 °C in SDS-sample buffer. The epitope-tagged LHR was immunoprecipitated as described previously (12Petäjä-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperrière A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Ligand affinity chromatography was performed using hCG-Affi-Gel 10, which was prepared as described previously (24Keinänen K.P. Kellokumpu S. Metsikkö M.K. Rajaniemi H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7920-7926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solubilized receptors were incubated with 20 μl of the resin overnight at 4 °C, washed, and eluted as described above. Enzymatic Digestions of Crude Membrane Particles and Purified LHRs—For glycosidase treatments, the crude membrane particles were solubilized in 1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.0 (Endo H) or pH 7.0 (PNGase F), 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 22 °C for 60 min. Before centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min, the samples were diluted 10-fold by adding 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.0 or 7.0), 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For PNGase F digestion, the buffer also contained 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline. After centrifugation, aliquots of the supernatants were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and subjected to digestion with Endo H (100 milliunits/ml) or PNGase F (5 units/ml) at 30 °C for 16 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 4× SDS-sample buffer. The hCG-Affi-Gel 10-purified 125I-labeled receptor was treated with glycosidases as described earlier (25Petäjä-Repo U.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were thawed and homogenized in buffer H (buffer C containing 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) using a Dounce homogenizer (30 strokes with the loose pestle and 30 with the tight one). The homogenates were first centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to pellet the crude membranes, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to clarify the cytosolic fraction. The pellets were washed once with buffer H, centrifuged as above, and solubilized in buffer H containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. After mixing the suspension on a magnetic stirrer for 60 min, the samples were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Immunoprecipitations from the soluble fraction (supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100), and the solubilized membranes were carried out using the receptor-specific polyclonal antibody in two sequential steps. The bound antigens were first eluted with 1% (w/v) SDS, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, by incubating at 95 °C for 5 min, and the eluates were diluted 10-fold with buffer H containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 before the next immunoprecipitation step. The second elution was performed by incubating in SDS-sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. Denaturation of the samples and the second immunoprecipitation step were necessary because of a nonspecific protein in the cytosolic fraction that co-migrated with the receptor precursor on SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE, Ligand, and Immunoblotting—For SDS-PAGE (7.5% separating gels), samples were denatured by heating at 95 °C for 2 min in the absence or presence of 50 mm dithiothreitol. Molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad) detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad) were used to calibrate the gels. For two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, samples were first run under non-reducing conditions, and a 4-mm strip of the slab gel was cut out and dehydrated by incubating in CH3CN at 22 °C for 15 min and drying in a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant Instruments). The gel strip was rehydrated in 2% (w/v) SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 50 mm dithiothreitol at 70 °C for 20 min and after incubation in 100 mm iodoacetamide, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, at 22 °C for 60 min, it was placed onto a preparative well on another slab gel. For detection of radioactivity, the gels were treated with EN3HANCE® (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions, dried, and exposed at -70 °C for 1-20 days, using Biomax MR (Eastman Kodak Co.) or Fuji x-ray film (Fuji Photo Film Co.) and intensifying screens. The relative intensities of the bands on the autoradiograms were analyzed by densitometric scanning with Agfa Duoscan HiD laser scanner and quantified using the Scion Image 4.02 software, subtracting the local background from each lane. The data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 4.02 software. For immuno- and ligand blotting, the proteins resolved in SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically to either nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) or Immobilon P sheets (Millipore). The bound proteins were probed using the polyclonal LHR antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents from Amersham Biosciences were used to reveal the blotted proteins. Ligand blotting was performed by incubating the nitrocellulose sheets with [125I]hCG in the absence or presence on an excess of unlabeled hCG, as described (24Keinänen K.P. Kellokumpu S. Metsikkö M.K. Rajaniemi H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7920-7926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEK-293 Cells Express Two LHR Forms of Mr 73,000 and 90,000—To identify the LHRs expressed in HEK-293 cells, solubilized membranes from stably transfected cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). A receptor-specific antibody directed against the C-terminal domain of the receptor recognized two bands with apparent molecular weights of 90,000 and 73,000 (Fig. 1A, lane 2), the relative intensities of which varied from one experiment to another. These two bands were not present in non-transfected cells (Fig. 1A, lane 1), indicating that they specifically represent the expressed receptor. Ligand blotting was then applied to investigate whether the two receptor species detected on Western blots are able to bind hormone. The solubilized membrane proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose sheets (Fig. 1A). Incubation of the sheets with [125I]hCG revealed specific binding to the Mr 90,000 and 73,000 receptor species (Fig. 1A, compare lane 4 with 6). The Mr 73,000 receptor band was less intense on ligand blots than on immunoblots, whereas the reverse was true for the Mr 90,000 receptor band (Fig. 1A, compare lane 2 with 4). The most likely explanation for this observation is that a large fraction of the smaller receptor species is misfolded/incompletely folded and thus is unable to bind ligand (see below). When the samples were reduced prior to SDS-PAGE, no radiolabeled bands were detected (data not shown), indicating that correct conformation for ligand binding requires intact disulfide bonds. The identities of the two LHR species were studied further by treating the receptors with glycosidases (Fig. 1B). Endo H selectively removes unprocessed high mannose-type N-linked oligosaccharides from glycoproteins but does not cleave complex type, fully processed glycans (26Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Treatment of the membrane-bound proteins with this enzyme did not change the molecular weight of the Mr 90,000 receptor species but reduced that of the Mr 73,000 one to Mr ∼62,000 (Fig. 1B, lane 2). This demonstrates that the Mr 73,000 receptor species does not represent a degradation product but rather an intact receptor polypeptide bearing high mannose-type oligosaccharides, whereas the Mr 90,000 receptor species appears to contain complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides. This was further supported by the observation that PNGase F, an enzyme that can remove all types of N-linked oligosaccharides from glycoproteins (26Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), was able to digest this receptor species (Fig. 1B, lane 4). As anticipated, PNGase F was also able to increase the electrophoretic mobility of the Mr 73,000 receptor form (Fig. 1B, lane 4). The oligosaccharides of the Mr 90,000 LHR form were studied in more detail by subjecting this species to various exo- and endoglycosidase treatments (Fig. 2). The Mr 90,000 receptor was purified by affinity chromatography on hCG-Affi-Gel 10, labeled with 125I, and separated from the Mr 73,000 species by electroelution from the SDS gel prior to glycosidase treatments. The N-linked oligosaccharides were first characterized by treating the receptor with Endo F2, an enzyme that is able to remove biantennary N-linked glycans (26Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2, lane 3, this enzyme decreased the apparent Mr of the receptor to ∼87,000. As complete removal of N-linked glycans with PNGase F decreases the Mr to ∼62,000 (Fig. 2, lane 2), the Mr 90,000 receptor appears to contain some biantennary but also trior tetra-antennary N-linked oligosaccharides. The receptor was also treated with exoglycosidases,"

To determine the role of trehalose in the physiology of these bacteria, the so-called Corynebacterineae, mutant strains of Corynebacterium glutamicum unable to synthesize trehalose due to the knock-out of the genes of the three pathways of trehalose biosynthesis, were biochemically analyzed. We demonstrated that the synthesis of trehalose under standard conditions is a prerequisite for the production of mycolates, major and structurally important constituents of the cell envelope of Corynebacterineae. Consistently, the trehalose-less cells also lack the cell wall fracture plane that typifies mycolate-containing bacteria. Importantly, however, the mutants were able to synthesize mycolates when grown on glucose, maltose, and maltotriose but not on other carbon sources known to be used for the production of internal glucose phosphate such as fructose, acetate, and pyruvate. The mycoloyl residues synthesized by the mutants grown on α-d-glucopyranosyl-containing oligosaccharides were transferred both onto the cell wall and free sugar acceptors. A combination of chemical analytical approaches showed that the newly synthesized glycolipids consisted of 1 mol of mycolate located on carbon 6 of the non reducing glucopyranosyl unit. Additionally, experiments with radioactively labeled trehalose showed that the transfer of mycoloyl residues onto sugars occurs outside the plasma membrane. Finally, and in contradiction to published data, we demonstrated that trehalose 6-phosphate has no impact on mycolate synthesis in vivo.

Finally, and in contradiction to published data, we demonstrated that trehalose 6-phosphate has no impact on mycolate synthesis in vivo. Trehalose (α-d-glucopyranosyl-α′-d-glucopyranoside) is widely distributed in nature; the disaccharide is found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and can serve as a carbon source, storage carbohydrate, or stress protection compound (for review, see Ref. 1Argüelles J.C. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The most common route of de novo trehalose synthesis is by UDP-glucose and glucose 6-phosphate, yielding trehalose 6-phosphate, which is subsequently dephosphorylated into trehalose (Fig. 1). The reactions are catalyzed in Escherichia coli by osmotically regulated trehalose synthesis (Ots) 1The abbreviations used are: Ots, osmotically regulated trehalose synthesis; TreS, trehalose synthase; TreY, maltooligosyltrehalose synthase; TreZ, maltooligosyltrehalose hydrolase; CTAB, N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide; COSY, correlated spectroscopy; MMCM, maltose monocorynomycolate; MTMCM, maltotriose monocorynomycolate, TMCM, trehalose monocorynomycolate; TDCM, trehalose dicorynomycolate; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization-time of flight. 1The abbreviations used are: Ots, osmotically regulated trehalose synthesis; TreS, trehalose synthase; TreY, maltooligosyltrehalose synthase; TreZ, maltooligosyltrehalose hydrolase; CTAB, N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide; COSY, correlated spectroscopy; MMCM, maltose monocorynomycolate; MTMCM, maltotriose monocorynomycolate, TMCM, trehalose monocorynomycolate; TDCM, trehalose dicorynomycolate; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization-time of flight. enzymes, OtsA and OtsB. An alternative route for trehalose synthesis in other organisms consists in the conversion of maltose into trehalose, catalyzed by trehalose synthase (TreS), which converts the α(1→4) glycosidic bond of maltose into an α(1-1) linkage to yield trehalose (Fig. 1). An additional pathway for trehalose synthesis uses oligo/polymaltooligo-dextrins/glycogen as substrate; the terminal α(1→4) glycosidic bond at the reducing end of the polymer is converted into α(1-1) by maltooligosyltrehalose synthase (TreY), and the resulting terminal trehalosyl unit of the polysaccharide is then released by maltooligosyltrehalose hydrolase (TreZ). Although only one of the three pathways occurs in most bacteria, all three biosynthetic routes were found in mycobacteria and corynebacteria (2De Smet K.A.L. Weston A. Brown I.N. Young D.B. Robertson B.D. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3Tzvetkov M. Klopprogge C. Zelder O. Liebl W.

Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role of trehalose in the physiology of microorganisms grouped in the Corynebacterineae suborder. These Gram-positive bacteria are unusual in that, like Gram-negative microorganisms, they contain an outer permeability barrier that may explain both their limited permeability and their rather general insusceptibility to toxic agents (5Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 6Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Draper P. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the additional barrier in Gram-negative bacteria is a typical bilayer of phospholipid and lipopolysaccharide, in mycobacteria and corynebacteria it consists of a bilayer composed of a monolayer of mycoloyl residues covalently linked to the cell wall arabinogalactan and a monolayer of a variety of lipids non-covalently attached to the cell wall (6Daffé M.

In Corynebacterineae, trehalose derivatives consist exclusively of glycolipids composed mainly of trehalose esterified by long chain (C30-C90) α-alkyl, β-hydroxy fatty acids of various chain lengths and structural features, called mycolic acids. Although in corynebacteria trehalose monocorynomycolate (TMCM) and trehalose dicorynomycolate (TDCM) are certainly involved in the formation of a second permeability barrier functionally similar to the Gram-negative outer membrane (8Daffé M. Eggeling L. Bott M. Handbook of Corynebacterium glutamicum. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2005: 121-148Crossref Google Scholar, 11Puech V. Chami M. Lemassu A. Lanéelle M.A. Schiffler B. Gounon P. Bayan N. Benz R. Daffé M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1365-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), trehalose dimycolate is believed to play a key role in the pathogenicity of mycobacteria (12Glickman M.S. Cox J.S.

Importantly, a trehalose analog that inhibits in vitro the synthesis of trehalose mycolates and cell-bound mycolates has been shown to have a bacteriostatic action on Mycobacterium aurum (14Belisle J.T. Vissa V.D. Sievert T. Takayama K. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Science. 1997; 276: 1420-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Consistently, the synthesis of trehalose has been recently shown to be essential for the growth of additional mycobacterial species, namely Mycobacterium smegmatis (15Woodruff P.J. Carlson B.L. Siridechadilok B. Senaratne R.H. Mougous J. Riley L.W. Williams S.J. Bertozzi C.R. J. Biol.

It is not known, however, whether or not the essentiality of trehalose for the mycobacterial growth is directly connected to the metabolism of mycolates. Nevertheless, in the context of the resurgence of tuberculosis and emergence of multidrug-resistant mycobacteria, the enzymes involved in the synthesis of trehalose, which is absent from mammalian cells, and/or the traffic of mycolic acids represent putative targets for the development of new anti-tuberculosis drugs. Most of the studies devoted to the role of sugars, notably trehalose, in Corynebacterineae have been performed in corynebacteria. Pulse labeling experiments with palmitic acid have shown that Corynebacterium diphtheriae cell extracts accumulated in the first seconds of incubation a C32-β-keto ester of trehalose, i.e. the 6-(2-tetradecyl, 3-keto octadecanoyl)-α-d-trehalose (17Promé J.C. Walker R.W. Lacave C. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1974; 278: 1065-1068Google Scholar). Similar experiments have also demonstrated the stimulating effect of glucose on corynomycolate synthesis by some acellular preparations of corynebacteria (18Walker R.W. Promé J.C. Lacave C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 326: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Shimakata T. Tsubokura K. Kusaka T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 247: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and have led to the isolation of glucose and trehalose derivatives in the course of the synthesis of mycolic acids, suggesting a possible role of these compounds in the biosynthesis. Subsequently, trehalose 6-phosphate, but not trehalose, was also shown to stimulate corynomycolate synthesis from palmitate in the presence of ATP into trehalose monomycolate (20Shimakata T. Minatogawa Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been proposed that phosphorylated trehalose is the true activated form implicated in the early step of the synthesis of trehalose mycolates. Functional analysis of the different mycoloyltransferase genes has demonstrated that TDCM derives from TMCM (21Puech V. Bayan N. Salim K. Leblon G. Daffé M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1026-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22de Sousa-D'Auria Kacem R. Puech V. Tropis M. Leblon G. Houssin C. Daffé M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 224: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) since the inactivation of these genes results in the accumulation of TMCM with the concomitant decrease of TDCM; the inactivation of one of these genes, csp1 renamed cmytA (22de Sousa-D'Auria Kacem R. Puech V. Tropis M. Leblon G. Houssin C. Daffé M. FEMS Microbiol.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1026-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Expectedly, the purified mycoloytransferase from mycobacteria was shown to catalyze the conversion of trehalose monomycolate into trehalose dimycolate (15Woodruff P.J. Carlson B.L. Siridechadilok B.

In contrast, although the accumulation of TMCM correlates in mutants defective in the production of mycoloyltransferases with the decrease of cell wall-linked mycolates (21Puech V. Bayan N. Salim K.

Accordingly, further studies are needed to decipher the role of trehalose in Corynebacterineae. Interestingly, all the three biosynthetic routes leading to trehalose (Fig. 1) are found in both mycobacteria and corynebacteria (2De Smet K.A.L. Weston A. Brown I.N. Young D.B. Robertson B.D. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3Tzvetkov M. Klopprogge C. Zelder O. Liebl W.

In contrast to mycobacteria, where trehalose has been shown to be essential for bacterial growth, a targeted gene deletion approach was successful in generating the corynebacterial strains affected in all three pathways of trehalose biosynthesis and was thereby unable to synthesize the disaccharide (3Tzvetkov M. Klopprogge C. Zelder O. Liebl W. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1659-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 4Wolf A. Krämer R. Morbach S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To gain further insights into the role of trehalose in the physiology of Corynebacterineae, we investigated (i) the impact of trehalose deficiency on the lipid metabolism and cell envelope architecture of the triple mutant of Corynebacterium glutamicum (4Wolf A. Krämer R. Morbach S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), (ii) the structural requirements of sugars for the production of mycolate-containing glycoconjugates by the trehalose-deficient mutant, and (iii) the possible implication of trehalose 6-phosphate in the synthesis and traffic of mycolates by generating mutants affected in the OtsA/B pathway. Strains and Culture Conditions—The various strains affected in one or more pathways of trehalose biosynthesis used in the present study derived from the C. glutamicum ATCC13032. In addition to the strains described by Wolf et al. (4Wolf A. Krämer R. Morbach S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), new single and double mutants affected in otsB were constructed as indicated below and examined. Culture conditions were identical to those described by Wolf et al. (4Wolf A. Krämer R. Morbach S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To avoid a possible contamination of the culture medium with carbon sources other than sucrose, cells grown on Luria broth were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, and a portion (1/100) was inoculated on the minimum medium containing 4% sucrose as carbon source. A portion (1/100) of these precultures was re-inoculated in the culture medium containing 4% sucrose as the only carbon source. Cloning of otsA, otsB, treY, and treS and Construction of Strains Deleted in Trehalose Biosynthesis Genes—Cloning of the indicated genes and the construction of deletion strains was performed as described previously (4Wolf A. Krämer R. Morbach S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The otsB gene was deleted by the method of allelic replacement based on the selection of a chromosomal deletion by two recombination events. The flanking regions together with the otsB gene were amplified by PCR by the use of 5′-CGA TAA ACT TCC CGA TGA TTG CC and 5′-GGA ATT GGA AAC TTC CTT CCA CC as primers. The PCR fragment was cloned into the SmaI site of pUC18. The resulting plasmid was designated pUC18otsB. For the construction of a ΔotsB-deletion allele, an internal fragment of 0.15 bp was excised using the restriction endonucleases NcoI and DraIII, leading to pUC18ΔotsB. The otsB fragment was isolated after digestion with EcoRI and XbaI and ligated with the similarly treated vector pK19mobsacB (26Schäfer A. Tauch A. Jäger W. Kalinowski J. Thierbach G. Pühler A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was designated pK19mobsacBΔotsB. The deletion of otsB in the chromosome of 13032 (27Abe S. Takayama K. Kinoshita S. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1967; 13: 279-301Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and CglΔtreY (4Wolf A. Krämer R. Morbach S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) was carried out as recently described (4Wolf A. Krämer R. Morbach S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). All enzymes used for recombinant DNA techniques were purchased from NEB (Frankfurt, Germany) or Roche Applied Science. Oligonucleotides were obtained from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Sequence information on the C. glutamicum genome was generously provided by the Degussa AG (Hanau, Germany). Quantification of Cytosolic Trehalose and Trehalose 6-Phosphate—Cytosolic trehalose was quantified by gas chromatography (GC) as described previously (4Wolf A. Krämer R. Morbach S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), whereas the amount of trehalose 6-phosphate was determined by GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For quantifying the latter compound, 40 ml of exponentially growing cells with an optical density of 5 were harvested and washed once in 400 mm KPi buffer (pH 7.5). Subsequently, cells were sonicated in a methanol bath (2 ml of methanol, 70 °C, 20 min). After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected. To increase the amount of hydrophilic sugar phosphates, the pellet was extracted again with 2 ml of H2O. The samples were immediately centrifuged after suspension of the pellet. The aqueous supernatant was pooled with the methanol fraction, and 1 ml of CHCl3 was added. After a phase separation 1 ml of the methanol/water mixture was dried under N2 at 65 °C, and the putative sugar constituents were converted into methoximes (28Schwind H. Scharbert F. Schmidt R. Kattermann R. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1978; 16: 145-149PubMed Google Scholar) by adding 50 μl of methoxyamine/pyridine mixture (20 mg of methoxyamine/ml in pyridine). The derivatization was carried out at 30 °C for 90 min. Subsequently, methoximes were trifluoroacetylated by adding 80 μl of N-methyl-N-trimethysilyl-trifluoroacetamide, and the samples were incubated at 65 °C for 60 min. GC-MS was performed using a Finnigan Trace-GC/Trace-MS equipped with a J&W Scientific fused-silica column (30 m, 0.25 mm internal diameter, 0.25-mm film thickness) obtained from Agilent (Palo Alto, CA). The samples were applied by split injection (1:25)/PTV (70-280 °C, 14 °C/s). A non-linear temperature gradient from 70 to 76 °C (1 °C/min) and 76 to 325 °C (6 °C/min) was used followed by an isothermic plateau (10 min). Signals that could not be properly distinguished from the base line (signal-to-noise ratio <10) were classified as non-detectable. Uptake of Glucose, Trehalose, or Betaine—For the uptake experiments cultures of the wild type and CglΔotsAΔtreSΔtreY were grown overnight in CgXII medium with 4% sucrose as the carbon source. Cells were harvested and washed once in KPi buffer (50 mm KPi (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaCl). Subsequently, they were suspended in the same buffer and kept on ice. Cells with an optical density of 3 were preheated for 3 min at 30 °C before the uptake measurement was started by the addition of either 500 μm [14C]glucose (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany, 100 μCi/ml) or 50 μm [14C]trehalose (Trenzyme GmbH, Konstanz, Germany, 1 mCi/ml), i.e. final concentrations of 0.025 and 0.050 μCi/ml of labeled glucose and trehalose, respectively, in the assays. In the case of the betaine uptake measurements osmotic shock was performed by the addition of 600 mm NaCl to activate the betaine uptake carriers of C. glutamicum. Cells were preheated for 3 min before the uptake reaction was started by the addition of 250 μm [14C]betaine. At different time intervals 100-μl samples were taken and filtered rapidly through 0.45-μm glass fiber filters (GF, Schleicher & Schuell GmbH). The filters were washed twice with 2.5 ml of 100 mm LiCl solution, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. To determine the location of the label, i.e. cell wall fraction or cytosol, the assay conditions were changed as follows. Cells were prepared and used in the transport assay as described above. After an incubation time of 10 min with 50 μm [14C]trehalose or 250 μm [14C]betaine, 100 μl of cells were filtered on glass fiber filters. They were partly permeabilized by the addition of 1 ml of 50 mm KPi buffer containing 0.1% N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to release the cytosol without destroying the cell envelope. After 1 min the CTAB solution was filtered, and the remaining cell envelopes were washed twice with 2.5 ml of 100 mm LiCl solution. In a parallel approach the filtered cells were incubated for 1 min in 50 mm KPi buffer instead of the CTAB solution before being washed with LiCl. The radioactivity determined in these control cells represented the total amount of the accumulated substrate present after 10 min of incubation with [14C]trehalose or [14C]betaine. The radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Isolation, Fractionation, and Analysis of Lipids—Lipids were obtained and analyzed as previously described (21Puech V. Bayan N. Salim K. Leblon G. Daffé M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1026-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were extracted from wet cells for 16 h with CHCl3/CH3OH (1:2, v/v) at room temperature with continuous stirring; the bacterial residues were reextracted three times with CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, v/v) and then CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v); the organic phases were pooled and concentrated. The crude lipid extracts were washed, evaporated to dryness, and partitioned between water and chloroform (1:1, v/v); the organic phase was washed with distilled water, evaporated to dryness to yield the crude lipid extracts from each strain, and comparatively examined by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel-coated plates (G-60, 0.25-mm thickness, Merck) developed with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (30:8:1 or 65: 25:4, by volume). Detection of all classes of lipids was done by spraying the TLC plates with either rhodamine B or 20% H2SO4 in water, the latter followed by heating at 110 °C; glycolipids were revealed by spraying plates with 0.2% anthrone (w/v) in concentrated H2SO4 followed by heating at 110 °C. The Dittmer-Lester reagent (29Dittmer J.C.F. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 126-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for visualizing phosphorus-containing lipids. Purification of Glycolipids—The mycolate-containing glycolipids, i.e. glucose, maltose, and maltotriose mycolates, were separated from phospholipids by anion exchange chromatography using QMA-silica Sep-Pak Cartridges (Waters). The columns were eluted with a gradient of CHCl3/CH3OH. Glucose, maltose, and maltotriose mycolates were eluted from the columns, respectively, with 20, 30, and 40% CH3OH in CHCl3 (v/v). Phospholipids were retained on the columns and were eluted with 2% NH4OH in 0.01 m ammonium acetate in CHCl3/CH3OH (4:1 v/v). Quantification of Corynomycolic Acids—The quantification of corynomycolic acids was performed twice in independent experiments as follows. Delipidated cells (300 mg dry weight) and lipid extracts (10 mg) of the various strains were dried under vacuum and saponified (30Daffé M. Lanéelle M.-A. Asselineau C. Lévy-Frébault V. David H.L. Ann. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 241-256Google Scholar); the saponified products were acidified with 20% H2SO4. The resulting fatty acids were extracted with diethyl ether, converted to methyl esters with diazomethane, dried under vacuum, and weighed. Portions of fatty acid methyl esters from delipidated cells and extractable lipids (1-2 mg) were treated with trimethylsilyl reagents (31Sweeley C.C. Bentley R. Makita M. Wells W.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2497-2507Crossref Scopus (2150) Google Scholar) to derivatize hydroxylated components of the mixtures, i.e. corynomycolates, and analyzed by GC. The detector response for the various classes of fatty acid methyl esters was determined using authentic samples of C16:0 and C32:0 corynomycolate methyl esters. Identification of non-hydroxylated fatty acid methyl esters and corynomycolate derivatives was achieved by GC-MS. GC of fatty acid methyl esters was performed using a Hewlett Packard HP4890A equipped with a fused silica capillary column (25-m length × 0.22 mm inner diameter) containing WCOT OV-1 (0.3-mm film thickness, spiral). A temperature gradient of 100-300 °C at 5 °C min-1 followed by a 5-min isotherm plateau at 300 °C was used. GC-MS analysis was conducted on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph connected to a Hewlett-Packard 5989A mass spectrometer. Samples were injected in the splitless mode. The column was a 12-m HP-1. A temperature gradient of 100-290 °C (8 °C min-1) was used. Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis of glycolipids was performed as previously described (32Laval F. Lanéelle M.-A. Deon C. Montsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF spectra were acquired on a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems) equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser emitting at 337 nm and were analyzed in the Reflectron mode using an extraction delay time set at 100 ns and an accelerating voltage operating in negative ion mode of 20 kV. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy—Spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer equipped with an Aspect X32 computer and a TXI probe. Sample (1 mg) was dissolved in CDCl3 (99.96% purity)/CD3OD (99.8% purity) (Spin et Techniques, Paris, France), 1:1 (v/v), and analyzed in a 200 × 5-mm NMR tubes at 25 °C. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm downfield from the signal for chloroform (δH/tetramethylsilane 7.27). The one-dimensional proton (1H) spectrum was measured using a 45° tipping angle for the pulse and 3 s as a recycle delay between each of the 1000 acquisitions. The spectral width of 7500 Hz was collected in 16,000 complex points that were multiplied by a sine bell (ssb = 2) before processing to 32,000 real points in the frequency domain. After Fourier transformation, the spectra were base line-corrected with a fourth order polynomial function. All two-dimensional NMR data sets were recorded without sample spinning, and data were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using the time proportional phase increment method (33Marion D. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3514) Google Scholar) unless otherwise indicated. The spectral width was 4006 Hz in each dimension, and the relaxation delay was 3 s. 450 spectra of 4096 data points with 32 scans per t1 increment were recorded. For processing, a sine bell shift (11b = 2) was applied in both dimensions, and the data matrix was expanded to 4000 × 1000 data points. A two-dimensional correlated spectroscopy (COSY) spectrum was obtained with standard Bruker pulse sequence. A two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy spectrum was recorded using a MLEV-17 mixing sequence of 160 ms (34Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2159969939,"Human Cripto-1 (CR-1) is overexpressed in approximately 80% of human breast, colon and lung carcinomas. Mouse Cr-1 upregulation is also observed in a number of transgenic (Tg) mouse mammary tumors. To determine whether CR-1 can alter mammary gland development and/or may contribute to tumorigenesis in vivo, we have generated Tg mouse lines that express human CR-1 under the transcriptional control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). Stable Tg MMTV/CR-1 FVB/N lines expressing different levels of CR-1 were analysed. Virgin female MMTV/CR-1 Tg mice exhibited enhanced ductal branching, dilated ducts, intraductal hyperplasia, hyperplastic alveolar nodules and condensation of the mammary stroma. Virgin aged MMTV/CR-1 Tg mice also possessed persistent end buds. In aged multiparous MMTV/CR-1 mice, the hyperplastic phenotype was most pronounced with multifocal hyperplasias. In the highest CR-1-expressing subline, G4, 38% (12/31) of the multiparous animals aged 12-20 months developed hyperplasias and approximately 33% (11/31) developed papillary adenocarcinomas. The long latency period suggests that additional genetic alterations are required to facilitate mammary tumor formation in conjunction with CR-1. This is the first in vivo study that shows hyperplasia and tumor growth in CR-1-overexpressing animals."

Transcription of the heavy (H) strand of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) involvestwo overlapping transcription units(1Montoya J. Christianson T. Levens D. Rabinowitz M. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

One unit starts directlyupstream of the tRNAPhe gene and spans the tRNAPhe, 12 SrRNA, 16 S rRNA, and tRNAVal genes (initiation site H1). The othertranscription unit starts ∼100 bp further downstream (initiation site H2)at the boundary between the tRNAPhe and 12 S rRNA genes andproduces a single polycistronic RNA that encompasses almost the entire lengthof the heavy strand. The ribosomal transcription unit is transcribed at a muchhigher rate compared with the other transcription unit, and control of itsexpression is exerted at both the initiation and termination levels(3Gelfand R.

A central role in thecontrol of termination has been attributed to the mitochondrial transcriptiontermination factor(mTERF), 1The abbreviations used are: mTERF, mitochondrial transcription factor;Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DTT,dithiothreitol; HSP, heavy strand promoter; IEF, isoelectric focusing; LSP,light strand promoter; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization;Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PVDF, polyvinylidenefluoride; TOF, time-of-flight. a 39-kDaprotein that binds to a 28-base pair region of mtDNA located within thetRNALeu(UUR) gene at a position immediately downstream of the 16 SrRNA gene (5Kruse B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8123-8130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous characterizationof recombinant mTERF expressed in bacteria or in coupled in vitrotranscription and translation systems produced proteins with sequence-specificDNA binding activity but no transcription termination activity(7Fernandez-Silva P. Martinez-Azorin F. Micol V. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1066-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These observationsindicated that mTERF requires other cellular factors and/or aposttranslational modification to efficiently terminate transcription.Furthermore, a recent study of recombinant rat mTERF suggested thatphosphorylation of four amino acids is required for transcription terminationactivity (8Prieto-Martin A. Montoya J. Martinez-Azorin F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2059-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Alternatively,mTERF activity may be regulated by its polymerization state, because nativehuman mTERF is present in HeLa mitochondrial lysates in two forms, an activemonomer and an inactive polymer(9Asin-Cayuela J. Helm M. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15670-15677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Native mTERF has a hightendency to polymerize, thereby explaining a dramatic loss of activity duringpurification. We here characterize mTERF-dependent transcription termination in a highlypurified and recombinant in vitro system for mitochondrialtranscription (10Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat.Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Previousinvestigations of mTERF function were performed in partially purifiedmitochondrial extracts, and the possible contribution of yet to be identifiedcellular factors was therefore difficult to address. Because bacterialexpression in the past had failed to generate an active human protein, weexpressed recombinant mTERF in insect cells using the baculovirus system. Theadvantages of this eukaryotic expression system are the abundant expression ofrecombinant protein combined with the possibility of co-translational andposttranslational modifications, including N-glycosylation andphosphorylation(11Davidson D.J.

ThemTERF protein does not require other cellular factors for its terminationactivity, and a comprehensive structural analysis revealed that mTERF is astable monomer in solution that actively promotes transcription termination inits non-phosphorylated form. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human mTERF—Thegene encoding mTERF (GenBank™ accession number BC000965) was amplifiedfrom cDNA by PCR and cloned it into the pBacPAK9 (Clontech). During thecloning the leader peptide was deleted, a Met residue was added to the Nterminus, and a His6 tag was added to the C terminus.Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, recombinant formTERF, was prepared as described in the BacPak manual (Clontech). For proteinexpression, Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells grown in suspensionwere infected with the virus (5–10 plaque-forming unit/cell) andincubated for 60–72 h at 27 °C in SF 900 II medium withl-glutamine (Invitrogen) complemented with 2% fetal calf serum and1% PEST antibiotic mixture (Invitrogen). Cells were then pelleted down, washedin phosphate-buffered saline, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at–80 °C. The recombinant mTERF protein was purified by Ni2+-NTAchromatography. The frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of lysisbuffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2μm pepstatin, 0.6 μm leupeptin, and 2mm benzamidine) and incubated on ice for 20 min. The cells werehomogenized with 15 strokes of a tight-fitting pestle in a Dounce homogenizer,and the homogenate was brought to 15 ml with lysis buffer. After the additionof 3 ml of 5 m NaCl, the solution was incubated at 4 °C for 45min in an orbital shaker. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugationat 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatantcontaining mTERF was passed 10 times through an 18-gauge needle to shear DNA.One volume of buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mNaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 2 μm pepstatin, 0.6 μm leupeptin, and 2mm benzamidine) supplemented with 20 mm imidazole wasadded to the supernatant. The lysate was mixed with Ni2+-NTASuperflow resin (Qiagen) previously equilibrated in buffer A supplemented with10 mm imidazole (1 ml Ni2+-NTA resin per 400 ml of cellculture). The mixture of supernatant and resin was incubated at 4 °C for 1h in an orbital shaker, and the beads were then collected by centrifugationfor 10 min at 1,500 × g. After removal of the supernatant(flow-through), 10 resin volumes of buffer A supplemented with 40mm imidazole were added to the resin. After 15 min of incubation,the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 × g, afterwhich the supernatant (wash) was removed and the resin transferred into aPoly-Prep® chromatography column (Bio-Rad). The resin wasincubated for 15 min with 12 ml of elution buffer (buffer A supplemented with250 mm imidazole), and the mTERF protein was subsequently eluted in1-ml fractions that were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at–80 °C. Gel Filtration Chromatography—The gel filtrationchromatography of Ni2+-NTA-purified mTERF was performed asdescribed (9Asin-Cayuela J. Helm M. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15670-15677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with thefollowing modifications. The column (Superose® 12; AmershamBiosciences) was equilibrated in running buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 500mm KCl) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Following the instructions ofthe column's manufacturer, a calibration curve was prepared with blue dextran2000, ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), ovalbumin (47 kDa), and insulin(5.8 kDa), all from Amersham Biosciences (except for insulin from Sigma,catalog number I9278). The protein samples were dialyzed against gelfiltration running buffer prior to injection. The injected sample volume was 1ml, the flow rate was 0.4 ml/min at 4 °C, and 0.2-ml fractions werecollected. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.The mTERF-containing fractions were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and storedat –80 °C. The mTERF protein concentration was determined withBradford reagent (Sigma). In Vitro Transcription Assay—The termination activity ofmTERF was tested in a fully reconstituted in vitro transcriptionsystem described previously(10Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat.Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Four different DNAtemplates were used. To construct pHSP1, a DNA fragment corresponding to bp499–742 of human mtDNA (containing both HSPs) was cloned into pUC18. Toconstruct pHSP1-TERM, a fragment corresponding to bp 3063–3594 of humanmtDNA (containing the binding site for mTERF, between nucleotides 3229 and3256) was cloned immediately downstream of HSP1 fragment in pHSP1. For thegeneration of pHSP1-MRET, the human mtDNA 3063–3595 fragment was clonedinto the same position as in pHSP1-TERM, but in the reverse orientation. ForpLSP-MRET, a LSP-containing fragment spanning bp 477–1 of human mtDNAwas cloned into pUC18 followed by the mTERF-binding site fragment(3594–3063) immediately downstream. After linearization (pHSP1-TERM andpHSP1-MRET with BmrI and pLSP-MRET with EcoRI), the plasmid constructs wereused to measure promoter-specific transcription in a runoff assay as describedpreviously (10Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat.Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The proteinconcentrations used in the in vitro transcription experiments were250 fmol of His-POLRMT, 500 fmol of TFB2M, 2.5 pmol of TFAM and, whenindicated, variable amounts of mTERF or an equivalent volume of buffer. For the pulse-chase experiment, pHSP-TERM was used as template, and thein vitro transcription reaction was scaled up to a final volume of100 μl. The in vitro transcription reaction contained 0.3μm [α-32P]UTP (100 μCi), and after 5 min ofincubation at 32 °C cold UTP was added to a final concentration of 2.5mm. Samples (25 μl) were collected 0, 30, 60, and 90 min afterthe addition of UTP, and the transcription products were analyzed as describedpreviously (10Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat.Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Phosphoprotein Blot Staining—The indicated amounts ofrecombinant mTERF, ovalbumin, and bovine serum albumin were separated byelectrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins wereblotted to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The PVDF membrane wassubsequently stained with the Pro-Q® Diamond phosphoproteinblot stain kit (Molecular Probes) following the instructions of themanufacturer. The stained bands were revealed by direct UV lighttransillumination and photographed with a charge-coupled device camera, modelICD-42E (Ikegami Tsushinki Co.) Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—The mTERF protein wasseparated by isoelectric focusing (IEF) in the first dimension and by SDS-PAGEin the second dimension. For the analysis an mTERF protein purified by gelfiltration over a Superose® 12 column and dialyzed against arunning buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1mm DTT, and 100 mm KCl) was used. IEF was carried outessentially according to the instructions of the manufacturer (AmershamBiosciences). The IEF strips (Immobiline™ DryStrip pH 7–11 NL, 7cm) were rehydrated overnight in 200 μl of DeStreak®rehydration solution containing 1% of IPG pH 7–11 NL buffer. Twentymicroliters of mTERF (1pmol/μl) were mixed with 69.5 μl of UTC buffer (7m urea, 2 m thiourea, and 4% Chaps), 10 μl of DTT (1m), and 0.5 μl of IPG pH 7–11 NL buffer, and the samplewas loaded onto the IEF strip anodically in a sample cup. The IEF wasperformed on an IPGphor (Amersham Biosciences) IEF unit at 20 °C with a50-μA current per strip using the following schedule: step 1 (step andhold), 300 V and 200 V-h; step 2 (gradient), 1000 V and 704 V-h; step 3(gradient), 5000 V and 4500 V-h; and step 4 (step and hold), 5000 V and 3000V-h. For the alkaline phosphatase treatment experiments, 20 μl of mTERFprotein (1 pmol/μl) were incubated with 2.6 μl of 10×dephosphorylation buffer (Roche Applied Science) and 4 μl of calf intestinealkaline phosphatase (1 unit/μl; Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 30min. As a negative control, the calf intestine alkaline phosphatase wasreplaced with 4 μl of H2O. After incubation, the samples wereimmediately diluted in UTC buffer, DTT, and IPG buffer and loaded onto the IEFstrip as described above. After IEF, the strips were incubated for 15 min at room temperature underconstant shaking in 10 ml of equilibration solution (50 mm Tris-HCl(pH 8.8), 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.002% bromphenolblue) supplemented with 10 mg/ml DTT, followed by a second incubation for 15min in equilibration solution supplemented with 25 mg/ml iodoacetamide. Thestrip was next placed on top of a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide mini-gel that hadbeen covered with a solution of 0.5% agarose and 0.002% bromphenol blue in SDSrunning buffer. After electrophoresis, the polyacrylamide gels were stainedwith Coomassie Blue or silver as indicated. Precision Plus protein standardplug (Bio-Rad) was used as a molecular mass marker. Protein Analysis with Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assistedlaser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) analysis of in-geldigested proteins was carried out with an Ultraflex II TOF/TOF massspectrometer from Bruker (Billerica, MA). The samples were prepared asdescribed previously (15Spahr H. Samuelsen C.O. Baraznenok V. Ernest I. Huylebroeck D. Remacle J.E. Samuelsson T. Kieselbach T. Holmberg S. Gustafsson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Typically, 300 shots werecombined for one spectrum. Data base searches were done with the MS BIOTOOLSsoftware from Bruker by using the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science,London, UK). For electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, 20 μl (1.6 μg) ofNi2+-NTA-purified mTERF was loaded on a reversed phase trappingcolumn (Poros R1; Applied Biosystems) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroaceticacid. The column was washed for 2 min with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flowrate of 200 μl/min, and mTERF was subsequently eluted with a buffercontaining 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 20μl/min. The protein samples were analyzed with an electrosprayionization-quadrupole TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) using thestandard conditions for the electrospray interphase. Mass calibration wasperformed with 100 pmol of apomyoglobin. Deconvolution of the spectra was donewith the software supplied with the quadrupole TOF mass spectrometer. The S.D.of the estimated masses were calculated as described. Recombinant mTERF Efficiently Terminates Transcription in a FullyReconstituted in Vitro Transcription System—Previous studies havesuggested that mTERF activity is regulated by phosphorylation or proteinpolymerization. We wanted to investigate the requirements for mTERF activityin vitro and therefore generated a recombinant baculovirus encodingthe mature form of the human mTERF protein fused in-frame with acarboxyl-terminal His6-tag. Recombinant mTERF was expressed ininsect cells and purified by Ni2+-NTA chromatography and gelfiltration to near homogeneity (Fig.1A). We investigated mTERF-dependent transcriptiontermination in an in vitro system for mitochondrial transcriptionreconstituted with highly purified and recombinant transcription factor A(TFAM), RNA polymerase (POLRMT), and transcription factor B2 (TFB2M). For ouranalysis, we used linearized DNA templates containing HSP followed by themTERF-binding site in the forward or reverse orientation. We ran thetranscription experiments in parallel but on two different gels to allow fordirect comparisons of the transcription termination activity on the forwardand reverse templates (Fig. 1, Band C). In the absence of mTERF, the mitochondrialtranscription machinery synthesized the expected full-length transcripts (seelanes 2 in Fig. 1, B andC). We added increasing amounts of mTERF and observed theappearance of an additional transcript with the expected size for an RNAtranscript terminated at the mTERF-binding site. The recombinant mTERF proteinwas highly active, and we observed termination already at a molar ratio ofabout 1:20 of mTERF to DNA template (see lane 4 inFig. 1, B andC). The mTERF termination activity was dependent of therelative orientation of the mTERF-binding site. When the mTERF-binding sitewas in the same orientation as the HSP (pHSP-TERM), we failed to observecomplete termination even at the highest mTERF concentrations(Fig. 1B). If weinstead placed the mTERF-binding site in the reverse orientation (pHSP-MRET),we observed almost complete termination of transcription already at a molarratio of about 1:1 of mTERF to DNA template(Fig. 1C, lane6). The mTERF protein has been shown previously to stimulate HSP transcription(5Kruse B. Narasimhan N. Attardi G. Cell. 1989; 58: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,9Asin-Cayuela J. Helm M. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15670-15677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The stimulation is onlyobserved when mTERF binds to its cognate binding site and both the promoterand the mTERF-binding site are in the same orientation. In our recombinantin vitro transcription system, we noted that the overall level oftranscription was higher on the pHSP-TERM template(Fig. 1B) relative tothe pHSP-MRET template. We could not, however, detect specific stimulation oftranscription upon the addition of increasing amounts of mTERF to either ofthese two templates (Fig. 1, B andC). To further characterize the mTERF protein, we analyzed transcriptiontermination with the LSP followed by the mTERF-binding site in the reverseorientation (that is, as in vivo). We observed effective and completemTERF-dependent termination but no stimulation of the overall levels oftranscription (Fig.1D). The observed results were essentially identical towhat had been observed with the pHSP-MRET template(Fig. 1C). Finally, we wanted to see if the shorter transcript observed inFig. 1B was derivedfrom true termination of transcription and not only polymerase pausing. Todistinguish between these two possibilities, we performed a transcriptionreaction with the pHSP-TERM template. After a 5-min pulse of radiolabeled UTP,we added an 8000-fold excess of cold UTP and followed the transcriptionreaction for 90 min. If mTERF caused RNA polymerase pausing, we expected thatthe ratio of terminated-to-runoff transcripts would decrease progressivelywith time due to the resumption of elongation by the stalled enzyme. We foundthat the shorter transcript persisted for up to 90 min of incubation withoutany obvious change in the ratio between terminated and runoff transcripts(Fig. 1D). Weconcluded that the shorter transcripts formed in the presence of mTERF arelikely due to true transcription termination and not to POLRMT RNA polymerasepausing. Recombinant mTERF Is a Monomer—The mTERF protein purifiedfrom mammalian cells has been shown previously to exist in two distinctstates, as an active monomer and as an inactive polymer. We determined themultimeric state of our recombinant mTERF with gel filtration chromatographyusing Superose® 12. The mTERF protein eluted as one single peakwith an apparent molecular mass of ∼40 kDa, closely corresponding to thetheoretical mass of the protein (Fig.2A). Because the gel filtration analysis had beenperformed at high salt concentrations (0.5 m KCl) that mightdisrupt a potential polymer, we pooled peak fractions from the gel filtration,dialyzed the material against a buffer with 0.15 m KCl, andrepeated the gel filtration analysis. Also under these conditions the mTERFprotein eluted as a monomer (Fig.2B). We concluded that our recombinant mTERF remains inthe active monomeric conformation and does not polymerize to the same extentas demonstrated previously for native mTERF. The Recombinant mTERF Protein Is Not Phosphorylated—Previous reports of rat mTERF and its regulation by phosphorylation promptedus to investigate the existence of phosphorylated amino residues in our activemTERF. We first used a small molecule organic fluorophore (Pro-Q Diamond dye)that binds directly to the phosphate moiety and has been reported to detect aslittle as 2 ng of phosphoproteins directly on PVDF membranes(16Goodman T. Schulenberg B. Steinberg T.H. Patton W.F. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 2533-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We separated ourpurified mTERF (from fraction 69 in Fig.2B) on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel alongside equal amountsof ovalbumin (containing two phosphorylated sites and used as a positivecontrol) and bovine serum albumin (used as a negative control). After transferto a PVDF membrane, we stained the proteins with Pro-Q Diamond dye(Fig. 3A). We observedno staining of our mTERF, even when 3 μg of it was loaded, but obtained astrong signal with 1 μg of ovalbumin. Phosphoprotein staining is a sensitive technique, and comparisons betweenautoradiography and Pro-Q Diamond staining on the same 32P-labeledprotein samples have revealed very small differences(16Goodman T. Schulenberg B. Steinberg T.H. Patton W.F. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 2533-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We did, however, want toverify our findings with unrelated techniques and therefore investigated themigration pattern of mTERF during two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. For thefirst dimension IEF we used DeStreak® Rehydration Solution(Amersham Biosciences) instead of DTT in the running buffer to avoidstreaking, a common artifact caused by oxidation of basic proteins. In thesecond dimension we separated the mTERF protein with SDS-PAGE and stained withCoomassie Blue (Fig.3A). Under these conditions, we detected a major singlespot (spot I) that migrated in excellent agreement with the theoreticalisoelectric point (pH 9.26) and molecular mass of mTERF. Two minor spots(spots II and III) could be observed directly above and below the major spot.Another minor spot (spot IV) was also visible. All spots were identified asmTERF by MALDI-TOF analysis. The mTERF protein is known to run as a doublet inSDS-PAGE gels, presumably due to slight conformational changes, which mightexplain the appearance of extra spots immediately above or below the majorspot. We could not detect any spots to the left, the expected location for aphosphorylated form of mTERF. In a second set of experiments, we analyzedmTERF after alkaline phosphatase treatment(Fig. 3B, bottomsection). As a control, we exposed the mTERF protein sample to identicalconditions but without adding the alkaline phosphatase(Fig. 3B, topsection). In these two experiments we observed one major spot at exactlythe same position. The presence of mTERF in the spots was confirmed byMALDI-TOF mass fingerprint analysis. Therefore, alkaline phosphatase treatmentdid not alter the migration pattern of mTERF, arguing against the presence ofphosphorylated residues. In a final effort to identify phosphorylated amino acid residues, weanalyzed mTERF by electrospray mass spectrometry, a technique that allows forthe determination of the exact molecular mass of a peptide with high accuracy.From the multiple charged protein ions obtained(Fig. 4A), themolecular mass of the protein was determined by deconvolution(Fig. 4, B andC). The determined mass for the dominant species was40233.2 (S.D. ± 0.6 Da), which coincides precisely with that predictedfor the mTERF molecule (40190.5 Da) with an N-terminal acetylation (42.7 Da).Two additional peaks of 40256.1 and 40278.0 Da fit nicely with sodium adductsof the major peak. Our electrospray mass spectrometry analysis also revealed aminor protein peak at 40308.8 (S.D. ± 0.9 Da) with a putative sodiumadduct of 40352.4 Da. The difference in mass of 76.6 Da relative to the majormTERF peak at 40233.2 Da is consistent with a disulfide adduct between theprotein and β-mercaptoethanol (expected mass increase of 76.0 Da) andefficiently rules out phosphorylation, which should cause an 80-Da increase inmass. We used here a highly purified and recombinant transcription system tocharacterize recombinant human mTERF in vitro. Our definedexperimental system minimized the interference of contaminants and led us toconclude that mTERF does not require any additional factors present inmitochondrial extracts to actively promote transcription termination. Asobserved previously with the native protein, recombinant mTERF terminatestranscription bidirectionally of both HSP- and LSP-initiated transcripts(17Shang J. Clayton D.A. J.Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29112-29120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified mTERFprotein is highly active, and we can detect transcription termination alreadyat protein concentrations well below the concentration of the DNA template. Weobserved near complete transcription termination at about equimolarconcentrations of mTERF relative to that of the DNA template. Another relevantconclusion from our study is that non-phosphorylated mTERF is active intranscription termination. We use phosphostaining, two-dimensionalelectrophoresis, and electrospray mass spectrometry analysis to demonstratethat the active mTERF protein is not phosphorylated. It could, of course, beargued that a small, non-detectable fraction of mTERF is modified and thatthis fraction is responsible for the termination activity observed invitro. But because the mTERF protein promotes almost completetranscription termination at a molar ratio slightly above 1:1 of protein toDNA template, this possibility appears extremely unlikely. Even if human mTERF does not require phosphorylation to terminatetranscription in vitro, we do not want to exclude a role forposttranslational modifications in the regulation of mTERF activity invivo. Specific modifications of mTERF could e.g. promotepolymerization and inactivate the protein or influence the DNA bindingsequence specificity. Previous studies of the native mTERF protein have shownthat the protein does not only terminate transcription at the mTERF-bindingsite but also stimulates transcription initiation at HSP(5Kruse B. Narasimhan N. Attardi G. Cell. 1989; 58: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,9Asin-Cayuela J. Helm M. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15670-15677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The stimulation was onlyobserved when mTERF binds to its cognate-binding site and both the promoterand the mTERF-binding site are in the same orientation. We failed to observemTERF-specific stimulation of transcription in our reconstituted invitro transcription, which could indicate a difference between the nativeand recombinant protein in this respect. Mitochondrial transcription termination factors have been isolated andcharacterized from many different eukaryotes, including sea urchin(18Loguercio Polosa P. Roberti M. Musicco C. Gadaleta M.N.

Relatively few studies have addressed the developmental roles of these cofactors in vivo. By using the total dependence of amphibian metamorphosis on thyroid hormone (T3) as a model, we have investigated the role of steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC3) in gene activation by thyroid hormone receptor (TR) in vivo. First, expression analysis showed that SRC3 was expressed in all tadpole organs analyzed. In addition, during natural as well as T3-induced metamorphosis, SRC3 was up-regulated in both the tail and intestine, two organs that undergo extensive transformations during metamorphosis and the focus of the current study. We then performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to investigate whether SRC3 is recruited to endogenous T3 target genes in vivo in developing tadpoles. Surprisingly, we found that SRC3 was recruited in a gene- and tissue-dependent manner to target genes by TR, both upon T3 treatment of premetamorphic tadpoles and during natural metamorphosis. In particular, in the tail, SRC3 was not recruited in a T3-dependent manner to the target TRβA promoter, suggesting either no recruitment or constitutive association. Finally, by using transgenic tadpoles expressing a dominant negative SRC3 (F-dnSRC3), we demonstrated that F-dnSRC3 was recruited in a T3-dependent manner in both the intestine and tail, blocking the recruitment of endogenous coactivators and histone acetylation. These results suggest that SRC3 is utilized in a gene- and tissue-specific manner by TR during development.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 4Tata J.R. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 5Atkinson B.G. Dev. Genet. 1994; 15: 313-319Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and offers a unique opportunity to study the role of cofactors in nuclear receptor function in vertebrate development. A major advantage of this model is that all tissues/organs require T3 despite undergoing vastly different transformations during metamorphosis (2Shi Y.-B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 43Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. Physiology of the Amphibia. Academic Press, New York1976: 467-599Crossref Google Scholar). These changes range from the development of adult organs de novo from undifferentiated stem cells to the regression of larval-specific organs such as the gills and tail and occur at developmentally distinct stages. All these changes are believed to be due to gene regulation by T3 through TR (44Buchholz D.R. Tomita A. Fu L. Paul B.D. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9026-9037Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and can be easily manipulated by blocking the synthesis of endogenous T3 or adding physiological concentrations of T3 to the tadpole rearing water. We have shown earlier that the mRNAs of TR interacting cofactors, SRC2, SRC3, and p300, are expressed during metamorphosis, among which SRC3 is up-regulated during both natural and T3-induced metamorphosis, supporting a role for this coactivator (45Paul B.D. Shi Y.-B. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that SRC3 is also up-regulated at the protein level during natural as well as T3-induced metamorphosis. More importantly, by using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay on wild type and transgenic animals, we demonstrated that SRC3 is recruited to T3-responsive genes in developing animals in a tissue- and gene-dependent manner during both natural and T3-induced metamorphosis, implicating that SRC3 utilization by TR is affected by tissue and promoter context. Animals and Treatment—Wild type tadpoles of the African clawed toad Xenopus laevis were obtained from Xenopus I. Inc. (Dexter, MI), and developmental stages were determined according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (46Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis. 1st Ed. North Holland Publishing, Amsterdam1956Google Scholar). Stage 54 premetamorphic tadpoles at a density of two tadpoles per liter of deionized water were treated with the indicated amount of T3 for 2–3 days. The concentrations of T3 used were according to published protocols. In the experiments conducted, varying the T3 concentration between 10 and 50 nm did not affect the conclusions. Transgenic tadpoles were generated as described (47Paul B.D. Fu L. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)—RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's recommendations. RT-PCRs were carried out using the Superscript One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). The expression of the ribosomal protein L8 (rpl8) was used as an internal control (48Shi Y.-B. Liang V. C.-T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The sequences of the primers used were (5′-3′): CGTGGTGCTCCTCTTGCCAAG and GACGACCAGTACGACGAGCAG for rpl8 (48Shi Y.-B. Liang V. C.-T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), CACTTAGCAACAGGGATCAGC and CTTGTCCCAGTAGCAATCATC for TH/bZIP (49Furlow J.D. Brown D.D. Mol.

Biol. 1995; 167: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). PCR was also done on RNA samples without reverse transcription as a control for genomic DNA contamination (data not shown). 0.5 μg of total RNA was used in a 25-μl reaction and with the following reaction conditions: 42 °C for 30 min for the RT reaction, followed by 21–25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s. The resulting products were analyzed on an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Preparation of Tadpole Tissues for Western Blot Analysis—Tadpoles were sacrificed by decapitation on ice. The dissected organs were sliced into small pieces and homogenized in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics Corp.). The lysate was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 5 min, and the protein in the supernatant was quantitated by Bradford's assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were loaded on an 8–16% Tris-glycine gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analysis. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—ChIP assay with tissues from tadpoles was performed as described previously (54Sachs L.M. Shi Y.-B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13138-13143Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 55Damjanovski S. Sachs L.M. Shi Y.-B. Baniahmad A. Methods in Molecular Biology: Thyroid Hormone Receptors. 202. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 153-176Google Scholar) with minor modifications (56Tomita A. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used in the assay: anti-Xenopus TR (57Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18479-18483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), anti-acetylated histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma), and anti-Xenopus SRC3 (47Paul B.D. Fu L. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of dnSRC3 was carried out using anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma). Preclearing for the anti-FLAG antibody was done using protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After reverse cross-linking, DNA was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Quantitative PCR was carried out with ChIP DNA sample in duplicate on an ABI 7000 (Applied Biosystems) using promoter-specific primers and FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein)-labeled Taq-man probes (Applied Biosystems). To perform relative quantitation, six 3-fold serial dilutions from a large batch of ChIP input DNA prepared from intestines prepared especially for the purpose of serving as standards were used for the quantification of the experimental samples. The calculated standard curves ranged in slope from -3.30 to -3.50, where theoretical amplification has a slope of -3.32. Also included was a no template control where double distilled water was added instead of sample DNA as a control for PCR product contamination. Results from the experimental samples were within the range of the standard curve. The primers used for conventional and quantitative PCR were reported previously (44Buchholz D.R. Tomita A. Fu L. Paul B.D. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9026-9037Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 56Tomita A. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell.

Expression and T3 Regulation of SRC3 in Developing Animals—We studied the expression of SRC3 using RT-PCR in different organs of X. laevis tadpoles. SRC3 was expressed in all organs analyzed, including the intestine, heart, liver, fore limb, hind limb, brain, and tail, with a higher level of expression in the brain (Fig. 1A). We next studied the expression of SRC3 protein during T3-induced metamorphosis in the tail and intestine, two organs that undergo dramatic changes during development (2Shi Y.-B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 43Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. Physiology of the Amphibia.

Metamorphosis: Post-embryonic Reprogramming of Gene Expression in Amphibian and Insect Cells. Academic Press, New York1996: 508-538Google Scholar). X. laevis tadpoles at stage 54 (46Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis. 1st Ed. North Holland Publishing, Amsterdam1956Google Scholar) were treated with T3, which is known to induce the expression of T3-response genes in these organs and initiate metamorphosis (2Shi Y.-B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 43Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. Physiology of the Amphibia. Academic Press, New York1976: 467-599Crossref Google Scholar). The tail and intestine of these animals were dissected out and subjected to Western blotting using anti-SRC3 antibodies to detect the expression of the SRC3 protein. In parallel, total RNA isolated from the two organs was analyzed by RT-PCR to check the expression of the SRC3 transcript. The expression of SRC3 protein was up-regulated in the T3-treated tadpoles in the intestine and tail (Fig. 1, B and D, top panels), just like SRC3 mRNA (Fig. 1, B and D, bottom panels) (45Paul B.D. Shi Y.-B. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, during natural metamorphosis, the expression of SRC3 was also found to be up-regulated at the climax of metamorphosis (stage 62) as compared with premetamorphosis (stage 54) in the intestine and tail (Fig. 1, C and E, top panels), again like SRC3 mRNA (Fig. 1, B and D, bottom panels) (45Paul B.D. Shi Y.-B. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These results suggest a role of SRC3 in tissue transformation during both natural and T3-induced metamorphosis. Gene- and Tissue-dependent Recruitment of SRC3 to T3-responsive Promoters by TR—To study the involvement of SRC3 in T3-mediated transcription in vivo, we focused on the intestine and the tail. The metamorphosis of the intestine and the tail have been well characterized (2Shi Y.-B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 43Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. Physiology of the Amphibia. Academic Press, New York1976: 467-599Crossref Google Scholar, 58Shi Y.-B. Gilbert L.I. Tata J.R. Atkinson B.G. Metamorphosis: Post-embryonic Reprogramming of Gene Expression in Amphibian and Insect Cells. Academic Press, New York1996: 508-538Google Scholar). These two organs share a number of similarities. Cell death or apoptosis is the major event at early stages of metamorphosis in both organs. A number of T3-response genes are similarly regulated in both organs (58Shi Y.-B. Gilbert L.I. Tata J.R. Atkinson B.G. Metamorphosis: Post-embryonic Reprogramming of Gene Expression in Amphibian and Insect Cells. Academic Press, New York1996: 508-538Google Scholar), including the TRβA and TH/bZIP genes, whose promoters have been shown to contain TREs (49Furlow J.D. Brown D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2076-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 59Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we carried out ChIP assays to determine the recruitment of endogenous SRC3 to the T3-responsive promoters, TRβA and TH/bZIP in the tail and intestine. We treated premetamorphic X. laevis tadpoles at stage 54 (46Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis. 1st Ed. North Holland Publishing, Amsterdam1956Google Scholar) with T3 for 2 days, which is known to initiate metamorphosis (2Shi Y.-B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 43Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. Physiology of the Amphibia. Academic Press, New York1976: 467-599Crossref Google Scholar). As expected, both TRβA and TH/bZIP genes were up-regulated in the intestine and tail as shown by RT-PCR analysis of total RNA isolated from the two organs (Fig. 2, bottom panels). When the nuclei were isolated from the intestine and tail and subjected to ChIP assays with antibodies against TR, acetylated histone H4 (AcH4), and SRC3, we found that as expected, TR was bound constitutively to both promoters, while an increase in levels of acetylated histone H4 was observed with T3 treatment (Fig. 2, A–D, lane 2), correlating with transcriptional activation and consistent with previous results (60Sachs L.M. Damjanovski S. Jones P.L. Li Q. Amano T. Ueda S. Shi Y.B. Ishizuya-Oka A. Comp Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 126: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the intestine, an increased association of SRC3 was observed at both TH/bZIP and TRβA promoters upon T3 treatment (lane 2 of Fig. 2, A and B). Surprisingly, in the tail, T3 treatment led to an increased recruitment of SRC3 only at the TH/bZIP promoter (Fig. 2C, lane 2) but not the TRβA promoter (Fig. 2D, lane 2). To investigate whether this tissue- and gene-dependent recruitment of SRC3 is an artifact of precociously metamorphosis induced by T3 or occurs physiologically during metamorphosis, we carried out ChIP assays by using organs isolated from premetamorphic tadpoles or tadpoles at the climax of metamorphosis when endogenous levels of T3 are high. As observed during T3-induced metamorphosis, TR bound the promoters constitutively, and the acetylation levels of histone H4 was much higher at the climax of metamorphosis at both promoters in both organs (lane 2 of Fig. 3, A–D). Furthermore, in the intestine, we found that SRC3 was recruited to both promoters at the climax of metamorphosis (stage 62) but not in premetamorphic tadpoles (stage 54) (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 2). In the tail, SRC3 recruitment to the TH/bZIP promoter was low in premetamorphic tadpoles (stage 54) and high at the climax (stage 62) (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 1 and 2), whereas SRC3 binding to the TRβA promoter was similar or even lower at the climax compared with that in premetamorphic tadpoles (Fig. 3D, lanes 1 and 2). To confirm the differential recruitment of SRC3, we conducted quantitative real-time PCR on the SRC3 ChIP samples. The results again showed that SRC3 was recruited to both the promoters in intestine in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 4A) and to the TH/bZIP promoter but not the TRβA promoter in the tail (Fig. 4B). For comparison, the levels of histone H4 acetylation were also analyzed by real-time PCR on the H4 ChIP samples and found to be increased by the T3 treatment in all cases, accompanying gene activation (Fig. 4, C and D). Real time PCR analysis of ChIP samples from premetamorphic (stage 54) and naturally metamorphosing (stage 62) tadpoles yielded essentially identical results, i.e. with increased recruitment of SRC3 to both the promoters in the intestine (Fig. 5A) but only TH/bZIP promoter in tail (Fig. 5B) at the metamorphic climax, and enhanced histone acetylation in all cases (Fig. 5, C and D). Thus, the results from both natural and T3-induced metamorphosis indicate that even though T3-dependent gene activation through TR involves increased acetylation at both promoters in both organs, SRC3 is utilized in a gene- and tissue-specific manner during the T3 activation process. The agreement between T3-induced and natural metamorphosis further argues that this T3-dependent differential recruitment is physiologically important for proper gene regulation and tissue remodeling.Fig. 5Real-time PCR analysis showing differential SRC3 recruitment to T3-dependent promoters during natural metamorphosis. Chromatin was isolated for ChIP assay from the intestine (A, C) and tail (B, D) of premetamorphic tadpoles at stage 54 and metamorphic tadpoles at stage 62. The TRE regions in the ChIP samples were analyzed using quantitative PCR. Three tadpoles were used per treatment.View Large Image"

Regulation of protein function by Sir2 protein (sirtuin) deacetylases is conserved in all domains of life.

The recent identification of the acetyltransferase enzyme responsible for the acetylation of Acs defined the SDPADS in prokaryotes. This report identifies one residue in Acs, Leu-641, which is critical for the acetylation of Acs by the protein acetyltransferase enzyme. In vivo and in vitro evidence shows that mutations at Leu-641 prevent the acetylation of Acs by protein acetyltransferase, maintain the Acs enzyme in its active state, and bypass the need for sirtuin deacetylase activity during growth on acetate.

Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The role of Acs, an enzyme central to the metabolism of all cells, is to activate acetate to Ac-CoA (23Starai V.J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2020-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The Acs reaction proceeds via an Ac-AMP intermediate (Fig. 1) before yielding Ac-CoA, a high energy metabolite involved in many anabolic and catabolic processes (23Starai V.J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2020-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In Salmonella enterica, Acs activity is posttranslationally regulated via acetylation of residue Lys-609. Acetylation of the latter effectively blocks the conversion of acetate to Ac-AMP (22Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Removal of the acetyl moiety from acetylated Acs protein (AcsAc) is catalyzed by the S. enterica Sir2 ortholog encoded by the cobB gene (24Tsang A.W. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol.

Unacetylated Acs is competent for the conversion of acetate to its adenylated intermediate (acetyl-AMP) and acetyl coenzyme A (right).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Here we report results from studies aimed at dissecting the molecular interactions between Acs and the S. enterica protein acetyltransferase, Pat. Using genetic selections, we identified a specific residue in Acs, Leu-641, as a critical amino acid for the acetylation of Acs by Pat. We propose that changes at this position alter the protein-protein interactions between Acs and Pat. Residue Leu-641 is hypothesized to be part of the Pat-binding domain of Acs. In vitro and in vivo evidence is presented in support of this conclusion. This work begins defining the mechanism of protein substrate recognition by the SDPADS of S. enterica. All bacterial strains used in this study were derivatives of the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2. The genotypes of strains used in this work are listed in Table I. Bacterial strains were grown on nocarbon E minimal medium (NCE) (26Berkowitz D. Hushon J.M. Whitfield H.J. Roth J. Ames B.N. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 215-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supplemented with potassium acetate as the source of carbon and energy, MgSO4 (1 mm), and l-methionine (0.5 mm). Luria-Bertani broth (LB) was used as rich medium. Growth behavior was analyzed in 96-well microtiter dishes (BD Biosciences) using a computer-controlled BioTek EL808-I Ultra microplate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc.) with the incubation chamber set at 37 °C. A 2-μl inoculum of an overnight culture of S. enterica was used to seed 198 μl of freshly prepared minimal medium in each well; the medium was supplemented with 10 mm potassium acetate as the carbon and energy source. When used, l-(+)-arabinose was added to a final concentration of 100 μm. Data points were collected every 10 min, with shaking at the highest intensity for 540 s between readings. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Ampicillin was used at 100 μg/ml and kanamycin at 50 μg/ml.Table IStrains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidRelevant genotypeSource or ref. no.bIn the text, MudI1734 (43) is referred to as MudJ (44).S. enterica strainsaAll S. enterica strains used in this study were derivatives of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2.LT2Wild typeLaboratory collectionLT2 derivativesTR6583metE205 ara-9K.

Random Mutagenesis of Acs—Plasmid pACS7 (acs+) was introduced into the mutagenic Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Red (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting transformants were resuspended into 5 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking. This culture was subcultured 1:100 (v:v) into 5 ml of fresh ampicillin-containing LB medium and allowed to continue growth at 37 °C with shaking. After the second overnight outgrowth, plasmid was reisolated using the Wizard Plus SV Miniprep kit (Promega). Isolation of a Plasmid Encoding an Acs Enzyme Insensitive to Acetylation by Pat—The pool of mutagenized pACS7 plasmid was electroporated (31Seidman C.G. Struhl K. Sheen J. Jessen T. Ausubel F.M.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1982; 107: 584Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) into S. enterica strain JE6668 (acs pta cobB), which was unable to grow on any concentration of acetate because of the lack of Acs and phosphotransacetylase (Pta) functions. The cobB mutation ensured that any Acs encoded by the plasmid introduced into the strain would remain acetylated; hence growth on acetate could only occur if the variant Acs protein could escape acetylation by the Pat enzyme. Transformed cells were plated onto NCE minimal agar supplemented with 1 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm l-methionine, 100 μm l-(+)-arabinose (for induction of acs expression), ampicillin, and 10 mm acetate as the sole carbon and energy source. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Clones arising on these plates were reisolated on the same solid medium and further characterized. The sequence of the acs gene encoded by plasmids that allowed strain JE6668 to grow on low acetate concentrations was determined using BigDye™ protocols (ABI PRISM, University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center). Construction of Plasmid pACS12 (AcsL641P)—Plasmid pACS10 encoding wild-type Acs protein fused at its C terminus to a chitin-binding domain was used as a template in the PCR-mediated QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). We used mutagenic primers 5′-GGTGGAGAAACCGCTCGAAGAGAA-3′ and 5′-CTTCTCTTCGAGCGGTTTCTCCACC-3′ to introduce the L641P mutation (underlined residues identify the mutagenic nucleotide). PCRs were performed as per the manufacturer's protocol; DNA sequencing confirmed the single base substitution. The resulting plasmid was named pACS12, which carried allele acs4 that encoded AcsL641P protein fused to a chitin-binding domain at its C terminus. Construction of Plasmid pACS13 (AcsL641P)—Plasmid pACS7 carrying the wild-type acs+ gene under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter was used as template in the PCR-mediated QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To introduce the L641P mutation, the mutagenic primers used in the construction of plasmid pACS12 were used. The reactions were performed as per the manufacturer's protocol. DNA sequencing confirmed the single base substitution. The resulting plasmid was named pACS13, which directed the synthesis of AcsL641P protein in response to arabinose in the medium. Construction of Plasmid pACS15 (AcsL641Q) and Plasmid pACS16 (AcsL641A)—Plasmid pACS15 and pACS16 were constructed as described for plasmid pACS13, except that mutagenic primers 5′-GGTGGAGAAACAGCTCGAAGAGAA-3′ and 5′-CTTCTCTTCGAGCTGTTTCTCCACC-3′ were used to introduce the L641Q change, and the primers 5′-GTGGTGGAGAAAGCGCTCCGAAGAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTCTCTTCGAGCGCTTTCTCCACCAC-3′ were used to introduce the L641A change. Plasmid pACS15 directed the synthesis of AcsL641Q protein, whereas pACS16 directed the synthesis of AcsL641A protein, both in response to arabinose in the medium. Purification of AcsL641P Protein—Acs protein carrying the L641P mutation was obtained by expressing the acs allele carried by plasmid pACS12. The variant protein was purified from S. enterica cobB+ and cobB genetic backgrounds as described for wild-type Acs (22Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Purification of GST-Pat—GST-Pat was purified as described (25Starai V.J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Purified GST-Pat protein was dialyzed against 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m KCl and 25% (v/v) glycerol. The protein was drop frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at–80 °C. In Vitro AMP-forming Ac-CoA Synthetase Reactions—Ac-CoA synthetase activity of Acs was monitored as described (22Starai V.J.

Acs-dependent synthesis and isolation of radiolabeled Ac-CoA using [14C,C-1]acetate, ATP, and CoA with thin-layer chromatography were performed as described (22Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), except that 1 μg of unacetylated bovine serum albumin was added to each reaction to increase Acs stability. Pat-mediated Acetylation of Acs—Protein acetylation reactions using [14C,C-1]Ac-CoA were performed as described (25Starai V.J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of Acs protein was added to 5 μg of GST-Pat protein in 0.05 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20 μm [14C,C-1]Ac-CoA (specific activity, 47 mCi/mmol) (Moravek) and 200 μm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride in a final volume of 100 μl. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C after which proteins were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5% (w:v). Precipitated proteins were washed twice with 0.5 ml of ice-cold ethanol and allowed to air-dry. Proteins were resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) followed by Coomassie staining (36Sasse J. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. I. Wiley Interscience, New York1991: 10.6.1-10.6.8Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gels were dried onto a piece of Whatman® paper and placed in a sealed film cassette under a Cyclone™ Storage Phosphor Screen (Packard Instruments). Signal intensity was analyzed after 8 h of exposure using the Cyclone™ Phosphor Detection System as per the manufacturer's directions. Pat-mediated Inhibition of Ac-CoA Synthetase Activity—Acs proteins (Acswt and AcsL641P) were isolated from S. enterica as described above, except that strain JE7462 (pat cobB/pTara) was used as the overexpression host. Acs proteins were acetylated by purified Pat protein in the following manner. A 150-μl total volume reaction containing 0.05 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 200 μm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 40 μm Ac-CoA, and 10% glycerol (v:v) contained either active or heat-inactivated GST-Pat at a concentration of 0.95 μm (18.5 μg); Acs proteins were added to 1.9 μm (20 μg). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. GST-Pat was removed from the reactions by 80 μl of GST·Mag beads (50% slurry (v/v) (Novagen)) pre-equilibrated with the acetyltransferase reaction buffer. Incubation and removal of the magnetic beads was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. Reaction supernatants were filtered through 0.45-μm Spin-X® centrifuge tube filters (Costar). The protein concentration of the filtered reaction was determined and tested for Ac-CoA synthetase activity as described (33Williamson J.R. Corkey B.E. Lowenstein J.M. Methods in Enzymology. XIII. Academic Press, New York1969: 494-497Google Scholar, 34Horswill A.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2379-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), except that a total of 0.5 mg of Acs protein was used in the Ac-CoA synthetase reactions. Protein Determination—Protein concentration in the samples was determined using the Bradford protein assay protocol (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with bovine serum albumin as standard per the manufacturer's instructions. The in vitro and in vivo evidence discussed below indicate that residue Leu-641 of Acs is critical for the acetylation of the active site residue Lys-609 by the Pat enzyme. Because residue Leu-641 lies close to the site of acetylation in Acs (Lys-609), we postulate that Leu-641 plays a critical role in the interaction of Acs with Pat. The Variant AcsL641P Enzyme Is No Longer Posttranslationally Controlled by the SDPADS—We used a genetic approach to identify derivatives of Acs that were no longer acetylated by Pat. cobB pat+ strains of S. enterica do not grow at low acetate concentrations (≤10 mm), because in the absence of CobB sirtuin deacetylase Acs remains acetylated (i.e. inactive, Fig. 2) (37Starai V.J. Takahashi H. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Genetics. 2003; 163: 545-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rationale for the search was centered on the premise that if Pat failed to acetylate Acs in the pat+ cobB background, Acs would remain active and cells would grow on acetate despite the lack of CobB sirtuin deacetylase. To isolate variants of Acs that were no longer acetylated by Pat, we mutagenized plasmid pACS7 acs+ (Acswt) and selected for plasmids that would restore growth of the strain JE6668 (acs pta cobB) on minimal medium supplemented with 10 mm acetate as carbon and energy source and L(+)-arabinose (100 μm) as inducer of plasmid-borne acs. It was important to inactivate the chromosomal copies of acs and phosphotransacetylase (pta) to completely block acetate conversion to Ac-CoA (37Starai V.J. Takahashi H. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Genetics. 2003; 163: 545-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Brown T.D. Jones-Mortimer M.C. Kornberg H.L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1977; 102: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 39Fox D.K. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13487-13497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and eliminate background growth on acetate (Fig. 3B). Sequencing of the acs allele encoded by a plasmid that supported robust growth of strain JE6668 on acetate revealed a single TA to CG transition at nucleotide 1922. This base substitution resulted in a mutant Acs protein with a replacement of a leucyl residue with a prolyl residue at position 641. The L641P mutation was reconstructed using site-directed PCR mutagenesis to confirm the phenotype associated with this mutation. Acs protein encoded by the reconstructed plasmid (pACS13 acs4 (AcsL641P)) restored the ability of strain JE6668 (acs pta cobB) to grow on acetate when arabinose was added to the medium to induce the synthesis of AcsL641P (Fig. 3A, open diamonds versus solid diamonds). A strain carrying a plasmid encoding wild-type Acs protein failed to grow even when arabinose was included in the medium to induce the synthesis of wild-type Acs protein (Fig. 3B, lower left panel). To determine whether the substitution of residue Leu-641 by Pro was specific, we replaced Leu-641 with Gln or Ala; the presence of the mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. Growth analyses involving strains carrying plasmid pACS15 acs5 (AcsL641Q) or plasmid pACS16 acs6 (AcsL641A) were performed using a strain carrying plasmid pACS13 acs4 (AcsL641P) as control. Strain JE6668 (acs pta cobB) harboring the plasmid pACS15 acs5 (AcsL641Q) or pACS16 acs6 (AcsL641A), as well as the strain carrying plasmid pACS13 acs4 (AcsL641P) (data not shown), grew on 10 mm acetate, indicating that the effect of a change on Leu-641 was not specific to the side chain of the prolyl residue and emphasizing the importance of the side chain of the leucyl residue at that position. Purified AcsL641P Is Active in the Absence of CobB-Sirtuin Deacetylase Activity—Acswt and AcsL641P Acs enzymes were purified from S. enterica cobB+ and cobB genetic background to gain insights into the mechanism by which the L641P mutation afforded CobB-independent Acs activity in vivo. Specific activities of these proteins were calculated, measuring the formation of [14C,C-1]Ac-CoA from [14C,C-1]acetate, Mg(II)/ATP, and HS-CoA (Table II). As expected, Acswt purified from the sirtuin-deficient cobB background was substantially less active than the identical enzyme purified from the sirtuin-proficient cobB+ background (∼36-fold reduction in activity, Table II). Incubation of inactive Acswt with CobB sirtuin and NAD+ restored activity to wild-type levels (from 0.1 ± 0.01 to 4.2 ± 0.04 μmol/min/mg protein; Table II). In striking contrast to these results, the AcsL641P enzyme purified from the cobB background was nearly as active as the Acswt enzyme purified from the cobB+ background (3.2 ± 0.09 versus 3.9 ± 0.01 μmol/min/mg protein, respectively). Incubation of CobB and NAD+ with the AcsL641P enzyme purified from the sirtuin-deficient background did not change the activity of the AcsL641P enzyme. In addition, AcsL641P enzyme isolated from the cobB+ background showed little difference (∼1.5-fold) in specific activity when compared with the same enzyme purified from the cobB background (4.7 versus 3.2 mmol of Ac-CoA min–1 mg–1), indicating that the mutant protein was no longer under SDPADS control. These results could be explained by a lack of acetylation of the AcsL641P enzyme by Pat. We also considered the unlikely alternative explanation would be that AcsL641P enzyme gained the ability to activate acetate in the presence of acetylated Lys-609.Table IIAcswt and AcsL641P activities purified from cobB+ and cobB strainsacs expression hostaThe relevant genotype of the strain from which the Acs protein was purified.

Open table in a new tab Pat Does Not Acetylate AcsL641P Protein and Does Not Inhibit Its Activity—To address the possibility that the L641P mutation blocked Acs acetylation by Pat, purified AcsL641P enzyme was incubated with Pat and [14C,C-1]Ac-CoA, and the presence of labeled Acs protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Control experiments showed that Pat efficiently transferred the [14C,C-1]acetyl moiety of [14C,C-1]Ac-CoA to wild-type Acs protein (Fig. 4, lanes 1) and that heat-inactivated Pat did not (Fig. 4, lanes 2). In contrast to Acswt, AcsL641P enzyme was not a substrate for Pat under the in vitro conditions tested (Fig. 4, lanes 3). These results were consistent with the idea that the AcsL641P enzyme was not acetylated by Pat in vivo, allowing the CobB sirtuin deacetylase-deficient strain, JE6668, to grow on acetate. To show that purified Pat did not acetylate AcsL641P at Lys-609, we monitored Acs activity after incubation with Pat. As expected, Pat-mediated inhibition of Acswt activity was observed (∼16-fold reduction). Strikingly, the activity of the AcsL641P enzyme was not significantly affected (10 versus 12 μmol of Ac-CoA/min/mg of protein; Table III). However, the AcsL641P enzyme activity was about one-third that of the Acswt enzyme, suggesting that the L641P mutation may affect the stability of the enzyme. The effect of the L641P mutation on Acs activity or stability has not been further characterized.Table IIIPat-mediated inhibition of Acswt and AcsL641P proteinsConditionsaAcetyltransferase reaction components are listed under “Experimental Procedures.”Acswt-specific activitybSpecific activity is defined as μmol of acetyl-CoA formed min-1 mg-1.

Open table in a new tab Conclusions—Results from these studies suggest that the structural contributions of residue Leu-641 of Acs are critical for its interaction with the Pat protein acetyltransferase. This conclusion is based on the robust negative effects that changes at position 641 had on the ability of Pat to acetylate Acs, despite drastic changes in the side chain introduced at that position. Although the crystal structures of unacetylated and acetylated Acs from S. enterica were solved in the presence of ligands (41Gulick A.M. Starai V.J. Horswill A.R. Homick K.M. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2866-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), the region of Acs that contains residue Lys-609 was disordered in both models, making it difficult to determine the spatial relationship of Leu-641 to Lys-609. Leu-641 is located in α-helix 20 (residues 637–645), the last α-helix of the Acs protein (Fig. 5), which could suggest that this helix represents a possible binding site on Acs for the Pat protein. Further studies of Pat-Acs interactions are under way."

In this report, we characterized the regulation of system N/A transporter 3 (SNAT3) in the liver of dietary-restricted mice and in hepatocytes treated with serum starvation and insulin. The expression of SNAT3 was up-regulated in dietary-restricted mice. The expression of SNAT3 protein was detected on the plasma membrane of hepatocyte-like H2.35 cells with a half-life of 6–8 h. When H2.35 cells were depleted of serum, the expression of SNAT3 was increased. An increased concentration of insulin, however, suppressed SNAT3 expression. Interestingly, the down-regulation of SNAT3 expression by insulin was blocked by the specific phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, but not by MAPK inhibitor PD98059, suggesting that insulin exerts its effect on SNAT3 through phosphoinositide 3-kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Surface biotinylation assay showed an increased level of SNAT3 on the cell surface after 0.5 h of insulin treatment, although no effect was observed after 24 h of treatment. Consistently, the transport of the substrate l-histidine was increased with short, but not long, treatment by insulin in both H2.35- and SNAT3-transfected COS-7 cells. The l-histidine uptake was inhibited significantly by l-histidine followed by 2-endoamino-bicycloheptane-2-carboxylic acid and l-cysteine and to a lesser extent by l-alanine and aminoisobutyric acid, but was not inhibited by α-(methylamino)isobutyric acid, implying that uptake of l-histidine in H2.35 cells is primarily mediated by system N transporters. In conclusion, differential regulation of SNAT3 by insulin and serum starvation reinforces the functional significance of this transporter in liver physiology.

Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 2Haussinger D. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Mammalian amino acid transporters identified to date belong to a variety of protein transporter families including CAT, A, N, and EAAT (3Palacin M. Estévez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 4Castagna M.A. Shayakul C. Trotti D. Sacchi V.F. Harvey W.R. Hediger M.A. J. Exp.

Many of the families identified thus far consist of multiple members that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The members of former system A and N transport families share common sequential and functional characteristics; therefore, recently they have been reclassified as a single family, SLC38A or System N/A Transport (SNAT) 1The abbreviations used are: SNAT, system N/A transporter; AD, ad libitum-fed; AIB, aminoisobutyric acid; DR, dietary-restricted; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3 kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: SNAT, system N/A transporter; AD, ad libitum-fed; AIB, aminoisobutyric acid; DR, dietary-restricted; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3 kinase. family (6Mackenzie B.

We have identified and characterized three members of the SNAT family, SNAT1 (formerly mNAT2), SNAT3 (formerly mNAT), and SNAT4 (formerly mNAT3 and hNAT3), which are predominantly expressed in liver, muscle, brain, or retina (8Gu S.

Genomics. 2001; 74: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) are rat and human orthologs of SNAT4. The members of the SNAT transporter system family mostly convey l-glutamine, l-histidine, l-asparagine, and l-alanine across cell membranes (6Mackenzie B. Erickson J.D. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 7Gu S. Jiang J.X. J. Lanzhou Univ. 2003; 39: 28-34Google Scholar). Transport of glutamine and alanine is essential for control of nitrogen metabolism in the liver and muscle (2Haussinger D. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 19Zorzano A. Fandos C. Palacin M. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 667-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In these organs, glutamine is a central intermediate in the detoxification of ammonia and the production of urea (20Watford M. Chellaraj V. Ismat A. Brown P. Raman P. Nutrition. 2002; 18: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Alanine directly participates in the glucose-alanine cycle between the liver and muscle for glycolysis and in the removal of ammonia from muscle. In addition, we have observed a graded distribution of SNAT3 expression from the central vein to the portal tract in the liver (8Gu S. Roderick H.L. Camacho P. Jiang J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3230-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that activities of N/A transport systems are regulated by growth factors and hormones (including insulin in some tissues), substrate availability, cell swelling, starvation, etc. (21McDowell H.E. Eyers P.A. Hundal H.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 44: 15-19Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Low S.Y. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Pogson C.I. Rennie M.J. Biochem.

Physiol. 1993; 265: E135-E144PubMed Google Scholar). Glucagon and glucocorticoid have been reported to stimulate hepatic system N/A transport (26Schenerman M.A. Kilberg M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 856: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Cariappa R. Kilberg M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E1021-E1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tamarappoo B.K. Nam M. Kilberg M.S. Welbourne T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E526-E533PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the activities of system N/A transport are up-regulated in the liver during prolonged fasting and corticosteroid treatment, becoming the rate-determining factor in intrahepatic metabolic processes (22Low S.Y. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Pogson C.I. Rennie M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have shown that activities of system N/A transport appear to be regulated by physiological factors, the precise regulatory mechanism at the molecular level is unknown because of the lack of information regarding the identity of transporter proteins. Recent progress in molecular cloning permits the investigation of the function and regulation of these transporters in close detail. Our recent study showed that the expression and function of SNAT4 are stimulated by insulin-activated phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling in hepatocyte-like cells (11Gu S. Langlais P. Liu F. Jiang J.X. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 721-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we report differential regulation by insulin signaling of a member of the system N transport family, SNAT3. SNAT3 was up-regulated in the liver of dietary-restricted mice and serum-starved hepatocytes. The expression of SNAT3 was down-regulated by chronic treatment of insulin in hepatocytes. This down-regulation was mediated through insulin-activated PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway. On the other hand, acute treatment by insulin within 0.5 h stimulated the surface expression of SNAT3 with a corresponding increase in substrate uptake. Competitive inhibition analysis suggested that the l-histidine uptake was primarily mediated by system N transporters. The temporal regulation of SNAT3 by insulin in the liver suggests that this transporter plays a key role in liver physiology and function.

Protease inhibitor mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Nitrocellulose membrane was purchased from Schleicher & Schuell, and nylon membrane Hybond-XL was from Amersham Biosciences. Tissue culture medium, protein and RNA standard mixtures, and Lipofectamine 2000 were obtained from Invitrogen. FBS was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). H2.35 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). EZ-link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin, immobilized neutral avidin, and Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit were from Pierce. The liver samples of ad libitum-fed (AD) and dietary-restricted (DR) mice were generous gifts from Dr. Arlan Richardson at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. These mice were originally obtained from NIA, National Institutes of Health. X-OMAT AR films were from Eastman Kodak. Paraformaldehyde (16% stock solution) was from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Fort Washington, PA). Tissue-Tek® OCT compound was from Miles Scientific (Naperville, IL). All other chemicals were from either Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Cell Cultures—H2.35 cells derived from mouse primary differentiated hepatocytes were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4% FBS and incubated in a 10% CO2 incubator at 39 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Membrane Protein Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis—Crude membrane extracts were prepared from liver samples of various aged AD and DR mice, H2.35 cells, and neuroblastoma-like N2A cells as described previously (8Gu S. Roderick H.L. Camacho P. Jiang J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3230-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended, and the protein concentration was determined using the Micro BCA protein reagent assay kit. 20 μg of protein were loaded, separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blotted with affinity-purified antibodies against SNAT3 (1:300 dilution) and β-actin (1:5000). The detailed procedure for affinity purification of SNAT3 antibody was described by Gu et al. (8Gu S. Roderick H.L. Camacho P. Jiang J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3230-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were detected using secondary anti-rabbit antiserum (1:5000) for SNAT3 or anti-mouse antiserum (1:5000) for β-actin. These secondary antibodies were conjugated with either horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase and were detected using either a chemiluminescence reagent kit (ECL) or alkaline phosphatase colorimetric reaction, respectively. The membranes treated with ECL were exposed to X-OMAT AR films and detected by fluorography. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blots were performed as described (29Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Total RNAs were extracted from adult mice liver and H2.35 cells using TRI Reagent® according to the manufacturer's instructions. 30 μg of RNA were loaded onto an agarose gel containing formaldehyde, separated through electrophoresis, and then transferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized at 45 °C for 12 h in a hybridization solution containing 50% formamide and [32P]-labeled cDNA probe corresponding to nucleotides 1135–1737 of mouse Snat3 (AF159856). The probed membrane was washed in a high stringency condition of 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 63 °C for 1 h. Immunofluorescent Staining and Confocal Laser Microscopy—The immunofluorescent detection of SNAT3 was performed as described previously (30Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). H2.35 cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, incubated with blocking solution (2% normal goat serum, 0.25% Triton X-100, 2% fish skin gelatin, and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30 min, and incubated with affinity-purified anti-SNAT3 antibody (1:300 dilution in blocking solution) at 4 °C overnight. The primary antibodies were labeled for 1 h in the dark at room temperature by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500 dilution). The specimens were analyzed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview; Olympus) with an excitation at 488 nm by an argon laser. Radioactive Labeling of Hepatocyte Cultures and Immunoprecipitation—The cultures were rinsed three times with culture medium deficient in methionine prior to the addition of 1 ml 35S-labeling medium (methionine-free SNAT, system N/A transporter with 5% dialyzed FBS, 20 μm methionine, and 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine) for 0.5, 1.5, and 3 h. For pulse-chase experiments, the radioactive medium was removed after a 3-h pulse. The cultures were rinsed three times with complete culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5 mm methionine and 10% FBS) and incubated in non-radioactive medium at different chase periods. Cell cultures were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-SNAT3 affinity-purified antibody (31Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Cell Surface Biotinylation—Biotinylation of monolayer cells was performed based on a modification of the procedure described previously (32Whitworth T. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 276: 42932-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, H2.35 cells were labeled with 1 mg/ml EZ-link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin in PBS at 4 °C for 20 min. The cells were washed three times with PBS plus 100 mm glycine to quench the biotinylation reaction, lysed, and then mixed with the same volume of monomeric avidin beads for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed three times with PBS, and the biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in a sample loading buffer containing 1% SDS and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. Transport Assay—7 μg of SNAT3 cDNA cloned in pcDNA3.1 vector was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were subjected to insulin treatment and transport analysis. For analysis of the uptake of l-histidine in cells, H2.35 and COS-7 cells were treated in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg/ml insulin for 0.5-24 h, followed by three rinses with uptake buffer (150 mm LiCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). These cells were incubated in uptake buffer for an additional 10 min, transferred to uptake buffer containing 50 μm3H-labeled l-histidine for 5 min, and then washed three times with cold PBS. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (2% SDS in PBS), and 200 μl of cell lysates were transferred to scintillation solution for measurement of the radioactivity inside the cell. A competition assay with various amino acids and substrates was conducted to determine the contribution of various amino acid transport systems to l-histidine uptake in H2.35 cells. The rate of uptake at concentrations of 50 μm l-histidine was measured in the absence or presence of 5 mm α-(methylamino)isobutyric acid, l-alanine, AIB, l-histidine, 2-endoamino-bicycloheptane-2-carboxylic acid, or l-cysteine for 5 min. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and the data collected are presented as ± S.D. Statistical Analysis—Dunnett and Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons tests were performed using InStat software (GraphPad Prism®, San Diego, CA). The Dunnett test was used to compare the control group versus experimental groups. The Student-Newman-Keuls test was used to compare pairs of experiments. Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. with more than three determinations. * in the figures indicate the degree of significant differences as compared with the controls. (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). Up-regulation of SNAT3 Expression in the Liver of Dietary-restricted Mice—We have previously shown that SNAT3 is predominately expressed in the liver (8Gu S. Roderick H.L. Camacho P. Jiang J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3230-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The expression of SNAT3 in ad libitum-fed (AD) and dietary-restricted (DR) mice was examined by Western blots (Fig. 1, upper panel) and densitometric measurements (lower panel). There was an increase in the expression of SNAT3 in DR mice of 4–6- and 12-month-old mice (Fig. 1, lanes 1–4). The increase became less dramatic in 24-month-old mice (lanes 5 and 6). The results imply that increased expression of SNAT3 in DR mice could be caused by the decreased levels of certain components or factors in the plasma. Expression of SNAT3 in Hepatocyte-like H2.35 Cells—To understand the molecular mechanism of the regulation and function of SNAT3 in the liver, we utilized mouse hepatocyte-like H2.35 cells as an in vitro model. The expression of SNAT3 in H2.35 cells in the form of mRNA and protein was detected (Fig. 2, A and B). A 2.4-kb form of mRNA was revealed in H2.35 cells (Fig. 2A, lane 1) and in the liver (lane 2). A 60-kDa migrating protein band was detected with anti-SNAT3 antibody in H2.35 cells (Fig. 2B, lane 1), whereas no expression of SNAT3 protein was observed in neuroblastoma-like N2A cells (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of the cells showed that SNAT3 was localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C, b). The protein stability and turnover of SNAT3 were determined using pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 3). The cumulative level of SNAT3 protein was observed after 3 h of radioactive labeling (Fig. 3, lanes 1–3). The protein levels of SNAT3 were still visible after 16 h of postlabeling chase time (lanes 4–8) along with an appearance of another protein band (∼48 kDa) (lane 8). These results suggest that SNAT3 is a relatively stable protein with a half-life of ∼6–8 h. SNAT3 protein was not detected in the preimmune antibody-blotted sample (lane 9). Stimulation of SNAT3 Expression in Serum-starved Hepatocytes—In analogy to dietary restriction in vivo, H2.35 cells were serum-starved for 48 h and the expression of SNAT3 was determined (Fig. 4). In comparison to the expression of the housekeeping protein β-actin (Fig. 4, lower panel), serum starvation dramatically stimulated the expression of SNAT3 (upper panel, lanes 1 and 2). SNAT3 was undetectable using preimmune antibody (upper panel, lane 3). This observation suggests that the expression of SNAT3 is down-regulated in the presence of serum. A Decrease in the Expression of SNAT3 Induced by Insulin— The plasma levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factor in DR mice have been shown to be markedly decreased as compared with AD mice (34Masoro E.J. McCarter R.J. Katz M.S. McMahan C.A. J. Gerontol. 1992; 47: B202-B208Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 35Mai V. Colbert L.H. Berrigan D. Parkins S.N. Pfeiffer R. Lavigne J.A. Lanza E. Haines D.C. Schatzkin A. Hursting S.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1752-1755PubMed Google Scholar). The serum, according to the information provided by the manufacturer, contains 7–13 microunits/ml insulin. Treatment with insulin significantly reduced mRNA levels of SNAT3 (Fig. 5A, upper panel) with the most dramatic effect after 24 h of insulin treatment, as shown by the densitometric quantification (lower panel). Similarly, the protein levels of SNAT3 also decreased in insulin-treated H2.35 cells (Fig. 5B). This decrease is directly associated with the concentration of insulin being applied. This effect was initiated at 6.1 ng/ml insulin (Fig. 5B, lane 3) and became more obvious in association with increased concentrations of insulin (lanes 4–7). A similar decrease was also observed in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-treated sample (lane 8). The reduction of SNAT3 expression associated with the increasing concentrations of insulin was confirmed by densitometric measurements (Fig. 5B, lower panel). Moreover, the decrease of SNAT3 expression induced by insulin was dependent upon the treatment period (Fig. 6). In comparison to the expression of the housekeeping protein β-actin, the decrease of SNAT3 expression was consistent after 4 h of insulin treatment (Fig. 6A, lanes 5 and 6), becoming more profound starting at 16 h (lanes 9 and 10) and sustaining up to 80 h of treatment (lanes 23–24). This observation was further verified by densitometric quantification (Fig. 6B). The decrease in the amount of SNAT3 between the treatment periods of 16–80 h was stabilized. This could imply that longer periods of the insulin treatment may not inhibit or reduce SNAT3 biosynthesis and that the existing intracellular protein pool of SNAT3 is stabilized. Together, these data show that the expression of SNAT3 is down-regulated by the chronic treatment by insulin and this down-regulation is likely to occur at the mRNA level of SNAT3.Fig. 6Time-dependent down-regulation of the expression of SNAT3 by insulin. A, H2.35 cells were treated in the presence (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and 23) and absence (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24) of 0.5 μg/ml insulin for 1 h (lanes 1 and 2), 2h(lanes 3 and 4),4h(lanes 5 and 6),8h (lanes 7 and 8), 16 h (lanes 9 and 10), 24 h (lanes 11 and 12), 36 h (lanes 13 and 14), 44 h (lanes 15 and 16), 52 h (lanes 17 and 18), 60 h (lanes 19 and 20), 72 h (lanes 21 and 22), and 80 h (lanes 23 and 24). The immunoblots of membranes from treated cells were labeled with anti-SNAT3 or anti-β-actin antibody. B, the SNAT3 bands from three separate Western blots were quantified using densitometry (NIH image).

The data are presented as mean ± S.D. and n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Regulation of SNAT3 Expression by Insulin-activated PI3K-mTOR Signaling—The insulin signaling cascade consists of two major downstream pathways, the MAPK pathway and the PI3K pathway (36Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To determine which pathway is responsible for the inhibitory effect of insulin, we utilized two well characterized specific inhibitors, PD98059 for the MAPK pathway and LY294002 for the PI3K pathway (36Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The expression of Akt, a downstream effector of PI3K, and MAPK in H2.35 cells was ascertained through the immunoblots with their corresponding antibodies (Fig. 7A). The activation of MAPK and Akt kinase exhibited through the phosphorylation on certain amino acid residues was determined using antibodies against phosphor-MAPK (pThr-202/Tyr-204) and phospho-Akt kinase (pThr-308) (Fig. 7A). As compared with the non-treated control (Fig. 7A, lane 1), the activation of both kinases was detected upon treatment with insulin (lane 2). MAPK activation was inhibited with PD98059 (lane 4, blotted with antibodies for MAPK(pThr-202/Tyr-204)). Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (lane 3) attenuated Akt activation (lane 3, blotted with antibodies for Akt(pThr-308)). A similar inhibitory effect was also observed by another Akt inhibitor, Wortmannin (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that insulin activated MAPK and PI3K signaling in H2.35 cells and that the inhibitors PD98059 and LY294002 can efficiently block the activation of each signaling pathway. These two inhibitors, PD98059 and LY294002, were adopted to determine which downstream pathway(s) of insulin-activated signaling was involved in down-regulation of the expression of SNAT3 in H2.35 cells (Fig. 7B). Consistent with the data shown in Figs. 5 and 6, insulin induced a decrease in SNAT3 expression (Fig. 7B, lanes 1 and 2). This decreased expression was completely blocked by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (lane 3), but not by the MAPK inhibitor PD98059 (lane 4). The inhibition of insulin-induced down-regulation of SNAT3 by the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin was also observed (data not shown). These results suggest that the insulin-induced down-regulation of SNAT3 in hepatocytes is likely to be mediated through the PI3K signaling pathway. To further confirm the effect of PI3K pathway on the down-regulation of SNAT3 by insulin, H2.35 cells were treated with various concentrations of LY294002 in conjunction with insulin (Fig. 7C). Higher concentrations of LY294002 completely attenuated the inhibitory effect of insulin on SNAT3 expression, implying the involvement of insulin-activated PI3K signaling pathway. mTOR was recently reported to be activated by insulin-PI3K pathway, and the activated mTOR signaling is involved in metabolic activities and cell proliferation (37Hay N.

Recent structural determinations of the apo- and glycolipid-liganded forms of human GLTP have provided the first insights into the molecular architecture of the protein and its glycolipid binding site (Malinina, L., Malakhova, M. L., Brown, R. E., and Patel, D. J. (2004) Nature 430, 1048–1053). In the present study, we have evaluated the functional consequences of point mutation of the glycolipid liganding site of human GLTP within the context of a carrier-based mechanism of glycolipid intermembrane transfer. Different approaches were developed to rapidly and efficiently assess the uptake and release of glycolipid by GLTP. They included the use of glass-immobilized, glycolipid films to load GLTP with glycolipid and separation of GLTP/glycolipid complexes from vesicles containing glycolipid (galactosylceramide or lactosylceramide) or from monosialoganglioside dispersions by employing nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-based affinity or gel filtration strategies. Point mutants of the sugar headgroup recognition center (Trp-96, Asp-48, Asn-52) and of the ceramide-accommodating hydrophobic tunnel (Phe-148, Phe-183, Leu-136) were analyzed for their ability to acquire and release glycolipid ligand. Two manifestations of point mutation within the liganding site were apparent: (i) impaired formation of the GLTP/glycolipid complex; (ii) impaired acquisition and release of bound glycolipid by GLTP. The results are consistent with a carrier-based mode of GLTP action to accomplish the intermembrane transfer of glycolipid. Also noteworthy was the inefficient release of glycolipid by wtGLTP into phosphatidylcholine acceptor vesicles, raising the possibility of a function other than intermembrane glycolipid transfer in vivo.

However, a GLTP-like sequence occurs in the carboxyl-terminal region of phosphoinositol 4-phosphate adaptor protein-2 and related human FAPP2 proteins, which localize to the trans-Golgi network at exit sites where transport carriers destined for the plasma membrane are formed (24Godi A.

GLTP orthologs in other eukaryotes have been implicated in the activation of stress-induced, programmed cell death in plants (Arabidopsis) (26Broedersen P. Petersen M. Pike H.M. Olszak B. Skov S. Odum N. Jorgensen L.B. Brown R.E. Mundy J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 490-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) as well as in a self-destructive death process triggered by cell-cell incompatibility in filamentous fungi (Podospora anserina) (27Mattjus P. Turcq B. Pike H.M. Molotkovsky J.G. Brown R.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The findings suggest that GLTP is a member of an emerging new protein family involved in important cellular processes. Human rGLTP, as recently revealed by x-ray diffraction, is characterized by a novel folding motif among proteins that transfer or bind lipids (13Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 430: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The structural data show that complexation of lactosylceramide (LacCer) by GLTP involves a single glycolipid liganding site. The glycolipid liganding site of GLTP is composed of a surface recognition center for the sugar headgroup and a molded-to-fit, hydrophobic tunnel that accommodates the hydrocarbon chains of the ceramide moiety via a cleft-like conformational gating mechanism. Mapping of the recognition center and hydrophobic tunnel of GLTP has enabled identification of amino acid side chains that hydrogenbond and make hydrophobic contacts with the bound glycolipid (13Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 430: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Point mutation analyses indicated that several of the residues lining the liganding site are essential for GLTP to maintain maximum capacity to transfer glycolipids between membranes quickly and efficiently. However, from kinetic measurements of the intermembrane glycolipid transfer activity of the point mutants, it is not possible to discern whether the reduced activity occurs because of an impaired ability of GLTP to acquire glycolipid from the donor vesicles or to release the bound glycolipid to acceptor phospholipid membranes. The goal of the present work was to elucidate the molecular basis of the decreased transfer activity of GLTPs containing point mutations in their liganding sites by directly assessing their relative glycolipid binding capacities as well as the ability of the resulting GLTP/glycolipid complexes to release glycolipid to acceptor membranes. To accomplish this goal, approaches were developed for the rapid isolation and functional analysis of soluble wtGLTP (and point mutants) complexed with various glycolipids (GalCer, LacCer, and ganglioside GM1). The experimental strategy not only provided further evidence for a wild type GLTP/glycolipid complex acting as a soluble intermediate that moves between membranes to accomplish glycolipid transfer but yielded novel insights into the functional consequences of point mutation within the glycolipid complexation site of GLTP with respect to complex solubility, stability, and functionality. Materials—Porcine galactosylceramide (GalCer) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, Al), and monosialoganglioside (GM1) was purchased from Sigma. Radioactive GalCer [6-3H]galactose (20 Ci/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., and l-α-1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-[oleoyl-1-14C]phosphatidylcholine (52.6 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]GM1 was synthesized using galactose oxidase as described previously (28Brown R.E. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5454-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Brown R.E. Hyland K.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1062-1069Google Scholar), and [3H]LacCer 16:0 was synthesized as described below. The purity of radioactive lipids was confirmed by TLC. SUV Preparation—Lipids of the desired composition including either [3H]GalCer or [14C]POPC were mixed in chloroform/methanol and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Residual solvent was removed under high vacuum for 4 h. The lipid films were hydrated in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (or 50 mm NaH2PO4), pH 8.0, by vigorous vortexing and brief bath sonication. SUVs were produced by probe sonication (ultrasonic processor W-225) followed by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 45 min) to remove contaminating titanium particles from the probe and partially sonicated lipid aggregates (30Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson F.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Typical recovery of lipid in the supernatant as SUVs was ∼80%. SUVs comprised of 99 mol % POPC and 1 mol % GalCer (1–2 mm final total lipid concentration) were used in Ni-NTA affinity and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) experiments. Pure POPC SUVs, prepared similarly but at 10–20 mm concentration, served as acceptor vesicles. Protein Expression and Purification—Human GLTP was cloned and expressed in E. coli using pET-30 vector as described previously (13Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 430: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The purification procedure was modified slightly as follows. Transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) were grown at 37 °C in LB medium (750 ml). Cells were induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 = 0.9–1.1, and bacterial growth was continued at 15 °C for 20 h. The cell pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of washing buffer comprised of 10 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol including 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After brief sonication and centrifugation, clarified cell lysate was loaded on 1–1.5 ml of Ni-NTA affinity resin (Qiagen). The majority of protein was soluble. The column was thoroughly washed with washing buffer. The protein was released by stepwise elution with buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (60, 100, and 200 mm) in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, and 5% glycerol. To remove imidazole, fractions were combined and loaded on desalting columns (Econo-Pac 10 DG; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0. Protein fractions were then concentrated to 2–6 mg/ml using Centriplus centrifugical filter devices YM-10 (Amicon). Glycerol was added at 10% final concentration to stabilize and protect the protein from freeze-thaw damage. Protein purity was analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad protein assay) using bovine serum albumin as standard. To remove the His tags and S-tags, rGLTP (pET-30) was incubated with Factor Xa (Novagen) for 16 h at room temperature. Then, the protein was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography SEC using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex-75 prep grade column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Protein fractions were concentrated to 2–6 mg/ml and stored in buffer containing 10% glycerol. Site-directed mutants were obtained using the pET-30/wtGLTP construct vector and QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutant plasmid constructs were verified by DNA-sequencing performed at the Mayo Molecular Biology Core Facility (Rochester, MN) with an Applied Biosystems 377 sequencer using thermocycler protocols and fluorescent dye terminators. Expressed mutants were affinity-purified as described for wtGTLP. The yields of purified mutant proteins were similar to wtGLTP (∼10 mg/liter culture). Near-UV CD and far-UV CD spectra confirmed the absence of global changes in the folding of the mutants (13Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 430: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because control experiments revealed that the liganding data were not affected by the presence of the amino-terminal fusion tag, we routinely used His fusion GLTP mutants to avoid the more difficult and lengthy purification of nonfusion proteins. The relative ease of producing high protein amounts by recombinant approaches enabled adequate protein to be loaded on SEC columns to avoid the poor protein recoveries reported for porcine GLTP (4Abe A. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11231-11239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GLTP/Glycolipid Complex Formation Using Immobilized Glycolipid Films—GalCer, dissolved in chloroform:methanol (9:1, 250 μl) along with [3H]GalCer, was dried under nitrogen while vortexing in 1-ml conical glass vials (Kimble catalog number 60702-1, VWR International). The vials containing the glycolipid films were then placed under high vacuum for 1.5 h. The protein solution (0.1–1 mg in 0.5 ml) was added to the dry lipid film, immobilized on the glass wall of the vial, and gently incubated at room temperature. Aliquots (50 μl) were taken at different time points and counted (Beckman Instruments LS 3801) in scintillation mixture (ICN EcoLume). Protein recovery after 1 h of incubation was greater than 98% as determined by Bradford analyses. Because of well known deviations from classical enzymatic and liganding behavior that occur when either the protein or the ligand is immobilized or insoluble (56Tischer W. Kasche V. Trends Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 326-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 57Berg O.G. Gelb M.H. Tsai M.D. Jain M.K. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2613-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), conditions were established to optimize detection of GLTP/glycolipid complexation. The deviations originate from the inherent insolubility of lipid ligands and the diffusional and partitioning limitations associated with immobilized ligands and proteins. With glycolipid films, simply increasing the total glycolipid ligand to substantial excess relative to protein did not guarantee that more ligand becomes available for interaction with the protein. We found that a 10-fold excess of ligand (as compared with protein) only slightly increased the wtGLTP acquisition rate (∼1.2-fold; data not shown) as compared with a 2-fold excess of ligand. It appeared that higher glycolipid amounts resulted in thicker immobilized films and only marginally increased glycolipid availability to protein in solution. Nonetheless, the relative differences in the time-dependent acquisition of glycolipid by wtGTLP and the point mutants were found to be unaffected by the changes in ligand-to-protein ratio, even when protein molar ratio exceeded glycolipid (e.g. 3:1). Intermembrane Transfer Activity of rGLTP—An intervesicular transfer assay involving radiolabeled GalCer was modified slightly as follows (5Brown R.E. Stephenson F.A. Markello T.C. Barenholz Y. Thompson T.E. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1985; 38: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Brown R.E. Jarvis K.L. Hyland K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Mattjus P. Pike H.M. Molotkovsky J.G. Brown R.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). POPC donor vesicles (1 mm total phospholipid) containing 2 mol % GalCer supplemented with [3H]GalCer (50 nCi/ml) and 10 mol % negatively charged dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid were prepared by sonication as described above. 100 mol % POPC vesicles (10 mm lipid concentration) served as acceptor membranes. GLTP (1 μg) was preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C with donor vesicles (50 μl) before initiation of the transfer reaction by adding a 10-fold excess of POPC acceptors vesicles (50 μl). The reaction buffer consisted of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0). After incubation at 37 °C, separation of the charged donor and neutral acceptor vesicles was achieved by rapid elution over DEAE Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) minicolumns (2 ml). Control experiments without protein enabled correction for leakage of unbound donor vesicles (∼2% of total counts). Control experiments without acceptor vesicles revealed no counts above background in the eluant unless protein levels exceeded ∼50 μg. Transfer Activity of GLTP/GalCer Complex—The DEAE chromatographic approach was also used to assess GalCer transfer from the GLTP/GalCer complex to acceptor vesicles because small GLTP amounts (<50 μg) were completely retained by DEAE resin (2 ml). Protein (0.1 mg; ∼4 nmol) was incubated for 2 h with glass-adsorbed GalCer film comprised of [3H]GalCer (16 nCi) and unlabeled GalCer (5 nmol). To assess glycolipid release, aliquots of the resulting GLTP complex (1–5 μg) were incubated with POPC SUVs (50 μl; 10 mm) at 37 °C for the specified time and then separated on a DEAE minicolumn by washing with buffer (2 ml). Glycolipid release to eluted acceptor vesicles was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. In the absence of acceptor vesicles, background levels of radioactivity were recovered, suggesting that the complex is stable and requires membrane for glycolipid release. Ni-NTA Affinity Chromatography—Ni-NTA resin (0.2 ml) was equilibrated with washing buffer comprised of 10 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol. The amount of resin was based on its established binding capacity, i.e. 0.2 ml of Ni-NTA resin binds 1 mg of protein (Qiagen). The protein/vesicle mixtures were incubated with resin by shaking in Eppendorf tubes for 20–30 min. The mixtures were briefly centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 10 s) to separate the resin and supernatant fractions. Complete binding of GLTP to the resin was confirmed by monitoring the protein concentration in the supernatant. The resin was washed several times with 0.4 ml of washing buffer until radioactivity of [3H]GalCer or [14C]POPC dropped to background level. Then, protein was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration stepwise to 200 mm and then to 1 m in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0. Maximal elution of protein was achieved by incubating for 10 min before spinning. The protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Bradford assay. Radioactivity of all fractions was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Control experiments showed that radioactive vesicles did not bind to the resin (data not shown). Gel Filtration Chromatography—To separate protein from SUVs, Sephacryl S-300 resin (Amersham Biosciences) was chosen because of its known capability for resolving lipid vesicles and glycolipid micelles (29Brown R.E. Hyland K.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1062-1069Google Scholar). A Sephacryl S-300 column (1.5 × 20 cm, 35 ml) was equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and calibrated with mixtures of radioactive SUVs and GLTP. Protein/vesicle mixtures (1–1.5 ml) were loaded, and 1-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min while washing the column with buffer. The vesicles (∼2 × 106 Da) (31Mattjus P.

The radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Control experiments showed that optimal sensitivity for detection of glycolipid complexation by GLTP was observed when the molar amount of GLTP was in excess relative to glycolipid. Synthesis of [3H]LacCer—The [3H]N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of palmitic acid (4 μCi) was dried under nitrogen and combined with d-lactosyl-β1-1-d-erythrosphingosine and then dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and N-ethyldiisopropylamine. The mixture was gently bath sonicated. The reaction tube was heated at 50–52 °C. The reaction progress was checked periodically over 43 h by TLC using the solvent CHCl3: MeOH:H2O (50:21:3, v/v/v). N-Hydroxysuccinimide-palmitate and 18:1 LacCer were used as standards and detected on the silica gel plate by spraying with primulin reagent and viewing under long wave ultraviolet light. The silica gel bands were scrapped into counting vials. H2O(1 ml) and Ecolume scintillation mixture (10 ml) were added to each vial to measure radioactivity by scintillation counting. To recover pure [3H]LacCer, a Waters solid phase extraction Sep-Pak cartridge (100 mg; WAT023595) was equilibrated with 10 ml of chloroform. The reaction mixture was dried under nitrogen, resuspended in chloroform (100 μl), and loaded on the column. To release N-hydroxysuccinimide fatty acyl derivatives and related reaction side products, the column was eluted with 3.5 ml of CHCl3 (+1% MeOH). Then, 5 ml of acetone:MeOH (9:1, v/v) was added to elute glycolipid. All column fractions were dried under nitrogen and dissolved in 1 ml of CHCl3:MeOH (2:1, v/v). The purity of recovered [3H]16:0 LacCer was checked by TLC and fluorography using EN3HANCE spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Our initial goal was to evaluate the effect of point mutation at different sites within the liganding region of GLTP by analyzing the time-dependent response of glycolipid complexation. Previously, SEC on Sephadex G-75 had been used to separate porcine GLTP from phospholipid vesicles containing glycolipid and to show that GLTP can ligand glycolipid to form a soluble protein/lipid complex (4Abe A. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11231-11239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the long separation times and poor protein recoveries reported with Sephadex G-75 were deemed impractical for effectively analyzing the glycolipid liganding capabilities of mutant GLTPs in time-dependent fashion. We investigated whether GLTP could acquire glycolipid immobilized on glass"
https://openalex.org/W2089542817,"Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (Ephs) function as molecular relays that interact with cell surface-bound ephrin ligands to direct the position of migrating cells. Structural studies revealed that, through two distinct contact surfaces on opposite sites of each protein, Eph and ephrin binding domains assemble into symmetric, circular heterotetramers. However, Eph signal initiation requires the assembly of higher order oligomers, suggesting additional points of contact. By screening a random library of EphA3 binding-compromised ephrin-A5 mutants, we have now determined ephrin-A5 residues that are essential for the assembly of high affinity EphA3 signaling complexes. In addition to the two interfaces predicted from the crystal structure of the homologous EphB2·ephrin-B2 complex, we identified a cluster of 10 residues on the ephrin-A5 E α-helix, the E-F loop, the underlying H β-strand, as well as the nearby B-C loop, which define a distinct third surface required for oligomerization and activation of EphA3 signaling. Together with a corresponding third surface region identified recently outside of the minimal ephrin binding domain of EphA3, our findings provide experimental evidence for the essential contribution of three distinct protein-interaction interfaces to assemble functional EphA3 signaling complexes."

Physiol.Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Thecation-Cl co-transporters mediate a highly regulated influx of electrolytes inan electroneutral manner in epithelia and other cell types. In epithelia, NKCCisoforms participate in fluid and electrolyte secretion and absorption,depending on the localization of NKCC to basolateral or apical plasmamembrane, respectively. In secretory epithelia, NKCC1 is oriented totranslocate the ions sodium, potassium, and chloride from the blood intocells. These epithelia also typically express a Cl channel in the apicalmembrane. Stimulation of secretion results in the activation of NKCC1 andapical Cl channels, thus allowing movement of Cl from the blood into cells viaNKCC1 and exit into the lumen via apical Cl channels. Our studies have focusedon NKCC1 function in epithelial lining mammalian airways. We observed rapidstimulation of NKCC1 function achieved through selective stimuli,specifically, hyperosmotic stress(2Liedtke C.M. Cole T.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,3Liedtke C.M. Papay R. Cole T.S. Am. J.

These stimuli and others,including oxidative stress, activate NKCC1 in other cell types(1Russell J.M. Physiol.Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, rapid activation of NKCC1 is thought to requirephosphorylation, although the exact mechanisms have yet to be defined. Commonamong the cation-Cl co-transporters is a well conserved topology with 12transmembrane domains flanked by large intracellular N- and C-terminal tails.The intracellular tails have only recently been found to be associated with aregulatory function. Human colonic and airway epithelial NKCC1-terminal tailscontain consensus phosphorylation sites for serine, threonine protein kinasessuch as protein kinase C (PKC), casein kinase II, and protein kinase A (humantracheal epithelial sequence, GenBank™ accession number AY280459)(5Payne J.A.

These and other proteinkinases have been implicated in the activation of NKCC1, but none has beendirectly linked to NKCC1 activation. Shark rectal gland and rat brain NKCC1are each apparently phosphorylated during the activation of the co-transporter(6Darmon R.B. Forbush B. J.Biol.

Stimulation of ratsalivary gland by β-adrenergic agents leads to an increase in NKCC1transport activity and to phosphorylation of NKCC1(10Kurihara K. Moore-Hoon M.L. Saitoh M. Turner R.J. Am. J.

In addition, rat parotidNKCC1 is phosphorylated by endogenous kinases associated with the basolateralplasma membrane and possibly co-precipitated with NKCC1(11Kurihara K. Nakanishi N. Moore-Hoon M.L.

An examination of the amino acid sequence of the N terminus ofshark rectal gland NKCC1 revealed a highly conserved region with the sequenceRVNFVD, a consensus sequence for proteins binding the catalytic subunit PP1c(18Darmon R.B. Flemmer A. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34359-34362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,19Cohen R.T.W. J. CellSci. 2002; 115: 241-256Google Scholar). Evidence for aninteraction of PP1 with NKCC1 comes from studies of heterologously expressedproteins (18Darmon R.B. Flemmer A. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34359-34362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mutations ofshark rectal gland NKCC1 at the consensus site for PP1c binding decreased theamount of co-precipitated NKCC1 and decreased the rate of NKCC1dephosphorylation. Examination of phosphorylation sites on NKCC1 revealedthree phosphoacceptors, Thr189, Thr184, andThr202, on the N terminus as necessary for full activation oftransport (6Darmon R.B. Forbush B. J.Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Many studies on dephosphorylation of NKCC1 have utilized readily availableand abundant sources of tissues and cells, most of non-mammalian origin. Inthe current study, we focus on mammalian epithelia and a role forserine-threonine protein phosphatases in the regulation of endogenous NKCC1.Our previous studies of rabbit and human tracheal epithelial cells in primarycell culture pointed to PP2A as a major protein phosphatase. In the currentstudy, we used primary cultures of human tracheal epithelial cells and aCalu-3 airway epithelial cell line to examine, in more detail, the activationof NKCC1 by protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin. Wefound that okadaic acid selectively activates NKCC1 in the absence ofenvironmental or hormonal stimulation and blocks PP2A activity but does notaffect PP1 activity in cells stimulated with theα1-adrenergic agent methoxamine. We also demonstrateco-immunoprecipitation of PP2A with NKCC1, pull down of PP2A with the Nterminus of NKCC1 and actin, and co-immunoprecipitation of PP2A withPKC-δ, a protein kinase necessary for activation of human trachealNKCC1. In addition, we observed the co-precipitation of SPAK, aserine/threonine kinase recently reported as a binding partner of shark rectalgland and mouse NKCC1 with PP2A and PKC-δ(7Dowd B.F.X. Forbush B.

These results indicate adynamic role for PP2A in a signaling proteome involved in the activation ofhuman airway NKCC1. Cell Isolation and Culture—Tissue was obtained from tracheasat the time of autopsy through the Cystic Fibrosis Center, Case WesternReserve University. Tracheal epithelial cells were isolated, seeded on0.4-μm-pore size Transwell-Clear polyester filter inserts (Corning Costar,Cambridge, MA) at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells, and grown toconfluence in defined medium(2Liedtke C.M. Cole T.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,13Liedtke C.M. Am. J.Physiol. 1995; 268: L414-L423PubMed Google Scholar). Calu-3 cells were grownin cell culture on 100-mm2 tissue culture plastic or on0.4-μm-pore size Transwell-Clear polyester filter inserts(3Liedtke C.M. Papay R. Cole T.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L1151-L1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All of the cell cultureswere incubated in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Culturemedium was changed at 48–72-h intervals until confluence was reached.Confluence was assessed by microscopic examination and by measurement ofelectrical resistance across the cell monolayers grown on filter inserts.Electrical resistance was quantitated using chopstick electrodes and EVOM(epithelial voltohmmeter, World Precision Instruments, New Haven, CT). Valueswere corrected for background resistance of filter alone bathed in medium. Measurement of NKCC1 Activity—NKCC1 activity was measured asbumetanide-sensitive basolateral to apical unidirectional flux of86Rb, a congener of potassium, or as bumetanide-sensitive uptake of86Rb from a basolateral bathing medium in serum-deprived cells(3Liedtke C.M. Papay R. Cole T.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L1151-L1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,21Liedtke C.M. Cody D. Cole T.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L739-L747Google Scholar). For basolateral-to-apicalflux measurements, cell monolayers were preincubated for 10 min at 35 °Cwith HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution (HPSS), consisting of 10mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 4.2 mmNaHCO3, 5.8 mm KCl, 0.3 mmNa2HPO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.4mm MgSO4, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.5, or HBSSsupplemented with 10 μm bumetanide in a basolateral bathingsolution. Cells were permeabilized at the apical membrane using 175 units/mlnystatin in an apical cytosolic medium containing 20 mm NaCl, 110mm potassium gluconate, 0.4 mm Mg2+gluconate, 4.2 mm NaHCO–3, and 10mm HEPES, pH 7.5. A phosphatase inhibitor was immediately added tothe apical cytosolic medium at a 1:1000 dilution to the final concentrationindicated in the tables and figures. After a 15-min incubation period,transepithelial flux was initiated by adding 1 μCi of 86Rb tothe basolateral solution. The apical bathing medium was collected forradioactive counts at 2.5-min intervals for 10 min and replaced with an equalvolume of nystatin-supplemented cytosolic medium. After the last sampling,cell monolayers were washed in ice-cold 1% phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5(PBS), and intracellular radioactivity was extracted with 0.5 ml of 0.1n NaOH. For measurement of 86Rb uptake, cells were preincubated for 30min at 32 °C following the addition of vehicle or 10 μmbumetanide or for 30 min following the addition of varying concentrations ofprotein phosphatase inhibitor. Stock solutions of each inhibitor were preparedin HPSS. To initiate radiotracer uptake, filters were transferred to a well ofa six-well tissue culture dish containing 1 μCi of 86Rb in HPSS.Influx was measured for a 4-min time interval and then terminated by rapidlyimmersing filters four times in an ice-cold isotonic buffer consisting of 100mm MgSO4 and 137 mm sucrose. Intracellularradioactivity was extracted by incubating cell monolayers in 0.1 nNaOH. Aliquots of cell extracts were assayed for protein content with a Pierceprotein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard and forradioactive counts by scintillation counting. For flux experiments, theaccumulation of 86Rb in the apical compartment was calculated asnmol/mg protein over time. For uptake experiments, intracellular radioisotopiccontent was calculated as nmol potassium/mg protein (86Rb). Measurement of Protein Phosphatase Activity—Phosphataseactivity was quantitated using a Malachite Green phosphatase assay (UpstateBiotechnology) by measuring the dephosphorylation of a phosphopeptide,RK(pT)IRR. Cell monolayers were grown to confluence, serum-deprived overnight,and incubated with vehicle or drugs of interest for indicated periods of time.To stop the reaction, cells were rapidly washed twice with ice-cold isotonicbuffer consisting of 100 mm MgSO4 and 137 mmsucrose. Cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer consisting of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA,0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitors mixture andharvested by scraping. The scrapings were sonicated on ice for three 10-spulses and centrifuged for 10 min at 100 × g in a refrigeratedIEC MPR-4 tabletop centrifuge. Aliquots of the supernatant were assayed forprotein content using a Pierce protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin asthe control and for protein phosphate activity. Samples were incubated for 10min at 30 °C in buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0,and 0.1 mm EDTA without or with 1 nm okadaic acid.KR(pT)IRR was added to the mixture to a final concentration of 175μm, and the incubation continued for 20 min at 30 °C. Toterminate the reaction, 100 μl of Malachite Green detection solution wasadded to the mixture. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C toallow color development. Absorbance was measured at A655using a Bio-Rad microplate reader (Model 3550). Sample absorbance wascorrected for blank wells containing no enzyme. Phosphate released wasdetermined by comparing absorbance to a standard phosphate curve. PP2Aactivity was defined as the activity inhibited by the addition of 1nm okadaic acid to the phosphatase reaction mixture. Preparation and Expression of RecombinantProteins—Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from the human airwayepithelial cell line Calu-3 using the RNeasy Midi Kit (Invitrogen). RACE-readycDNA was prepared using the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) with Superscript IIreverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's protocol. All of the5′-RACE experiments were carried out using the GeneRacer 5′-primerand NKCC1-specific reverse primers (5′-AAAGCCATCCTCAAAAGGTTC-3′and 5′-CTGTGTGCCGGTAGTGATCG-3′) with Thermozyme DNA polymerase(Invitrogen) and 10% Me2SO. The final construct encoded amino acids1–286 of human NKCC1 (GenBank™ accession number AY280459).Amplification of the 3′-end of the NKCC1 was carried out using thegene-specific primers encoding amino acids 758–1212(5′-CCCGGGCTGTATATTTATGTTACCTACAAAAACCAGATG-3′ and5′-GGATCCTTTCTTGGTCGTCAGAAGGTAAGGTATCAATAAGG-3′) with PlatinumTaqDNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). Resulting PCR products were purified,cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and verified by nucleotidesequence analysis with ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator (Applied Biosystems,Foster City, CA). Recombinant peptides were produced using a pET-41a expression vector(Novagen), which placed a GST, His6, and S tags at the N terminusof the construct. Peptides were expressed in BL21-competent cells uponinduction with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C.Cells were harvested, and recombinant protein was extracted from the bacterialcell pellet using B-PER bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce) andeluted in 2 ml of Elution Buffer. Peptides were purified using Centricon YM-30extraction columns (Millipore), dialyzed against PBS, and stored at –80°C. Protein content was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce)with bovine serum albumin as the standard. To verify the size of the peptide,the peptides were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis on 4–15% gradientslab gels under reducing conditions and probed with a polyclonal antibodyspecific to the GST tag. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were grownto confluence, serum-deprived overnight, and washed with ice-cold PBS. Forimmunoblot analysis, cells were lysed and harvested in 1 ml of lysis bufferconsisting of 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture. Aliquots of20–30 μg of protein were added to Laemmli buffer, heated for 5 min ina boiling water bath, and cooled to room temperature. Samples were subjectedto SDS-PAGE on 4–15% gradient slab gels. Protein bands were transferredto PVDF membrane paper for immunoblot analysis and probed with specificantibodies for proteins of interest. NKCC1 was immunoprecipitated from Calu-3 cells as described(3Liedtke C.M. Papay R. Cole T.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L1151-L1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 1 mlof ice-cold 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 3.5mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1mm benzamide, and protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates wereprecleared by treatment with agarose beads. A 0.5-ml aliquot of lysate wasincubated with 1.1% SDS for 1 h at room temperature. The SDS-solubilizedlysates were combined with 3.0% Triton X-100 and incubated for 1 h on ice.NKCC1 was immunoprecipitated by overnight incubation with constant rotation at4 °C with 136 μg of affinity purified T4 monoclonal antibody attachedto protein G beads (Pierce SiezeX immunoprecipitation kit). In someexperiments, NKCC1 was immunoprecipitated without SDS pretreatment using 2.0μg of goat polyclonal anti-NKCC1 antibody (N-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation, washed five times,incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with Laemmli buffer, and subjected to gelelectrophoresis on 4–15% gradient slab gels. NKCC1 andco-immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blot analysis usingspecific antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence. Data Analysis—Protein phosphatase activity is reported aspmol phosphate released/min/μg protein. Immunoreactive protein bandsdetected by chemiluminescence were quantitated by laser densitometry. Data arereported as the mean ± S.E. and represent at least three or moreexperiments, unless otherwise stated. Treatment effects were evaluated using amultiple regression analysis with Tukey post comparison test and by two-sidedStudent's t test for unpaired samples using a GraphPad InStat,version 3.00, software program. Materials—86Rb (specific activity 154 Bq/g Rb,4200 Ci/g Rb) and an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent were purchased fromAmersham Biosciences. Mouse polyclonal antibodies to full-length human PP1(E-9) and to human PP2B catalytic α subunit, goat polyclonal antibody toNKCC1 (N-16), polyclonal anti-GST antibody, anti-GST-agarose beads, andhorseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were obtained from SantaCruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat polyclonal antibody to PP2Acatalytic subunit α (clone 1D6) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology(Charlottesville, VA), rabbit polyclonal antibody to PP2Cα/β waspurchased from Oxford Biomedical Research (Oxford, MI), and rabbit polyclonalantibody to SPAK was from Abgent (San Diego, CA). Bumetanide was purchasedfrom Sigma, and protease inhibitor mixture set III, calyculin, and okadaicacid were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (San Diego, CA). Agarose beads andtissue culture supplies were purchased from Invitrogen. Precast 4–15%gradient slab gels were obtained from Bio-Rad. All of the other chemicals wereof reagent grade. Effect of Protein Phosphatase Inhibitors on NKCC1 Activity—Activation of NKCC1, an integral membrane protein, is achieved using agonistsand environmental conditions that are thought to alter its phosphorylationstate. One approach to evaluate the role of protein phosphorylation in theregulation of NKCC1 is to examine the effect of protein phosphataseinhibitors. In the first series of experiments, we examined the effects ofprotein phosphatase inhibitors on bumetanide-sensitive transepithelial86Rb flux in primary cultures of human tracheal epithelial cellsgrown on permeable supports. Two agents tested were OA and calyculin, whichare potent inhibitors of serine-threonine-specific PP1 and PP2A. The order ofpotency for OA is PP2A ≫ PP1 (Ki of 0.1 versus10 nm) and for calyculin is 10-fold higher for PP1 compared withPP2A (15Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. CellBiol. 1994; 11: 55-86Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Pretreatment ofserum-deprived human tracheal epithelial cells with 0.1 nm OAcaused a 3.5-fold increase in bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb-cumulativeflux and a 3.2-fold increase in the percent of total flux that wasbumetanide-sensitive (Table I),indicating the activation of NKCC1. Higher concentrations of OA, up to 10nm, each significantly increased NKCC1 activity and the percent oftotal bumetanide-sensitive flux. In contrast, pretreatment with calyculin at10 nm, a concentration that blocks PP1 but not PP2A, did not alterNKCC1 function. These results indicate a preferential role for PP2A in theregulation of airway epithelial NKCC1 function.Table IInhibition of protein phosphatase activity: the effect on NKCC1activity in human airway epithelial cellsExperimental conditionBumetanide-sensitive 86Rb accumulative flux% Bumetanide-sensitiveHuman tracheal epithelial cell monolayersnmol/mg protein%Vehicle15.6 ± 5.8 (5)14.9OA, 0.1 nm54.3 ± 11.2(6)ap < 0.03.48.2cp < 0.01.OA, 1.0 nm42.1 ± 7.1(7)ap < 0.03.51.4cp < 0.01.OA, 10 nm57.0 ± 14.5(7)ap < 0.03.43.8cp < 0.01.CAL, 10 nm10.9 ± 6.9 (3)18.9Calu-3 cell monolayersVehicle18.3 ± 7.4 (4)18.4OA, 0.1 nm75.6 ± 8.2(5)bp < 0.002.54.9cp < 0.01.OA, 10 nm72.9 ± 12.0(5)cp < 0.01.55.8bp < 0.002.a p < 0.03.b p < 0.002.c p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab Because of limited availability of human tracheal tissue as a source ofepithelial cells, we selected an airway epithelial Calu-3 cell line forfurther study because this cell line expresses abundant NKCC1 protein andcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein anddisplays highly regulated transport function(3Liedtke C.M.

Gen.Physiol. 1999; 113: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). As shown inTable I, pretreatment of Calu-3cells with 10 nm OA increased bumetanide-sensitive 86Rbtransepithelial basolateral-to-apical flux 4.1-fold and the percent of totalbumetanide-sensitive flux 2.9-fold, indicating the activation of NKCC1. We also quantitated NKCC1 activity as bumetanide-sensitive 86Rbuptake in Calu-3 cells grown on Transwell filter inserts. As shown inFig. 1A, OA at a finalconcentration of 1 nm significantly increased bumetanide-sensitive86Rb uptake from 21.0 ± 3.8 (n = 6) nmolpotassium/mg protein to 37.4 ± 4.3 (n = 3) nmol potassium/mgprotein (p < 0.02). As a control, cells were treated withmethoxamine, a α1-adrenergic agent that stimulates NKCC1activity in human tracheal epithelial cells and Calu-3 cells.Bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb uptake increased 3.6-fold to 75.5± 14.2 (n = 5) nmol potassium/mg protein. Pretreatment with 1nm OA before basolateral addition of methoxamine further increasedthe response to methoxamine. In the presence of OA, NKCC1 activity increasedto 113.8 ± 16.7 (n = 5) nmol potassium/mg protein, a valuesignificantly different from treatment with methoxamine alone (p<.05). Fig. 1Billustrates a dose-dependent stimulation of bumetanide-sensitive86Rb uptake by OA. An EC50 was calculated from the datain Fig. 1B as 0.42nm (Fig.1C). These functional studies indicate a role for PP2A inCalu-3 NKCC1 activity that was explored next by quantitating enzymeactivity. Activity of PP1 and PP2A—Calu-3 cells were stimulated withmethoxamine or, as a control, incubated with buffer and then lysed inhypotonic buffer and assayed for activity of PP1 and PP2A.

O., Butler, N. S., Monick, M. M., and Hunninghake, G. W. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 36099–36106) that hyperoxia induces cell cycle arrest and sustained extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activity in macrophages. In this study, we determined the mechanisms of hyperoxia-induced ERK activation and how ERK activity plays a pro-survival role in hyperoxia-exposed cells. Inhibition of ERK activity decreased survival of hyperoxia-exposed macrophages. This was due, at least in part, to down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, BimEL. In determining the mechanism of ERK activation by hyperoxia, we found that ERK activation was not associated with hyperoxia-induced activation of the upstream ERK kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1/2. When we examined the ability of whole cell lysates from hyperoxia-exposed cells to dephosphorylate purified phosphorylated ERK, we found decreased ERK-directed phosphatase activity. Two particular ERK-directed phosphatases (protein phosphatase 2A and MAPK phosphatase-3) demonstrated decreased activity in hyperoxia-exposed cells. Moreover, whole cell lysates from normoxia-exposed cells depleted of PP2A or MAPK phosphatase-3 were also less able to dephosphorylate ERK. These data demonstrate that, in hyperoxia-exposed macrophages, sustained activation of ERK due to phosphatase down-regulation permits macrophage survival via effects on the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins.

Supplemental oxygen therapy is indispensable for patients with respiratory failure, even though high concentrations of inspired oxygen can cause tracheobronchitis, acute lung injury, and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis. Hyperoxia can induce cellular damage, in part, through increased production of reactive oxygen species (1Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10986-10992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of hyperoxia has been extensively evaluated in epithelial cells (2Lee P.J. Alam J. Wiegand G.W. Choi A.M. Proc.

Macrophages in the lung are at ∼13% oxygen under normal conditions. Under conditions of supplemental oxygen exposure (acutely ill patients), macrophages can be exposed to up to 90% oxygen. It is known that macrophages exposed to one type of oxidant stress, cigarette smoke, survive for prolonged periods of time in the lung (10Marques L.J. Teschler H. Guzman J. Costabel U. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 156: 1700-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The prolonged life of the macrophages of smokers compared with our previous observations on the cell cycle effects of hyperoxia (hyperoxia induces macrophage cell cycle arrest accompanied by induction of p21Cip1 and activation of the retinoblastoma protein (11Nyunoya T. Powers L.S. Yarovinsky T.O. Butler N.S. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol.

Macrophages, in vitro, survive hyperoxia for a prolonged period of time, and this is associated with sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; BH, Bcl-2 homology; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKP, MAPK phosphatase; MEK, MAPK kinase; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PTP, protein/tyrosine phosphatase; HePTP, hematopoietic PTP; STEP, striatum-enriched phosphatase.

In this study, we pursued the hypothesis that hyperoxia-linked down-regulation of ERK-directed phosphatases leads to prolonged ERK activation and increased ERK-dependent survival. ERK can be activated via stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases, G-protein-coupled receptors, and integrin receptors (12Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). ERK can also be activated in response to redox changes in the cell through still unidentified mechanisms (13Samavati L. Monick M.M. Sanlioglu S. Buettner G.R. Oberley L.W. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C273-C281Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). ERK is activated by dual phosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine residues by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2). The duration of ERK phosphorylation affects the biological responses in cells. Short duration of ERK activation (as seen with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) does not alter the cell cycle, whereas prolonged ERK activation regulates cell proliferation (14Kahan C. Seuwen K. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13369-13375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A potential mechanism to induce sustained activation of ERK is a decrease in phosphatase activity, because ERK is inactivated by phosphatases. The specific removal of phosphate from either the tyrosine or the threonine is enough to eliminate or decrease enzyme activity (15Posada J. Cooper J.A. Science. 1992; 255: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 16Hancock C.N. Dangi S. Shapiro P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11590-11598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). There are several types of known phosphatases that regulate ERK, including serine/threonine phosphatases, such as PP2A (17Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), dual-specificity phosphatases, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (MKPs) (18Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 19Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), protein/tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), such as striatum-enriched phosphatase (STEP) (20Paul S. Nairn A.C. Wang P. Lombroso P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and hematopoietic PTP (HePTP) (21Huang Z. Zhou B. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52150-52159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Under most conditions, ERK activation is brief, because PP2A, a constitutively expressed phosphatase is already present in the complex at base line and rapidly switches off ERK activity by removing a phosphate from the threonine residue (17Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Another means of ERK inactivation occurs via induction and activation of one or more MKPs leading to dual dephosphorylation of ERK (22Pouyssegur J. Lenormand P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3291-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). MKPs have unique specificities toward their MAPK substrates and distinct subcellular localizations. MKP-1 is located in the nucleus and preferentially inactivates p38 MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and ERK (in that order) (23Wu J.J. Bennett A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16461-16466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, MKP-3 is located in the cytoplasm and preferentially dephosphorylates ERKs (19Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol.

Both MKPs and PTPs have catalytic site cysteines that, when oxidized, inactivate the phosphatases (26Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 27Chiarugi P. Fiaschi T. Taddei M.L. Talini D. Giannoni E. Raugei G. Ramponi G. J. Biol.

Neuroscience. 2004; 129: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A has also been shown to be negatively regulated by redox modulation of a cysteine (29Kim H.S. Song M.C. Kwak I.H. Park T.J. Lim I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37497-37510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30Foley T.D. Kintner M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because of this known redox-linked negative regulation of phosphatases, we hypothesized that hyperoxia induces prolonged ERK activation via inactivation of one or more phosphatases involved in ERK regulation. Bcl-2 family members are essential regulators of apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family consists of two classes: anti-apoptotic members, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL that protect cells from apoptosis, and pro-apoptotic members that trigger or sensitize for apoptosis. More than 20 pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins have been identified in mammals and can be divided into two subgroups by the number of Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains that they contain (31Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members include Bax and Bak with 2–3 BH domains and other proteins identified as BH3-only proteins, including Bim and Bad. The BH3-only proteins are crucial for initiation of apoptosis. In contrast, Bax/Bak-like proteins are further downstream effectors in the cell death program. The BH-3-only protein Bim is expressed in various cells, including macrophages, and is strictly regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level (31Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Bim is a major apoptotic signal following withdrawal of survival factors. Bim–/– mice show a marked accumulation of monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes (32Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C. Tarlinton D.M. Kay T.W. Kontgen F. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Science. 1999; 286: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bim–/– lymphocytes are resistant to cytokine withdrawal in culture (33Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Houghton P.J. Look A.T. Ozawa K. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). ERK can bind and promote phosphorylation of Bim, targeting it for degradation via the proteosome (34Ley R. Balmanno K. Hadfield K. Weston C. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18811-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Luciano et al. (35Luciano F. Jacquel A. Colosetti P. Herrant M. Cagnol S. Pages G. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6785-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) reports that ERK-dependent degradation of Bim protects leukemia cells from Imatinib-induced apoptosis (35Luciano F. Jacquel A. Colosetti P. Herrant M. Cagnol S. Pages G. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6785-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). However, the role of Bim regulation in cell survival under hyperoxia has not been studied. In this study, we showed that hyperoxia induces sustained ERK phosphorylation leading to a pro-survival change in the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. The prolonged ERK activity is not associated with an increase in activity of upstream kinases. Rather, hyperoxia induces a sustained decrease in total ERK-directed phosphatase activity. The effect of hyperoxia results from alterations in multiple ERK-linked phosphatases. On one hand, hyperoxia fails to trigger auto-inactivation of ERK via induction of MKP-1 (as is found with LPS-induced ERK activation). On the other hand, hyperoxia does decrease ERK-directed phosphatase activity of at least two major ERK-directed phosphatases (MKP-3 and PP2A). In combination, these findings support an important role for phosphatase down-regulation in the sustained ERK activation seen with macrophages exposed to hyperoxia. These data suggest an important role for ERK in macrophage survival under hyperoxic conditions that is driven by multiple effects on phosphatases. Reagents and Antibodies—Chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Nitrocellulose membranes, ECL and ECL Plus, were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Antibodies were obtained from various sources. Anti-Bim was from Stressgen Biotechnologies (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Anti-ERK2, anti-MEK1, anti-MKP-1, anti-MKP-3, and anti-PP2A were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-β-actin was from Sigma. Phosphorylation-specific antibodies for ERK and MEK1/2 were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Developing antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-goat, or anti-mouse Ig) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Tissue culture plates were obtained from Corning (Corning, NY). Cell Culture and Cell Viability Assay—RAW 264.7 cells (TIB-71, American Type Culture Collection) were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (40 μg/ml). The cells were subcultured every 2–3 days. Experiments were performed in six-well (35 mm) Costar tissue culture plates or regular tissue culture dishes (100 mm) under normoxia (O2 = 21%) or hyperoxia (O2 = 95%) at the starting cell density of 0.5 × 106/ml. The percentage of viable cells in each group at 24 h was determined by the trypan blue assay. Isolation of Whole Cell Extracts—Whole cell protein was obtained by lysing the cells on ice for 20 min in 500 μl of lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and 1× phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The lysates were then sonicated for 20 s, incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein was quantified using a protein measurement kit (Protein Assay Kit 500–0006, Bio-Rad). Cell lysates were stored at –70 °C until use. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis for the presence of particular proteins or for phosphorylated forms of proteins was performed on whole cell lysates. Protein (30–80 μg) was mixed 1:1 with 2× sample buffer (20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 1.25 m Tris, pH 6.8; all from Sigma) heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and fractionated on a 10 or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel run at 100 V for 90 min. Cell proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by semidry transfer (Bio-Rad) at 20 V for 45 min. Equal loading of the protein groups on the blots was evaluated using the primary antibodies or anti-β actin or Ponceau S stain (Sigma). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Trisbuffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, washed, and then incubated with the primary antibody overnight. The blots were washed four times with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (and ECL or ECL Plus). An autoradiograph was obtained, with exposure times of 10 s–2 min. In Vitro ERK Dephosphorylation Assay—In vitro ERK dephosphorylation assay in this study was similar to others (36Kassel O. Sancono A. Kratzschmar J. Kreft B. Stassen M. Cato A.C.

The whole cell lysates were obtained as previously described, except that phosphatase inhibitors were not used. In some instances, okadaic acid (3 μm) and/or sodium orthovanadate (2 mm) were added to the lysates for 5 min, and whole cell lysates (20 μg) were incubated with recombinant phosphorylated ERK protein (Stratagene) (0.1 μg) at 37 °C for 20 min, followed by boiling in 2× sample buffer. Total phosphatase activity for pERK in conditions of normoxia and hyperoxia were measured by Western blotting using anti-pERK antibody (Cell Signaling). To evaluate PP2A- or MKP-3-dependent effects on pERK dephosphorylation, immunoprecipitation was performed by incubation of each lysate (500 μg/500 μl) with anti-PP2A (5 μg) or anti-MKP-3 (5 μg). Overnight incubation at 4 °C with rotation was followed by the addition of 40 μl/sample protein G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed two times with lysis buffer without phosphatase inhibitors and transferred to new tubes and then were washed one more time with phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.9 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in non-reducing conditions without β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitated PP2A or MKP-3 was incubated with recombinant pERK at 37 °C for 20 min in phosphatase buffer and released from agarose by boiling in 2× sample buffer. The specific phosphatase activity for pERK in conditions of normoxia and hyperoxia were measured by Western blotting using anti-pERK antibodies. Immunodepletion—The whole cell lysates from macrophages in conditions of normoxia were obtained as previously described, except that phosphatase inhibitors were not used. To evaluate PP2A- or MKP-3-dependent effects on pERK dephosphorylation in cell lysates with normoxia, immunoprecipitation for PP2A or MKP-3 was performed as described in the in vitro ERK dephosphorylation assay. After protein G-agarose plus was pulled down, the supernatants were transferred to Eppendorf tubes in ice and were used as PP2A- or MKP-3-immunodepleted cell lysates. PP2A- or MKP-3-immunodepleted cell lysates (20 μg) were incubated with recombinant pERK (0.1 μg) at 37 °C for 20 min in phosphatase buffer and were boiled in 2× sample buffer for 5 min. The ERK-directed phosphatase activity in PP2A- or MKP-3-immunodepleted cell lysates was measured by Western blotting using anti-pERK antibodies. Statistical Analysis—The results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. The number of cells in each condition at various time points was compared using a Student's unpaired t test. Macrophages Survive Hyperoxia via Sustained ERK Activation—Our initial studies showed that RAW 264.7 cells (macrophages) do not die for up to 48 h under hyperoxia. We found that hyperoxia did not alter the activity of protein kinase B (Akt), a transducer of multiple survival signals. In contrast, we found that hyperoxia induces sustained ERK activation (11Nyunoya T. Powers L.S. Yarovinsky T.O. Butler N.S. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol.

To directly evaluate the role of hyperoxia-induced ERK activation on cell survival in macrophages, we performed the following experiments. Macrophages were cultured in standard tissue culture plates, with or without U0126, a MEK inhibitor (the ERK upstream kinase, 10 μm), under conditions of normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (95% O2). Western blot analysis was performed for phosphorylation of ERK. We determined that hyperoxia induces sustained ERK activation without a change in the amount of total ERK (Fig. 1A). Cell viability was measured at 24 h by trypan blue staining. As shown in Fig. 1B, macrophage survival after 24 h of hyperoxia was close to 100%. In contrast, macrophage survival after 24 h of hyperoxia with ERK inhibition was significantly decreased (∼60%) (p < 0.05). These data support the hypothesis that hyperoxia-induced ERK activation is a crucial signal to maintain cell viability in macrophages. Hyperoxia Down-regulates a Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 Family Protein, BimEL, in an ERK-dependent Manner—The Bcl-2 family members are key regulators of cell survival and death. However, little is known about the effects of hyperoxia on the Bcl-2 family proteins in macrophages. To evaluate this, macrophages were cultured in normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (95% O2) in standard tissue culture plates. Western blot analysis was performed for BimEL (the Bim isoform abundant in macrophages (data not shown)) and Bcl-xL at 24 h. Hyperoxia decreased BimEL but increased Bcl-xL (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that hyperoxia alters the balance of Bcl-2 family proteins toward a pro-survival phenotype. It is known that ERK triggers degradation of the proapoptotic protein Bim in cultured fibroblasts (34Ley R. Balmanno K. Hadfield K. Weston C. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18811-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that hyperoxia-induced ERK activation down-regulates Bim. To evaluate this, macrophages were cultured, with or without U0126 (a MEK inhibitor), in normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (95% O2) in standard tissue culture plates. Western blot analysis was performed for total BimEL and phosphorylation of ERK at 24 h. Hyperoxia decreased BimEL protein levels, and the effect was dependent on ERK activity (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that hyperoxia down-regulates BimEL protein in an ERK-dependent manner. We next addressed the mechanism of extended ERK activation in hyperoxia-exposed cells. Hyperoxia-induced ERK Activation Is Not Associated with Increased Activation of the Upstream ERK Kinase MEK1/2 but Rather with Down-regulation of ERK-directed Phosphatases— ERK activity is regulated by the balance between upstream kinase activity and downstream phosphatase activity. We determined whether the increased activity of ERK induced by hyperoxia was due to activation of upstream kinases in the ERK pathway. We used LPS as a positive control for activation of upstream kinases. Macrophages were cultured under conditions of normoxia (21% O2) with or without LPS (1 μg/ml) or hyperoxia (95% O2). Western blot analysis was performed to determine whether there was activation (phosphorylation) of MEK1/2. LPS induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 at 15 min, but hyperoxia did not increase MEK activity for up to 24 h (Fig. 3A). This demonstrates that hyperoxia-induced ERK activity is not linked to increased activity of upstream kinases. Hyperoxia does not increase MEK activity, but there is still a potential role for the base-line MEK activity in ERK activation by hyperoxia. To address this question, macrophages were cultured under conditions of normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (95% O2) with or without U0126 (10 μm), a MEK inhibitor. Western blot analysis was performed to determine whether there was base-line activation (phosphorylation) of ERK that could be inhibited by U0126. MEK inhibition blocked ERK phosphorylation in both normoxia and hyperoxia (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that base-line MEK activity is necessary for hyperoxia-induced ERK activation. However, the lack of increased MEK activity with hyperoxia suggests an alternative mechanism for the increase in ERK activity. One possibility is that hyperoxia decreases the constitutive activity of the phosphatases involved in ERK regulation. Thus, we postulated that hyperoxia decreases dephosphorylation of ERK in exposed macrophages. The following experiments address this hypothesis. To investigate the effect of hyperoxia on total macrophage phosphatase activity, an in vitro ERK dephosphorylation assay was performed. Macrophages were cultured in normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (95% O2) for 24 h. Whole cell lysates were obtained and incubated with recombinant phosphorylated ERK. Whole cell lysate phosphatase activity for ERK in conditions of normoxia and hyperoxia was measured by Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-ERK antibody. As shown in Fig. 3C, hyperoxia decreased ERK-directed whole cell lysate phosphatase activity. Thus, hyperoxia-induced ERK activation does not appear to be due to an increase in MEK activity, but rather to a decrease in phosphatase activity. Hyperoxia Decreases PP2A and MKP-3 Activity for ERK Dephosphorylation—It is known that oxidant stimuli, such as hydrogen peroxide, decrease activity of some phosphatases, resulting in ERK activation (29Kim H.S.

Macrophages were cultured in normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (95% O2) for 24 h. Whole cell lysates were obtained and PP2A, MKP-3, STEP, and HePTP activity were immunoprecipitated and used in an in vitro ERK dephosphorylation assay. Macrophage exposure to hyperoxia decreased the ability of immunoprecipitated PP2A and MKP-3 to dephosphorylate ERK (Fig. 4A). However, hyperoxia did not decrease the ability of STEP or HePTP to dephosphorylate ERK (data not shown). These results suggest that a decrease in PP2A and MKP-3 activity contribute, at least in part, to the sustained ERK activation in h"

These residues gather to form a hydrophobic cluster around Tyr122 in the crystal structures of Ca2+-ATPase in Ca2+-unbound E2 (unphosphorylated) and E2P (phosphorylated) states but are far apart in those of Ca2+-bound E1 (unphosphorylated) and E1P (phosphorylated) states. The substitution-effects were also compared with those of Ile235 on the A domain/M3 linker and those of T181GE of the A domain, since they are in the immediate vicinity of the Tyr122-cluster. All these substitutions almost completely inhibited ATPase activity without inhibiting Ca2+-activated E1P formation from ATP. Substitutions of Ile235 and T181GE blocked the E1P to E2P transition, whereas those in the Tyr122-cluster blocked the subsequent E2P hydrolysis. Substitutions of Ile235 and Glu183 also blocked EP hydrolysis. Results indicate that the Tyr122-cluster is formed during the E1P to E2P transition to configure the catalytic site and position Glu183 properly for hydrolyzing the acylphosphate. Ile235 on the A domain/M3 linker likely forms hydrophobic interactions with the A domain and thereby allowing the strain of this linker to be utilized for large motions of the A domain during these processes. The Tyr122-cluster, Ile235, and T181GE thus seem to have different roles and are critical in the successive events in processing phosphorylated intermediates to transport Ca2+.

In the catalytic cycle, the enzyme is activated by binding of two Ca2+ ions (E2 to E1Ca2, steps 1-2) and then autophosphorylated at Asp351 with MgATP to form ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E1P, step 3), which can react with ADP to regenerate ATP. Upon formation of this EP, the bound Ca2+ ions are occluded in the transport sites. The subsequent isomeric transition to ADP-insensitive form (E2P) will result in a change in orientation of the Ca2+ binding sites and reduction in their affinity and thus the Ca2+ release into lumen (step 4). Finally, hydrolysis takes place and returns the enzyme into an unphosphorylated and Ca2+-unbound form (E2, steps 5 and 6). E2P can also be formed from Pi in the presence of Mg2+ and absence of Ca2+ by reversal of its hydrolysis. The enzyme has three cytoplasmic domains, nucleotide-binding (N), phosphorylation (P), and actuator (A) domains, and ten transmembrane helices (M1-M10) (Fig. 2). The organization of the cytoplasmic domains markedly differ between the atomic models for the Ca2+-bound intermediates and those for the Ca2+-released intermediates, especially in the orientation of the A domain (8Toyoshima C.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that the large rotation of the A domain (by ∼110° parallel to membrane) and its tight association with the P domain occur during the E1P to E2P transition and Ca2+ release, being consistent with the structural change in E1·AlFx·ADP (E1PCa2·ADP analog)→E2·MgF42−(E2·Pi analog) shown in Fig. 2 as well as with the change in E1·AlFx·ADP→E2·AlF4− (the analog for the transition state of E2P hydrolysis) (10Sørensen T.

For further understanding of the Ca2+ transport mechanism, it is therefore essential to identify structural elements involved in these events and reveal their actual roles in the Ca2+ transport. In this regard, we have recently found (16Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Danko S. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2202-2210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that Tyr122 on the loop connecting the A domain and the second transmembrane helix (A domain/M2 linker) is critical for the E2P hydrolysis. In the Ca2+-unbound structures E2·MgF42−,E2⋅AIF42−, and E2(TG) (E2 fixed with thapsigargin), Tyr122 is located on the interface of the associated A and P domains. Its aromatic ring is situated near the center of the seven hydrophobic residues clustered from the three regions, Ile179/Leu180/Ile232 on the A domain, Val705/Val726 on the P domain, and Leu119/Tyr122 on the A domain/M2 linker, forming hydrophobic interactions (Tyr122-hydrophobic cluster, see Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. I). The three regions are, however, far apart in the Ca2+-bound structures E1Ca2, E1·AMPPCP, and E1·AlFx·ADP. It is then possible that the formation of Tyr122-hydrophobic cluster and the resulting A-P domain association may have important functions in the Ca2+ transport. Interestingly, Ile235 on the A domain/M3 linker and the essential T181GES loop of the A domain (17Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14088-14092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Clausen J.D. Vilsen B. McIntosh D.B. Einholm A.P. Andersen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is therefore also of interest to know how these closely located three elements operate to achieve successive events in the transport cycle. In the present study, we therefore explored by site-directed substitutions and kinetic analyses the possible roles of seven residues in Tyr122-hydrophobic cluster and further compared the substitution effects with those of Ile235 and T181GES loop in the same series of experiments. Results revealed that all the seven hydrophobic residues in the Tyr122-cluster are critical for the E2P hydrolysis and further indicated that the Tyr122-cluster, Ile235, and T181GES loop have different roles and are critical in the successive events in processing phosphorylated intermediates to transport Ca2+. Mutagenesis and Expression—The Stratagene QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was utilized for the substitution of residues in the rabbit SERCA1a cDNA. The ApaI-KpnI or KpnI-SalI restriction fragments with the desired mutation were excised from the plasmid and ligated back into the corresponding region in the full-length SERCA1a cDNA in the pMT2 expression vector (19Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The pMT2 DNA was transfected into COS-1 cells by the liposome-mediated transfection method. Microsomes were prepared from the cells as described previously (20Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The “control microsomes” were prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with the pMT2 vector containing no SERCA1a cDNA. The amount of expressed SERCA1a was quantified by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (21Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Suzuki H. Saino T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23910-23915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Expression levels of wild-type SERCA1a and the mutants were 2-3% of total microsomal proteins. Ca2+-ATPase Activity—The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined at 25 °C in a mixture containing 10 μg/ml microsomal protein, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μm A23187, 0.1 m KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.55 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0). The Ca2+-ATPase activity was obtained by subtracting the Ca2+-independent ATPase activity, which was determined in the presence of 5 mm EGTA without added CaCl2, otherwise as above. The specific ATPase activity/mg of expressed SERCA1a protein was calculated from the amount of expressed SERCA1a and the Ca2+-ATPase activity of expressed SERCA1a, which was obtained by subtracting the Ca2+-ATPase activity of the control microsomes from that of the microsomes expressing SERCA1a. This background level with the control microsomes was as low as 3% of the activity of microsomes expressing the wild-type SECRA1a. The specific activity thus obtained with the wild type was 3.36 ± 0.30 μmol/min/mg SERCA1a protein (n = 6). Formation and Hydrolysis of EP—Phosphorylation of SERCA1a in microsomes with [γ-32P]ATP or 32Pi and dephosphorylation of 32P-labeled SERCA1a were performed under conditions described in the legends to Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The reactions were quenched with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing Pi. Rapid kinetics measurements of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were performed with a handmade rapid mixing apparatus (22Kanazawa T. Saito M. Tonomura Y. J. Biochem.

The radioactivity associated with the separated Ca2+-ATPase was quantitated by digital autoradiography as described (24Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The amount of EP formed with the expressed SERCA1a was obtained by subtracting the background radioactivity with the control microsomes. This background was less than 5% of the radioactivity of EP formed with the expressed wild-type SERCA1a. The amount of EP/mg of SERCA1a protein was calculated from the amount of EP thus obtained and the amount of expressed SERCA1a.Fig. 4Time course of accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP from ATP.

At 1 s after this addition, the reaction was quenched with trichloroacetic acid. The amount of E2P thus determined was shown as percentage of the total amount of EP.

In the wild type, the decay of EP formed from ATP and the hydrolysis of E2P formed from Pi were completed within 1 s (data not shown), being consistent with the rapid turnover of the wild type at 25 °C (16.9 s-1 as calculated from the ATPase activity and the amount of EP (described in the legend to Fig. 3)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Miscellaneous—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program Origin (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Three-dimensional models of the enzyme were reproduced by the program VMD (26Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35555) Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPase Activity and Formation of EP from ATP—The specific Ca2+-ATPase activity of the expressed SERCA1a was determined at 25 °C. The alanine and serine substitutions of each of all the seven residues in the Tyr122-hydrophobic cluster (Leu119, Ile179, Leu180, Ile232, Val705, Val726, and Tyr122) resulted in the very large to almost complete loss of the activity (with larger loss by the serine substitution in each residue) (Fig. 3A). The conservative phenylalanine substitution of Tyr122 showed only moderate reduction as we observed previously (16Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Danko S. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2202-2210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The substitutions of Thr181, Gly182, and Glu183 in the T181GES loop and of Ile235 caused almost complete loss of the activity, whereas the substitution of Ser184 showed only moderate reduction. The results observed with the T181GES loop essentially agree with the previous finding by Clarke et al. (17Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14088-14092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Clausen et al. (18Clausen J.D. Vilsen B. McIntosh D.B. Einholm A.P. Andersen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2776-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All these mutants formed EP from ATP in the presence of saturating 100 μm Ca2+ (see the legend to Fig. 3 for the EP levels measured at steady state at 0 °C), and thus all the mutants yielded sufficient levels of EP for kinetic characterization. The affinities for Ca2+ determined with the EP formation in all the mutants were close to that in the wild type (Table I, K0.5). The rates of the E2 to E1Ca2 transition in steps 1 and 2 were then determined at pH 6 where the equilibrium between E1 and E2 is most shifted to E2 (27Pick U. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6120-6126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this experiment, the enzyme was first preincubated in the absence of Ca2+ and then phosphorylated by simultaneous addition of saturating Ca2+ and ATP. The time courses of EP formation were well described by the first order kinetics (data not shown), and the rates obtained were summarized in Table I. When ATP was added to the enzyme preincubated with Ca2+ (E1Ca2) otherwise as above, the EP formation was much faster, therefore the rates obtained above actually reflect the rate-limiting E2 to E1Ca2 transition. The substitutions of the hydrophobic residues Leu119, Ile179, Val705, Val726, and Tyr122 somewhat reduced the rate, but the extents of reduction were much less than those in the ATPase activity. The substitutions of Thr181 and Glu183 on the T181GES loop moderately reduced the rate, whereas those of Gly182 and Ser184 did not affect much. The effect of substitution of Glu183 actually agreed with the previous observation by Clausen et al. (18Clausen J.D. Vilsen B. McIntosh D.B. Einholm A.P. Andersen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2776-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The substitutions of Ile235 on the A domain/M3 linker had essentially no effect on the rate of E2 to E1Ca2 transition.Table IKinetic parameters determined for partial reaction stepsAffinity for Ca2+E2 to E1Ca2Loss of ADP sensitivity (E1P to E2P transition)Decay of EPATPHydrolysis of E2PPiDecay of EPATP at 25 °CHydrolysis of E2PPi at 25 °CK0.5n(+)K+(−)K+μms−1s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1Wild type0.291.910.263 (100%)—bNot determined because the E2P accumulation was low.0.204 (100%)0.038 (100%)0.307 (100%)——L119A0.351.900.120 (46%)—bNot determined because the E2P accumulation was low.0.106 (52%)0.0005 (1.2%)0.0014 (0.5%)0.030.06L119S0.492.060.079 (30%)0.1620.431 (211%)0.0001 (0.2%)0.0010 (0.3%)0.010.03I179A0.241.980.195 (74%)0.0850.208 (102%)0.0017 (4.4%)0.0083 (2.7%)0.511.07I179S0.271.930.121 (46%)0.1490.394 (193%)0.0004 (1.0%)0.0014 (0.5%)0.070.26L180A0.261.790.215 (82%)—bNot determined because the E2P accumulation was low.0.135 (66%)0.0062 (16.2%)0.0208 (6.8%)0.782.05L180S0.322.050.223 (85%)0.1190.220 (108%)0.0014 (3.6%)0.0045 (1.5%)0.440.81I232A0.351.690.252 (96%)0.1440.151 (74%)0.0006 (1.5%)0.0009 (0.3%)0.050.08I232S0.301.530.226 (86%)0.0780.148 (73%)0.0005 (1.2%)0.0009 (0.3%)0.050.08V705A0.611.510.058 (22%)0.1960.225 (111%)0.0036 (9.5%)0.0075 (2.4%)0.681.42V705S0.302.200.085 (32%)—bNot determined because the E2P accumulation was low.0.079 (39%)0.0023 (6.1%)0.0035 (1.1%)0.360.89V726A0.272.290.137 (52%)0.1170.123 (61%)0.0106 (27.9%)0.0140 (4.6%)0.983.18V726S0.332.030.100 (38%)0.0570.097 (48%)0.0025 (6.7%)0.0061 (2.0%)0.511.42Y122AaThe results with Y122A essentially agree with our previous experiments (16).0.311.930.079 (30%)0.1500.102 (50%)0.0007 (1.7%)0.0001 (0.03%)0.110.23I235A0.261.860.272 (104%)—cAlmost all of EP accumulated was E1P (see Fig. 3B).0.029 (14%)0.0010eThe rate most likely reflects the rate-limiting E1P to E2P transition in step 4.

Open table in a new tab The E1P to E2P Transition and Decay of EP Formed from ATP—We then analyzed the E1P to E2P transition at 0 °C. In Fig. 3B and C, the amount of ADP-insensitive EP (E2P) accumulated was determined at 15 s after addition of ATP (nearly the steady state). In the presence of K+, which strongly accelerates the hydrolysis of E2P and thus suppresses its accumulation in the wild type (28Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1451-1457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the fraction of E2P accumulated in the mutants for Ile235 and the T181GES loop was very low or even lower than in the wild type. On the other hand, the mutants for the Tyr122-hydrophobic cluster (especially the serine substitution mutants) accumulated a substantial amount of E2P. In the absence of K+, the E2P accumulation largely increased in the wild type and even to a much higher level in the mutants for the Tyr122-hydrophobic cluster. By contrast, the amount of E2P accumulated in the mutants for Ile235 and the T181GES loop was still very low in the absence of K+, although E183A accumulated to some extent. These results suggest that the E1P to E2P transition is not inhibited in the mutants for the Tyr122-hydrophobic cluster but strongly inhibited in the mutants for Ile235 and T181GES loop (in E183A to some extent). In Fig. 4, the time course of accumulation of E2P from E1Ca2 and ATP was determined in the absence and presence of K+ with the mutants for the Tyr122-hydrophobic cluster, which were shown above to accumulate the large amount of E2P. The total amount of EP reached its maximum level very rapidly (within ∼1 s) and remained unchanged during the period of observation (data not shown) and thus the time course actually reflects the accumulation of E2P from E1P. The E2P accumulation apparently proceeded with first order kinetics, and the rates obtained are summarized in Table I. In the absence of K+ (Fig. 4, A and B), the wild type accumulated a fair amount of E2P and therefore the time courses of the mutants could be compared with that of the wild type. The rates of the mutants for the Tyr122-hydrophobic cluster in the absence of K+ were comparable to or even slightly faster than that of the wild type, although it was reduced to some extent in the specific mutants such as L119A, V705S, and V726S. In each of the mutants for the Tyr122-cluster, the apparent rate observed in the presence of K+ (Fig. 4, D and E, Table I) was similar to or somewhat slower than that in the absence of K+. Results nevertheless indicate that the substitutions of the residues of Tyr122-hydrophobic cluster do not inhibit the E1P to E2P transition, and therefore the large accumulation of E2P in these mutants may be due to possible inhibition of the subsequent hydrolysis of E2P. This kind of analysis was not possible with the mutants for Ile235 and the T181GES loop, because they do not accumulate E2P (see Fig. 3, B and C) except the mutant E183A in the absence of K+ as it accumulated to some extent with the reduced rate (Fig. 4C and Table I). For these mutants, therefore, the decay of E1P was determined in the presence of K+ instead of the E2P accumulation from E1P (Fig. 5C). The decay time courses were well fitted with a single exponential and the rates obtained were summarized in Table I. This EP decay most likely reflects the rate-limiting E1P to E2P transition (as in the wild type (28Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1451-1457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). In fact almost all of"

DNA damage poses a daily threat to the survival of eukaryotic cells. This damage, when left unrepaired, can result in mutations, some of which lead to cancer. Among the repair processes that eukaryotic cells have evolved to ensure prompt repair of DNA damage, base excision repair is the pathway responsible for removal of 10,000 lesions per cell per day that result from oxidative and alkylation damage (1.Horton J.K. Baker A. Berg B.J. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 2.Ochs K. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Kaina B.

Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 445-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Like other repair processes, base excision repair consists of a sequence of finely tuned events that starts with a specific glycosylase recognizing the damaged base (5.McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 255-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Upon removal of the base by the glycosylase, an apurinic/apyrimidinic exonuclease excises the sugar-phosphate backbone and leaves a gap in the DNA (6.Raffoul J.J. Cabelof D.C. Nakamura J. Meira L.B.

Res. 1996; 362: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This gap is filled by DNA polymerase β (Polβ) 1The abbreviation used is: Polβ, polymerase β. 1The abbreviation used is: Polβ, polymerase β. in most base excision repair events. In short patch base excision repair, where only a single base is filled in, Polβ is able to remove the 5′-deoxyribose phosphate with its 5′-deoxyribose phosphate lyase activity (8.Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) thus leaving a substrate ready for completion of repair by a DNA ligase (9.Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16000-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Polβ has been associated with a variety of other cellular processes including meiosis where it was found to localize to synaptonemal complexes (10.Jonason A.S. Baker S.M. Sweasy J.B. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2001; 110: 402-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 11.Plug A.W. Clairmont C.A. Sapi E. Ashley T. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1327-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Polβ is necessary for development as evidenced by the fact that a homozygous deletion in mice is lethal (12.Gu H. Marth J.D. Orban P.C. Mossmann H. Rajewsky K. Science. 1994; 265: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Although Polβ is considered a fairly low fidelity polymerase (13.Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5787-5796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it performs nucleotide insertion in a template-directed manner where it is able to discriminate and select the correct dNTP from a pool of very similar nucleotide substrates. The inherently lower fidelity of this enzyme can be further attributed to the fact that it does not have any intrinsic proofreading or nuclease activities. However, the lack of these functions makes it ideal for a direct study of incorporation fidelity. Additionally, several crystal structures of DNA polymerase β are available including that of the enzyme bound to the DNA substrate alone, termed the “open” conformation, and that of the enzyme in complex with both the DNA and dNTP substrates, known as the “closed” conformation (14.Sawaya M.R. Pelletier H. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1930-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 15.Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 17.Arndt J.W. Gong W. Zhong X. Showalter A.K. Liu J. Dunlap C.A. Lin Z. Paxson C. Tsai M.D. Chan M.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5368-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The availability of these structures further aids us in understanding fidelity and allows us to relate the functional and structural information. Polβ is a relatively small enzyme that is easy to purify. Cumulatively, these features make Polβ the ideal candidate for study of enzyme activity and fidelity. Recently, a variety of Polβ mutants have been found associated with numerous types of human cancers. Of the 149 tumor samples examined, 30% contained mutations in DNA polymerase β (18.Starcevic D. Dalal S. Sweasy J.B. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: e71-e74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the known role of polymerase β in DNA repair and the possible role in meiosis as well as its implicated roles in small-scale replicative synthesis, it is of crucial importance to understand the types and nature of mutations that could lead to infidelity. This infidelity can result in the accumulation of mutations that could, in turn, result in cancer and/or abnormalities in cellular processes. Here we present the biochemical characterization of the I260Q variant of Polβ. Residue Ile-260 is located in the hinge region of DNA polymerase β, which is the region that underlies the area between the fingers and the palm domains of the enzyme (16.Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Ile-260 appears to be of particular significance for its position at the bottom of the hinge, directly underneath the plane where the DNA substrate is positioned. We previously conducted a genetic screen that identified I260Q as a high activity mutant with low fidelity (19.Starcevic D. Dalal S. Sweasy J.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 44: 3775-3784Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). I260Q was shown to have activity levels comparable with wild type in the recA718polA12 heterologous complementation system (20.Sweasy J.B. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1407-1410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because wild type Polβ was shown to substitute for Pol I of Escherichia coli in the joining of Okazaki fragments, this complementation system assesses the catalytic activity of Polβ mutants that are expressed in the recA718polA12 strain. Furthermore, in the same system, I260Q reverted the trpE56 mutation at a frequency 60-fold higher than wild type indicating that this mutant has a strong in vivo mutator phenotype (21.Washington S.L. Yoon M.S. Chagovetz A.M. Li S.X. Clairmont C.A. Preston B.D. Eckert K.A. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We confirmed these findings in vitro and found I260Q to have wild type activity levels in a primer extension assay. We also used the in vitro primer extension assay to show that the mutator activity is an intrinsic characteristic of I260Q (19.Starcevic D. Dalal S. Sweasy J.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 44: 3775-3784Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the study reported here, we examined the kinetic and structural basis for the mutator phenotype of the I260Q variant and found that I260Q is able to form all three sets of mispairs opposite both a purine and a pyrimidine. Moreover, the kinetic basis for misincorporations performed by this mutant is in the binding affinity for the dNTP substrate where I260Q has a lower affinity for the correct dNTP and higher affinity for the incorrect dNTP as compared with wild type. Our results suggest that the hinge of Polβ is important for discrimination during the binding of nucleotide substrate. Bacterial Strains—The strain BL21 DE3 with the genotype F-ompT hsdSB(rb-mb) gal dcm (DE3) was used for protein expression. The wild type enzyme as well as the I260Q variant were expressed from a pET28a vector as previously described (22.Kosa J.L. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol.

DNA Substrate Preparation for Kinetic Studies—The single base pair-gapped DNA substrates with a 5′-phosphate on the downstream oligonucleotide were used for the misincorporation studies. The sequences of the substrates are shown in Table I. The primer oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5′ end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP. The rest of the oligonucleotides were phosphorylated at the 5′ end with non-radioactive ATP. Labeled and phosphorylated oligonucleotides were purified through a Microspin P-6 or P-30 column (Bio-Rad) and annealed at a primer:template:downstream oligonucleotide ratio of 1:1.3:1.5 in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl. The mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, slow cooled to 50 °C for 30 min, incubated at 50 °C for 20 min, and then immediately transferred to ice. An 18% polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography was used to confirm >90% annealing.Table IDNA substrates employed in kinetic experiments The templating base is underlined.SubstrateSequence1B-A5′-TTGCGACTTATCAACGCCCACACAGTAGCTGTCTTCTCAGTTTC-3′3′-AACGCTGAATAGTTGCGGGTGTAGTCATCGACAGAAGAGTCAAAG-5′1B-C5′-TTGCGACTTATCAACGCCCACACAGTAGCTGTCTTCTCAGTTTC-3′3′-AACGCTGAATAGTTGCGGGTGTCGTCATCGACAGAAGAGTCAAAG-5′ Open table in a new tab Presteady-state Analyses—Burst reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol with 300 nm DNA substrate 1B-A and 100 nm enzyme. This buffer was also used for all the other kinetic experiments described in this work. All concentrations given are final concentrations upon mixing. These burst experiments were performed at saturating dNTP concentrations. Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of the Polβ/DNA and Mg/dNTP solutions. The Rapid Quench apparatus (KinTek) (24.Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) was employed in these experiments because of the fast reaction rate. The reactions were quenched with 0.3 m EDTA. Active Site Titration—A fixed concentration of either wild type Polβ or the I260Q variant was preincubated with a range of concentrations of the 1B-A substrate followed by reacting with the correct dNTP substrate, dTTP, for 0.3 s. This time interval was chosen based on the burst reaction and ensures maximum reaction amplitude while minimizing multiple turnovers. The results of these reactions were used to calculate the percentage of active sites of the enzyme and the equilibrium dissociation constant for the DNA substrate, KD, as described below. Single Turnover Misincorporation Assays—This experimental approach provides a way to compare the I260Q variant with the wild type enzyme for their relative abilities to incorporate correct and incorrect dNTPs into a primer-template by determining the dissociation constant from the dNTP substrate, Kd, and the maximum rate of polymerization for each dNTP, kpol. Single turnover kinetic experiments were performed under conditions in which over 90% of the DNA is bound by the enzyme to ensure that the rate of a single catalytic turnover is being measured. These conditions were empirically determined to be at a 15:1 molar ratio of enzyme to DNA for the I260Q variant (data not shown); therefore, 750 nm enzyme (for both I260Q and wild type) and 50 nm DNA were used with varying concentrations of dNTP. The reactions for correct dNTP incorporation were performed in the KinTek apparatus at 37 °C by loading 15 μl of the Polβ-DNA complex in one sample loop and 15 μl of a single dNTP into the other. Substrate concentrations typically used were 1–100 μm and reactions times were 0–8 s. Misincorporation reactions were performed under the same conditions as for correct dNTP incorporation but manually, with a range of dNTP concentrations between 1 and 1 mm, and reaction times 0–2700 s. Product Separation and Data Analysis—All the reactions described above resulted in the addition of one nucleotide to the primer of the DNA substrate used. The n (non-extended) and n+1 (extended by one dNTP) DNA were resolved on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel (Sequel NE, American Bioanalytical). To measure product formation as a function of time, the gels were scanned using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified with the accompanying ImageQuant software. The data were analyzed using the Kaleidagraph program (Synergy software). Data from the burst experiments were fit to the burst equation: [product] = A(1 - exp(-kobst) + kSSt). Data from active site titrations were fit to the quadratic equation: [E-DNA] = 0.5(KD(DNA) + [E]0 + [D]0) - [0.25(KD(DNA) + [E]0 + [D]0)2 - ([E]0[D]0)]0.5, where [E-DNA] is the concentration of the Polβ-DNA complex, [E]0 is the initial enzyme concentration, [D]0 is the initial concentration of the gapped DNA substrate, and KD(DNA) is the dissociation constant of the Polβ-DNA complex. Single turnover kinetic data were fit to the single exponential equation: [product] = A(1 - exp(-kobst)), where A is the amplitude, t is the time, and kobs is the observed rate constant. Observed rate constants were then plotted against [dNTP], and the data were fit to the hyperbolic equation: kobs = kpol[dNTP]/(Kd + [dNTP]), where kpol is the maximum rate of polymerization, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant for dNTP. Fidelity values were calculated as follows: fidelity = ((kpol/kd)c + (kpol/kd)i)/((kpol/kd)i), where c and i represent the correct and incorrect dNTPs, respectively. I260Q Exhibits a Burst of Product Formation—The I260Q variant was previously isolated from a genetic screen of in vivo mutator mutants. The mutator tendencies of this variant were previously confirmed using the in vitro missing base primer extension assay (19.Starcevic D. Dalal S. Sweasy J.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 44: 3775-3784Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the study described here, we use kinetic analyses to fully characterize this mutant and describe the kinetic basis for its mutator phenotype. First, we wished to determine whether the presteady-state kinetic profile of I260Q is similar to wild type. The reaction conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1, I260Q displays biphasic kinetics of presteady-state nucleotide incorporation as does wild type, in which an initial rapid phase is followed by a slower, linear one. This is immediately followed by the rate-limiting step of the catalytic cycle, dissociation from DNA (25.Werneburg B.G. Ahn J. Zhong X. Hondal R.J. Kraynov V.S. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7041-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For I260Q, the fast phase occurs at a rate of 11.4 ± 2.5 s-1, which is similar to the 13.6 ± 1.3 s-1 for wild type on this particular DNA substrate. The slower phase occurs at 0.4 s-1 and 0.9 s-1 for I260Q and wild type, respectively. The biphasic nature of the burst indicates that the I260Q variant, like wild type, has its rate-limiting step of the catalytic cycle after phosphodiester bond formation. I260Q Has a Slightly Higher Affinity for the DNA Substrate than Wild Type—We used the active site titration assay to measure the dissociation constant of wild type or I260Q from the DNA substrate. Shown in Fig. 2 are the data obtained from these measurements fitted to the quadratic equation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” From this experiment, the KD values were calculated to be 35 nm for I260Q and 60 nm for wild type. Thus, the equilibrium dissociation constants are very similar for the two enzymes with I260Q having a slightly greater affinity for the DNA substrate. I260Q Forms All Three dNTP Mispairs Opposite Both a Purine (A) and a Pyrimidine (C)—We wished to determine the kinetic basis for the mutator phenotype of I260Q previously observed in both in vivo and in vitro assays (19.Starcevic D. Dalal S. Sweasy J.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 44: 3775-3784Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). First, we measured the rates and dissociation constants for the dNTP substrate for correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation opposite template A in substrate 1B-A. The reaction conditions and molar ratios are listed under “Experimental Procedures.” As illustrated in Fig. 3 for incorporation of the correct nucleotide, the results were first fitted to the single exponential equation for each individual dTTP concentration to calculate the kobs for each of the dTTP concentrations used. These rates were then plotted as a function of dTTP concentration (Fig. 3B) and fitted to the hyperbolic equation to obtain the Kd and kpol values. As summarized in Table II, the kinetic basis for the increased ability to misincorporate nucleotides opposite purine A is in the dissociation constant, Kd, for the dNTP. The dissociation constant for the correct dNTP substrate, dTTP in this case, is ∼5-fold higher than wild type: 30 μm for I260Q and 6 μm for wild type, whereas the dissociation constant for the incorrect nucleotide is lower than wild type. For example, when dGTP is incorporated opposite A, the Kd for I260Q is 49 μm, whereas it is 147 μm for wild type. A similar difference between I260Q and wild type is observed for dATP misincorporation opposite A where I260Q has a Kd of 30 μm and wild type has a kd of 138 μm. The Kd values for both wild type and mutant are lowered in reactions examining dCTP insertion opposite A most likely because of a slippage phenomenon that has previously been demonstrated for wild type. Because of slippage, the enzyme positions the base immediately 5′ to the template for nucleophilic attack thus allowing it to pair with the incoming nucleotide. In this case, this would mean incorporation opposite G rather than A, which could then form the Watson-Crick G-C base pair. The rate of incorporation for each dNTP substrate is similar for wild type and I260Q. This ultimately results in a lowered catalytic efficiency for I260Q for the correct dNTP substrate. However, I260Q has a somewhat higher catalytic efficiency than wild type for misincorporation. These data suggest that I260Q misincorporates nucleotides opposite purine A because of a lack of discrimination during substrate binding.Table III260Q extends the primer with all three incorrect nucleotides opposite purine A The correct pair is in bold.Base pairEnzymekpolKdaUnits are micromolarkpolc/ kpolibThe kpol for correct (c) is divided by kpol for incorrect (i)Kdi/KdccThe Kd for incorrect (i) divided by the Kd for correct (c)kpol/KdFidelitydFidelity (F) is calculated as follows: [(kpol/Kd)c + (kpol/Kd)i]/[(kpol/Kd)i], where c and i represent correct and incorrect dNTPs respectivelyWTeWT, wild type/Qs-1μmm-1 s-1A:dTTPWT10.2 ± 0.56 ± 11.70I260Q11.1 ± 1.230 ± 0.70.36A:dATPWT0.015 ± 0.0016138 ± 42680230.0001115,45623I260Q0.016 ± 0.000830 ± 469410.00054668A:dGTPWT0.013 ± 0.0003147 ± 10785250.00008819,31919I260Q0.017 ± 049 ± 06471.60.0003471,038A:dCTPWT0.010 ± 0.000520 ± 310303.30.000503,40120I260Q0.019 ± 0.0049 ± 15790.30.0021172a Units are micromolarb The kpol for correct (c) is divided by kpol for incorrect (i)c The Kd for incorrect (i) divided by the Kd for correct (c)d Fidelity (F) is calculated as follows: [(kpol/Kd)c + (kpol/Kd)i]/[(kpol/Kd)i], where c and i represent correct and incorrect dNTPs respectivelye WT, wild type Open table in a new tab We also wished to examine misincorporation opposite a pyrimidine. We constructed a substrate with a templating C within the same sequence context as for A above. Table III summarizes the results of incorporation opposite pyrimidine C using template 1B-C. As observed with misincorporation opposite A, the I260Q variant also misincorporates opposite C. The kinetic basis for misincorporation opposite template C is Kd, the equilibrium dissociation constant. In fact, I260Q appears to prefer the incorrect dNTP substrate. The rates of correct and incorrect incorporation are comparable between wild type and I260Q as observed for insertion opposite template A. The catalytic efficiency of I260Q for misincorporation is slightly higher than that of wild type. This indicates that the basis for the misincorporation phenotype of I260Q and lowered fidelity observed in the in vivo and in vitro assays previously described results from decreased discrimination during dNTP binding by Polβ.Table IIII260Q efficiently forms all 3 dNTP mispairs opposite pyrimidine C The correct pair is in bold.Base pairEnzymekpolKdaUnits are micromolarkpolc/ kpolibThe kpol for correct (c) is divided by kpol for incorrect (i)Kdi/KdccThe Kd for incorrect (i) divided by the Kd for correct (c)kpol/KdFidelitydFidelity (F) is calculated as follows: [(kpol/Kd)c + (kpol/Kd)i]/[(kpol/Kd)i], where c and i represent correct and incorrect dNTPs, respectivelyWTeWT, wild type/Qs-1μmm-1 s-1C:dGTPWT11.5 ± 0.146 ± 11.91I260Q10.3 ± 0.5742 ± 50.24C:dATPWT0.013 ± 0.000342 ± 488570.000316,16224I260Q0.014 ± 0.00115 ± 27360.40.00093259C:dTTPWT0.015 ± 0.0005466 ± 8767110.000238,30516I260Q0.017 ± 0.0000136 ± 06060.90.00047511C:dCTPWT0.0023 ± 0.015 ± 25,0002.50.0001512,73430I260Q0.0028 ± 0.00035 ± 13,6790.10.00056430a Units are micromolarb The kpol for correct (c) is divided by kpol for incorrect (i)c The Kd for incorrect (i) divided by the Kd for correct (c)d Fidelity (F) is calculated as follows: [(kpol/Kd)c + (kpol/Kd)i]/[(kpol/Kd)i], where c and i represent correct and incorrect dNTPs, respectivelye WT, wild type Open table in a new tab The I260Q Polβ variant was identified in a genetic screen as an enzyme with an overall activity similar to wild type Polβ but with a significantly lower fidelity (19.Starcevic D. Dalal S. Sweasy J.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 44: 3775-3784Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the kinetic basis for the mutator phenotype of I260Q Polβ. Strikingly, I260Q binds the correct nucleotide with significantly lower affinity and incorrect nucleotides with 2–6-fold higher affinities than the wild type enzyme. Therefore, the kinetic basis for the mutator phenotype of I260Q lies in its inability to discriminate the correct from the incorrect dNTP during the binding step of nucleotide incorporation. Because residue 260 is located on the inside lining of the hydrophobic pocket within the hinge region that is between the catalytic and the COOH-terminal domains of Polβ, our kinetic data suggest that this hinge and the associated domain motions are important for polymerase fidelity. The Hinge Functions in the Geometric Alignment of Substrates—The hinge region is located at the interface between the catalytic domain (residues 149–262) and the COOH-terminal domain (residues 263–338) of Polβ. Both domains present residues toward the large active site cleft that are crucial for template binding, nascent base pair recognition, and catalytic turnover (14.Sawaya M.R. Pelletier H. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1930-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 15.Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 16.Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Strands β2, β7, and helix M are located close to the hinge axis, and the network of interactions extending from the residues in this region is likely to moderate the extent of domain motions. Careful analysis of the relative domain motions observed in various Polβ-substrate complexes identified the loops near Val-177 and Cys-178 and Pro-261, Lys-262, and Asp-263 as hinge boundaries. The flexibility of the two loops allows for the bulk movement of secondary structural elements within the COOH-terminal domain. Other residues, including but not limited to Leu-194, Thr-196, Cys-178, Ile-260, Gly-268, Val-269, and Phe-272, contribute interactions necessary for the maintenance and function of an intricate hydrophobic network along the hinge region. Some of these side chains also display obvious movements upon domain closure. Therefore, it is conceivable that the hinge, as orchestrated by the movement of some of these residues, controls the extent and the dynamics of the enzyme closure around the substrates (15.Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 16.Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Arg-258, Tyr-271, Arg-283, Asn-294, Glu-295, and Tyr-296 are layered immediately above the hydrophobic hinge region and form a major part of the template binding site. Rotation of the COOH-terminal domain results in enzyme activation by positioning the template, the 3′-OH of the primer, the base, and the α-phosphate of the incoming dNTP such that rapid and accurate nucleotide incorporation can occur. Ile-260 Is Critically Involved in Domain Closure—Ile-260 is located near the hinge axis and in the wild type enzyme contributes to the formation of a hydrophobic core. Upon comparison of several high-resolution Polβ co-crystal structures, the Ile-260 side chain is consistently found in either of two different conformations. The χ2 angle changes such that Cδ is alternating between the “up” and the “down” position, thereby affecting the packing against the adjacent hydrophobic residues. Interestingly, the volume of a small cavity above Ile-260 appears to be altered by the χ2 switch as well. This cavity, as depicted in Fig. 4, could feasibly act as a buffer space absorbing local motions and allowing a specific flexing in the hinge between the COOH-terminal and the catalytic domains of Polβ. The mutation from Ile-260 to Gln is associated with a slight change in side chain volume as well as a significant change in chemical nature. When altered from Ile to Gln, the small cavity above position 260 disappears. If the side chain amide group moves into the interior of the protein core, the hydrophobic packing would most likely be disrupted. However, analysis of the three most frequent rotamers using PYMOL along with molecular modeling indicate that the amide side chain is most likely oriented away from the adjacent hydrophobic residues and points toward the charged residues on the surface of the template binding cleft. These local changes could result in a polymerase that may not close properly and efficiently, thereby leading to a less stable but active conformation in the I260Q variant as compared with wild type Polβ. Aberrant positioning of the dNTP-binding residues within the active site of the enzyme could certainly affect dNTP affinity in the mutant enzyme. This suggestion is consistent with the recently published structures of the wild type enzyme in complex with mismatched bases at the active site (26.Krahn J.M. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1823-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). They indicate that there might be an intermediate so-called “semi-open” complex that occurs after dNTP binding but before chemistry (26.Krahn J.M. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1823-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The complexes showed that the bases stagger and form alternate hydrogen bonds with the surrounding polymerase residues. Such staggered bases partially overlap, thus preventing the fingers from properly closing and forming the optimal active site (26.Krahn J.M. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1823-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We suggest that the active site of I260Q may also be in a semi-open conformation. I260Q Is Important for dNTP Binding and Positioning— Molecular modeling suggests that the change of Ile-260 to Gln introduces small but significant shifts in adjacent hydrophobic residues that form part of the dNTP binding pocket, namely Tyr-271 and Phe-272 (15.Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Reordering of these side chains adjacent to the ribose moiety of the incoming dNTP affects nucleotide binding as has been shown by biochemical studies published previously (27.Vande Berg B.J. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3408-3416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Alteration of Phe-272 to Leu leads to a decrease in the binding affinity for the dNTP substrate and an enzyme with lower fidelity (28.Li S.X. Vaccaro J.A. Sweasy J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4800-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Asn-279, a direct spatial neighbor of Phe-272, forms a minor groove interaction with the incoming substrate such that incorrect dNTPs most likely protrude into the minor groove and clash with Asn-279. Alteration of Asn-279 to Ala results in an inaccurate enzyme with significantly less affinity for correct dNTP substrate (29.Kraynov V.S. Werneburg B.G. Zhong X. Lee H. Ahn J. Tsai M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The reshaping of the dNTP binding pocket geometry when Ile-260 is altered to Gln is consistent with the finding that the I260Q Polβ shows a 5-fold increase in preference for the incorrect over the correct substrate during the binding step. Thus, we suggest that wild type Polβ does discriminate correct from incorrect substrates during dNTP binding and during subsequent steps in the catalytic cycle and not only during transition state chemistry, as has been proposed previously (30.Showalter A.K. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Ile-260 Is Important for Template Positioning—Based upon our modeling studies, changes in the size and the chemistry of residue 260 would be predicted to cause significant shifts in the position of surface residues of the COOH-terminal domain. As a result, the position of the template DNA could be critically affected, which in turn has long range effects on the geometry of the Watson-Crick binding pocket. The templating base forms an integral part of the Watson-Crick binding pocket and an aberrant geometry could be more permissive for accepting and incorporating the incorrect dNTP. This possibility has been explored and substantiated by molecular modeling studies. In our modeling studies, we have found changes in the side chain positions of residues Arg-258, Glu-295, and Tyr-296 as a result of altering Ile-260 to Gln. Consequently, the template DNA is repositioned relative to where it would be expected to be found in the wild type enzyme, thereby affecting the position of the templating base and changing the geometry of the Watson-Crick binding pocket. The subtle structural changes described above could conceivably explain why the I260Q variant has a lower affinity for the correct dNTP substrate and higher affinity than the parent enzyme for the incorrect dNTP substrate, thus, leading to a significant drop in fidelity as compared with wild type Polβ. Summary and Implications—Our data show that changing hinge residue 260 of Polβ from Ile to Gln results in a polymerase that has nearly wild type activity but is a mutator mutant. We find that the kinetic basis for misincorporation by I260Q lies in loss of discrimination at the level of dNTP substrate binding. Our modeling studies indicate that the Gln mutant affects the domain closure around the DNA substrate, that the protein matrix around the ribose moiety of the incoming nucleotide is altered, and that the DNA template could be positioned differently in this variant than in the wild type enzyme (19.Starcevic D. Dalal S. Sweasy J.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 44: 3775-3784Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). DNA binding is the first step in the catalytic cycle, and it is likely that repositioning of the DNA substrate would consequently affect the subsequent steps, particularly dNTP binding and chemistry. Based on our finding that the I260Q variant has a decreased affinity for the correct nucleotide and increased affinity for the incorrect one, we propose that this mutant is less well adapted to form a nucleotide binding pocket with a geometry similar to that of wild type Polβ that supports catalysis. Subtle changes in a small and compact enzyme such as Polβ can have dramatic effects, making it an excellent model to further our understanding of mechanistic aspects of polymerase fidelity.

There are two distinct types of Streptomyces PLD; one is an iron-containing enzyme from Streptomyces chromofuscus, which is activated by Ca2+ (8Yang H. Roberts M.F. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2958-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the other is a member of a superfamily, which includes cardiolipin synthases, phosphatidylserine synthases, poxvirus envelope proteins, a Yersinia murine toxin, and several endonucleases (9Sung T.C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 10Stuckey J.A. Dixon J.E.

A. 2001; 98: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). All members of this superfamily contain one or two copies of the conserved HXKXXXXD (HKD) motif. On the other hand, the S. chromofuscus PLD does not contain the HKD motif (8Yang H. Roberts M.F. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2958-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but instead has a tightly bound iron that is necessary for catalytic activity (12Zambonelli C. Casali M. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52282-52289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In a previous enzymatic kinetic study, it has been proposed that PLDs in this family share a two-step mechanism involving nucleophilic attack by one of the histidines of the HKD motifs on the phosphodiester with formation of a phosphatidylhistidine intermediate accompanied by the release of a base, followed by an attack by water or an alcohol on the phosphohistidine intermediate to release PA or the transphosphatidylation product and regenerate free enzyme (13Waite M.

A. 1998; 95: 9202-9207Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently, a study on the crystal structure of the PLD from Streptomyces sp. PMF strain (PMFPLD), which contains two HKD motifs, with substrate supported the reaction mechanism of the PLD superfamily mentioned above and indicated that a histidine residue in the N-terminal HKD motif acted as the nucleophile that attacks the phosphorus atom of the substrate phospholipids (17Leiros I. McSweeney S. Hough E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 805-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The PMFPLD catalyzed its reaction through a covalent mechanism and a phosphatidylhistidyl intermediate, whereas S. chromofuscus PLD utilizes the direct attack of water or alcohol on the phosphorus atom (18Yang H. Roberts M.F. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2087-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Previously, we have screened PLD-producing Actinomycetes species, and evaluated the activity of several PLDs. The PLD from Streptomyces septatus TH-2 (TH-2PLD) possessed two HKD motifs and showed the highest transphosphatidylation activity among them (19Hagishita T. Nishikawa M. Hatanaka T. Biotechnol. Lett. 2000; 22: 1587-1590Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although the primary sequences among Streptomyces PLDs showed high homology (identity of about 70%), these PLDs exhibited different activity in transphosphatidylation (20Hatanaka T. Negishi T. Kubota-Akizawa M. Hagishita T. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2002; 31: 233-241Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Hatanaka T. Negishi T. Mori K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1696: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that other residues apart from the two HKD motifs are involved in the recognition of phospholipids. However, these residues have not yet been identified experimentally. In another study, we found two amino acid residues related to the thermostability of Streptomyces PLD containing HKD motifs using RIBS (repeat-length independent and broad spectrum) in vivo DNA shuffling. This system is a novel method of random chimeragenesis based on the combination of highly frequent deletion formation in the Escherichia coli ssb-3 strain with an rpsL-based chimera selection system (22Mori K. Mukaihara T. Uesugi Y. Iwabuchi M. Hatanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study, to investigate amino acid residues related to the PLD-catalyzed reaction, we constructed chimeras between TH-2PLD and PLDP from a distinct Streptomyces sp., which has been used extensively in transphosphatidylation reactions (5Juneja L.R. Hibi T. Yamane T. Shimizu S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1987; 27: 146-151Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 6Juneja L.R. Kazuoka T. Goto T. Yamane T. Shimize S. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. 1994; 58: 1716-1717Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), using RIBS in vivo DNA shuffling, and compared chimeras in terms of activities. Furthermore, the effect of the identified amino acid residues on the recognition of phospholipids was analyzed by surface plasmon spectroscopy. Materials—pETKmS2 (23Mishima N. Mizumoto K. Iwasaki Y. Nakano H. Yamane T. Biotechnol. Prog. 1997; 13: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Tsuneo Yamane, Nagoya University, Japan. Phosphatidyl-p-nitrophenol (PpNP) was prepared from soybean phosphatidic acid and p-nitrophenol according to the procedure of D'Arrigo et al. (24D'Arrigo P. Piergianni V. Scarcelli D. Servi S. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1995; 304: 249-254Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) was purchased from Avanti and used without further purification. All the other chemicals were of the highest purity available. The pldp Gene Synthesis—Hokkaido System Science synthesized the artificial pldp gene on the basis of the sequence described in Ref. 25.Takahara, M., Houriyou, K., and Imamura, S. (1993) Japanese patent, JP1993252935-A/1Google Scholar. We altered the gene by a silent mutation to facilitate its expression in E. coli. First, we altered several codons for Pro, Ser, and Arg at the third nucleotide to cytosine because the expression of the th-2pld gene including a codon for Ser with adenine or thymine at the third nucleotide in E. coli was unsuccessful. 2T. Hatanaka, personal data. We then added an EcoRI site and an NcoI site to the 5′-end of the gene, and added a BamHI site to the 3′-end to construct a vector for RIBS shuffling. Finally, the BamHI site in the wild-type pldp gene was deleted by silent mutation to construct the vector. The pldp fragment was cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI gap of pUC19, and the resulting plasmid pUC19(pldp) was obtained. Construction of Plasmids for RIBS in Vivo DNA Shuffling—The plasmids for RIBS in vivo DNA shuffling was constructed as detailed previously (22Mori K. Mukaihara T. Uesugi Y. Iwabuchi M. Hatanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For RIBS in vivo DNA shuffling, a plasmid that contained the pldp and th-2pld genes cloned in tandem was constructed as follows. The pldp gene in plasmid pUC19 was digested with NcoI and BamHI, then the pldp gene was ligated into the NcoI-BglII gap of plasmid pACTIS4b (22Mori K. Mukaihara T. Uesugi Y. Iwabuchi M. Hatanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to obtain pACTIS4b(pldp). Next, the th-2pld gene in pBluescript was digested with EcoRV and BamHI, and the gene was ligated into the PmaCI-BamHI gap of plasmid pACTIS4b(pldp), yielding pACTIS4b(pldp/th-2pld). Then, the Gmr-rpsL+ cassette from pNC124 (22Mori K. Mukaihara T. Uesugi Y. Iwabuchi M. Hatanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was digested with KpnI, and the cassette was inserted into the KpnI site between the two pld genes in pACTIS4b(pldp/th-2pld) to construct pACTIS4b(pldp/Gmr-rpsL+/th-2pld) (Fig. 2A). The resulting vector was used for RIBS in vivo DNA shuffling. Random Chimeragenesis of PLD Genes—Two homologous genes (pldp and th-2pld) were placed in the same direction, and a cassette containing the Gmr and E. coli rpsL+ genes was inserted between them. rpsL+ encodes the ribosomal protein S12 (22Mori K. Mukaihara T. Uesugi Y. Iwabuchi M. Hatanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the target of Sm. E. coli MK1019 (ssb-3 rpsL(Smr)) was prepared as a host for chimeragenesis. A certain mutation in the genomic rpsL gene led this strain to Smr. The transformation of MK1019 with pACTIS4b(pldp/Gmr-rpsL+/th-2pld) altered the phenotype of cells from Smr to Sms (and also Gms to Gmr), because the Sms ribosome was reconstituted with the wild-type RpsL protein encoded by the plasmid. When recombination occurs between two homologous genes, the Gmr-rpsL+ cassette is simultaneously deleted from the plasmid, and the cells reverse their phenotype from Sms/Gmr to Smr/Gms. The Gmr gene excludes the accidental deletion of the Gmr-rpsL+ cassette. In strain MK1019, the expression levels of chimeric pld genes in resulting plasmids are negligible, because these genes are controlled by the T7-lac promoter; however, this strain does not have T7 RNA polymerase. Moreover, leaky expression must be repressed by LacI encoded by the plasmid. Thus, the intact form of the chimeric gene is selectable without expression. E. coli MK1019 was transformed with pACTIS4b(pldp/Gmr-rpsL+/th-2pld) by electroporation, and transformants were selected on LB plates containing chloramphenicol and gentamicin. The sensitivities of Cmr/Gmr transformants to streptomycin (Sms) were confirmed on LB plates containing chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and streptomycin. Sms transformants from each host were cultivated in the LB medium containing chloramphenicol. Cultures were spread on LB plates containing chloramphenicol with streptomycin. Plasmids isolated from 48 selected Smr revertants from each host were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The 1.6-kb DNA fragment containing the PLD gene on isolated plasmids was amplified by PCR using a GC-rich PCR system (Roche Applied Science) with primers corresponding to the coding regions of the pelB signal (5′-CGACCGCTGCTGCTGGTCTGC-3′) and His6 tag (5′-TGGTGGTGGTGCTCGAGTGCGGC-3′). Recombination sites were mapped on the basis of the change in the pattern of the digestion of these fragments with several restriction endonucleases and determined in detail by DNA sequencing. Construction of Expression Vectors of Chimera C and D Mutants—To identify the amino acid residues related to activities, we constructed chimera C and D mutants by PCR amplification. To prepare the mutants (C-1, C-2, and D-GD), the following three mutagenic sense primers, where the HinfI site (underlined) was substituted with a silent mutation, were synthesized, 5′-GGTGG(C→A)ATCAACG(G→A, Gly→Asp)CTGGAAG-3′ (corresponding to the chimera C gene, nucleotide (nt) 574–594), 5′-GTGG(C→A)ATCAACG(G→A, Gly→Asp)CTGGAAGG(A→C, Asp→Ala)CGAC-3′ (corresponding to the chimera C gene, nt 575–600), and 5′-GGTGG(C→A)ATCAACG(A→G, Asp→Gly)CTGGAAGG(C→A, Ala→Asp)CGAC-3′ (corresponding to the chimera D gene, nt 575–600), respectively. The target mutation was introduced with the primer sets of 5′-TTGTGGTGCTGCGCGTACGGC-3′ (a reverse primer, corresponding to the chimera C gene, nt 1314–1334) and each of the mutagenic primers using the GC-rich PCR system. The partial pldp gene was amplified by PCR with a combination of a forward primer 5′-GCACCGAGGGCAACGCGCTGGA-3′ (a forward primer, corresponding to the chimera C gene, nt 119–140) and a reverse primer (5′-CGTTGAT(G→T)CCACCGGTGATCACGC-3′ for silent mutation of the HinfI site (underlined), corresponding to the nucleotide sequence from the chimera C gene, 563–586). The amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the T-vector pGEM-TEasy (Promega), and the resultant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids representing C-1, C-2, and D-GD were digested with HinfI and BamHI. The plasmid containing HinfI site was digested with PstI and HinfI. The fragments were ligated into the PstI-BamHI gap of vector pACTIS4b chimera D to construct the expression vector. To prepare the mutants (C-3, C-4, and C-5), the following three mutagenic antisense primers, where the ApaI site (underlined) was substituted with a silent mutation, were synthesized, 5′-GGC(C→G)GGCCCGGTCAGCGCGAGGTC(GG→GA, Ala→Val)C GTC(GG-T→CGA, Thr→Ser)CACCGGGTGGGAGGT(C→G, Gln→Asp)TC-3′ (corresponding to the chimera D gene, nt 588–633), 5′GGC(C→G)GGCCCGGTCAGCGCGAGGTC(GG→GA, Ala→Val)CGTC(GGT→CGA, Thr→Ser)-3′ (corresponding to the chimera D gene, nt 603–633), and 5′-GGC(C→G)GGCCCGGTCAGCGCGAGGTC(GG→GA, Ala→Val)CGTC-3′ (corresponding to the chimera D gene, nt 604–633), respectively. The target mutation was introduced with the primer sets of 5′-GCACCGAGGGCAACGCGCTGGA-3′ (a forward primer, corresponding to the chimera D gene, nt 119–140) and each of the mutagenic primers described above using the GC-rich PCR system. The partial th-2pld gene was amplified by PCR with a combination of a forward primer (5′-ACCGG(D→G)CCCGCCGCCGGCTCCGCGGGC-3′ for silent mutation of the ApaI site (underlined), corresponding to the nucleotide sequence from the chimera D gene, 624–648) and a reverse primer (5′-TTGTGGTGCTGCGCGTACGGC-3′, corresponding to the complement of the chimera D gene, nt 1314–1334). The amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the T-vector pGEM-TEasy (Promega), and the resultant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids representing C-3, C-4, and C-5 were digested with PstI and ApaI. The plasmid containing ApaI site was digested with ApaI and AatII. The fragments were ligated into the PstI-AatII gap of vector pACTIS4b chimera D to construct the expression vector. Construction of Inactive Mutants (C(H170A), C(H443A), C-2(H170A), and C-2(H443A)—To investigate the effect of the identified residues on the recognition of phospholipids, independent of the two HKD motifs that are essential for catalysis, we constructed mutants in which the His170 or His443 of the N- or C-terminal HKD motifs of TH-2PLD was substituted with Ala. To prepare the mutants (C(H170A) and C-2(H170A)), the mutagenic gene was amplified by PCR with a combination of a forward primer (5′-CGACCGCTGCTGCTGGTCTGC-3′, corresponding to part of the pelB signal sequence) and a reverse primer (5′-CCGTCGACCACCAGCAGCTTGGCG(TG→GC, His→Ala)GTTC-3′ (corresponding to the pldp gene, nt 528–557). Then, the amplified DNA fragment was cloned, sequenced, and digested with BstXI and BamHI. The plasmid (pUC19(C) or pUC19(C-2)) was digested with PstI and BstXI. The fragments were ligated into the PstI-BamHI gap of vector pETKmS2PLDP to construct the expression vector. To prepare the mutants (C(H443A) and C-2(H443A)), the mutagenic gene was amplified by PCR with a combination of a forward primer (5′-CCCTGCGCGCGCTCGTCGGCA-3′, corresponding to the th-2pld gene, 962–982) and a reverse primer (5′-ACCAGCTTGTGG(TG→GC, His→Ala)CTGCGCGTACG-3′ (corresponding to the th-2pld gene, nt 1316–1340). Then, the amplified DNA fragment was cloned, sequenced, and digested with BglII and Van91I. The plasmid (pUC19(C) or pUC19(C-2)) was digested with BglII and Van91I. The fragment was exchanged for the homologous region of the subcloned chimera C or C-2 gene. The resultant mutant genes were digested with NcoI and BamHI. The fragment was ligated into the NcoI-BamHI gap of vector pETKmS2. Expression and Purification of PLDs—E. coli BL21-Gold(DE3) (Invitrogen) was transformed with PLD expression plasmids. Expression was carried out according to a method described previously (26Hatanaka T. Negishi T. Kubota-Akizawa M. Hagishita T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1598: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in the presence of appropriate antibiotics (chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) for strains harboring plasmids obtained from the random chimeragenesis and plasmids derived from pETKmS2, respectively) except for the addition of premixed protease inhibitor tablet Complete™, Mini, EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science) at the induction period (one tablet per culture). Cultures were centrifuged for 60 min at 3,500 × g. The culture broth was concentrated with an ultrafiltration device using Amicon Ultra (Millipore, 30-kd cut), and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). His-tagged PLDs were purified using Magextractor-His Tagg (TOYOBO). The purified PLDs were dialyzed against 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.5). Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins—SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1979; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) using a 15% acrylamide gel. The molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences) included phosphorylase b, albumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase, trypsin inhibitor, and α-lactalbumin. Proteins on the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) and destained with water. Assay for PLD Activities using PpNP—Hydrolytic activity was determined based on the hydrolytic activity of PpNP. The procedure was similar to the method described previously (20Hatanaka T. Negishi T. Kubota-Akizawa M. Hagishita T. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2002; 31: 233-241Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PLD-catalyzed transphosphatidylation activity was determined by measuring the production of p-nitrophenol from PpNP and ethanol according to the method that used a biphasic system consisting of benzene and water as described previously (20Hatanaka T. Negishi T. Kubota-Akizawa M. Hagishita T. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2002; 31: 233-241Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One unit of PLD was defined as the amount of the enzyme that released 1 μmol of p-nitrophenol per minute under the assay conditions. PLDs used in this study showed both hydrolysis and transphosphatidylation activities in the absence of Ca2+. The kinetic assays for both activities were carried out as described previously (20Hatanaka T. Negishi T. Kubota-Akizawa M. Hagishita T. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2002; 31: 233-241Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the assay of hydrolytic activity, the reactions were carried out in 1.5-ml cuvettes; the 1-ml reaction mixture consisted of PpNP at final concentrations ranging from 0.11 to 2 mm in 0.1 m acetate buffer (pH 5.5) and the purified PLDs. In the assay for transphosphatidylation activity, the reactions were carried out in 1.5-ml sample tubes; the 400-μl reaction mixture consisted of PpNP at a final concentrations ranging from 1.8 to 20 mm, and ethanol at final concentration of 500 mm, in an emulsion containing benzene and acetate buffer (pH 5.5). The purified PLDs (200 ng) were used in the assay. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)—Another enzyme assay for PLD-catalyzed transphosphatidylation was performed by TLC using 10 mm PpNP or POPC as the substrate. The reaction conditions were similar to those mentioned above except for the use of acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 4 mm CaCl2. After centrifugation, the organic layer of the reaction mixture was applied to a TLC plate (60 F254, Merck) and developed with chloroform/methanol/water (30:10:1, v/v). Lipids on the TLC plate were detected by spraying with 5% sodium phosphomolybdate/ethanol solution. Then, the plate was dried and scanned. The intensity of the spot corresponding to phosphatidyl ethanol (PEtOH) was analyzed using Scion Image software. The relative activity of PLD was calculated as chimera C-2 activity toward PpNP or POPC. Preparation of Vesicles—An appropriate aliquot of POPC dissolved in chloroform was evaporated and further dried under a vacuum for at least 3 h. The lipid was hydrated at a concentration of 10 mm in phosphate-buffered saline. Then, the lipid suspensions were vortexed vigorously and frozen and thawed 10 times in liquid nitrogen. The multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) were passed 30 times through polycarbonate membranes (50 nm pore diameter) using a Lipofast extruder (28MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar) (Avestin), to obtain small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore)—Real time interaction between PLD molecules and phospholipids were measured using a Biacore instrument (BIAcore 2000, Biacore AB). Liposomes were captured onto the surface of a Sensor Chip L1 (Biacore AB). The surface of the L1 sensor chip was first cleaned with 20 mm CHAPS at a flow rate of 5 μl/min followed by the injection of SUVs (60 μl, 0.5 mm lipid concentration) at a flow rate of 2 μl/min in buffer A (10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 4 mm CaCl2), which resulted in the deposition of ∼7000–8000 resonance units. To measure the association of PLDs with lipids, purified chimera C or C-2 (79–266 nm diluted in buffer A) was applied to the captured SUVs at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. After binding of PLDs to phospholipids, the dissociation process was observed at the same flow rate for 10 min. The evaluation of the kinetic parameters for PLD binding to lipids was performed by nonlinear fitting of binding data using the BIA evaluation 4.1 analysis software. The apparent association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants were evaluated from the differential binding curves (sample control) as shown in Fig. 7 assuming an A + B = AB association type for the protein-lipid interaction. The affinity constant KD was calculated from the equation KD = kd/ka. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—The secondary structures of PLDs were determined by CD spectroscopy using a J-720WI spectrometer (Jasco). Proteins were dissolved to a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.5). Spectra were acquired at 25 °C using a 1-cm cuvette. Molar ellipticities (per residue) were calculated using the equation [θ] = 100(θ)/(lcN), where [θ] is the molar ellipticity per residue, (θ) is the observed ellipticity in degrees, l is the optical pathlength in centimeters, c is the molar concentration of the protein, and N is the number of residues in the protein. Statistical Analysis—All statistical evaluations were performed by an unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance (ANOVA). All data are presented as means ± S.D. of at least three determinations. Construction of Chimeric PLDs—The chimeric pld genes were obtained when the plasmid pACTIS4b (Fig. 2A) for RIBS in vivo DNA shuffling was transformed into the ssb-3 mutant. The recombination sites were widely distributed over the entire chimeric pld gene except for in the N-(1–283) terminal region. We chose eight typical chimeras having a recombination site in each restriction mapping region (Fig. 2B), and carried out the expression of the genes and purification of the protein products. The molecular weight of purified PLDs analyzed by SDS-PAGE was ∼57 kDa, which coincided with the calculated value (56.5 kDa) (Fig. 2C). Comparison of Activities for Chimeric PLDs—To determine the region related to hydrolysis and transphosphatidylation reactions, we first analyzed the specific activities of two parental and eight chimeric PLDs (Fig. 3, A and B). Although chimeras A, B, C, and H had high transphosphatidylation activities similar to that of TH-2PLD, those of chimeras D–G had much lower activities than that of TH-2PLD (Fig. 3B, upper). Among the chimeric PLDs examined, chimera C had the highest transphosphatidylation activity. Interestingly, the transphosphatidylation activity of chimera C was significantly different from that of chimera D (Student's t test; p < 0.01), despite these two chimeras exhibiting equivalent hydrolytic activity (Student's t test; p > 0.05). A similar significant difference in activity was observed between chimera G and H. In this study, we first focused the difference between the activities of chimera C and D. Identification of Amino Acid Residues Related to Activities—In the primary structure, chimera C differed from chimera D in six residues (Fig. 4A). This suggests that some of these residues are related to the difference in activities. Therefore, we constructed five chimera C mutants (from C-1 to C-5, the primary sequence of which is presented in Fig. 4A), and estimated their activities. The transphosphatidylation activity of each chimera C mutant was considerably decreased in comparison to their hydrolytic activity (Fig. 4B). This result suggests that Gly188 contributes to the increase in transphosphatidylation activity. It should be noted that mutant C"
https://openalex.org/W2010467412,"U2AF has been characterized as an essential splicing factor required forefficient recruitment of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein to the3′-splice site in a pre-mRNA. The U2AF65 subunit binds to thepyrimidine tract of the pre-mRNA, whereas the U2AF35 subunitcontacts the 3′-splice site AG. Here we show that U2AF35appears to be completely dispensable for splicing in nuclear extracts preparedfrom adenovirus late-infected cells (Ad-NE). As a consequence, the viral IIIaand cellular IgM introns, which both have suboptimal 3′-splice sites andrequire U2AF35 for splicing in nuclear extracts from uninfectedcells, are transformed to U2AF35-independent introns in Ad-NE.Furthermore, we present evidence that two parallel pathways of 3′-splicesite recognition exist in Ad-NE. We show that the viral 52,55K intron, whichhas an extended pyrimidine tract, requires U2AF for activity in Ad-NE. Incontrast, the IgM intron, which has a weak 3′-splice site sequencecontext, undergoes the first catalytic step of splicing in U2AF-depletedAd-NE, suggesting that spliceosome assembly occurs through a novelU2AF-independent pathway in Ad-NE.

As a consequence, the viral IIIaand cellular IgM introns, which both have suboptimal 3′-splice sites andrequire U2AF35 for splicing in nuclear extracts from uninfectedcells, are transformed to U2AF35-independent introns in Ad-NE.Furthermore, we present evidence that two parallel pathways of 3′-splicesite recognition exist in Ad-NE. We show that the viral 52,55K intron, whichhas an extended pyrimidine tract, requires U2AF for activity in Ad-NE. Incontrast, the IgM intron, which has a weak 3′-splice site sequencecontext, undergoes the first catalytic step of splicing in U2AF-depletedAd-NE, suggesting that spliceosome assembly occurs through a novelU2AF-independent pathway in Ad-NE. The removal of introns from mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) is an essentialstep in eukaryotic gene expression. In the cell, splicing takes place within alarge macromolecular complex, the spliceosome, which consists of five smallnuclear ribonucleoproteins(snRNPs) 1The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; Ad-NE,nuclear extracts prepared from adenovirus late-infected cells; HeLa-NE,nuclear extracts prepared from uninfected HeLa spinner cells; DTT,dithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; Ad-NE,nuclear extracts prepared from adenovirus late-infected cells; HeLa-NE,nuclear extracts prepared from uninfected HeLa spinner cells; DTT,dithiothreitol. and manynon-snRNP splicing factors (reviewed in Refs.1Kambach C.

The critical step in 3′-splice site definition is the stablerecruitment of U2 snRNP to the 3′-splice site. U2 snRNP binds to thebranchpoint sequence through a base pairing interaction with this sequence andU2 snRNA (reviewed in Ref. 4Krämer A. Annu. Rev.Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar).Binding of U2 snRNP requires auxiliary splicing factors such as SF1/mBBP andU2AF (5Krämer A. Utans U. EMBOJ. 1991; 10: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). U2AF is a heterodimerconsisting of a 65- and a 35-kDa subunit. The U2AF65 subunit bindsspecifically to the pyrimidine tract through its RNA recognition domains(6Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), whereas U2AF35has been shown to make contact with the AG dinucleotide at the 3′-splicesite(7Wu S. Romfo C.M. Nilsen T.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 8Zorio D.A. Blumenthal T. RNA(N. Y.). 1999; 5: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Merendino L. Guth S. Bilbao D. Martinez C. Valcarcel J. Nature. 1999; 402: 838-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).In fact, introns appear to fall into one of two classes: AG-dependentintrons and AG-independent introns(10Reed R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2113-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The AG-dependent intronstypically have weak pyrimidine tracts, which make unstable interactions withU2AF65. In such introns, the U2AF35 interaction with the3′-splice site AG dinucleotide becomes important, by stabilizing theU2AF65 interaction with the pyrimidine tract(11Zuo P. Maniatis T. GenesDev. 1996; : 1356-1368Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In contrast,AG-independent introns do not require U2AF35 for activity. In suchintrons, binding of U2AF65 to the strong pyrimidine tract isusually sufficient to aid in the recruitment of U2 snRNP to the branchpointsequence (7Wu S. Romfo C.M. Nilsen T.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).We are using the adenovirus major late region 1 (L1) as a model pre-mRNA tostudy the mechanisms controlling alternative splice site usage inadenovirus-infected cells. In the L1 unit, a common 5′-splice site canbe joined to two alternative 3′-splice sites, resulting in the formationof the so-called 52,55K (proximal 3′-splice site) or IIIa (distal3′-splice site) mRNAs. Early during virus infection, the 52,55K3′-splice site is used exclusively, whereas the IIIa splice site becomesthe preferred site in late virus-infected cells (reviewed in Ref.12Akusjärvi G. Stevenin J. Böhm P. Adenoviruses: Model and Vectors in Virus HostInteraction. Springer Verlag, Berlin2003: 253-286Google Scholar). Our previous work hasdemonstrated that regulated expression of the IIIa mRNA is, to a large extent,controlled by two sequence elements: a 49-nucleotide-long repressor element(the 3RE), which binds the SR family of splicing factors; and a28-nucleotide-long virus infection-dependent splicing enhancer (the 3VDE).Although we know much about the function of the 3RE (reviewed in Ref.12Akusjärvi G. Stevenin J. Böhm P. Adenoviruses: Model and Vectors in Virus HostInteraction. Springer Verlag, Berlin2003: 253-286Google Scholar), it appears clear that the3VDE is the major element responsible for the enhanced splicing phenotype ofthe IIIa mRNA late during virus infection(13Mühlemann O. Yue B.G. Petersen-Mahrt S. Akusjärvi G. Mol. Cell.Biol. 2000; 20: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The 3VDE is the minimalelement required to confer an enhanced splicing phenotype to a heterologoustranscript in nuclear extracts prepared from late virus-infected cells(Ad-NE). The 3VDE consists of the IIIa branch point sequence, pyrimidinetract, and AG dinucleotide. A limited mutational analysis of the 3VDE furtherrevealed that the IIIa pyrimidine tract is a critical element required for theactivated splicing of the IIIa pre-mRNA in Ad-NE(13Mühlemann O. Yue B.G. Petersen-Mahrt S. Akusjärvi G. Mol. Cell.Biol. 2000; 20: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,14Mühlemann O. Kreivi J.P. Akusjärvi G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7324-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, much to oursurprise, the increase in IIIa splicing did not correlate with an increasedbinding of U2AF65 to the IIIa pyrimidine tract. Collectively, ourresults have suggested that the splicing enhancer activity of 3VDE may operatethrough a mechanism that might, in fact, be U2AF-independent(13Mühlemann O. Yue B.G. Petersen-Mahrt S. Akusjärvi G. Mol. Cell.Biol. 2000; 20: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,15Kreivi J.P. Akusjärvi G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Here we extend these studies by examining the significance of the U2AFheterodimer for splicing in Ad-NE. Our results suggest that U2AF35is dispensable for splicing in Ad-NE. Thus, pre-mRNAs that are AG-dependent inHeLa-NE become AG-independent in Ad-NE. We further show that two parallelpathways of 3′-splice site recognition appear to function inadenovirus-infected cells. Consensus-type introns, containing long pyrimidinetracts, require U2AF65 for activity, whereas at least one modeltranscript, the cellular IgM pre-mRNA, undergoes the first catalytic step ofsplicing in U2AF-depleted AdNE. These results suggest that splicing of certainsuboptimal pre-mRNAs may be completely U2AF-independent in Ad-NE. Furthermore,the results indicate that a novel U2AF-independent pathway of spliceosomeassembly exists in late adenovirus-infected cells and that this pathwayappears to selectively favor splicing of weak 3′-splice sites, a featuretypical for many of the adenoviral introns that are activated late duringinfection.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Protein Expression—Plasmids encoding fortranscripts IIIa (pGDIIIa), AdML (pBSAd1), 52,55K (pGD52,55K), and IgM andIgM-GA/C (pIgM and pIgM-GA/C) have been described previously(13Mühlemann O.

Primer sequences are available uponrequest. Gst-U2AF65(6Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) was expressed and purifiedas described in the Amersham Biosciences manual.In Vitro Transcription—Radiolabeled pre-mRNAs were generatedby in vitro run-off transcription in the presence of 50 μCi of[α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), 1mm cap analog (m7G-(5′)ppp(5′)G; Amersham Biosciences),50 μm GTP, 50 μm CTP, 500 μm ATP,and 500 μm UTP(18Clarke P.A. Haynes S.R. RNA-ProteinInteraction Protocols. 118. HumanaPress, Totowa, NJ1999: 1-9Google Scholar). The IIIa and 52,55Kpre-mRNAs were transcribed with T7 polymerase from PCR-amplified products ofplasmids pGDIIIa and pGD52,55K using a common 5′-primer, T7-IIIa(5′-ATTAATACGACTCACTATAGAATACAAGCTTGGGACTCTTGG-3′), and a3′-primer, IIIa-U1 (5′-GTACTCACCCCCAGCGCCGCCCGCACC-3′) or52,55K-U1 (5′-GTACTCACCCCTCTTGCCGCTGCTGAG-3′). The PCR product fortranscription of the AdML pre-mRNA was generated using the primer pairpBSAd1:1U40 (5′-TATATAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAACAAAAGCTTGCATG-3′) andpBSAd1: 371L22 (5′-TCCAAGAGTACTGGAAAGACCG-3′). The IgM and theIgM-GA/C pre-mRNAs were transcribed directly from plasmid DNA linearized withXbaI. The IgM-GA/C-ext transcript was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase froma PCR-amplified product of plasmid IgM-GA/C using 5′-primer T7IgMp458(5′-ATTAATACGACTCACTATAGACATACGATTTAGGTGA-3′) and the3′-primer IgM-Xba (5′-GAAAGAAGACCATCTCAGAGATAAA-3′). After a2–4-h incubation, transcripts were gel-purified, precipitated, andre-dissolved in water.In Vitro Splicing Conditions—Nuclear extracts prepared fromuninfected (HeLa-NE) or adenovirus late-infected (20 h after infection) (AdNE)HeLa spinner cells were prepared as described previously(19Kreivi J.P. Zerivitz K. Akusjärvi G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,20Mühlemann O. Akusjärvi G. Wold W.S.M. Methods in Molecular Medicine. 21. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 203-216Google Scholar). Splicing reactions wereincubated at 30 °C for 90–180 min in a total volume of 25 μlcontaining 20–25 fmol of transcript; 40% HeLa-NE, Ad-NE,NE(ΔU2AF), or Ad(ΔU2AF); 2.6% polyvinyl alcohol; 12% glycerol; 12mm HEPES (pH 7.9); 60 mm KCl; 2 mm ATP; 20mm creatine phosphate; 0.3 mm DTT; and 2.5 mmMgCl2. Reactions were stopped by treatment with 40 μg ofproteinase K (Merck) in presence of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 12.5 mmEDTA, 1 μgof yeast tRNA, and 1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C. Afterprecipitation with 40 μl of 3 m sodium acetate and 1 ml of 99.5%ethanol, the RNA was resolved on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels.Depletion of U2AF by Oligo(dT)-cellulose Chromatography—HeLa-NE and Ad-NE were depleted from U2AF as described previously(21Valcarcel J. Martinez C. Green M.R. Richter J.D. mRNA Formation and Function. Academic Press, New York1997: 31-53Crossref Google Scholar). In brief, the nuclearextracts (1 ml) were adjusted to 1 m KCl and passed over a 5-mloligo(dT)-cellulose column (New England Biolabs) equilibrated with bindingbuffer containing 1 m KCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.5mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40.The column flow-through collected by this procedure yields the depletednuclear extract, NE(ΔU2AF) and Ad(ΔU2AF). The column was washedwith buffer E containing 2.5 m KCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.05%Nonidet P-40 followed by an elution step with buffer containing 2 mguanidine-HCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA,20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. The depletedextracts, the 2.5 m KCl wash fractions, and the recovered U2AFpreparations were dialyzed against buffer D (0.1 m KCl, 20mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 1mm DTT). After dialysis, proteins in the wash and U2AF-containingfractions were concentrated using Centricon centrifugal filter units (MWCO 3K;Amicon). The depleted extracts, wash fractions, and eluates were stored inaliquots at –70 °C until use.U2 snRNA Depletion—Oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavageof U2 snRNP in U2AF-depleted Ad-NE was done essentially as describedpreviously (22Lamond A.I. Sproat B.S. Higgins S.J. Hames B.D. RNA Processing: A Practical Approach. 135. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 103-140Google Scholar). Theoligonucleotides used were E15 directed against the 5′-end of U2 snRNAand R5S directed toward the 5S rRNA(23Black D.L. Chabot B. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 737-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 pmol ofrespective oligonucleotide was pre-incubated in Ad(ΔU2AF) for 5 min at30 °C before initiation of splicing using the IgM or IgM-GA/C transcripts.The conditions for splicing were as described above.Spliceosome Assembly—Standard splicing reactions were set upusing Ad-NE or Ad(ΔU2AF) and the 32P-labeled IgM-GA/Ctranscript. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, mixed withheparin (final concentration, 0.5 μg/μl), and resolved on a 4% (60:1acrylamide/bisacryalamide) native polyacrylamide gel, which was cast in abuffer containing 50 mm Tris-glycine and 5% glycerol. The gel wasrun in a cold room at 350 V for ∼2 h in the Tris-glycine buffer lackingglycerol.Western Blot—The extent of U2AF depletion was tested foreach depleted extract preparation by Western blotting comparing it with serialdilutions of 10 μl of HeLa-NE or Ad-NE (both with a total proteinconcentration of 10 mg/ml). Extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gelunder reducing conditions and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using asemidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). U2AF was detected using a polyclonalanti-U2AF35 antibody(11Zuo P. Maniatis T. GenesDev. 1996; : 1356-1368Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar) or a monoclonalanti-U2AF65 antibody (MC3)(24Gama-Carvallho M. Krauss R.D. Chiang L. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. CellBiol. 1997; 137: 975-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and visualized bychemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce).RESULTSIIIa Splicing Becomes AG-independent in Nuclear Extract Prepared fromAdenovirus-infected HeLa Cells—Introns containing weak pyrimidinetracts are typically AG-dependent. In such pre-mRNAs, the 3′-splice siteAG dinucleotide must be recognized by U2AF35 prior to the firstcatalytic step of the splicing reaction. In contrast, removal ofAG-independent introns requires the AG dinucleotide only during the secondcatalytic step. Therefore, AG-independent introns can still undergo the firstcatalytic step of splicing in transcripts where the 3′-splice site AGhas been mutated to GA. Such interrupted splicing reactions accumulate thecharacteristic exon 1 and exon 2-intron lariat splicing intermediates(25Reed R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1986; 46: 681-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar).The adenovirus IIIa 3′-splice site is considered to be a weak3′-splice site because it has a short pyrimidine tract and isinefficiently spliced in HeLa-NE(26Kreivi J.P. Zerivitz K. Akusjärvi G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2379-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). According to the currentmodel, this would suggest that the IIIa 3′-splice site should beclassified as an AG-dependent intron. To test this hypothesis, we mutated theIIIa 3′-splice site from AG/A to GA/C(Fig. 1, IIIa andIIIa-GA/C). We also changed the first nucleotide of thesecond exon because previous work has shown that this nucleotide has a stronginfluence on U2AF35 binding, with cytidine being less efficient inrecruiting U2AF35 compared with other nucleotides(7Wu S. Romfo C.M. Nilsen T.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).As a control for an AG-independent substrate, we used the adenovirus majorlate first intron (AdML), which is often used as a prototypical AG-independentintron (7Wu S. Romfo C.M. Nilsen T.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar,16Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1987; 49: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar,17Guth S. Tange T.O. Kellenberger E. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7673-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The major late introncontains a very strong pyrimidine tract(Fig. 1, AdML). Forthe same reason as described above, we changed the AdML 3′-splice sitefrom AG/A to GA/C (Fig. 1,AdML and AdML-GA/C). All four substrates weretested in in vitro splicing reactions using HeLa-NE or Ad-NE.The experimental conditions were selected such that the IIIa and AdML wildtype substrates should be spliced with a reasonable efficiency in both HeLa-NEand Ad-NE (Fig. 2, A andB, lanes 1 and 2). As has been shownfor HeLa-NE (7Wu S. Romfo C.M. Nilsen T.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar,16Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1987; 49: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar,17Guth S. Tange T.O. Kellenberger E. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7673-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and as one would haveexpected for Ad-NE, the mutated AdML-GA/C substrate could still undergo thefirst catalytic step of splicing in both types of extracts(Fig. 2B, lanes3 and 4).Fig. 2AG-independent splicing of the IIIa pre-mRNA in Ad-NE. Radiolabeledpre-mRNAs (A) IIIa, IIIa-GA/C, (B) AdML, AdML-GA/C, and(C) IIIa(-3VDE)-GA/C were spliced in HeLa-NE (NE) or Ad-NE(Ad), and products were resolved by gel electrophoresis andvisualized by autoradiography. The positions of splicing substrates, products,and intermediates are indicated schematically to the left of eachpanel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast, mutating the AG dinucleotide at the IIIa 3′-splice siteabolished all splicing activity in HeLa-NE(Fig. 2A, comparelanes 1 and 3), suggesting that IIIa, as predicted becauseof its weak sequence context(26Kreivi J.P. Zerivitz K. Akusjärvi G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2379-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), is an AG-dependentsubstrate. Interestingly, incubation of the IIIa-GA/C transcript in Ad-NEresulted in a very efficient accumulation of the first exon and the exon2-lariat splicing intermediate (Fig.2A, lane 4). This result was surprising becauseit suggests that the IIIa pre-mRNA was converted from an AG-dependent intronin HeLa-NE (Fig. 2A,lanes 1 and 3) to an AG-independent intron in Ad-NE(Fig. 1A, lane4). It is noteworthy that the accumulation of splicing intermediates didnot result from a general increase of the splicing activity in Ad-NE, as shownby the reactions using the wild type AdML substrate(Fig. 2B, comparelanes 1 and 2). In some experiments, splicing of theIIIa-GA/C transcript produced faint bands migrating at the position of theauthentic spliced mRNA and one band migrating slightly faster(Fig. 2A, lane4). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that the faster migratingspecies was a minor aberrant product resulting from the use of a cryptic AGdinucleotide located 10 nucleotides downstream of the authentic IIIa3′-splice site (data not shown). No cDNA product corresponding to anauthentic splicing event was observed with the IIIa-GA/C transcript,suggesting that the slower migrating species most likely was a breakdownproduct.To investigate whether the weak pyrimidine tract of IIIa(26Kreivi J.P. Zerivitz K. Akusjärvi G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2379-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was the critical elementin the IIIa pre-mRNA responsible for the AG-dependent splicing in HeLa-NE, wereplaced 3VDE with the branch site and pyrimidine tract from the rabbitβ-globin second intron. In addition, the globin 3′-splice site wasmutated from AG/A to GA/C. As shown in Fig.2C, splicing intermediates were visible in both HeLa-NEand Ad-NE with the IIIa(-3VDE)GA/C transcript, indicating, as one wouldexpect, that a strong pyrimidine tract can convert the IIIa transcript into anAG-independent substrate also in HeLa-NE.IgM Becomes an AG-independent Substrate in Nuclear Extract Preparedfrom Adenovirus-infected Cells—Hypothetically, the AG-independentsplicing of the IIIa pre-mRNA in Ad-NE might be part of a viral strategy toenhance splicing of introns with a weak 3′-splice site context, afeature typical for many of the late viral 3′-splice sites. To test thishypothesis, we used the well-characterized immunoglobulin μ pre-mRNAsubstrate in our assay system(17Guth S. Tange T.O. Kellenberger E. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7673-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,27Guth S. Martinez C. Gaur R.K. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8263-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,28Kan J.L.C. Green M. GenesDev. 1999; 13: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)(Fig. 1, IgM andIgM-GA/C). This pre-mRNA has been characterized as an AG-dependentsubstrate, which requires binding of U2AF35 to its 3′-splicesite for activity (17Guth S. Tange T.O. Kellenberger E. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7673-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,28Kan J.L.C. Green M. GenesDev. 1999; 13: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As expected from previousresults, splicing of the IgM transcript in HeLa-NE was abolished when the3′-splice site AG was mutated to GA(Fig. 3, lane 3). Incontrast, incubating the IgM-GA/C transcript in Ad-NE resulted in an efficientaccumulation of exon 1 and the exon 2-intron lariat splicing intermediatescharacteristic of the first catalytic step of splicing(Fig. 3, lane 4). Weconclude that the IgM pre-mRNA, like the IIIa pre-mRNA, was converted to anAG-independent substrate in Ad-NE. Collectively, our results suggest that thecellular splicing machinery may have undergone a major shift in activityduring virus infection, a shift that is not specific to viral transcripts.Fig. 3IgM splicing becomes AG-independent in Ad-NE. Radiolabeled IgM andIgM-GA/C pre-mRNAs were spliced in HeLa-NE (NE) or Ad-NE(Ad), and products were resolved by gel electrophoresis andvisualized by autoradiography. The positions of splicing substrates, products,and intermediates are indicated to the left of the panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)U2AF Is Required for Splicing of the Strong 52,55K Intron in NuclearExtracts Prepared from Infected Cells—We have previously shown thatintrons with a weak 3′-splice site context are activated in Ad-NE,whereas introns with a strong pyrimidine content are slightly repressed(14Mühlemann O. Kreivi J.P. Akusjärvi G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7324-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results presentedhere suggest that splicing of both types of introns becomesU2AF35-independent in Ad-NE. This finding prompted us toinvestigate whether the U2AF heterodimer was necessary for splicing in Ad-NE.For this experiment, U2AF was depleted from HeLa-NE and Ad-NE byoligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography(6Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar,29Ruskin B. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 207-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This protocol haspreviously been shown to remove both U2AF subunits almost to completion(21Valcarcel J. Martinez C.

The bound U2AF wassubsequently eluted from the column and used for reconstitution experiments.As shown in Fig. 4A,the depletion protocol was effective and removed U2AF65 andU2AF35 to undetectable levels in the NE(ΔU2AF) andAd(ΔU2AF) extracts, respectively (i.e. far below 1% of theinitial amount; see Fig.4B for a longer exposure).Fig. 4Efficient depletion of U2AF65 and U2AF35 fromHeLa-NE (NE) and Ad-NE by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography.A, a Western blot in which the amount of U2AF subunits in thedepleted extracts (lanes ΔU2AF) is compared withserial dilutions of HeLa-NE (100% to 1%) and Ad-NE (100% to 1%), the 2.5m KCl wash fraction (Wash), and the 2 mguanidine-HCl eluate (Eluted U2AF).

Forthis experiment, we choose the 52,55K pre-mRNA, which has an extendedpolypyrimidine tract (Fig. 1)that binds U2AF65 efficiently(14Mühlemann O. Kreivi J.P. Akusjärvi G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7324-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown inFig. 5, depletion of U2AF fromeither HeLa-NE or Ad-NE abolished 52,55K splicing completely(Fig. 5, lanes 2 and6). Re-addition of U2AF eluted from the oligo(dT) column restored52,55K pre-mRNA splicing in both the depleted HeLa-NE and Ad-NE(Fig. 5, lanes 3 and7). Taken together, these results are in agreement with theconclusion that splicing of an intron containing a strong polypyrimidine tract(Fig. 1) requires U2AF foractivity in both virus-infected and uninfected extracts. However, we found oneinteresting difference: supplementing HeLa-NE depleted of U2AF with arecombinant U2AF65 protein did not restore 52,55K splicing. Incontrast, the U2AF65 protein was able to restore 52,55K splicing inU2AF-depleted Ad-NE (Fig. 5,lane 8). This finding adds further support to our conclusion that3′-splice site recognition is altered in Ad-NE.Fig. 552,55K splicing is U2AF-dependent. A radiolabeled 52,55K pre-mRNAwas incubated under splicing conditions in Hela-NE (NE) or depletedNE(ΔU2AF) (lanes 1–4) or in Ad-NE (Ad) or Ad(ΔU2AF) (lanes 5–8). Reactions were supplemented with 400ng of U2AF recovered from the oligo(dT)-cellulose column (NE-U2AF) (lanes3 and 7) or 200 ng of a bacterially expressedGst-U2AF65 protein (lanes 4 and 8).

Here, we report that BAD dissociates from 14-3-3ζ at each G2/M phase of proliferating lymphoid cells. The cell cycle-dependent dissociation of BAD was associated with phosphorylation at Ser-128, whereas mutant S128A-BAD, in which Ser-128 was converted to alanine, remained associated with 14-3-3ζ throughout the cell cycle. Although the cell cycle-dependent dissociation of BAD per se did not induce apoptosis, growth factor deprivation induced prompt apoptosis at the G2/M phase but not at the G1 phase. In cells expressing S128A-BAD, growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis was markedly delayed and was accompanied by a delayed dephosphorylation of growth factor-dependent regulatory serine residues. These results indicate that BAD induces apoptosis upon detecting the coincidence of G2/M phase and growth factor deprivation.

These results indicate that BAD induces apoptosis upon detecting the coincidence of G2/M phase and growth factor deprivation. Growth factors are required for cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. The deprivation of appropriate growth factors induces apoptosis, causing elimination of hematopoietic cells (1Williams G.T. Smith C.A. Spooncer E. Dexter T.M. Taylor D.R. Nature. 1990; 343: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). A BH3 only protein, BAD, plays a gatekeeper role in growth factor-dependent cell survival by regulating the mitochondrial threshold for apoptosis (2Downward J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E33-E35Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 3Klumpp S. Krieglstein J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It has been shown that BAD is phosphorylated and associated with 14-3-3 proteins in the presence of growth factors. Upon deprivation of growth factors, BAD is dephosphorylated and dissociates from 14-3-3 to bind to Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 on the mitochondria, and the translocation of BAD will reduce the threshold for apoptosis and markedly enhance cell death (4Zha J.

Another phosphorylation site at Ser-155 of BAD blocks the binding of BAD to Bcl-xL or to Bcl-2 (17Tan Y. Demeter M.R. Ruan H. Comb M.J. J. Biol.

The importance of these functional residues was demonstrated in BAD knock-in mice in which each of the regulatory serine residues (Ser-112, -136, and -155) was converted to alanine. Growth factor-dependent survival was attenuated in cells from the immune and nervous systems of the mutant knock-in mice (5Datta S.R. Ranger A.M. Lin M.Z. Sturgill J.F. Ma Y.C. Cowan C.W. Dikkes P. Korsmeyer S.J. Greenberg M.E. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 631-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Ser-128 of BAD is another functional site, the phosphorylation of which enhances neuronal apoptosis by preventing the association between BAD and 14-3-3. The phosphorylation of Ser-128 by Cdc2 was observed when granule cells of the developing rat cerebellum received death signals (19Donovan N. Becker E.B. Konishi Y. Bonni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40944-40949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 20Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Although the effect of Cdc2 was observed in nonproliferating neurons, Cdc2 is an essential enzyme for mitosis progression in proliferating cells. If Cdc2 also phosphorylates Ser-128 of BAD in proliferating cells, it is possible that the association between BAD and 14-3-3 is regulated not only by growth factors but also by the cell cycle. If this is the case, BAD-mediated apoptosis upon the withdrawal of a growth factor may be cell cycle-dependent. However, the cell cycle dependence of BAD-mediated apoptosis has not been clarified. To study the association between BAD and 14-3-3 along with the cell cycle progression in proliferating cells, we developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 1The abbreviations used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; IL-3, interleukin-3; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; PKA, protein kinase A. -based assay system to monitor their association. We fused the variants of the green fluorescent protein to BAD and to 14-3-3ζ, which binds to BAD and has an anti-apoptotic effect (21Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Zhang H. Fu H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Yang H. Masters S.C. Wang H. Fu H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A significant FRET signal was observed upon the association between BAD and 14-3-3ζ. We show here that BAD and 14-3-3ζ are associated at the G1 phase but are dissociated in the G2/M phase in interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent FL5.12 lymphoid cells. The dissociation of the two molecules was regulated by the phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-128. When the cells were deprived of IL-3, apoptosis occurred immediately at the G2/M phase but not at the G1 phase. These results demonstrate a novel cell cycle-dependent regulation of apoptosis by BAD. Protein Expression in Escherichia coli and Purification—DNAs encoding BAD (NM_007522) and 14-3-3ζ (U57312) were obtained from a mouse brain cDNA library (Clontech). The plasmids pECFP-N1 and pEYFP-N1, encoding enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), respectively, were obtained from Clontech. A point mutation in the BAD gene (Ser-128 → Ala-128) was generated by a mutagenic PCR technique. All the PCR-amplified DNAs were sequenced (LRT; Amersham Biosciences) to ensure no errors had been introduced during amplification. The DNAs were inserted into pET23d (Stratagene) and introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Stratagene). The cells were grown to an A600 of 0.5 in the 2xYT medium at either 16 °C for BAD-CFP or 25 °C for 14-3-3ζ-YFP. Recombinant gene expression was induced by incubation in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalacto-pyranoside for 24 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and broken with a French press. The recombinant proteins were purified from the cell lysate using a resin with an affinity for His-tagged proteins, Talon (Clontech), and gel filtration chromatography (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200pg, Amersham Biosciences). The gel filtration column was equilibrated with HEPES-buffered solution (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Protein yields were evaluated on the basis of the absorbance at the peak wavelengths of each fluorescent protein. An aliquot of the purified BAD-CFP was treated with PKA (New England Biolabs) at 30 °C for 1 h in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2. Surface Plasmon Resonance—We used BIAcore2000 (BIAcore) for surface plasmon analysis. Purified BAD-CFP (20 μg/ml) was coupled to the CM5 sensor chip surface using the standard amine coupling procedure to yield a signal of 80 resonance units. BAD-CFP immobilized on the chip was phosphorylated at 30 °C by injecting PKA in HEPES-buffered solution containing 1 mm MgCl2 for 60 min at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. As an analyte, 300 nm 14-3-3ζ-YFP in HEPES-buffered solution was injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 25 °C. Fluorescence Spectra—The fluorescence spectra of the proteins (concentration 10 μm) in a solution containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin were obtained using a spectrofluorometer (FP-6500; JASCO). The excitation wavelengths were 425 nm for CFP and 470 nm for YFP. Cell Culture—GP293 cells, BW cells, and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences), 100 mm pyruvate (Sigma), and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). FL5.12 cells (a gift from Dr. T. Inaba, Hiroshima University) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), and 1 ng/ml murine IL-3 (Wako). All the cell lines were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Protein Expression and Fluorescence Measurement in FL5.12 Cells— DNAs encoding BAD-ECFP and 14-3-3ζ-YFP were cloned into the retroviral vector pMX (a kind gift from Dr. T Kitamura, The University of Tokyo). To package the retrovirus, GP293 cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of pVSV-G (Clontech) and 12 μg of either pMX-BAD-CFP or pMX-14-3-3ζ-YFP using Lipofectamine 2000 (Clontech). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the culture supernatant was collected and applied to 1 × 105 FL5.12 cells. Clones coexpressing BAD-CFP and 14-3-3ζ-YFP were isolated by limited dilution and subjected to FRET analysis. Fluorescent images of the cells in the RPMI 1640 medium on a coverslip were obtained under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX-70) using a water immersion objective lens (OLYMPUS LUMPlanFl/IR, ×40, numerical aperture 0.8). The images were separated by a dichroic mirror into two channels and independently collected using the W-VIEW system and processed using Aquacosmos software (Hamamatsu Photonics). Evaluation of FRET Signal—Because of the broad excitation and emission spectra of GFP variants, the 535-nm channel with excitation at 420 nm contains the direct excitation of both CFP and YFP in addition to FRET between CFP and YFP. To evaluate the FRET-excited YFP signal, we subtracted the following two values from the 420-nm excited 535-nm signal: 1) CFP signals at 535 nm estimated from the 420-nm excited 480 nm signal, and 2) intensities of the 420-nm excited YFP signal estimated from the 490-nm excited YFP signal. We evaluated the FRET signal within cells using the ratio of the FRET-excited YFP signal (F535) to the 420-nm excited CFP signal at 480 nm (F480) from the images taken using the W-VIEW system. RNA Interference—We used small hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knock down the BAD expression (23Shirane D. Sugao K. Namiki S. Tanabe M. Iino M. Hirose K. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The sequence of the shRNA (5′-AGTCCTGGTGGGATCGAAACT-3′) corresponds to mouse BAD nucleotide positions 563–583. The shRNA was retrovirally expressed in FL5.12 cells, and the expression level of BAD was examined by Western blotting. Immunoblotting and Co-immunoprecipitation—Whole-cell samples for phosphorylation analysis were prepared as cells suspended in SDS-containing buffer (104 cells/μl) and boiled before immunoblot analysis. The samples for immunoprecipitation were prepared as described by Zha et al. (4Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in Tris-buffered solution containing 0.3% Nonidet P-40. The lysates were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-BAD antibody (Cell Signaling) for 1 h followed with protein G beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was washed and resuspended in loading buffer for further immunoblot analysis. The prepared samples were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; separated products were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with appropriate antibodies. Antibodies against BAD, BAD phospho-Ser-112, -Ser-136, and -Ser-155 (Cell Signaling), and 14-3-3ζ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were purchased from the indicated suppliers. The antibody against BAD phospho-Ser-128 was a kind gift from Dr. A. Bonni and Dr. Konishi (Harvard Medical School). Immunoreactive bands were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Flow Cytometry—To analyze DNA content, cells were fixed with cold 70% ethanol and treated with RNase A. DNA was stained with propidium iodide (25 μg/ml), and cytometric analysis was performed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences). For the measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), cells were incubated at 37 °C with 10 nm tetramethylrhodamine methylester for 10 min and analyzed using FACScan. Apoptosis was quantified by FACScan using annexin V-FITC (VioBision Inc.). In Vitro Evaluation of FRET-based Assay of Association between BAD and 14-3-3ζ—To monitor the association and dissociation between BAD and 14-3-3ζ, we used a FRET-based assay system to facilitate time lapse measurements. We fused the ECFP as a FRET donor to BAD and the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein as a FRET acceptor to 14-3-3ζ (Fig. 1A). We first evaluated the functional properties of recombinant BAD-CFP and 14-3-3ζ-YFP in vitro. The PKA phosphorylated serine residues at positions 112, 136, and 155 but not 128 of recombinant BAD-CFP (Fig. 1B) in accordance with the previous results (5Datta S.R. Ranger A.M. Lin M.Z.

Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The interaction between 14-3-3ζ-YFP and BAD-CFP was analyzed using surface plasmon resonance. BAD-CFP associated with 14-3-3ζ-YFP only when BAD-CFP was prephosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the fusion proteins retain the properties of their parent molecules in terms of phosphorylation sites and molecular interaction. We then examined whether we could observe FRET between BAD-CFP and 14-3-3ζ-YFP upon their association. The fluorescence spectrum of nonphosphorylated BAD-CFP showed only a minimal change regarding the presence or absence of 14-3-3ζ-YFP (Fig. 1D, left panel). In contrast, when PKA-treated BAD-CFP was mixed with 14-3-3ζ-YFP, there was a clear change in the fluorescence spectrum: the fluorescence intensity of BAD-CFP at 480 nm (F480) decreased and that of 14-3-3ζ-YFP at 535 nm (F535) increased (Fig. 1D, right panel). These results indicate that the intensity of the FRET signal between BAD-CFP and 14-3-3ζ-YFP increases when the two molecules associate after the phosphorylation of BAD-CFP by PKA. Thus, the FRET signal (F535/F480) can be used to monitor the extent of association between BAD-CFP and 14-3-3ζ-YFP. Evaluation of the FRET-based Assay within Cells—To examine the FRET signal within living cells, we chose FL5.12 cells. FL5.12 cells were coinfected with BAD-CFP and 14-3-3ζ-YFP (Fig. 1E). In cells treated with staurosporine, a general inhibitor of protein kinases including PKA (24Spacey G.D. Bonser R.W. Randall R.W. Garland L.G. Cell. Signal. 1990; 2: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), F480 increased at the expense of F535, resulting in a decrease in FRET signal intensity (Fig. 1F). The change in FRET signal intensity indicates the dissociation of BAD-CFP from 14-3-3ζ-YFP and is accompanied by a decrease in the level of BAD-CFP phosphorylation (Fig. 1G). We also examined the effect of okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor (10Chiang C.W. Harris G. Ellig C. Masters S.C. Subramanian R. Shenolikar S. Wadzinski B.E. Yang E. Blood. 2001; 97: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Haystead T.A. Sim A.T. Carling D. Honnor R.C. Tsukitani Y. Cohen P. Hardie D.G. Nature. 1989; 337: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). In cells treated with 100 nm okadaic acid, the FRET signal intensity increased, indicating an enhanced association between BAD-CFP and 14-3-3ζ-YFP (Fig. 1H) with a concomitant increase in the level of BAD-CFP phosphorylation at Ser-112 and Ser-136, but not at Ser-128 (Fig. 1I). However, when the okadaic acid concentration was increased to 1000 nm, the FRET signal intensity decreased, indicating the dissociation of BAD-CFP from 14-3-3ζ-YFP (Fig. 1H). The decrease in the FRET signal intensity was not accompanied by any decrease in phosphorylation level at Ser-112 and Ser-136 but was accompanied by an increase in phosphorylation level at Ser-128 (Fig. 1I), which was shown to inhibit the association between BAD and 14-3-3 (20Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These results show that the association between BAD and 14-3-3ζ is regulated by the balance among multiple phosphorylation sites on BAD and that the FRET signal reports their association state, which may be difficult to estimate by measuring only the phosphorylation state of BAD. We also examined whether BAD has a growth factor deprivation-dependent proapoptotic effect in FL5.12 cells. The endogenous BAD expression was significantly reduced by the expression of small hairpin RNA (supplemental Fig. 1A). FL5.12 cells underwent cell death after withdrawal of IL-3 from the culture medium, and the extent of apoptosis was significantly reduced after the knock down of BAD (supplemental Fig. 1B). The results indicate that FL5.12 cells are appropriate for the study of BAD-mediated apoptosis. Cell Cycle Arrest and Association between BAD and 14-3-3ζ—Having established the method of monitoring the association between BAD and 14-3-3ζ in live cells, we examined whether the level of association between the two molecules changes with the cell cycle. FL5.12 cells were treated with a reagent that arrests cell cycle progression for 6 h before both the DNA content of the cells and the FRET signal were examined (Fig. 2A). Using mimosine (26Mosca P.J. Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4375-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) or aphidicolin (27Ikegami S. Taguchi T. Ohashi M. Oguro M. Nagano H. Mano Y. Nature. 1978; 275: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), most of the cells were synchronized at the G1 phase, and simultaneously the FRET signal intensity increased. In contrast, treatment with nocodazole (28Zieve G.W. Turnbull D. Mullins J.M. McIntosh J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 126: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) or paclitaxel (29Schiff P.B. Horwitz S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar) synchronized most of the cells at the G2/M phase and decreased the FRET signal intensity. These results indicate that BAD-CFP associates with 14-3-3ζ-YFP at the G1 phase, whereas the two molecules dissociate at the G2/M phase. We then studied the level of phosphorylation at Ser-128 on BAD. It decreased at the G1 phase and increased at the G2/M phase reciprocally with the change in the FRET signal intensity (Fig. 2B). The phosphorylation level at other functional sites, Ser-112, -136, and -155, showed a minimal change in terms of the cell cycle phase in the presence of IL-3 (Fig. 2B). The enhanced phosphorylation at Ser-128 was also observed in endogenous BAD when cells were synchronized at the G2/M phase by nocodazole not only in FL5.12 cells but also BW (murine thymoma) and NIH3T3 cells (fibroblasts) (Fig. 2C). To study the role of Cdc2 in the phosphorylation at Ser-128, we examined the effects of a Cdc2 inhibitor, roscovitine, in FL5.12 cells. The nocodazole-induced phosphorylation at Ser-128 was reversed in the presence of roscovitine (Fig. 2D). The nocodazole-induced dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ was also reversed in the presence of roscovitine (supplemental Fig. 2A). These results indicate that Cdc2 is involved in the phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-128 in FL5.12 cells. To examine whether the phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-128 is indeed directly involved in the cell cycle-dependent dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ, we generated a mutant BAD in which Ser-128 was replaced by alanine (S128A). The FRET signal intensity between S128A mutant BAD and 14-3-3ζ did not change even when cells were synchronized at the G2/M phase by nocodazole treatment for 6 h (Fig. 2A). The result indicates that phosphorylation at Ser-128 is essential for the cell cycle-dependent dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ. To further confirm the dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ at the G2/M phase, immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out (supplemental Fig. 3). In FL5.12 cells coexpressing both BAD-CFP and 14-3-3ζ-YFP, an anti-BAD antibody coimmunoprecipitated the two proteins, and the level of co-immunoprecipitated 14-3-3ζ-YFP decreased following the cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase by paclitaxel. On the other hand, in the cells expressing S128A mutant BAD-ECFP, there was no difference in the level of co-immunoprecipitated 14-3-3ζ-YFP between control and G2/M-arrested cells. Thus, the observed Ser-128-dependent dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ at the G2/M phase was supported by an independent method. Temporal Correlation of Cell Cycle with Interaction between BAD and 14-3-3ζ—We then examined whether the association/dissociation of BAD and 14-3-3ζ would change along with the cell cycle progression. The cell cycle was first synchronized at either the G2/M phase in the presence of nocodazole or at the G1 phase in the presence of mimosine for 5 h, and then the reagent was withdrawn to allow the cell cycle to proceed. The progression of the cell cycle was examined on the basis of the DNA contents of the cells. The population of cells at the G2/M (or G1) phase increased (or decreased) during nocodazole treatment, and there was a rebound change after the withdrawal of nocodazole (Fig. 3A, left). Essentially, the same but opposite changes were observed in mimosine-treated cells (Fig. 3A, right). At the same time, the association between BAD and 14-3-3ζ was monitored using the FRET signal (Fig. 3B). In both nocodazole- and mimosine-treated cells, the levels of association between BAD and 14-3-3ζ followed a time course similar to that of the population of cells in the G1 phase (Fig. 3, A versus B). A correlation analysis between the G1 cell population and FRET signal supported this observation (supplemental Fig. 4). We also examined the level of BAD phosphorylation at Ser-128 during the cell cycle progression. Indeed, the level of phosphorylation at Ser-128 increased during the G2/M phase and decreased during the G1 phase (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that both the extent of association between BAD and 14-3-3ζ and the level of phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-128 change with cell cycle progression. Link between Cell Cycle and Apoptosis after IL-3 Deprivation—Next we examined the relationship between the cell cycle phase and apoptosis after IL-3 deprivation. Apoptosis was monitored on the basis of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), which was measured using the fluorescence intensity of tetramethylrhodamine methylester as an indicator (30Loew L.M. Tuft R.A. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2396-2407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). When the cell cycle was arrested at the G1 phase in the presence of mimosine, the extent of association between BAD and 14-3-3ζ increased, and the association state continued after the withdrawal of IL-3 in the continued presence of mimosine (Fig. 4A, filled circles). Interestingly, apoptosis was not observed even after IL-3 deprivation for 2–3 h in the presence of mimosine (Fig. 4B, filled circles). Only after washing out of mimosine did BAD dissociate from 14-3-3ζ and apoptosis was enhanced (Fig. 4, A and B, filled circles). Therefore, when IL-3 was withdrawn at the G1 phase, the apoptotic process was not initiated immediately. We then examined the effect of IL-3 deprivation on apoptosis in cells synchronized at the G2/M phase by nocodazole treatment. Upon the application of nocodazole the extent of association between BAD and 14-3-3ζ decreased (Fig. 4A, open circles). In sharp contrast with cells synchronized at the G1 phase, an enhancement of apoptosis started immediately after IL-3 deprivation (Fig. 4B, open circles). The above results suggest that dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ is required for the initiation of IL-3 deprivation-induced apoptosis. If indeed the acceleration of apoptosis depends on the association between BAD and 14-3-3ζ cells expressing the S128A mutant, BAD would show a delayed initiation of apoptosis because S128A-BAD did not dissociate from 14-3-3ζ even when the cells were synchronized at the G2/M phase (Fig. 2A). We therefore examined this possibility. In cells expressing S128A-BAD, IL-3 deprivation at the G2/M phase induced a much delayed enhancement of apoptosis in comparison with that in cells expressing wild-type BAD-CFP (Fig. 4B, triangles versus open circles). In accordance with this result, the inhibition of phosphorylation at Ser-128 by roscovitine, which also inhibited the dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ, delayed the initiation of apoptosis after IL-3 deprivation (supplemental Fig. 2B). Effect of 14-3-3ζ Association on Dephosphorylation of BAD—As mentioned in the Introduction, the binding of BAD to 14-3-3 is also dependent on the phosphorylation of BAD at the growth factor-dependent regulatory serine residues (Ser-112 and -136). Using the R18 peptide, which interacts with the amphipathic groove of 14-3-3 to displace 14-3-3 targets, Chiang et al. (12Chiang C.W. Kanies C. Kim K.W. Fang W.B. Parkhurst C. Xie M. Henry T. Yang E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6350-6362Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) showed that dissociation of 14-3-3 from BAD accelerates dephosphorylation of the regulatory serine residues in vitro. Thus, we examined whether the Ser-128-dependent dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ also has a potentiating effect on the rate of dephosphorylation of the regulatory serine residues in FL5.12 cells. The phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-112 and Ser-136 was analyzed in cells expressing BAD or S128A-BAD. Four hours after the cells were deprived of IL-3, the level of phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-112 and Ser-136 decreased, whereas that of S128A-BAD remained nearly constant (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the Ser-128-dependent dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ facilitates the dephosphorylation of BAD at the growth factor-dependent sites after IL-3 deprivation. This would contribute to the progression of apoptosis by facilitating the dissociation between BAD and 14-3-3ζ. Relation between Apoptosis and Cell Cycle-dependent Dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ—The above results showed that the cell cycle-dependent dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ promotes the proapoptotic function of BAD in the absence of IL-3. However, the cell cycle-dependent dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ per se did not result in apoptosis in the presence of IL-3. Therefore, an additional IL-3-dependent step seems to be required for the induction of apoptosis after the dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ at the G2/M phase. It has been shown that the phosphorylation of Ser-155 of BAD suppresses the proapoptotic function of BAD by eliminating its affinity for Bcl-xL (17Tan Y. Demeter M.R. Ruan H. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25865-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 18Zhou X.M. Liu Y. Payne G. Lutz R.J. Chittenden T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25046-25051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Indeed, there was no appreciable change in the phosphorylation level of BAD-CFP at Ser-155 at any cell cycle phase (Fig. 2B, bottom row). We further analyzed the phosphorylation state of endogenous BAD (supplemental Fig. 5). In wild-type cells synchronized at the G2/M phase by nocodazole treatment, Ser-128 was phosphorylated but Ser-155 remained phosphorylated in the presence of IL-3. Ser-155 was dephosphorylated when IL-3 was withdrawn. These results suggest that, after dissociation from 14-3-3ζ in the G2/M phase, BAD may not bind to Bcl-xL in the presence of IL-3 and that an additional step (dephosphorylation at Ser-155 due to IL-3 deprivation) is required for the induction of apoptosis. We showed that BAD dissociates from 14-3-3ζ at the G2/M phase of each cell cycle. The cell cycle-dependent dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ is primarily regulated by the phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-128 by Cdc2. The dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ at the G2/M phase does not immediately promote apoptosis but facilitates subsequent apoptosis only when the cells are deprived of growth factors. Indeed, the dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ enhanced the dephosphorylation of BAD at the growth factor-dependent sites, probably allowing phosphatases to gain access to BAD at regulatory serine residues because it was shown that the dephosphorylation of BAD at the functional serine residues (Ser-112, -136, and -155) is inhibited when BAD binds to 14-3-3ζ (12Chiang C.W. Kanies C. Kim K.W. Fang W.B. Parkhurst C. Xie M. Henry T. Yang E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6350-6362Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These results indicate that cell cycle-dependent BAD phosphorylation facilitates apoptosis through the facilitation of growth factor deprivation-induced dephosphorylation of BAD (Fig. 6). Thus, BAD detects the coincidence of the G2/M phase and growth factor deprivation to regulate apoptosis. This framework provides an explanation for why the dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ at the G2/M phase does not induce immediate apoptosis. It has been shown that the phosphorylation of one of the functional serine residues (Ser-155) of BAD suppresses the pro-apoptotic function of BAD by preventing association of BAD and Bcl-xL (17Tan Y. Demeter M.R. Ruan H. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25865-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 18Zhou X.M. Liu Y. Payne G. Lutz R.J. Chittenden T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25046-25051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). There was no change in the phosphorylation level of BAD at Ser-155 in any cell phase in the presence of IL-3, but the phosphorylation was markedly reduced after IL-3 deprivation (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 5). Thus, after the dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3ζ at the G2/M phase, BAD has to undergo an additional step (dephosphorylation at Ser-155) before the induction of apoptosis. Paclitaxel is one of the most important anti-cancer drugs and is used to treat various solid tumors. The drug arrests the cell cycle at the G2/M phase by stabilizing microtubules (29Schiff P.B. Horwitz S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). It was shown that the inhibition of Cdc2 activity reduces paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (31Tan M. Jing T. Lan K.H. Neal C.L. Li P. Lee S. Fang D. Nagata Y. Liu J. Arlinghaus R. Hung M.C. Yu D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 993-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BAD has been implicated in paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity: the expression of BAD in ovarian cancer cells enhances the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel (32Strobel T. Tai Y.T. Korsmeyer S. Cannistra S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2419-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These results suggest that both Cdc2 and BAD are involved in paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity. Therefore, our findings may underlie the molecular mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of the drug: the prolongation of the G2/M phase by paclitaxel enhances the Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-128, which in turn decreases the mitochondrial threshold for apoptosis. The activation of Cdc2 promotes cell proliferation (33Draetta G. Beach D. Cell. 1988; 54: 17-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 34Green D.R. Evan G.I. Cancer Cells. 2002; 1: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). On the other hand, our results indicated, rather paradoxically, that activated Cdc2 increases the probability of cell death. However, many oncoproteins induce both cell cycle progression and apoptosis (34Green D.R. Evan G.I. Cancer Cells. 2002; 1: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). The expression of transcription factors c-Myc or E2F1, which promotes the progression of cell cycle from the G1 to the S-phase, was shown to enhance apoptosis in the absence of growth factors (35Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar, 36Askew D.S. Ihle J.N. Cleveland J.L.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6983-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In our present study, we showed that Cdc2 activated at the cell cycle progression from the S-phase to the G2/M phase enhances apoptosis. These observations suggest that these mechanisms may function as a safety device for suppressing inappropriate cell proliferation. Indeed, the roles of BAD have been suggested in the regulation of cell proliferation. BAD-deficient mice suffer from large B cell lymphoma (6Ranger A.M. Zha J. Harada H. Datta S.R. Danial N.N. Gilmore A.P. Kutok J.L. Le Beau M.M. Greenberg M.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9324-9329Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). On the other hand, BAD-overexpressing mice have a severely decreased number of T cells in the thymus (39Mok C.L. Gil-Gomez G. Williams O. Coles M. Taga S. Tolaini M. Norton T. Kioussis D. Brady H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cell cycle-dependent regulation of apoptosis by BAD may have an important role in regulating cell proliferation under physiological and pathological states.

https://openalex.org/W2023511357,"Membrane type 1 (MT1)-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) is a major mediator of collagen degradation in the pericellular space in both physiological and pathological conditions. Previous evidence has shown that on the cell surface, active MT1-MMP undergoes autocatalytic processing to a major membrane-tethered 44-kDa product lacking the catalytic domain and displaying Gly285 at its N terminus, which is at the beginning of the hinge domain. However, the importance of this site and the hinge region in MT1-MMP processing is unknown. In the current study, we generated mutations and deletions in the hinge of MT1-MMP and followed their effect on processing. These studies established Gly284–Gly285 as the main cleavage site involved in the formation of the 44-kDa species. However, alterations at this site did not prevent processing. Instead, they forced downstream cleavages within the stretch of residues flanked by Gln296 and Ser304 in the hinge region, as determined by the processing profile of various hinge deletion mutants. Also, replacement of the hinge of MT1-MMP with the longer MT3-MMP hinge did not prevent processing of MT1-MMP. Molecular dynamic studies using a computational model of MT1-MMP revealed that the hinge region is a highly motile element that undergoes significant motion in the highly exposed loop formed by Pro295–Arg302 consistent with being a prime target for proteolysis, in agreement with the mutational data. These studies suggest that the hinge of MT1-MMP evolved to facilitate processing, a promiscuous but compulsory event in the destiny of MT1-MMP, which may play a key role in the control of pericellular proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2087554577,"The hepatitis B virus surface gene consists of a single open reading frame divided into three coding regions: pre-S1, pre-S2, and S. By alternate translation at each of the three initiation codons, L, M, and S proteins can be synthesized. Studies have shown that M protein is not essential for viral replication, virion morphogenesis, or in vitro infectivity. In this study, we show that native M protein can regulate surface gene expression at the transcriptional level. The regulatory effect of M protein is mediated through the CCAAT box within the S promoter. Deletion mapping analysis indicated that the transactivating effect of M protein is mediated through amino acids 1–57 of M protein (the MHBsau domain), although its maximal transactivation activity coincides with that of the pre-S2 domain. This conclusion is supported by the fact that disruption of the putative V8 protease site at the pre-S2/S domain junction not only rendered M protein incapable of transactivating the S promoter but also inactivated its nuclear translocation potential. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot experiments demonstrated that pre-S2 interacts with the three subunits of the CCAAT box-binding factor/nuclear factor Y, the cognate binding protein of the CCAAT box. These results demonstrate and define a novel regulatory role of M protein, which, under natural conditions, may undergo a proteolytic process to generate an MHBsau species that will be translocated inside the nucleus, where it will interact with the CCAAT box-binding factor to regulate surface gene expression.

HBV belongs to the hepadnavirus family, and its particle coat consists of a lipid bilayer membrane and envelope proteins. It has a partial duplex DNA genome of ∼3.2 kb and contains four overlapping open reading frames: DNA polymerase, core protein, surface antigen, and the X gene (5Ganem D. Varmus H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 651-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). The HBV surface (envelope) gene encodes three forms of viral surface proteins (6Tiollais P. Pourcel C. Dejean A. Nature. 1985; 317: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 7Yen T.S. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4: 33-42Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is divided into three parts by two internal initiation codons: the pre-S1, pre-S2, and S regions. This combination of three regions forms the large surface antigen LHBsAg or L protein. In addition, the pre-S2 and S regions form the middle surface antigen MHBsAg or M protein. The small surface antigen SHBsAg or S protein, also called major S protein, constitutes the most abundant protein of HBV envelopes. The production of these three forms of surface protein (L, M, and S) is controlled by two tandem promoters. The upstream pre-S1 promoter controls the transcription of a 2.4-kb transcript that encodes L protein only. The downstream S promoter, ∼240 bp away, specifies transcripts with heterogeneous 5′ termini (5Ganem D. Varmus H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 651-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), with the largest transcript encoding M protein and the remaining transcripts encoding S protein. In both infected and transfected hepatocytes, the amount of pre-S1 transcript is much less than the amount of S transcript (7Yen T.S. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4: 33-42Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Ganem D. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1996: 2703-2737Google Scholar), and L protein constitutes only a small percentage of the total surface protein synthesized in the infected cell. This is an important aspect of the viral life cycle because L protein, unlike the other surface proteins, is incompetent for secretion, and relative overexpression of L protein leads to the intracellular retention of all forms of the surface protein (9Bruss V. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 10Persing D.H. Varmus H.E. Ganem D.

Although the pre-S1 promoter appears to be much weaker than the S promoter in the context of either the entire viral genome or a large subviral genomic fragment, in fact, with the reporter gene, the pre-S1 promoter is slightly stronger than the S promoter when they are assayed separately in transfection studies. Within the S promoter, an element containing a CCAAT box (13Lu C.-C. Chen M. Ou J.H. Yen T.S. Virology. 1995; 206: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) can down-regulate L protein expression, and this CCAAT box is functionally important for S promoter activity (14Lu C.-C. Yen T.S. Virology. 1996; 225: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Zhou D.X. Yen T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23416-23421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kuo Y.L. Ting L.P. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Mutation of the CCAAT motif not only decreases the amount of S1 transcript, but also increases the amount of pre-S1 transcript (13Lu C.-C. Chen M. Ou J.H. Yen T.S. Virology. 1995; 206: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), indicating that this element plays a critical role in the balanced synthesis of the three forms of this surface protein, thus facilitating the proper assembling and secretion of the viral particle. An element adjacent to the CCAAT motif was identified by Bock et al. (17Bock C.T. Kubicka S. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1236-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and this element (temporarily named CCAAT adjacent factor (CAF)) may act in concert with the CCAAT motif to contribute the full activity of the S promoter. The biological role of M protein in the viral life cycle has been controversial. In vitro studies suggest that M protein is not essential for in vitro HBV replication (18Fernholz D. Stemler M. Brunetto M. Bonino F. Will H. J. Hepatol. 1991; 13: S102-S104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), virion morphogenesis (19Bruss V. Gerhardt E. Vieluf K. Wunderlich G.

Virology. 1993; 194: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because an M protein-deficient mutant can be found in patients with fulminant hepatitis, it was suggested that M protein is not required for in vivo viral replication (21Pollicino T. Zanetti A.R. Cacciola I. Petit M.A. Smedile A. Campo S. Sagliocca L. Pasquali M. Tanzi E. Longo G. Raimondo G. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that M protein has a previously unidentified novel autoregulatory function in surface gene expression. We have also characterized the molecular/genetic mechanism involved in its regulatory function.

Finally, these two rounds of PCR products were mixed in equal molar parts and amplified with the 5′-primer (D1A) and 3′-primer (D5). The final PCR products were digested with BstEII and XbaI and then substituted for the BstEII-XbaI fragment of the surface gene carried on pHBV1.2. To introduce the M protein initiation codon mutation into p(3A)SAg, “cassette exchange” experiments were carried out as described previously (23Fan Y.F. Lu C.-C. Chen W.C. Yao W.-J. Wang H.C. Chang T.T. Lei H.Y. Shiau A.-L. Su I.J. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, pHBV1.2/Mint was digested with BstEII and EcoRV, and the resulting 1.5-kb BstEII-EcoRV fragment was exchanged for the BstEII-EcoRV fragment of p(3A)SAg to create the p(3A)SAg/Mint mutant. p(3A)S(ΔPst), which will make M and S proteins from the S promoter, was constructed using PstI-digested p(3A)SAg (25Fan Y.F. Lu C.-C. Chang Y.C. Chang T.T. Lin P.W. Lei H.Y. Su I.J. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2000; 15: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and replaced with a 130-bp fragment containing the S promoter amplified from pSAg(ΔBgl/Hin) (15Zhou D.X. Yen T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23416-23421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The region amplified was from nucleotides (nt) 3121 to 31, with a primer pair in which each was carrying a PstI site. p(3A)S(ΔPst)/Sint was constructed using a cassette exchange experiment between p(3A)S(ΔPst) and plasmid Δ5 (23Fan Y.F. Lu C.-C. Chen W.C. Yao W.-J. Wang H.C. Chang T.T. Lei H.Y. Shiau A.-L. Su I.J. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, p(3A)SAg was completely digested with EcoRV, partially digested with EcoRI, and replaced with a 1.1-kb EcoRI-EcoRV fragment from plasmid Δ5, which carries a point mutation in the S protein initiation codon (ATG → AGG). As a result, p(3A)S(ΔPst)/Sint expresses M protein only. A pCMV-based expression plasmid containing the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early gene promoter was created by digestion of plasmid pCMVβ (Clontech) with NotI, self-religated, and named “pCMV-Basic vector.” pCMV-MHBs and pCMV-MHBs/Sint were constructed using a primer pair with a NotI linker to amplify the M protein coding sequence from p(3A)SAg and plasmid Δ5 (23Fan Y.F. Lu C.-C. Chen W.C. Yao W.-J. Wang H.C. Chang T.T. Lei H.Y. Shiau A.-L. Su I.J. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), respectively. The forward primer (also named MHBs-1) was 5′-GGTACCGCGGCCGCTCTAAGAGACAGTCATCCTC-3′, and the reverse primer (also named MHBs-2) was 5′-GGTACCGCGGCCGCTTAAATGTATACCCAGAGACAAA-3′ (with the NotI sites underlined). The NotI site is preceded by six random nucleotides and followed by the stop codon (in the case of MHBs-2) and HBV sequences (nt 3188∼3207 and 834∼815, respectively). To facilitate immunoprecipitation detection, a His epitope tag was added to the C terminus of the pre-S2 domain by PCR amplification (pCMV-pre-S2-His). The forward primer used was MHBs-1, and the reverse primer used was 5′-GGTACCGCGGCCGCTCAgtggtggtggtggtggtgGTTCGTCACAGGGTCCCCA (with the NotI site underlined). The NotI site is preceded by random nucleotides and followed by the stop codon, histidine tag (lowercase letters), and an HBV sequence (nt 156∼138). The PCR product amplified from p(3A)SAg was inserted into the pCMV-Basic vector. Mapping of the Minimal Transactivation Domain of M Protein—The minimal activation domain of M protein was determined by serial deletion from the 3′-end of M protein. Deletion mapping was performed in two ways. In the first method, primers were designed so that the endogenous M protein translation initiation codon would be used for the translation initiation of truncated proteins. pCMV-MHBs-(1–152), pCMV-MHBs-(1–76), pCMV-MHBs-(1–71), pCMV-MHBs-(1–57), pCMV-MHBs-(1–55), pCMV-pre-S2-(1–52), pCMV-pre-S2-(1–48), and pCMV-pre-S2-(1–47) (with the translation initiation codon of M protein numbered 1 and the numbers in parentheses indicating the region of amino acids covered) were constructed by PCR amplification with the following primer pair. The forward primer used was GGTACCGCGGCCGCTCTAAGAGACAGTCATCCTC. The NotI site (underlined) is preceded by six random nucleotides and followed by an HBV sequence (nt 3188∼3207). The reverse primer used was (N)6GCGGCCGCTTA(X)19, where N and X represent random nucleotides and a bracketed HBV sequence, respectively. The NotI site (underlined) is followed by the stop codon (TTA). HBV DNA sequences corresponding to nt 3188∼447 (pCMV-MHBs-(1–152)), 3188∼219 (pCMV-MHBs-(1–76)), 3188∼204 (pCMV-MHBs-(1–71)), 3188∼162 (pCMV-MHBs-(1–57)), 3188∼156 (pCMV-MHBs-(1–55)), 3188∼147(pCMV-pre-S2-(1–52)), 3188∼135 (pCMV-pre-S2-(1–48)), and 3188∼132 (pCMV-pre-S2-(1–47)) were amplified, digested with NotI, and inserted into the pCMV-Basic vector. For construction of pCMV-pre-S2-(5–55) (nt 4∼156), pCMV-pre-S2-(16–55) (nt 37∼156), and pCMV-pre-S2-(19–55) (nt 46∼156), the forward primer used was (N)6GCGGCCGCACCATG(X)17. The NotI site (underlined) is preceded by six random nucleotides and followed by a Kozak sequence (ACCATG) and an HBV sequence ((X)17) corresponding to the bracketed amino acids. The PCR fragment was amplified with the forward primer and reverse primer (N)6GCGGCCGCTTA(X)19 using plasmid p(3A)SAg as the template, digested with NotI, and ligated to the NotI-restricted and dephosphorylated pCMV-Basic vector. In the second method, truncated M proteins were tagged at the 5′-end using the C form of the pCruz HA vector (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), which tags the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the 5′-end of the expressed proteins. The primers were designed to bracket the truncated proteins exactly; they spanned amino acids 1–281, 1–152, 1–76, 1–71, 1–57, 1–55, 1–52, 1–48, 1–47, 5–55, 16–55, and 19–55 of M protein. The forward primer used was 5′-(N)6GCGGCCCG(X)17, where the NotI site (underlined) is preceded by N, which denotes the HBV sequences located nine nucleotides upstream of (X)17, and followed by the bracketed HBV sequence represented by (X)17. The reverse primer used was 5′-(N)6GCGGCCCGTTA(Y)19, where the NotI site (underlined) is preceded by N, which denotes the HBV sequences located 12 nucleotides downstream of (Y)19, and followed by the stop codon and the bracketed HBV nucleotides represented by (Y)19. Thus, HBV DNA sequences that correspond to nt 3213∼834 (pHA-MHBs-(1–281)), 3213∼447 (pHA-MHBs-(1–152)), 3213∼219 (pHA-MHBs-(1–76)), 3213∼204 (pHA-MHBs-(1–71)), 3213∼162 (pHA-MHBs-(1–57)), 3213∼156 (pHA-MHBs-(1–55)), 3213∼147 (pHA-pre-S2-(1–52)), 3213∼135 (pHA-pre-S2-(1–48)), 3213∼132 (pHA-pre-S2-(1–47)), 1∼156 (pHA-pre-S2-(4–55)), 37∼156 (pHA-pre-S2-(16–55)), and 46∼156 (pHA-pre-S2-(19–55)) were amplified using the forward and reverse primers with plasmid p(3A)SAg as the template. The amplified fragment was digested with NotI and ligated to the NotI-restricted pCruz HA vector. Construction of Putative V8 Protease and Chymotrypsin Site-specific Mutants of the S Gene—The PCR-based site-specific mutagenesis method described above was used to replace either nt 160∼165 or 202∼207, the putative proteolytic sites for V8 protease and chymotrypsin, respectively. The V8 protease mutant construct pCMV-MHBs/V8 has two amino acid replacements (NMENITS → NHMNITS). Primers MHBs-1 and MHBs-2 (the same primer pair used to construct pCMV-MHBs) were each combined with reverse primer 5′-168GATGTTCATATGGTTCGTCACAGGGTCC141-3′ and forward primer 5′-151ACGAACCATATGAACATCACATCAGGAT178-3′ (with the NdeI sites underlined), respectively, for the first PCR using pCMV-MHBs as the template. The PCR products from each reaction were combined and amplified with primers MHBs-1 and MHBs-2. The resulting PCR product was digested with NotI and cloned into the NotI-digested pCMV-Basic vector. The chymotrypsin mutant pMHBs/Ch was constructed in the same manner and had two amino acid substitutions (VLQAG → VHMAG). The reverse and forward primers were 5′-210CCCCGCCATATGCACGAGCAGGGGT186-3′ and 5′-193CTCGTGCATATGGCGGGGTTTTTCTTGT220-3′ (with the NdeI sites underlined), respectively. To add a His epitope tag to the N terminus of MHBs, MHBs/V8, or MHBs/Ch, the forward primer used was (N)6GCGGCCCGACCATGGCAcaccatcaccaccatcac(X)19, where N and X represent random nucleotides and HBV nt 3216∼13, respectively. The NotI site (underlined) is followed by a Kozak sequence (ACCATGG), a His tag sequence (lowercase letters), and an HBV sequence. The same reverse primer used to construct pCMV-MHBs (MHBs-2) was used. The PCR fragments were amplified using pCMV-MHBs, pCMV-MHBs/Ch, or pCMV-MHBs/V8 as the template, digested with NotI, and inserted into NotI-digested pCMV. The resulting plasmids were named pCMV-His-MHBs, pCMV-His-MHBs/Ch, and pCMV-His-MHBs/V8, respectively. Construction of the Luciferase Reporter Gene and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Fusion—To construct ppre-S1-Luc and pS-Luc, HBV genomic fragments corresponding to the pre-S1 (nt 2438∼2855) and S (nt 3114∼156) promoter regions were amplified from template p(3A)SAg using primer pairs containing the restriction sites for SacI (5′-primers) and XhoI (3′-primer) and were inserted into the SacI-XhoI-digested and dephosphorylated pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The primers for the pre-S1 promoter were GCAGAAGAGCTCAATCTCGGGAATCTCAA (5′-primer, nt 2438∼245) and CCAACCCTCGAGGCTGTAGCTCTTGTTCCC (3′-primer, nt 2855∼2838), and the primers for S promoter were 5′-GGTACCGAGCTCACAGTGTCAACAATTCCTCCTCC (5′-primer, nt 3114∼3136; with the SacI site underlined) and 5′-GCAGATCTCGAGGTTCGTCACAGGGTCCCCAGTCC (3′-primer, nt 156∼134; with the XhoI site underlined). The same set of primers used to construct pS-Luc was used for to construct pS/CAT-CAF-Luc, pS/SP1-Luc, pS/SP2-Luc, and pS/SP12-Luc, but the templates used were pSAg-LS3 (13Lu C.-C. Chen M. Ou J.H. Yen T.S. Virology. 1995; 206: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and LSp1-1, LSp1-2, and LSp1-12 (14Lu C.-C. Yen T.S. Virology. 1996; 225: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), respectively. Similarly, pS/CAT-Luc and pS/CAF-Luc were constructed by amplification of p(3A)SAg/CAT and p(3A)SAg/CAF using the same set of primers used to construct pS-Luc. p(3A)SAg/CAT was constructed by PCR-based site-specific mutagenesis with p(3A)SAg as the template, where the nucleotides (nt 3144∼3149) containing the CCAAT box were replaced with the NdeI site. p(3A)SAg/CAF was constructed in the same way as p(3A)SAg/CAT using p(3A)SAg as the template, where the nucleotides (nt 3150∼3155) containing contained CAF were replaced with the MfeI site. p(CCAAT)4-Luc, p(CAT-CAF)4-Luc, and p(CAF)4-Luc each contain four tandem copies of a CCAAT box (CACCAATCG), a CCAAT box plus an adjacent CAF (CACCAATCGGCAGTC), and CAF alone (ATCGGCAGTC), respectively. They were constructed by synthesizing two complementary oligonucleotides, annealed, and phosphorylated at their 5′-ends using a polynucleotide kinase reaction and then inserted into the HindIII-XhoI-restricted pLuc-MCS vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The complementary annealed double-strand oligonucleotide had a protruding HindIII restriction site at its 5′-end and a protruding XhoI restriction site at its 3′-end. The GFP-pre-S2 fusion proteins (pEGFP-N-pre-S2 and pEGFP-C-pre-S2) were constructed by PCR amplification of the pre-S2 domain with a pair of primers containing XhoI, cloned into pEGFP-N1 or pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), and checked for correct orientation by PCR. Transfected cells were stained with propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions and examined under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX41). To avoid misincorporation, all plasmid constructs were amplified using the proofreading Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and checked by appropriate restriction enzyme digestion, direct sequencing, or both to ensure their authenticity. Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assay—HuH-7 and HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 1% antibiotics as described previously (13Lu C.-C. Chen M. Ou J.H. Yen T.S. Virology. 1995; 206: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Fan Y.F. Lu C.-C. Chen W.C. Yao W.-J. Wang H.C. Chang T.T. Lei H.Y. Shiau A.-L. Su I.J. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For transient expression assays, HuH-7 or HepG2 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate (6 × 104 cells/well), a 3.5-cm dish (3 × 105 cells), or a 10-cm dish (3 × 106 cells). Transfection was performed in triplicate 18 h after seeding using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections were performed with equal total amounts of plasmid DNA equalized with empty vector (pCMV-Basic or pTZ19U) depending on the vector used for plasmid construction. To control for background level, the empty luciferase reporter gene plasmid (pGL3-Basic vector) and the empty expression plasmid (pCMV-Basic vector) were included in each transfection study. Cells were harvested 48∼72 h later, and luciferase activity analysis was performed according to the recommendations of Promega. The pRL-SV40 vector was intended for use as an internal control reporter that produces Renilla luciferase, and it was used in equal amounts for each transfection in combination with a reporter construct. The results represent the normalized mean ± S.D. and are expressed as a ratio or percent of cells cotransfected with the reporter gene and empty expression plasmid vectors. Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates—Whole cell lysates were prepared by washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times and suspending them in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 nm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.25% deoxycholate) containing the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), aprotinin (25 ng/ml), and leupeptin (5 ng/ml). The cell suspensions were subjected to shearing several times using a syringe with a 25-gauge needle. The suspensions were then centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 rpm. The final supernatant represented the total cell lysates. Preparation and Immunoprecipitation of HuH-7 Nuclear Proteins— The HuH-7 cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9157) Google Scholar, 27Wadman I.A. Osada H. Grutz G.G. Agulnick A.D. Westphal H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3145-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, nuclear proteins (200 μg) were incubated with the appropriate antibody (1 μg) in a total volume of 300 μl in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer at 4 °C for 18 h with agitation, incubated with protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Finally, the precipitates were resuspended in loading sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE with 12.5% acrylamide as described previously (28Huang T.-J. Li P.S. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed as described previously (28Huang T.-J. Li P.S. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) by electroblotting and then blocked for 1 h with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) and 4% nonfat milk. Immunoblotting was carried out using primary antibody against the major S surface protein (mouse monoclonal antibody A10F1, kindly provided by Professor S. C. Lee, Department of Molecular Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan), anti-pre-S2 antibody (mouse monoclonal IgG1, Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA), or anti-pre-S1 antibody (monoclonal antibody 18/7, a generous gift from Dr. W. H. Gerlich, Department of Medical Virology, Justus-Liebig University, Giessen, Germany) as described previously (23Fan Y.F. Lu C.-C. Chen W.C. Yao W.-J. Wang H.C. Chang T.T. Lei H.Y. Shiau A.-L. Su I.J. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis, the precipitated protein fractions were immunoblotted with anti-His6 tag antibody (mouse monoclonal IgG, Serotec Ltd., Oxford, UK); anti-HA antibody (F-7, mouse monoclonal IgG2a, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); or anti-CCAAT box-binding factor (CBF) A (FL-207, rabbit polyclonal IgG), anti-CBF-B (H-209, rabbit polyclonal IgG), or anti-CBF-C (H-120, rabbit polyclonal IgG) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibody. After being washed with PBST for 15 min, the bound primary antibody was detected with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or sheep anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (both from Amersham Biosciences) depending on the species of the primary antibodies used for blotting. After incubating the membranes for 40 min at room temperature, they were washed five times with PBST, and then the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The intensities of the protein bands were determined using a chemiluminescence image analyzer (FLA1000 system, Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). As an internal control, in the same membranes, the antibodies were stripped and reprobed with anti-α-tubulin antibody (IgG1, T-9026, Sigma) or anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen antibody (PC10, mouse monoclonal IgG2a, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). RNA Preparation and Primer Extension Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from transfected cells using a REzol C&T isolation kit (Protech Technology Enterprise Co., Ltd., Taipei) based on the acid guanidine/thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method according to the manufacturer's instructions. The levels of pre-S1 and S RNAs were quantified by primer extension analysis with 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides by T4 polynucleotide kinase as described previously (13Lu C.-C. Chen M. Ou J.H.

https://openalex.org/W2050687092,"Tyr25 is a ligand to the active site d1 heme in as isolated, oxidized cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase from Paracoccus pantotrophus. This form of the enzyme requires reductive activation, a process that involves not only displacement of Tyr25 from the d1 heme but also switching of the ligands at the c heme from bis-histidinyl to His/Met. A Y25S variant retains this bis-histidinyl coordination in the crystal of the oxidized state that has sulfate bound to the d1 heme iron. This Y25S form of the enzyme does not require reductive activation, an observation previously interpreted as meaning that the presence of the phenolate oxygen of Tyr25 is the critical determinant of the requirement for activation. This interpretation now needs re-evaluation because, unexpectedly, the oxidized as prepared Y25S protein, unlike the wild type, has different heme iron ligands in solution at room temperature, as judged by magnetic circular dichroism and electron spin resonance spectroscopies, than in the crystal. In addition, the binding of nitrite and cyanide to oxidized Y25S cytochrome cd1 is markedly different from the wild type enzyme, thus providing insight into the affinity of the oxidized d1 heme ring for anions in the absence of the steric barrier presented by Tyr25.

There are two strikingly different forms of bacterial nitrite reductase used in denitrification to catalyze the one-electron reduction of nitrite (NO–2) to nitric oxide (NO) and water, namely, cytochrome cd1 (NirS) and the copper-containing enzyme NirK. Cytochrome cd1 is a soluble tetraheme periplasmic homodimer. Each monomer contains a covalently bound c-type heme and a non-covalently bound d1 heme (a cofactor unique to this class of enzyme). The c heme is the site of electron entry, whereas the d1 heme binds and reduces nitrite. In addition, each monomer is divided into two distinct domains. The N-terminal domain is predominantly α-helical and binds the c heme, whereas the C-terminal domain forms an eight-bladed β-propeller in which the d1 heme sits (1Fülöp V. Moir J.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the oxidized “as isolated” Paracoccus pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase had unexpected ligands at each of the heme centers (1Fülöp V. Moir J.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The c heme centers on each monomer are bis-histidinyl, coordinated by His69 (belonging to the CXXCH motif) and His17. The d1 heme has His200 as an axial ligand along with Tyr25; the latter is from the c heme domain on the same extended N-terminal polypeptide loop as His17. The possibility that the axial ligands His17 and Tyr25 were an artifact of crystallization was eliminated by spectroscopic (magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) 1The abbreviations used are: MCD, magnetic circular dichroism; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance. and electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR)) studies in solution; these unambiguously confirmed the bis-histidinyl coordination of the c heme and were entirely consistent with the presence of tyrosine at the d1 heme (2Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Upon reduction, the crystal structure demonstrated a switch in the heme ligands of both heme centers. The His17 ligand to the oxidized c heme was displaced by Met106, and there was loss of the Tyr25 ligand to the d1 heme, leaving the latter pentacoordinate and available for NO–2 binding (3Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Subsequent to the initial spectroscopic and crystallographic characterization of the enzyme, it was discovered that significant catalytic activity of P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 required activation by reduction (4Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Köppenhofer A. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3093-3100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This could be understood in terms of the bis-histidinyl ligands to the oxidized c heme resulting in this center having an E°′ of approximately +60 mV. The latter value is not obviously compatible with acceptance of electrons from the physiological electron donors, cytochrome c550 and pseudoazurin, both of which have E°′ values of approximately +250 mV. In addition, Tyr25 would present a steric barrier against nitrite binding to the oxidized enzyme. An oxidized form of the enzyme with His/Met coordination at the c heme and absence of Tyr25 binding at the d1 heme can be generated (5Allen J.W.A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 883-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This conformation of cytochrome cd1 is catalytically active, not least because of the His/Met coordinated c heme center with an estimated E°′ value of ∼250 mV (7Köppenhofer A. Turner K.L. Allen J.W.A. Chapman S.K. Ferguson S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4243-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), very similar to those of either of the two physiological electron donor proteins; also, the d1 heme is available to bind substrate in this conformation (6Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 883-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations cast doubt on the proposal that binding and dissociation of Tyr25 and the bis-histidinyl coordination at the c heme played roles in the catalytic activity of the protein (1Fülöp V. Moir J.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 3Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the finding that Tyr25 readily displaces cyanide from the d1 heme upon oxidation of the enzyme in the crystal or in solution provided further evidence for the strong tendency for this tyrosine to bind to the d1 heme iron (8Jafferji A. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Fülöp V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25089-25094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Tyr25 was subsequently mutated to a serine residue (9Gordon E.H.J. Sjögren T. Löfqvist M. Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Hajdu J. Fülöp V. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) to probe the consequences of the loss of this tyrosine ligand on protein conformation and activity. The visible absorption spectrum of the Y25S variant cytochrome cd1 showed the loss of all peaks associated with signal from a high spin d1 heme species. This was to be expected, following the loss of Tyr25, which puts the d1 heme in a state of high/low spin thermal equilibrium (2Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Upon removal of Tyr25, there was only a signal associated with a low spin d1 heme species (2Cheesman M.R.

A 1.4 Å structure of this variant protein showed only very localized changes in the immediate vicinity of residue 25 (9Gordon E.H.J. Sjögren T. Löfqvist M. Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W.

The protein still had bis-histidinyl coordination at the c heme, and the serine had effectively replaced Tyr25 in the d1 heme pocket, but a sulfate ion (presumably from the precipitant) was bound to the d1 heme rather than the –OH of Ser25. Kinetic assays revealed this enzyme did not require pre-reduction for maximal substrate turnover, unlike wild type cytochrome cd1 (4Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Köppenhofer A. Zajicek R.S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), possibly as a result of the increased accessibility of the d1 heme permitting nitrite to bind and subsequently raise the reduction potential of that heme (9Gordon E.H.J. Sjögren T. Löfqvist M. Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Hajdu J. Fülöp V. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The latter might allow electron transfer from a donor protein even with an energetically uphill initial step due to His/His coordination of the c heme (9Gordon E.H.J. Sjögren T. Löfqvist M. Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Hajdu J. Fülöp V. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). It was assumed that onset of catalytic turnover could also trigger the switching of the c-type center to His/Met coordination. An alternative possibility, that the Y25S enzyme had different heme ligands in solution (e.g. His/Met at the c heme center) compared with the crystal, was deemed very improbable because, as discussed above, the wild type enzyme retained the same heme ligands in the crystal and solution for the oxidized as isolated state. Furthermore, the Y25S protein retained essentially all those structural features in the crystal that can be recognized to stabilize the binding of His17 to the c-type center (9Gordon E.H.J. Sjögren T. Löfqvist M. Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Hajdu J. Fülöp V. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, additional spectroscopic studies of the Y25S protein have, as described in the present work, unexpectedly undermined this conclusion. Because of Tyr25 binding to the d1 heme in the oxidized wild type enzyme, studies of cyanide binding to the d1 heme of P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 have only been possible in the reduced form (8Jafferji A. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Fülöp V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25089-25094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Oxidation of the reduced cyanide bound complex results in the displacement of CN– by Tyr25. It was thought that P. pantotrophus Y25S cytochrome cd1 might allow the study of cyanide and nitrite binding to ferric d1 heme without interference from Tyr25, thus providing insight into the relative affinities of the ferric and ferrous forms of d1 heme for these two anions. Nitrite will bind only to the activated form of oxidized wild type cytochrome cd1 (6Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 883-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the binding affinity of nitrite to ferrous d1 heme could not be determined because the physiological catalytic reaction would reduce nitrite to nitric oxide and water. Protein Purification—The P. pantotrophus Y25S cytochrome cd1 variant was expressed from P. pantotrophus strain EG6202 complemented with a Y25S nirS expression vector, pEG760 (9Gordon E.H.J. Sjögren T. Löfqvist M. Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Hajdu J. Fülöp V. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were grown for 16–24 h on minimal media supplemented with 20 mm succinate and 20 mm nitrate under anaerobic conditions to ensure maximum d1 heme production and incorporation into the protein (9Gordon E.H.J. Sjögren T. Löfqvist M. Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Hajdu J. Fülöp V. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A standard P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 protocol was employed to obtain the periplasmic fraction and purify Y25S cytochrome cd1 from the cell pellets (9Gordon E.H.J. Sjögren T. Löfqvist M. Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Hajdu J. Fülöp V. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Moir J.W. Baratta D. Richardson D.J. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Concentrations of oxidized Y25S cytochrome cd1 were assayed spectroscopically using the absorbance at 410 nm (ϵ = 255,000 m–1 cm–1). P. pantotrophus pseudoazurin was purified from Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) that contained the plasmid pJR2 (12Leung Y.C. Chan C. Reader J.S. Willis A.C. van Spanning R.J. Ferguson S.J. Radford S.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Concentrations of oxidized P. pantotrophus pseudoazurin were determined at 590 nm (ϵ = 1360 m–1 cm–1). Spectroscopy—EPR spectra were recorded on an X-band ER-200D spectrometer (Brüker spectrospin) interfaced to a computer and fitted with a liquid helium flow cryostat (ESR-9; Oxford Instruments, Oxford, UK). MCD spectra were recorded on either a circular dichrograph (JASCO-J-500D) for the wavelength range 280–1000 nm or a laboratory-built dichrograph for the range 800–2500 nm. Samples were mounted within an Oxford Instruments SM4 split-coil super-conducting solenoid capable of generating magnetic fields of up to 5 T for low temperature measurements and in an Oxford Instruments SM1 6 tesla superconducting solenoid with an ambient temperature bore for room temperature MCD measurements. All solutions used in this study were dissolved in deuterated 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at the pH* values specified in the text (pH* is the apparent pH of D2O solutions measured using a standard glass pH electrode). Samples for MCD included deuterated glycerol (C3H5O3D3) in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio, as a glassing agent. Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda-2 spectrophotometer or a Hitachi instrument. Titrations with Anionic Ligands—Equilibrium binding parameters of cyanide were determined by titrating potassium cyanide into an air-tight cuvette containing a solution of oxidized P. pantotrophus Y25S cytochrome cd1 essentially as described in Jafferji et al. (8Jafferji A. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Fülöp V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25089-25094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using an excess of potassium cyanide, it was shown that only the d1 heme significantly bound cyanide at the range of concentrations of cyanide used in the titration. On addition of cyanide to the cuvette, using a Hamilton syringe, the solution was allowed to equilibrate, and then the cyanide binding affinity was monitored spectroscopically using the absorption at 672 nm. Note that the visible absorption spectrum of the Y25S cytochrome cd1 variant is different from that of the wild type, and therefore it was not appropriate to use the absorption at 632 nm as described in Jafferji et al. (8Jafferji A. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Fülöp V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25089-25094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The same method was used when titrating dithionite-reduced Y25S cytochrome cd1 that had been passed down a PD10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). The equilibrium binding parameters of nitrite were measured in the same fashion using potassium nitrite. Visible Absorption Spectroscopy—Fig. 1 shows the oxidized and reduced visible absorption spectra of Y25S P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1. The Söret band of the Y25S cytochrome cd1 spectrum is red shifted from 406 nm for the wild type to 410 nm, a value consistent with, but not reliably diagnostic for, His/Met coordination of the c heme as in other cytochromes cd1 (2Cheesman M.R.

J. 1986; 233: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), including activated P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 (6Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 883-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Köppenhofer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As seen in Gordon et al. (9Gordon E.H.J. Sjögren T. Löfqvist M. Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Hajdu J. Fülöp V. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the Y25S spectrum has a single broad peak above 600 nm at ∼640 nm; this is consistent with the disappearance of the high/low spin thermal equilibrium at the d1 heme caused, in the wild type enzyme, by Tyr25 coordination (2Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), leaving only a low spin species. The spectra of reduced P. pantotrophus wild type and Y25S cytochrome cd1 are identical, leading to the assumption they have the same structure in the vicinity of the absorbing cofactors. The absorbance maximum at ∼ 650 nm, in the reduced spectra of both proteins, allows direct comparison of d1 heme content with the wild type protein. Y25S consistently contains less d1 heme per dimer. Exact amounts varied from preparation to preparation but were never <80% that of the wild type. Room Temperature MCD Spectroscopy—The ultraviolet and visible region room temperature MCD spectrum of oxidized Y25S cytochrome cd1 is shown in Fig. 2. As with all cytochromes cd1, the signal between 300 and 580 nm is typical of low spin ferric protoheme (16Cheesman M.R. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 36: 201-255Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar); contributions in this region from ferric d1 hemes are significantly weaker than those of the ferric c hemes (17Stolzenberg A.M. Strauss S.H. Holm R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981; 103: 4763-4778Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In this case, the spectrum is identical to that of Pseudomonas stutzeri cytochrome cd1 at room temperature (2Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), a protein with His/Met coordination at the c heme. Fig. 3 shows the room temperature near-infrared MCD spectrum of oxidized “as isolated” wild type and Y25S cytochrome cd1 at room temperature in the region between 700 and 2000 nm. The wild type protein has a predominant peak at 1530 nm, whereas the Y25S protein has this peak red shifted to 1775 nm. Both these peaks have higher energy shoulders. The peaks observed for each protein are consistent with the near-infrared charge transfer bands associated with low spin ferric protohemes (i.e. the c heme of cytochrome cd1) and can be used as a diagnostic tool to assign heme ligands in b/c-type cytochromes (16Cheesman M.R. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 36: 201-255Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The Y25S cytochrome cd1 band at 1775 nm lies in the region indicative of His/Met coordination, whereas the wild type cytochrome cd1 band at 1530 nm lies in the region diagnostic of His/His coordination. These results indicate that, at room temperature, the c heme of Y25S cytochrome cd1 has His/Met coordination in solution, differing from the crystal structure (9Gordon E.H.J. Sjögren T. Löfqvist M. Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Hajdu J. Fülöp V. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The near-infrared MCD spectrum of P. pantotrophus Y25S cytochrome cd1 is identical to that of the wild type P. stutzeri (2Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14Sutherland J. Greenwood C. Peterson J. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) cytochromes cd1, both of which have His/Met axial ligands to their c hemes. Fig. 3 shows a significant broad signal at ∼1000 nm in the spectrum of the wild type P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 that is not present in the Y25S protein. This feature has been attributed to the high spin ferric d1 heme that is present in thermal equilibrium with the low spin species at room temperature because of Tyr25 coordination in wild type P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 (2Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). EPR Spectroscopy—The X-band EPR spectrum at 10 K of P. pantotrophus Y25S cytochrome cd1 is shown in Fig. 4; there are multiple features. For P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1, the three features at g = 2.93, 2.34, and ∼1.4 can be attributed to a low spin ferric c heme with His/Met axial ligands (5Allen J.W.A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Köppenhofer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The semi-apo form of cytochrome cd1 (with the d1 heme removed) has near identical g values; this type of cytochrome cd1 has been described as having His/Met ligands to the c heme (15Köppenhofer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an oxidized holo form of wild type cytochrome cd1, generated by oxidation of the reduced enzyme by hydroxylamine, displaying a gy value of 2.33, was shown to have His/Met ligation at the c heme (5Allen J.W.A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Allen J.W.A. Cheesman M.R. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Additionally, these features are also very similar to those seen in the X-band EPR spectra of P. stutzeri and P. aeruginosa cytochromes cd1, both of which have His/Met coordination at their c hemes (2Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In previous work, it has been shown that the c-type cytochrome center of wild type P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 has a relatively unusual EPR spectrum of the “large gmax type,” in which gz is >3, and the other two g values are not easily detected (2Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Köppenhofer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This feature is thought to be due to bis-histidinyl axial ligation with the orientation of the imidazoles closer to perpendicular than parallel (19Walker F.A. Huynh B.H. Scheidt W.R. Osvath S.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5288-5297Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar), as is observed in the crystal structure of wild type P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 (1Fülöp V. Moir J.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). There is no corresponding feature in the spectrum of P. pantotrophus Y25S cytochrome cd1. These EPR observations are absolutely consistent with Y25S cytochrome cd1 having His/Met axial ligands at low temperature, but without low temperature MCD it cannot be said so categorically. It remains possible, but unlikely, that the c heme of Y25S cytochrome cd1 may switch from His/Met at room temperature to His/His at low temperature, due to a freezing artifact or thermal equilibrium. Note that the x-ray crystal structure of Y25S cytochrome cd1 was determined at liquid N2 temperature (9Gordon E.H.J. Sjögren T. Löfqvist M. Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Hajdu J. Fülöp V. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The remaining EPR features at g = 2.57, 2.44, 2.25, 1.87, and 1.61 (Fig. 4) are consistent with previously observed characteristics of low spin ferric d1 heme and can be assigned to a rhombic species with g = 2.57, 2.25, and 1.87 together with an axial species with g = 2.44, 2.44, and 1.61 (2Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Köppenhofer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These g values are thought to represent His/OH– coordination at the d1 heme, which is highly likely in oxidized Y25S cytochrome cd1 because the d1 heme is exposed. It is clear that there are two different species of low spin ferric d1 heme possibly sharing a g value of 2.44. These two species could be caused by two different orientations of OH–. Features at g = 6.95 and 4.99 are characteristic of rhombically distorted high spin ferric d1 heme present in trace amounts. These g values have been seen in varying amounts in all wild-type P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 preparations (2Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 5Allen J.W.A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Low Temperature MCD Spectroscopy—It was clear from the experiments described above that at room temperature the ligands to the oxidized c heme were His/Met in solution for the Y25S protein. In addition, the evidence from the EPR measurements also strongly suggested that the oxidized c heme ligands were His/Met. However, although the room temperature near-infrared MCD showed that the coordination was His/Met, the EPR cannot be taken as certain evidence for retention of this coordination at the much lower temperature used with the latter technique. Consequently, low temperature near-infrared MCD analysis was undertaken, using two pH values such that any influence of proton concentration on the c-type cytochrome center could be assessed at the same time. The visible low temperature MCD spectra of samples at pH 6.5 (a pH close to physiological pH and that (pH 5.8) which produced maximal activity (4Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Köppenhofer A. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3093-3100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) and pH 8.5 are shown in Fig. 5. In both spectra it is clear there is no signal above 700 nm. Cheesman et al. (2Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) showed that any signal of >700 nm is due to high spin ferric d1 heme that is in thermal equilibrium with low spin ferric d1 heme in wild type P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 at room temperature. This observation confirms that the previously mentioned EPR features of the possibly two species of d1 heme are both from low spin hemes. The low temperature near-infrared MCD spectra of Y25S cytochrome cd1 at pH 6.5 and pH 8.5 are shown in Fig. 6. It is clear that the sample at pH 8.5 is close to 100% His/Met, base"
