https://openalex.org/W2009772373,"A synthetic theory of the ecology of amphibian metamorphosis is founded on the observation that the large variation in length of larval period and body size at metamorphosis typical of a particular species of amphibian cannot be directly explained by differences in dates of hatching or egg sizes. It is proposed that as development proceeds, variation in exponential growth coefficients causes a trend from a normal distribution to a skewed distribution of body sizes. The degree of skewing increases and the median of the distribution decreases with increasing initial densities of populations. The relative advantages of the largest members of a cohort may arise from a variety of mechanisms including the production of growth inhibitors, interference competition, and size-selective feeding behavior. These mechanisms result in a nonnormal distribution of competitive ability, a possible source of the density-dependent competition coefficient found in systems with many species (1). In our model the ranges of body sizes and dates of metamorphosis are determined by a minimum body size that must be obtained and a maximum body size that will not be exceeded at metamorphosis. Between these two size thresholds the endocrinological initiation of metamorphosis is expected to be related to the recent growth history of the individual larva. Species that exploit uncertain environments will have a wide range of possible sizes at metamorphosis. Species exploiting relatively certain environments will have a narrower range. The evolution of neoteny and direct development logically follow from the application of these ideas to the ecological context of the evolution of amphibian life histories. Species that live in constant aquatic habitats surrounded by hostile environments (desert ponds, caves, high-altitude lakes) may evolve permanent larvae genetically incapable of metamorphosis. Other populations may evolve a facultative metamorphosis such that populations are a mixture of neotenes and terrestrial adults. Direct development results from selection to escape the competition, predation, and environmental uncertainty characteristic of some aquatic habitats and is usually accompanied by parental care. The relation between our ecological model and the physiological mechanisms that initiate metamorphosis can only be suggested and it remains an open problem for developmental biologists."

Methanol could be used now as a means for marketing economically the natural gas that is otherwise going to waste in remote locations. If methanol were used as an additive to gasoline at a rate of 5 to 15 percent, for use in internal combustion engines, there would be an immediate reduction in atmospheric pollution, there would be less need for lead in fuel, and automobile performance would be improved. With increasing production of fuel-grade methanol from coal and other sources, we foresee the increasing use of methanol for electrical power plants, for heating, and for other fuel applications. We hope that a practical methanol fuel cell will be commercially available by the time that methanol becomes plentiful for fuel purposes. Methanol offers a particularly attractive form of solar-energy conservation, since agricultural and forest waste products can be used as the starting material. Indeed, at 1 percent conversion efficiency the forest lands could supply the entire present energy requirements of the United States."

This treatment also affects all HL-A antigens of the cell, which cap together with beta(2)-microglobulin, so that the cell becomes resistant to lysis upon addition of antibodies to HL-A in the presence of complement. These findings suggest that a physical linkage exists between these two classes of polypeptides at the surface of the living cell and is in agreement with recent biochemical data obtained by others with cell membrane preparations."
https://openalex.org/W2032501485,"The radiation-induced polymerization of formaldehyde has been studied in the solid state. The time of addition of one new link to a polymer chain increases exponentially in accordance with the Arrhenius law at 140 to 80 K, but approaches a constant value (approximately 10(-2) second) at temperatures below 10 K. Thus, a low-temperature limit to a chemical reaction rate has been observed. It is interpreted as a quantum effect caused by tunneling from the zero vibration level of the initial state, and a semiquantitative theory is given. The phenomenon should be taken into account for understanding tunneling of electrons in biological systems when such tunneling is accompanied by conformational changes. It could also be significant in slow, exothermic chemical reactions at low and ultralow temperatures, which may have had a role in chemical and biological evolution (cold prehistory of life?)."
https://openalex.org/W2012554803,"Craters attributable to hypervelocity impacts of micrometeorites have been discovered on rare chondrule-like objects from the gas-rich meteorite Kapoeta. These chondrule-like objects, probably generated by impacts themselves, provide further evidence for the regolith origin of Kapoeta. The micrometeorite flux at the time of formation of the meteorites was probably an order of magnitude higher than the present flux, but the solar luminosity could not have been higher than 1.7 times its present value."
https://openalex.org/W2050255016,"The Nimbus 5 microwave spectrometer has been used to measure thermal radiation in five frequency bands between 22.235 and 58.8 gigahertz, and has yielded both the temperature profile and, over ocean, the vapor and liquid water content of the terrestrial atmosphere, even in overcast conditions. Information has also been obtained on geophysical parameters that affect the surface emissivity, such as ice type, sea roughness, and snow cover. The experiment demonstrates the considerable potential of passive microwave sensing of meteorological and geophysical parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2060815956,A simple hydrodynamic model yields steady-state solutions with many of the properties of the Great Red Spot and the neighboring belts and zones of Jupiter. No special forcing mechanism is necessary to maintain the circulation of the Spot. This is consistent with observations which indicate that the Great Red Spot and the zones have similar dynamic properties.

This energetic electron source may be distinguishable from the solar wind diffusion source by the radial flux profile and by the characteristic electron energies."

https://openalex.org/W2049411150,"(31 Aug., p. 819) argue that, because current pricing practices do not internalize environmental costs, some mechanism other than the market is needed to protect environmental values. They propose a system of environmental credits-natural resource units (NRU's)-to be allocated to individuals and industrial organizations. Although their system is ingenious, I offer the following objections. 1) The system is, first of all, terribly cumbersome. If most families now have difficulty in keeping track of one checking account, think of the problems of maintaining two accounts. 2) How would environmental qualities be evaluated in terms of NRU's? Clearly the process would be extraordinarily cumbersome, arbitrary, and expensive. Maintaining a bureaucracy for establishing and managing NRU's would in itself have a major environmental impact. 3) As I have already pointed out (1), in addition to externalizing environmental costs, industrial activities have failed to internalize human health costs. Because NRU's would not provide equity for those costs, would there not be justice in demanding still a third system of allocating human health costs, or HHC's, to individuals? A monthly electric bill, for example, would then list dollars, NRU's, and HHC's separately, to be paid from three different accounts. 4) Last, and most important, there is a far simpler solution availablethe use of taxes to internalize environmental and health costs so that each consumer pays his fair share.
