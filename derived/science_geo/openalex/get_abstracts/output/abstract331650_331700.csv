https://openalex.org/W2063916326,"The benthos of the east and west sides of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, is characterized by dramatically different infaunal assemblages. The eutrophic East Sound has higher infaunal densities than almost any other benthic assemblage in the world. In contrast, the oligotrophic West Sound, bathed by currents from beneath the Ross Ice Shelf, has patterns of mobile epifauna and low infauna density similar to bathyl deep-sea communities."

Rapid-cycling brassicas can produce up to ten generations of seed per year and serve as models for research in genetics, host-parasite relations, molecular biology, cell biology, plant biochemistry, population biology, and plant breeding. Brassicas are a highly diverse group of crop plants that have great economic value as vegetables and as sources of condiment mustard, edible and industrial oil, animal fodder, and green manure. These plants can also be used in the classroom as convenient, rapidly responding, living plant materials for ""hands on"" learning at all levels of our educational system."
https://openalex.org/W2072622373,"Vibration-rotation lines of C(3) have been identified in the circumstellar spectrum of the obscured carbon star IRC+10216. This molecule is of interest in both the chemistry of flames, where it may be involved in the formation of soot, and in astrophysics, where it is a potential building block for carbonaceous grains. This high-resolution infrared detection of the pure carbon chain molecule C(3) allows the estimation of the equilibrium C-C bond length, 1.297 angstroms. Possible astrophysical formation and destruction mechanisms for C(3) are reviewed, including the relationship between C(3) and carbon clusters."
https://openalex.org/W1984641597,"A diamond-anvil, high-pressure apparatus was used to extend the upper pressure limit of static laboratory experiments. Shifts of the R(1) strong fluorescent line of ruby were observed that correspond to static pressures of 0.21 to 0.55 terapascal (2.1 to 5.5 megabars) at 25 degrees C. Sensitive spectroscopic techniques in the pressure range 0.15 to 0.28 terapascal were used to observe ruby and diamond fluorescence separately; these two fluorescent emissions overlap strongly at high pressures. At pressures greater than approximately 0.28 terapascal, the diamond fluorescence diminished and the ruby fluorescence reappeared strongly. Pressure was determined by extrapolation of the calibrated shift of the ruby R(1) line."
https://openalex.org/W1996937471,"To help feed, clothe, and house an increasing population, to make marginal lands more productive, to meet challenging resource needs, and to reforest the devastated tropics, we need a revitalized worldwide investigation of little-known plant species. Such an effort would expand our agricultural resource base and ease our dangerous dependence on a relative handful of crops. It would build a more stable food supply for drought-stricken Africa and other parts of the Third World, and it would reclothe many of the barren lands where erosion now threatens disaster. Some plants that are now virtually unknown are likely to become mainstays of international agriculture and industry."
https://openalex.org/W2037227664,"Voyager images of the uranian satellites Ariel and Miranda show flow features with morphologies indicating that ice has been extruded to the satellites' surfaces in the solid state. These images provide the first observational evidence for solid-state ice volcanism in the solar system. Topographic profiles have been measured across a number of flow features on Ariel. With a simple model of extrusion, spreading, and cooling of a viscous flow, the initial viscosity of the flow material is found to have been no more than about 10(16) poise, far lower than expected for H(2)O ice at the ambient surface temperatures in the uranian system. Sharply reduced viscosities may have resulted from incorporation of ices like NH(3) or CH(4) in the uranian satellites."
https://openalex.org/W2079507389,"The ratios of refractory elements to silicon and of zinc to silicon indicate that the silicate portion of the Netschaëvo meteorite is an ordinary chondrite. The scarcity of chondrules, the large dimensions (about 100 micrometers) of plagioclase grains, and the low indium content (0.09 nanogram per gram) indicate that Netschaëvo belongs to petrologic type 6. On a diagram of reduced iron versus oxidized iron, Netschaëvo lies along an extrapolation of the LL-L-H ordinary chondrite fractionation trend. The abundances of siderophile elements (nickel, germanium, iridium, and gold) are about 1.6 to 2.0 times greater than in H-group chondrites, and siderophile/nickel ratios are, with one exception, those expected from LL-L-H trends. This evidence indicates that Netschaëvo is an extremely iron-rich member of the ordinary chondrite sequence, and that plausible models to account for the ordinary chondrite sequence must produce materials having iron/silicon ratios 25 percent greater than those in CI carbonaceous chondrites. The existence of Netschaëvo emphasizes that the chondritic meteorites in terrestrial collections are a biased and incomplete selection of primitive solar system materials."

Comprehension skills well beyond simple decoding are now required. Research by educators and psychologists has laid a scientific foundation on which new pedagogic methods can be based. But even with better teaching, the hope that all adults can attain the highest levels of literacy skills may be unrealistic."
https://openalex.org/W2074049462,"The countries of the European Economic Community have recently mounted considerable efforts to commercialize biotechnology. Together, these efforts approach the same number of companies and level of government spending as those in the United States. In Europe there is more government emphasis on support for industry-university collaborations and industrial projects than in the United States, where basic research is emphasized. European efforts are often not easily delineated from those in the United States; many European companies have extensive U.S. operations and many U.S. companies have involvement in Europe. Strategies and efforts in European biotechnology are examined and compared to those in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2070906796,"Beetles secrete an array of chemicals generally believed to mitigate attack by predators. Methylcyclopentanoid monoterpenes secreted by larvae of the willow leaf beetle, Plagiodera versicolora, deter feeding by conspecific adults. Furthermore, the secretion elicits a strong repugnancy response in larvae of another willow herbivore, Nymphalis antiopa. Leaves bearing beetle larvae are less likely than leaves not bearing beetles to be frequented and consumed by Nymphalis larvae. Predator defense may not be the sole function of glandular secretions produced by herbivorous insects; secretions may also mediate interactions among herbivores that use a common resource."
https://openalex.org/W2074897514,"The development of an immobilized enzyme system for commercial application involves a series of decisions and compromises beginning with the choice of enzyme support and ending with the decision on operational mode. Each step is dependent on the other steps, and all the steps influence the overall economics of the final process. Compromises need to be made about the support, method of enzyme attachment, reactor type, kinetic behavior, and operating strategy. Selection of the enzyme carrier and its composition will have a major effect on the pH optimum, metal requirements, and overall performance of the immobilized enzyme system. The reactor type and its behavior will also affect performance. For commercial applications the fixed-bed reactor is generally the reactor type of choice. Knowledge of the appropriate kinetics is necessary to achieve the desired product quality and to reduce cost. One important kinetic parameter is reaction velocity under real world conditions. Rate expressions must take into consideration back-mixing and mass transfer limitations, both internal and external to the immobilized enzyme particles. In addition to understanding kinetic behavior, one must devise a proper operating strategy for producing the greatest amount of product at the least cost, while maintaining constant productivity over time. The success of any scale-up will be determined by the final processing cost as compared to that of the alternatives."

No teeth are preserved, but elliptical alveoli suggest a ziphodont dentition. This is the first known occurrence of such a crocodilian in Australia and probably the most recent in the world. The specimen is not referable to any known species."

Pressures in excess of 68 gigapascals (680 kilobars) were achieved, as determined from the fluorescence line of a ruby fragment sandwiched between the diamonds."
