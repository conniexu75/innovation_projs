https://openalex.org/W2023471002,"Pendred syndrome is a recessively inherited disorder with the hallmark features of congenital deafness and thyroid goitre. By some estimates, the disorder may account for upwards of 10% of hereditary deafness. Previous genetic linkage studies localized the gene to a broad interval on human chromosome 7q22-31.1. Using a positional cloning strategy, we have identified the gene (PDS) mutated in Pendred syndrome and found three apparently deleterious mutations, each segregating with the disease in the respective families in which they occur. PDS produces a transcript of approximately 5 kb that was found to be expressed at significant levels only in the thyroid. The predicted protein, pendrin, is closely related to a number of known sulphate transporters. These studies provide compelling evidence that defects in pendrin cause Pendred syndrome thereby launching a new area of investigation into thyroid physiology, the pathogenesis of congenital deafness and the role of altered sulphate transport in human disease."

Previous studies indicate that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors improve endothelium-dependent relaxation by increasing ecNOS activity. To determine whether HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can prevent hypoxia-mediated down-regulation of ecNOS function and expression, human endothelial cells were exposed to hypoxia (3% O2) in the presence of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin for various durations (0–48 h). Hypoxia decreased ecNOS protein and mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner, resulting in a 4- and 9-fold reduction after 48 h, respectively. In a concentration-dependent manner, simvastatin, and to a lesser extent, lovastatin, prevented the down-regulation of ecNOS expression by hypoxia. Simvastatin-induced changes in ecNOS expression correlated with changes in endothelial NO production and were reversed by treatment with l-mevalonate. Actinomycin D studies revealed that under hypoxic conditions, simvastatin increased ecNOS mRNA half-life from 13 to 38 h. Nuclear run-on studies showed that simvastatin had no effect on repression of ecNOS gene transcription by hypoxia. These results indicate that HMG CoA reductase inhibitors regulate ecNOS function and expression through changes in ecNOS mRNA stability and suggest that treatment with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may have beneficial effects in patients with hypoxia-mediated pulmonary hypertension.

These results indicate that HMG CoA reductase inhibitors regulate ecNOS function and expression through changes in ecNOS mRNA stability and suggest that treatment with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may have beneficial effects in patients with hypoxia-mediated pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals exposed to hypoxic conditions (1Scherrer U. Vollenweider L. Delabays A. Savcic M. Eichenberger U. Kleger G.R.

Recent studies demonstrate that pulmonary arterial vessels from patients with pulmonary hypertension have impaired release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor or nitric oxide (NO) (2Giaid A.

Indeed, individuals with pulmonary hypertension demonstrate reduced levels of endothelial cell nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) 1The abbreviations used are: ecNOS, endothelial cell nitric oxide synthase; LNMA,N ω-monomethyl-l-arginine; HMG CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. expression in their pulmonary vessels and benefit clinically from inhalation NO therapy (4Roberts J.D. Fineman J.R. Morin F.C. Shaul P.W. Rimar S. Schreiber M.D. Polin R.A. Zwass M.S. Zayek M.M. Gross I. Heymann M.A. Zapol W.M. N. Engl. J.

Conversely, mutant mice lacking ecNOS gene or newborn lambs treated with the ecNOS inhibitor,N ω-monomethyl-l-arginine (LNMA), develop progressive elevation of pulmonary arterial pressures and resistance (6Steudel W.

Soifer S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2675-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that hypoxia causes pulmonary vasoconstriction via inhibition of ecNOS expression and activity (8Adnot S. Raffestin B. Eddahibi S. Braquet P. Chabrier P.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 9Liao J.K. Zulueta J.J. Yu F.S. Peng H.B. Cote C.G. Hassoun P.M. J. Clin.

Physiol. 1994; 267: H1921-H1927PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, hypoxia-mediated down-regulation of ecNOS may lead to the vasoconstrictive and structural changes associated with pulmonary hypertension. Clinical trials with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A- (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors have shown that a reduction in serum cholesterol level is correlated with improved endothelium-dependent relaxation in atherosclerotic vessels (11Treasure C.B. Klein J.L. Weintraub W.S. Talley J.D. Stillabower M.E. Kosinski A.S. Zhang J. Boccuzzi S.J. Cedarholm J.C. Alexander R.W. N. Engl. J.

Med. 1995; 332: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). The HMG CoA reductase inhibitors lower serum cholesterol levels by blocking the hepatic conversion of HMG CoA to l-mevalonate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (13Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4566) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which HMG CoA reductase inhibitors restore endothelial function has been almost exclusively attributed to the lowering of serum cholesterol levels (14Levine G.N. Keaney J.F. Vita J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), little is known whether HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can restore endothelial function under non-hypercholesterolemic conditions. We hypothesize that HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can increase ecNOS activity and improve endothelium-dependent relaxation under hypoxic conditions via effects on endothelial rather than hepatic HMG CoA reductase. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine whether inhibition of endothelial HMG CoA reductase can modulate hypoxia-mediated down-regulation of ecNOS expression and activity. All standard culture reagents were obtained from JRH Bioscience (Lenexa, KS). Actinomycin D, 2,3-diaminonaphthalene, andl-mevalonate were purchased from Sigma). [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) were supplied by NEN Life Science Products. LNMA was obtained from Calbiochem. The antibody detection kit (Enhanced Chemiluminescence) and the nylon nucleic acid (Hybond) and protein polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes were purchased from Amersham Corp. Simvastatin and lovastatin were obtained from Merck Sharp and Dohme. Since endothelial cells lack lactonases to effectively process simvastatin and lovastatin to their active forms, these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors were chemically activated by alkaline hydrolysis before their use, as described previously (15Gerson R.J.

Human endothelial cells were harvested using Type II collagenase (Worthington) as described previously (16Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Cells of less than three passages were grown to confluence in a culture medium containing Medium 199, 20 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth factor (Collaborative Research Inc., Bedford, MA), 100 μg/ml heparin sulfate, 5 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and an antibiotic mixture of 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1.25 μg/ml Fungizone. For all experiments, the endothelial cells were grown to confluence before any treatment conditions. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) for 1 h before treatment with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. Confluent endothelial cells grown in 100-mm culture dishes were treated with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors and then placed without culture dish covers in humidified airtight incubation chambers (Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA). The chambers were gassed with 20 or 3% O2, 5% CO2, and balanced nitrogen for 10 min before sealing the chambers. The chambers were maintained in a 37 °C incubator for various durations (0–48 h) and found to have less than 2% variation in O2concentration, as described previously (9Liao J.K. Zulueta J.J. Yu F.S. Peng H.B. Cote C.G. Hassoun P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2661-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Cellular confluence and viability were determined by cell count, morphology, and trypan blue exclusion. Equal amounts of total RNA (10–20 μg) were separated by 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred overnight onto Hybond nylon membranes by capillary action, and baked for 2 h at 80 °C before prehybridization. Radiolabeling of human full-length ecNOS cDNA (16Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) was performed using random hexamer priming, [α-32P]CTP, and Klenow (Pharmacia). The membranes were hybridized with the probes overnight at 45 °C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSC (1 × SSC, 0.15 m NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate), 2.5 X Denhardt's solution, 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 0.1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. All Northern blots were subjected to stringent washing conditions (0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C) before autoradiography with intensifying screen at −80 °C for 24–72 h. RNA loading was determined by either rehybridization with human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe or by ethidium bromide staining of 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA on the nylon membranes. Cellular proteins were prepared and separated on SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (9Liao J.K. Zulueta J.J. Yu F.S. Peng H.B. Cote C.G. Hassoun P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2661-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using a murine monoclonal antibody to human ecNOS (1:400 dilution; Tansduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Immunodetection was accomplished using a sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:4,000 dilution) and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Corp). Autoradiography was performed at 23 °C, and the appropriate exposures were quantitated by densitometry. Confluent endothelial cells (5 × 107 cells were treated with simvastatin (1 μm) in the presence of 20 or 3% O2 for 24 h. Nuclei were isolated, and in vitro transcription was performed as described previously (9Liao J.K. Zulueta J.J. Yu F.S. Peng H.B. Cote C.G. Hassoun P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2661-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Equal amounts (1 μg) of purified, denatured full-length human ecNOS, human β-tubulin (ATCC number 37855), and linearized pGEM-3z cDNA were vacuum-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a slot blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). Hybridization of radiolabeled mRNA transcripts to the nitrocellulose membranes was carried out at 45 °C for 48 h in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 2.5 × Denhardt's solution, 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 0.1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The membranes were then washed with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 65 °C before autoradiography for 72 h at −80 °C. Band intensities were subjected to analyses by laser densitometry. The ecNOS activity was determined by a modified nitrite assay as described previously (9Liao J.K. Zulueta J.J. Yu F.S. Peng H.B. Cote C.G. Hassoun P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2661-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 17Misko T.P. Schilling R.J. Salvemini D. Moore W.M. Currie M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Briefly, endothelial cells grown in phenol-free medium were exposed to either 20 or 3% O2 in the presence and absence of simvastatin (1 μm). After 24 h, 300 μl of conditioned medium was mixed with 30 μl of freshly prepared 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (1.5 mm 2,3-diaminonaphthalene in 1 m HCl). The mixture was protected from light and incubated at 20 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated with 15 μl of 2.8 m NaOH. Fluorescence of 1-(H)-naphthotriazole was measured with excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 and 450 nm, respectively. Standard curves were constructed with known amounts of sodium nitrite. Nonspecific fluorescence was determined in the presence of LNMA (5 mm). Previous studies with nitrate reductase indicate that the nitrite to nitrate concentration in the medium was approximately 5:1 and that this ratio did not vary with exposure to 20 or 3% O2 concentration (9Liao J.K. Zulueta J.J. Yu F.S. Peng H.B. Cote C.G. Hassoun P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2661-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Band intensities from Northern and nuclear run-on assay blots were analyzed densitometrically by the National Institutes of Health Image Program (18Rasband W. NIH Image Program, Version 1.49. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1993Google Scholar). All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. compared with controls and among separate experiments. Paired and unpaired Student's t tests were employed to determine the significance of changes in ecNOS activity and densitometric measurements. A significant difference was taken forp values less than 0.05. Relatively pure (>98%) human saphenous vein endothelial cell cultures were confirmed by their morphological features (i.e. cuboidal, cobblestone, contact-inhibited) using phase-contrast microscopy and immunofluorescent staining with antibodies to Factor VIII (data not shown). There were no observable adverse effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors,l-mevalonate, or hypoxia on cellular morphology and viability. However, higher concentrations of simvastatin (>15 μm) or lovastatin (>50 μm) caused cytotoxicity after 36 h, and therefore, were not used. Otherwise, cellular confluency and viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion were maintained for all treatment conditions described. The activity of ecNOS was assessed by measuring the LNMA-inhibitable nitrite accumulation from human endothelial cells (9Liao J.K. Zulueta J.J. Yu F.S. Peng H.B. Cote C.G. Hassoun P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2661-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 17Misko T.P. Schilling R.J. Salvemini D. Moore W.M. Currie M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). The ratio of nitrite to nitrate production under our culture conditions was approximately 5:1 and was similar for hypoxia and normoxia (data not shown). Basal ecNOS activity at 20% O2 was 6.0 ± 3.3 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h. Exposure of endothelial cells to 3% O2 for 24 h decreased nitrite production by 75 ± 14% (1.5 ± 0.9 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1). Treatment with simvastatin (1 μm) not only completely reversed the down-regulation of ecNOS by hypoxia but resulted in a 3-fold increase in ecNOS activity over basal activity (18 ± 5.0 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, p < 0.05). This up-regulation of ecNOS activity was attenuated by the addition of l-mevalonate (400 μm) (9.6 ± 1.3 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h,p < 0.05). Interestingly, simvastatin (1 μm) alone up-regulated nitrite production 5-fold (30 ± 6.5 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, p < 0.01), which was completely blocked by l-mevalonate (400 μm) (8.6 ± 2.9 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, p < 0.05). We and others have previously shown that hypoxia decreases ecNOS protein expression (9Liao J.K. Zulueta J.J. Yu F.S. Peng H.B. Cote C.G. Hassoun P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2661-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 19Ziesche R. Petkov V. Williams J. Zakeri S.M. Mosgoller W. Knofler M. Block L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12478-12483Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Compared with normoxia (20% O2), exposure to hypoxia (3% O2) resulted in a 46 ± 4% and 75 ± 3% reduction in ecNOS protein levels after 24 and 48 h, respectively (p < 0.01,n = 3) (Fig.2 A). Treatment with HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin (1 μm), increased ecNOS protein levels by 2-fold after 24 h of normoxia (210 ± 18%,p < 0.05, n = 3) and completely reversed the decrease in ecNOS protein levels after 24 h of hypoxia (110 ± 10%, p > 0.05) compared with untreated normoxia (n = 3). Interestingly, treatment with simvastatin (1 μm) for 48 h resulted in not only a reversal of hypoxia-mediated decrease in ecNOS protein levels but also caused a significant increase in ecNOS protein levels above base line (160 ± 13%, p < 0.05 compared with untreated normoxia, n = 3). In a concentration-dependent manner, treatment with simvastatin attenuated the hypoxia-mediated decrease in ecNOS protein levels after 48 h (Fig. 2 B). At higher concentrations of simvastatin (1 and 10 μm), ecNOS protein levels were up-regulated to 160 ± 13% and 220 ± 21% above basal levels (p < 0.01, n = 3). Co-treatment with l-mevalonate (400 μm) significantly blocked the simvastatin-induced increase in ecNOS protein levels after 48 h (35 ± 3% above basal levels,p < 0.01, n = 3). Treatment with l-mevalonate alone, however, produced minimal effects on basal ecNOS protein levels in untreated cells exposed to hypoxia (25 ± 4% above basal levels, p < 0.05,n = 3). Simvastatin that was not chemically converted to its active form had no effect on ecNOS expression or activity (data not shown). Similarly, another HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, also prevented the hypoxia-mediated decrease in ecNOS protein levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3). Because lovastatin has a higher IC50 value for HMG CoA reductase compared with that of simvastatin (19Ziesche R. Petkov V. Williams J. Zakeri S.M. Mosgoller W. Knofler M. Block L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12478-12483Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), little if any reversal of ecNOS protein levels was observed after 24 h of exposure to hypoxia in the presence or absence of 1 μm of lovastatin (62 ± 7%versus 54 ± 4%). However, after 48 h of exposure to hypoxia, 1 μm lovastatin not only completely reversed the down-regulation of ecNOS protein levels but also increased ecNOS protein levels to 130 ± 9% above basal levels (p< 0.05, n = 3). With higher concentrations of lovastatin (10 μm), ecNOS protein levels were increased to 170 ± 13% that of basal levels (p < 0.01,n = 3). Again, l-mevalonate (400 μm) alone had no effects on ecNOS protein levels under hypoxic conditions but in combination with lovastatin almost completely blocked the effects of the lovastatin-induced increase in ecNOS protein expression (26 ± 23 and 37 ± 3% that of basal levels, respectively). These results indicate that simvastatin- and lovastatin-mediated increases in ecNOS protein expression are mostly likely due to the inhibition of endothelial HMG CoA reductase activity. To determine whether changes in ecNOS protein levels are due to changes in ecNOS steady-state mRNA levels, we performed Northern blotting on endothelial cells exposed to normoxia and hypoxia in the presence or absence of simvastatin (1 μm) and lovastatin (10 μm). Simvastatin alone increased ecNOS mRNA levels by 340 ± 24% (p < 0.01,n = 3). Exposure of endothelial cells to hypoxia reduced ecNOS mRNA levels by 70 ± 2 and 88 ± 4% after 24 and 48 h, respectively (Fig.4 A). Co-treatment with simvastatin not only completely reversed the hypoxia-mediated decrease in ecNOS mRNA levels but increased ecNOS mRNA levels to 200 ± 12 and 530 ± 30% those of basal levels after 24 and 48 h, respectively (p < 0.01, n = 3). Similarly, lovastatin (10 μm) alone increased ecNOS message by 350 ± 27 and 410 ± 21% under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, respectively (p < 0.01,n = 3) (Fig. 4 B). Neither simvastatin nor lovastatin caused any significant change in G-protein αsand β-actin mRNA levels under normoxic or hypoxic conditions (data not shown). These results indicate that the effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors are relatively selective in terms of their effects on ecNOS mRNA expression. Previous studies have shown that cytokines such as TNF-α or interleukin-1 decrease ecNOS mRNA expression (19Ziesche R. Petkov V. Williams J. Zakeri S.M. Mosgoller W. Knofler M. Block L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12478-12483Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Yoshizumi M. Perrella M.A. Burnett J.C. Lee M.E. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). To determine whether HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can also prevent cytokine-mediated decrease in ecNOS expression, we treated endothelial cells with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of simvastatin (1 μm). Treatment with TNF-α caused a 48 ± 5% reduction in ecNOS protein levels after 24 h (p < 0.01,n = 3) (Fig. 5). Co-treatment with simvastatin completely reversed the TNF-α-mediated decrease in ecNOS protein. Treatment with simvastatin alone increased ecNOS protein levels by 30 ± 10% over basal levels (p < 0.05, n = 3). These effects of simvastatin were blocked by co-treatment with l-mevalonate (data not shown). The half-life of ecNOS mRNA was determined in the presence of actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). Hypoxia shortened the half-life of ecNOS mRNA from 28 ± 4 to 13 ± 3 h (Fig.6). Treatment with simvastatin (1 μm) increased ecNOS half-life to 38 ± 4 and 46 ± 4 h under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, respectively (p < 0.05 for both, n = 3). These results suggest that HMG CoA reductase inhibitors prevent the hypoxia-mediated decrease in ecNOS expression by stabilizing ecNOS mRNA. Nuclear run-on assays showed that hypoxia caused an 85 ± 8% decrease in ecNOS gene transcription (p< 0.01, n = 3) (Fig. 7). Treatment with simvastatin (1 μm) did not produce any significant effect on hypoxia-mediated decrease in ecNOS gene transcription (83 ± 6% decrease in ecNOS gene transcription,p > 0.05 compared with hypoxia alone). Furthermore, simvastatin alone produced a minimal increase in ecNOS gene transcription under normoxic conditions (20 ± 5% increase in ecNOS gene transcription, p < 0.05 compared with normoxia control). Preliminary studies using different amounts of radiolabeled RNA transcripts demonstrate that under our experimental conditions, hybridization was linear and nonsaturable. The density of each ecNOS band was standardized to the density of its corresponding β-tubulin band (relative intensity). To exclude the possibility that changes in β-tubulin gene transcription are caused by hypoxia or simvastatin, another gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, was included on each of the nuclear run-on blots. Similar relative indices were obtained when ecNOS gene transcription was standardized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene transcription (data not shown). The specificity of each band was determined by the lack of hybridization to the nonspecific pGEM cDNA vector. We have shown that HMG CoA reductase inhibitors increase ecNOS expression and prevent hypoxia-mediated down-regulation of ecNOS activity. The mechanism(s) responsible for the increase in ecNOS expression by HMG CoA reductase inhibitors involves post-transcriptional ecNOS mRNA stabilization. There was no effect of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors on ecNOS gene transcription. The findings that co-treatment with l-mevalonate reversed the effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors on ecNOS expression suggest that endothelial HMG CoA reductase is an important negative regulator of ecNOS expression. These results are consistent with our finding that simvastatin that has a lower IC50 value compared with that of lovastatin for HMG CoA reductase more potently blocks the hypoxia-mediated decrease in ecNOS expression (20Van Vliet A.K. Negre-Aminou P. van Thiel G.C. Bolhuis P.A. Cohen L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 1387-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Despite extensive studies with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, the biological mechanism(s) involved in their clinical benefits remains unclear. Although improvements in ecNOS activity have been attributed to the lowering of serum cholesterol levels, recent studies suggest that HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may have direct effects on the vascular wall that are independent of serum cholesterol levels (22Andrews T.C.

Latifi R. Dudrick S.J. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1530-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Indeed, one of the earliest recognizable benefits after treatment with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors is the normalization of endothelium-dependent relaxation in atherosclerotic coronary arteries before significant lowering of serum cholesterol levels (24O'Driscoll G. Green D. Taylor R.R. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1126-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). In our study, the effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors on ecNOS expression were not due to changes in extracellular cholesterol levels, since all of the endothelial cells were exposed to the same cholesterol concentration. Thus, the clinical applications of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may well extend beyond hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis but also to other pathological conditions where ecNOS activity is found to be diminished, such as in hypoxia-mediated pulmonary hypertension (2Giaid A. Saleh D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar, 8Adnot S. Raffestin B. Eddahibi S. Braquet P. Chabrier P.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors on ecNOS expression, however, were not specific to hypoxia, since simvastatin produced similar effects in other conditions that are known to destabilize ecNOS mRNA such as interleukin-1 (19Ziesche R. Petkov V. Williams J. Zakeri S.M. Mosgoller W. Knofler M. Block L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12478-12483Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), TNF-α (21Yoshizumi M. Perrella M.A. Burnett J.C. Lee M.E. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), and oxidized low density lipoprotein. 2U. Laufs, V. La Fata, and J. K. Liao, unpublished observation. Indeed, treatment with simvastatin alone increased ecNOS expression via prolongation of ecNOS mRNA half-life. However, stabilization of ecNOS mRNA by simvastatin was relatively specific, since simvastatin did not prolong the half-life of other constitutively expressed genes such as the G-protein αs subunit or β-actin. It is not known, however, how inhibition of endothelial HMG CoA reductase stabilizes ecNOS mRNA. One possibility is thatl-mevalonate or its downstream lipid derivative stimulate proteins that bind to a sequence motif (AUUUA) in the ecNOS mRNA 3′-untranslated region, which is known to mediate mRNA destabilization via protein-mRNA interaction (25Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that ecNOS mRNA stability is cell cycle-dependent. Indeed, synchronization of cell cycle arrest by lovastatin in fibroblasts has been shown to increase the expression of other genes such as p27 Kip1 by post-transcriptional mechanisms (26Hengst L. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Thus, it is interesting to speculate whether HMG CoA reductase inhibitors stabilize ecNOS mRNA indirectly by regulating the cell cycle of vascular endothelial cells. Inhibition of endothelial l-mevalonate synthesis by HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may have many important biological consequences in addition to their effects on cholesterol biosynthesis. For example, metabolism of l-mevalonate can yield a series of isoprenoid compounds, including farnesyl, geranylgeranyl, and dolichol derivatives (13Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4566) Google Scholar). These derivatives allow for the covalent attachments and trafficking of membrane proteins (27Massy Z.A. Keane W.F. Kasiske B.L. Lancet. 1996; 347: 102-103Abstract PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Isoprenylation is important for the vesicular targeting of membrane proteins, such as ecNOS (28Lui J. Garcia-Gardena G. Sessa W.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13277-13281Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Farnesylation is necessary for the anchoring of G-proteins such as p21 ras to the cellular membrane, and therefore, may affect receptor-mediated ecNOS activity (29Kohl N.E. Mosser S.D. deSolms S.J. Guiliani E.A. Pompliano D.L. Graham S.L. Smith R.L. Scolnick E.M. Oliff A. Gibbs J.B. Science. 1993; 260: 1934-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Decreased dolichol synthesis interferes with the synthesis of glycoproteins and may modulate ecNOS activity via effects on membrane fluidity and cell growth (30Chojnacki T. Dallner G. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus, the up-regulation of ecNOS expression via inhibition of endothelial HMG CoA reductase may be mediated by factors resulting from a reduction inl-mevalonate metabolism other than cholesterol biosynthesis. The effect of hypoxia on ecNOS expression, however, remains somewhat controversial. Studies of rats exposed to chronic hypoxia demonstrate normal or increased expression of ecNOS in the pulmonary arterial endothelium (31Le Cras T.D. Xue C. Regasamy A. Johns R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L164-L170PubMed Google Scholar). Another study showed that hypoxia increases ecNOS promoter activity (32Arnett U.A. McMillan A. Dinerman J.L. Ballerman B. Lowenstein C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15069-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Yet, considerable evidence including the findings in this study suggests that hypoxia reduces endothelial NO production at the level of ecNOS expression (8Adnot S. Raffestin B. Eddahibi S. Braquet P. Chabrier P.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 9Liao J.K. Zulueta J.J. Yu F.S. Peng H.B. Cote C.G. Hassoun P.M. J. Clin.

A. 1996; 93: 12478-12483Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have found a strong correlation between decreases in ecNOS expression and reduction in ecNOS activity under hypoxic conditions. Several possible explanations could account for these reported discrepancies. First, hypoxia may affect other cell types such as macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells in the pulmonary vasculature, which could indirectly influence ecNOS expression. Second, the duration of hypoxia and subsequent hemodynamic changes associated with hypoxic-mediated vasoconstriction may indirectly affect ecNOS expression in vivo. Third, the cellular sources of ecNOS during hypoxia may come from sources other than the pulmonary endothelium such as the bronchial epithelium, which may be up-regulated rather than down-regulated by hypoxia (33Takimoto M. Oda K. Sasaki Y. Okada T. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34Kobzik L. Bredt D.S. Lowenstein C.J. Drazen J. Gaston B. Sugarbaker D. Stamler J.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 9: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Finally, hypoxia-mediated increases in ecNOS promoter activity as reported by a recent study may not be physiologic, since the ecNOS promoter used may not contain all of thecis-acting regulatory element(s) (32Arnett U.A. McMillan A. Dinerman J.L. Ballerman B. Lowenstein C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15069-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). When the more definitive studies were performed using in vitrotranscription or nuclear run-on assay, our findings were in agreement with that of earlier studies showing that hypoxia represses rather than induces ecNOS gene transcription (9Liao J.K. Zulueta J.J. Yu F.S. Peng H.B. Cote C.G. Hassoun P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2661-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10McQuillan L.P. Leung G.K. Marsden P.A. Kostyk S.K. Kourembanas S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1921-H1927PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, by preventing the down-regulation of ecNOS expression and activity, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may prove to be useful agents in treating chronically hypoxic individuals with progressive pulmonary hypertension. The findings of this study, therefore, may have important clinical implications since hypoxia-mediated pulmonary hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals living in high altitudes (1Scherrer U. Vollenweider L. Delabays A. Savcic M. Eichenberger U. Kleger G.R. Fikrle A. Ballmer P.E. Nicod P. Bärtsch P.N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Further studies, however, are required to determine the mechanism by which l-mevalonate or its metabolites destabilizes ecNOS mRNA."

The two forms are active as juxtacrine and paracrine/autocrine growth factors, respectively. The enzymes that process the HB-EGF transmembrane form are unknown. Accordingly, an in vitro assay was established using a fusion protein in which alkaline phosphatase (AP) replaced the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of HB-EGF (HB-EGF JM-AP). The fusion protein was anchored to agarose beads coated with anti-AP antibodies. Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were tested for the ability to release soluble HB-EGF in the in vitrosystem. MMP-3 released soluble 12-kDa immunoreactive and mitogenic HB-EGF within 30 min. On the other hand neither MMP-2 nor MMP-9 had any cleavage activities. A non-cleavable mutant was prepared by replacing the juxtamembrane (JM) region of HB-EGF with the JM region of CD4. The mutant HB-EGF, which in its full-length form was as active a juxtacrine growth factor as was the wild type HB-EGF in vivo, was not cleaved by MMP-3 in the in vitro assay. The C-terminal portion of the cleaved HB-EGF JM-AP that remained attached to the anti-AP beads was N-terminally sequenced and the MMP-3 cleavage site was determined to be Glu151-Asn152, a site within the JM domain. MMP-3 treatment also released soluble HB-EGFin vivo from MC2 cells expressing transmembrane HB-EGF precursor, at a level of about 2-fold above control. It was concluded that MMP-3 cleaves HB-EGF at a specific site in the JM domain and that this enzyme might regulate the conversion of HB-EGF from being a juxtacrine to a paracrine/autocrine growth factor.

Conversion of insoluble precursor to soluble released factor by enzymatic cleavage may constitute an important post-translational modification that regulates growth factor activity and bioavailability. For example, the transmembrane precursor form of TGF-α is a juxtacrine growth factor that mediates signaling, proliferation, and adhesion of neighboring cells (2Wong S.T. Winchell L.F. McCune B.K.

On the other hand, soluble TGF-α can diffuse freely and is a potent paracrine and autocrine growth factor (4Derynck R. Roberts A.B. Winkler M.E. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1984; 38: 287-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar).There has been great interest in identifying the enzymes responsible for proteolytic cleavage of cytokine and growth factor precursors, one reason being that release of these factors often contributes to pathological processes. For example, interleukin-1β-converting enzyme has been identified as an intracellular cysteine protease that releases mature interleukin-1β, thereby contributing to inflammatory disease (5Thornberry N.A.

Release of soluble TGF-α, an oncogenic growth factor is mediated by a yet unidentified protease that cleaves at an Ala-Val site in the juxtamembrane (JM) region of the precursor (4Derynck R.

Apopain, the product of the pro-apoptotic gene, ced-3, is a cysteine protease related to interleukin-1β-converting enzyme and is required for programmed cell death in Caenorhabditis elegans (6Nicholson D.W.

Hydroxamic acid-based derivatives which are specific inhibitors of metalloproteinases have been used to identify precursor-cleaving proteases.

Activation of HER4/erbB4 by HB-EGF results in chemotaxis but not proliferation, unlike activation of HER1/erbB1 which leads to both activities. The significance of HB-EGF heparin binding was demonstrated in that the chemotactic activity of HB-EGF for smooth muscle cells is mediated by interactions with cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans acting as low affinity receptors (21Higashiyama S.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Transmembrane HB-EGF synthesis is induced during skeletal muscle cell differentiation, and its gene expression is activated in these cells by MyoD (37Chen X. Raab G. Deutsch U. Zhang J. Ezzell R.M. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18285-18294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Release of soluble HB-EGF has been found to occur both constitutively and in a regulated manner. Macrophages and T lymphocytes are among the cell types that release HB-EGF constitutively (19Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 20Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G.E. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 2890-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the case of adherent cells such as MDA-MB-231 (39Raab G. Higashiyama S. Hetelekidis S. Abraham J.A. Damm D. Ono M. Klagsbrun M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and Vero (34Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), the membrane-anchored precursor is the predominant form and processing is inducible, for example, by addition of phorbol esters. Phorbol ester treatment of these cells renders them diphtheria toxin-resistant, suggesting that the transmembrane precursor has been fully converted into the soluble form (39Raab G. Higashiyama S. Hetelekidis S. Abraham J.A. Damm D. Ono M. Klagsbrun M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).The cleavage sites for HB-EGF processing and the enzymes responsible are not known. The endopeptidase, furin, has been implicated in the rapid constitutive release of the HB-EGF N-terminal propeptide (40Nakagawa T. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The enzyme(s) that release soluble HB-EGF from the cell surface may be matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) since phorbol ester-induced HB-EGF secretion is inhibited by hydroxamic-acid based derivatives that are MMP inhibitors (41Lanzrein M. Garred O. Olsnes S. Sandvig K. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 2M. Suzuki and M. Klagsbrun, unpublished data.2M. Suzuki and M. Klagsbrun, unpublished data.Considering that the HB-EGF cleavage enzymes might be MMP-related, we devised an in vitro assay and tested several MMPs for their ability to cleave and release HB-EGF. In this report we demonstrate that MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) but not MMP-2 nor MMP-9, cleaves HB-EGF to release soluble immunoreactive and mitogenic HB-EGF. Furthermore, cleavage occurs specifically in the juxtamembrane region at a Glu151-Asn152 site. In addition, a non-cleavable HB-EGF mutant was generated to exclude artifacts of nonspecific cleavage in measuring juxtacrine activity and determining juxtamembrane cleavage sites.DISCUSSIONThe proteolytic processing of the HB-EGF transmembrane precursor to the mature soluble form is a key step in converting this juxtacrine growth factor into a paracrine/autocrine one. We have identified MMP-3 as one of the possible proteases responsible for this processing event based on the demonstration that MMP-3 releases soluble bioactive HB-EGF from an insoluble substrate in vitro consisting of mature HB-EGF, the HB-EGF JM domain, and AP at the C terminus replacing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (HB-EGF JM-AP). Half-maximal release at 5 μg/ml MMP-3 occurs within 30 min. As might be predicted, the proteolytic cleavage occurs within the extracellular JM domain. The evidence for this is that (i) immunoreactive 12-kDa HB-EGF, the expected size, was released and was mitogenic for cells expressing EGF receptor (HER1/erbB1). Proteolytic cleavage in the mature HB-EGF domain would lead to irreversible loss of growth factor activity. Release of the 12-kDa soluble HB-EGF occurred concomitantly with a 12-kDa reduction in the mass of the HB-EGF JM-AP fusion protein. (ii) No release of soluble HB-EGF occurred in vitro when the HB-EGF JM domain was replaced with the corresponding JM region of the CD4 protein. This mutant was shown to be a non-cleavable mutant in vivo since when the replacement was made in the full-length HB-EGF and the construct was transfected into several cell types, the cells were resistant to the proteolytic cleavage induced by phorbol ester. Furthermore, the full-length HB-EGF with the CD4-JM mutant had juxtacrine growth factor activity in co-culture comparable to wild type transmembrane HB-EGF, indicating that the CD4-JM replacement has no adverse effects on overall structure and function beyond the JM domain; and (iii) N-terminal sequencing of the fusion protein that remains anchored to the anti-AP-coated agarose beads indicated that the specific cleavage site is Glu151-Asn152 which is within the proposed JM domain of HB-EGF, 10 residues upstream of the TM domain. No other N termini were detected.Previous results, based on amino acid composition analysis of C-terminal tryptic peptides of mature HB-EGF released by phorbol ester treatment of Vero cells, suggested that the cleavage site might be at Pro149-Val150 (34Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, this analysis might have been incomplete. Alternatively, after cleavage at Glu151-Asn152 by an MMP-3-like enzyme, there may be additional enzymes available in vivo, for example, neutral endopeptidase (46Vanhoof G. Goossens F. De Meester I. Hendriks D. Scharpe S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) that further process mature HB-EGF by removal of C-terminal Val150 and Glu151. Cleavage by MMP-3 at Glu151-Asn152 of the HB-EGF Pro149-Val150-Glu151-Asn152sequence is consistent with the demonstration that MMP-3 is highly effective in cleaving a Pro-Val-Glu-norvaline (Nva) synthetic fluorogenic peptide substrate at the Glu-Nva site with ak cat /K m of 218,000 s−1m−1 (47Nagase H. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20952-20957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This substrate is among the most rapidly hydrolyzed fluorogenic MMP-3 substrates yet described. In addition, the HB-EGF cleavage substrate sequence of Leu148-Pro149-Val150-Glu151-Asn152-Arg153, with cleavage occurring at Glu-Asn, is compatible with stromelysin (MMP-3)-sensitive hexamer sequences that were generated based on bacteriophage peptide display analysis (48Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). One of these sequences, Ile-Pro-Phe-Glu-Gln-Arg (with Glu and Gln at the P1 and P′1 positions, respectively), resembles the HB-EGF cleavage site sequence, and has a relatively highk cat/K m for MMP-3. Overall, the synthetic hexamers that have relatively highk cat/K m values also have predominantly a Pro residue at position P3, an Arg residue at position P′2 and often a Glu residue at position P1, positions compatible with those in the HB-EGF cleavage substrate sequence.Although MMP-3 is very effective in releasing soluble HB-EGF from the anchored substrate, MMP-2 (72-kDa gelatinase A) and MMP-9 (92-kDa gelatinase B) have no effect at all, even at 5 μg/ml enzyme in a 5-h digestion period and even though it can be demonstrated that these 2 gelatinases are highly active in degrading gelatin using zymography.The HB-EGF JM Glu-Asn cleavage site differs from other known MMP cleavage sites. MMP-3 has been shown to cleave cross-linked fibrin at a Gly-Ala site (49Bini A. Itoh Y. Kudryk B.J. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13056-13063Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and insulin B chain at Ala-Leu and Tyr-Leu sites (50Wilhelm S.M. Shao Z.H. Housley T.J. Seperack P.K. Baumann A.P. Gunja-Smith Z. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21906-21913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), none of which are present in the HB-EGF JM region. In general, there are no significant homologies between the various MMP-3 cleavage sites that are found in proteoglycans, several types of collagen and protease inhibitors (47Nagase H. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20952-20957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Matrisian L.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Other metalloproteinase cleavage sites have also been identified of which none are present in the HB-EGF JM. For example, MMP-2, but not MMP-9, releases an active soluble ectodomain of FGFR 1 by hydrolysis at a Val-Met site which is within the FGFR1 JM domain, eight residues upstream of the TM domain (13Levi E. Fridman R. Miao H.Q. Ma Y.S. Yayon A. Vlodavsky L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7069-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). MMP-2 hydrolyzes the β-amyloid precursor at Lys-Leu, Leu-Met, and Met-Val sites (52Miyazaki K. Hasegawa M. Funahashi K. Umeda M. Nature. 1993; 362: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 53Roher A.E. Kasunic T.C. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Ball M.J. Fridman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1755-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Galectin-3, a cell surface lectin involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in tumor metastases is cleaved at an Ala-Tyr site by both MMP-2 and MMP-9 (54Ochieng J. Fridman R. Nangia-Makker P. Kleiner D.E. Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Raz A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14109-14114Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).MMP-3 also releases soluble HB-EGF in vivo, albeit to a limited extent. MMP-3 treatment of MC2 cells expressing an AP-HB-EGF fusion protein results in about a 2-fold increase in released soluble HB-EGF compared with non-treated controls. The efficiency of releasein vivo is limited, with only about 5% of cell surface AP-HB-EGF being cleaved compared with the situation in vitroin which complete release can be achieved. Possible explanations are that the cleavage site is close to the cell membrane and may not be as readily accessible as it is in the in vitro assay and/or that TIMP-like inhibitors of MMP-3 associated with the cells may be inhibiting enzymatic activity. Alternatively, MMP-3 might not be the only cleavage enzyme for HB-EGF in vivo. HB-EGF is processed constitutively by macrophages (19Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 20Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G.E. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol.

Abraham J.A. Damm D. Ono M. Klagsbrun M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Whether these cleavage processes are mediated by the same enzymes and whether MMP-3 is an enzyme that is involved in these processes remains to be determined. For example, besides secreted proteases such as MMP-3, other enzymes that are membrane-bound might be involved in the processing of HB-EGF as has been demonstrated for tumor necrosis factor-α (10Black R.A.

Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar).The significance of MMP-3-induced cleavage of the HB-EGF precursor might be that this post-translational modification would increase the bioavailability of a potent growth factor that has been shown to be involved in physiological and pathological processes (reviewed in Ref.55Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F179-F200PubMed Google Scholar). Increased levels of MMPs including MMP-3, enhance the extracellular matrix degradation and remodeling that accompanies cell migration, tumor invasion, and wound healing (51Matrisian L.M.

https://openalex.org/W1966398753,"Further investigation of the targeting of the intracellular membrane lectin endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment-53 (ERGIC-53) by site-directed mutagenesis revealed that its lumenal and transmembrane domains together confer ER retention. In addition we show that the cytoplasmic domain is required for exit from the ER indicating that ERGIC-53 carries an ER-exit determinant. Two phenylalanines at the C terminus are essential for ER-exit. Thus, ERGIC-53 contains determinants for ER retention as well as anterograde transport which, in conjunction with a dilysine ER retrieval signal, control the continuous recycling of ERGIC-53 in the early secretory pathway. In vitro binding studies revealed a specific phenylalanine-dependent interaction between an ERGIC-53 cytosolic tail peptide and the COPII coat component Sec23p. These results suggest that the ER-exit of ERGIC-53 is mediated by direct interaction of its cytosolic tail with the Sec23p.Sec24p complex of COPII and that protein sorting at the level of the ER occurs by a mechanism similar to receptor-mediated endocytosis or Golgi to ER retrograde transport."
https://openalex.org/W2026245568,"How well antibodies can protect against disease due to HIV-1 infection remains a pivotal but unresolved issue with important implications for vaccine design and the use of prophylactic antibody to prevent infection after accidental exposure to the virus and to interrupt transmission of virus from mother to child. Strong doubts about the possible utility of antibodies in vivo have been raised because of the relative resistance of primary viruses to antibody neutralization in vitro. Primary viruses are likely to be close to the viruses transmitted during natural infection in humans. Vaccine studies have been of little value in assessing antibody efficacy in vivo because none of the strategies described to date have elicited significant neutralizing antibody responses to primary viruses. Passive immunization studies are similarly hindered by the paucity of reagents able to neutralize primary viruses effectively and a single study has suggested some benefit. Here we describe experiments to explore the ability of passive antibody to protect against primary virus challenge in hu-PBL-SCID mice. In this model, severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice are populated with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and infected with HIV-1. We find that the potent neutralizing human monoclonal antibody IgG1b12 at high dose is able to completely protect even when given several hours after viral challenge. The results are encouraging for antibody-based postexposure prophylaxis and support the notion that antibody induction could contribute to an effective vaccine."

The critical mannosyl donor for these reactions is the nucleotide sugar, GDP-mannose, whose transport into the Golgi from the cytoplasm is required for mannosylation. This transport reaction has been well characterized, but the nucleotide sugar transporter has yet to be identified in yeast.VRG4 is an essential gene whose product is required for a number of Golgi-specific functions, including glycosylation and the organization of the endomembrane system. Here, data are presented that demonstrate that the primary role of Vrg4p is in the transport of GDP-mannose into the Golgi. The vrg4 mutation causes a general impairment in mannosylation, affecting N-linked andO-linked glycoprotein modifications as well as the mannosylation of sphingolipids. By using an in vitro assay,vrg4 mutants were shown to be specifically defective in the transport of GDP-mannose into Golgi vesicles. The Vrg4 protein localizes to the Golgi complex in a pattern that suggests a wide distribution throughout the Golgi. Vrg4p displays homology to other putative nucleotide sugar transporters, suggesting that theVRG4 gene encodes a Golgi GDP-mannose transporter. As Vrg4p is essential, these results suggest that a complete lack of mannosylation of glycoproteins in the Golgi leads to inviability. Alternatively, the essential function of Vrg4p in yeast involves its effect on sphingolipids, which would imply a critical role for mannosylinositol phosphorylceramides or mannosyl diphosphoinositol ceramides on growth and viability.

The Golgi complex is the site where the terminal glycosylation of both proteins and lipids occurs. Unlike mammalian cells, in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, glycoproteins and sphingolipids are exclusively modified by the addition of mannose residues in the Golgi. Glycoproteins can undergo two types of modifications in which oligosaccharides are linked to either asparagine residues (N-linked) or serine/threonine residues (O-linked) (for review see Refs. 1Herscovics A. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar and 2Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Both of these glycosylation pathways initiate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPC, inositol phosphorylceramides; MIPC, mannosylinositol phosphorylceramides; m(IP)2C, mannose(inositol phosphate)2 ceramide; HA, hemagglutinin; ORF, open reading frame; PYC, permeabilized yeast cells.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPC, inositol phosphorylceramides; MIPC, mannosylinositol phosphorylceramides; m(IP)2C, mannose(inositol phosphate)2 ceramide; HA, hemagglutinin; ORF, open reading frame; PYC, permeabilized yeast cells. and terminate in the Golgi. After transport of the protein to the Golgi, mostN-linked oligosaccharides are elongated by a series of different mannosyltransferases to form glycoproteins that contain outer chains of 50 or more mannose residues. The α1,6-linked outer chain is highly branched with α1,2- and α1,3-linked mannoses. As in higher eukaryotes, it appears that the various mannosyltransferases that catalyze these sequential reactions are compartmentalized from one another within the individual Golgi cisternae. In the case ofO-linked sugars, up to five mannoses are added after the addition of the first mannose in the ER (3Gentzsch M. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5752-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 4Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The phosphoinositol-containing sphingolipids in yeast also undergo mannosylation in the Golgi. In S. cerevisiae, there are three major classes of sphingolipids. These include the inositol phosphorylceramides (IPCs) and the mannosylinositol phosphorylceramides (MIPC and M(IP)2C) (for review, see Ref. 5Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar). MIPC and M(IP)2C contain a single mannose attached to the inositol (6Smith S.W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3395-3405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although little is known about the mannosyltransferase(s) that catalyzes this reaction.The mannosyl donor for all of these Golgi-localized reactions is the nucleotide sugar GDP-mannose, whose site of synthesis is the cytoplasm. Before it can be utilized by the different lumenal mannosyltransferases, GDP-mannose must be transported into the Golgi by a specific nucleotide sugar transporter (7Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6935-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Once the sugar is donated to lumenal mannosyltransferase acceptors, the nucleoside diphosphate GDP is converted to a monophosphate by a nucleoside diphosphatase (7Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6935-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As in the mammalian Golgi, the transport of the nucleotide sugar into the lumen is coupled to the outward exit of the monophosphate in yeast. The yeast GDPase-encoding gene, GDA1, has been isolated (8Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Hausler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As predicted, a deletion of GDA1 results in the underglycosylation of proteins and lipids, although the null allele has no effect on growth.Many nucleotide sugar transport activities have been reported, which differ from one another in their substrate specificity and subcelluar localization (9Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Since the cytoplasm is the sole site at which nucleotide sugars are synthesized, they must be transported into the various organelles in which glycosylation occurs. Mammalian cells require the transport of many different nucleotide sugars due to the diversity of carbohydrate processing in the Golgi. Carbohydrate chains may contain galactose, sialic acid, fucose, xylose,N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylgalactosamine. In contrast, in S. cerevisiae, glycosylation in the Golgi is largely restricted to mannosylation which in principle requires only a single transporter.The VRG4 gene is an essential gene that is required for a number of different Golgi-specific functions, includingN-linked glycosylation (10Ballou L.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3837-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The data in this report demonstrate that the transport of GDP-mannose into the Golgi is the principal function of the VRG4 gene product. A simple system to assay GDP-mannose transport is described, using permeabilized yeast cells. With this system, we demonstrate thatvrg4 mutants are specifically defective in lumenal GDP-mannose transport in vitro. The protein sorting and membrane defects in vrg4 mutants may be explained by an indirect effect on sphingolipid mannosylation that normally occurs in the Golgi.DISCUSSIONThe transport of GDP-mannose into the lumen of the Golgi is requisite for glycosylation of both proteins and lipids in S. cerevisiae. The work presented here shows that the VRG4gene is required for this transport event and suggests thatVRG4 encodes the nucleotide sugar transporter. Our major observations and conclusions are as follows. (i) vrg4mutants accumulate under-mannosylated proteins and sphingolipidsin vivo. (ii) Membranes from the vrg4 mutant are specifically impaired in the lumenal uptake of GDP-[3H]mannose in vitro. Although these mutant membranes are drastically reduced in the ability to transport GDP-mannose, the activity of another Golgi enzyme, GDPase, is unaffected. (iii) VRG4 encodes a protein that is part of a large family of related proteins, some of which are known to function in nucleotide sugar transport. (iv) As predicted, Vrg4p is a resident of the Golgi complex. Although we cannot formally rule out the possibility that VRG4 encodes a regulator of the GDP-mannose transporter, the data demonstrate a pivotal role for Vrg4p in nucleotide sugar transport.Several putative nucleotide sugar transporters exhibit a high degree of similarity to Vrg4p (12Poster J.B. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3837-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Ma D. Russell D.G. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3799-3805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These include the LeishmaniaLpg2p which also regulates Golgi GDP-mannose transport (29Ma D. Russell D.G. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3799-3805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and theK. lactis Mnn2p which regulates UDP-GlcNAc transport (30Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5963-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,31Abeijon C. Mandon E.C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8851-8854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Lpg2 is most similar to Vrg4, whereas Mnn2p is more related to another S. cerevisiae ORF, Yel004p (30Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5963-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The similarity between Mnn2p and Vrg4p is somewhat surprising based upon their different substrate specificities. In K. lactis, glycoproteins are terminally modified by the addition ofN-acetylglucosamine and require the lumenal transport of UDP-GlcNAc in the Golgi. Glycoproteins in S. cerevisiae do not undergo this modification in the Golgi. Instead, they are modified entirely by mannose (see Ref. 2Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Therefore, the homology between Mnn2p and Vrg4p must include domains that are not involved in substrate specificity.The vrg4 mutation specifically affected MIPC and M(IP)2C biosynthesis. Coupled with the demonstration thatVRG4 is a resident Golgi protein, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that mannosylation of IPC to form MIPC and M(IP)2C is catalyzed by a glycosyltransferase that resides in the Golgi and utilizes GDP-mannose (24Puoti A. Desponds C. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results support the conclusions of Conzelmann and co-workers (24Puoti A. Desponds C. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), showing that the biosynthesis of MIPC and M(IP)2C is dependent on vesicular transport from the ER to Golgi, suggesting that these molecules are made in the Golgi.VRG4 is an essential gene that is pleiotropically required for a number of different Golgi functions, including secretion and the maintenance of normal membrane morphology. These observations led to the proposal that Vrg4p plays an important role in establishing or maintaining the organization of the Golgi (12Poster J.B. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3837-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The effect on sphingolipid biosynthesis may explain the pleiotropy associated with the vrg4 phenotype. Sphingolipids are essential membrane components. Although their biological role in yeast is still unclear, there is evidence that sphingolipids modulate the activity of the plasma membrane ATPase (32Patton J.L. Lester R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and are involved in phospholipid biosynthesis (33Wu W.I. Lin Y.P. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13830-13837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and anchoring of cell-surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins (34Conzelmann A. Puoti A. Lester R.L. Desponds C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the enrichment of sphingolipids in organelles of the secretory pathway (35Hechtberger P. Zinser E. Saf R. Hummel K. Paltauf F. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) supports the notion that the processes of protein secretion and the intracellular trafficking of sphingolipids are linked processes.VRG4 may indirectly affect these processes by inhibiting the synthesis of MIPC and M(IP)2C in the Golgi. The lack of these mature forms may alter the structure and functional properties of membranes which in turn affects a range of biological functions, including secretion.What is the essential role of VRG4? Both N- andO-linked glycosylation are essential, but it appears that only modifications that occur in the ER are vital. For instance, mutations that block the transfer of the preassembled lipid-linked oligosaccharide onto the asparagine residues of proteins are lethal (Ref. 36te Heesen S. Janetsky B. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2071-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar and see Ref. 37Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar for review). Similarly, mutants that completely lack the enzymes which catalyze the addition of the firstO-linked mannose in the ER are not viable (3Gentzsch M. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5752-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, all of the available evidence suggests that the later modifications that occur in the Golgi are not essential. For example, no single mannosyltransferase that affects N- or O-linked sugar additions in the yeast Golgi is essential. In the case ofN-linked mannoses, a deletion of the OCH1 gene, which encodes the initiating mannosyltransferase for the elongation ofN-linked oligosaccharides, results in the accumulation of glycoproteins that completely lack an outer chain (38Nakanishi-Shindo Y. Nakayama K.I. Tanaka A. Toda Y. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26338-26345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this drastic effect on glycosylation, the och1Δ mutant is viable (39Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 7: 2511-2519Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Similarly, proteins that affect the elongation ofO-linked mannose residues in the Golgi appear to be dispensable for viability (40Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Bussereau F. Jacquet M. Bussey H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15527-15531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although these data suggest that mannosylation of proteins in the yeast Golgi does not appear to be essential, the strict requirement of VRG4 may indicate that an absolute loss of glycoprotein mannosylation in the Golgi, due to the complete loss of the substrate required for these modifications, leads to inviability. An alternative model is that the essential function of Vrg4p in yeast may simply involve its effect on sphingolipids. If this is so, MIPC and/or M(IP)2C, whose biosynthesis is blocked in the absence of Vrg4p are implicated as playing a critical role in growth and viability. The isolation of the transferase(s) that catalyzes the mannosylation of MIPC and M(IP)2C will allow this idea to be tested. The Golgi complex is the site where the terminal glycosylation of both proteins and lipids occurs. Unlike mammalian cells, in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, glycoproteins and sphingolipids are exclusively modified by the addition of mannose residues in the Golgi. Glycoproteins can undergo two types of modifications in which oligosaccharides are linked to either asparagine residues (N-linked) or serine/threonine residues (O-linked) (for review see Refs. 1Herscovics A. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar and 2Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Both of these glycosylation pathways initiate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPC, inositol phosphorylceramides; MIPC, mannosylinositol phosphorylceramides; m(IP)2C, mannose(inositol phosphate)2 ceramide; HA, hemagglutinin; ORF, open reading frame; PYC, permeabilized yeast cells.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPC, inositol phosphorylceramides; MIPC, mannosylinositol phosphorylceramides; m(IP)2C, mannose(inositol phosphate)2 ceramide; HA, hemagglutinin; ORF, open reading frame; PYC, permeabilized yeast cells. and terminate in the Golgi. After transport of the protein to the Golgi, mostN-linked oligosaccharides are elongated by a series of different mannosyltransferases to form glycoproteins that contain outer chains of 50 or more mannose residues. The α1,6-linked outer chain is highly branched with α1,2- and α1,3-linked mannoses. As in higher eukaryotes, it appears that the various mannosyltransferases that catalyze these sequential reactions are compartmentalized from one another within the individual Golgi cisternae. In the case ofO-linked sugars, up to five mannoses are added after the addition of the first mannose in the ER (3Gentzsch M. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5752-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 4Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The phosphoinositol-containing sphingolipids in yeast also undergo mannosylation in the Golgi. In S. cerevisiae, there are three major classes of sphingolipids. These include the inositol phosphorylceramides (IPCs) and the mannosylinositol phosphorylceramides (MIPC and M(IP)2C) (for review, see Ref. 5Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar). MIPC and M(IP)2C contain a single mannose attached to the inositol (6Smith S.W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3395-3405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although little is known about the mannosyltransferase(s) that catalyzes this reaction. The mannosyl donor for all of these Golgi-localized reactions is the nucleotide sugar GDP-mannose, whose site of synthesis is the cytoplasm. Before it can be utilized by the different lumenal mannosyltransferases, GDP-mannose must be transported into the Golgi by a specific nucleotide sugar transporter (7Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6935-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Once the sugar is donated to lumenal mannosyltransferase acceptors, the nucleoside diphosphate GDP is converted to a monophosphate by a nucleoside diphosphatase (7Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6935-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As in the mammalian Golgi, the transport of the nucleotide sugar into the lumen is coupled to the outward exit of the monophosphate in yeast. The yeast GDPase-encoding gene, GDA1, has been isolated (8Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Hausler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As predicted, a deletion of GDA1 results in the underglycosylation of proteins and lipids, although the null allele has no effect on growth. Many nucleotide sugar transport activities have been reported, which differ from one another in their substrate specificity and subcelluar localization (9Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Since the cytoplasm is the sole site at which nucleotide sugars are synthesized, they must be transported into the various organelles in which glycosylation occurs. Mammalian cells require the transport of many different nucleotide sugars due to the diversity of carbohydrate processing in the Golgi. Carbohydrate chains may contain galactose, sialic acid, fucose, xylose,N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylgalactosamine. In contrast, in S. cerevisiae, glycosylation in the Golgi is largely restricted to mannosylation which in principle requires only a single transporter. The VRG4 gene is an essential gene that is required for a number of different Golgi-specific functions, includingN-linked glycosylation (10Ballou L. Hitzeman R.A. Lewis M.S. Ballou C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3209-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Kanik-Enulat C. Montalvo E. Neff N. Genetics. 1995; 140: 933-943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Poster J.B. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3837-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), secretion, protein sorting, and the maintenance of a normal endomembrane system (12Poster J.B. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3837-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The data in this report demonstrate that the transport of GDP-mannose into the Golgi is the principal function of the VRG4 gene product. A simple system to assay GDP-mannose transport is described, using permeabilized yeast cells. With this system, we demonstrate thatvrg4 mutants are specifically defective in lumenal GDP-mannose transport in vitro. The protein sorting and membrane defects in vrg4 mutants may be explained by an indirect effect on sphingolipid mannosylation that normally occurs in the Golgi. DISCUSSIONThe transport of GDP-mannose into the lumen of the Golgi is requisite for glycosylation of both proteins and lipids in S. cerevisiae. The work presented here shows that the VRG4gene is required for this transport event and suggests thatVRG4 encodes the nucleotide sugar transporter. Our major observations and conclusions are as follows. (i) vrg4mutants accumulate under-mannosylated proteins and sphingolipidsin vivo. (ii) Membranes from the vrg4 mutant are specifically impaired in the lumenal uptake of GDP-[3H]mannose in vitro.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) supports the notion that the processes of protein secretion and the intracellular trafficking of sphingolipids are linked processes.VRG4 may indirectly affect these processes by inhibiting the synthesis of MIPC and M(IP)2C in the Golgi. The lack of these mature forms may alter the structure and functional properties of membranes which in turn affects a range of biological functions, including secretion. What is the essential role of VRG4? Both N- andO-linked glycosylation are essential, but it appears that only modifications that occur in the ER are vital. For instance, mutations that block the transfer of the preassembled lipid-linked oligosaccharide onto the asparagine residues of proteins are lethal (Ref. 36te Heesen S. Janetsky B. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2071-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar and see Ref. 37Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar for review). Similarly, mutants that completely lack the enzymes which catalyze the addition of the firstO-linked mannose in the ER are not viable (3Gentzsch M. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5752-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, all of the available evidence suggests that the later modifications that occur in the Golgi are not essential. For example, no single mannosyltransferase that affects N- or O-linked sugar additions in the yeast Golgi is essential. In the case ofN-linked mannoses, a deletion of the OCH1 gene, which encodes the initiating mannosyltransferase for the elongation ofN-linked oligosaccharides, results in the accumulation of glycoproteins that completely lack an outer chain (38Nakanishi-Shindo Y. Nakayama K.I. Tanaka A. Toda Y. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26338-26345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this drastic effect on glycosylation, the och1Δ mutant is viable (39Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 7: 2511-2519Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Similarly, proteins that affect the elongation ofO-linked mannose residues in the Golgi appear to be dispensable for viability (40Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Bussereau F. Jacquet M. Bussey H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15527-15531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although these data suggest that mannosylation of proteins in the yeast Golgi does not appear to be essential, the strict requirement of VRG4 may indicate that an absolute loss of glycoprotein mannosylation in the Golgi, due to the complete loss of the substrate required for these modifications, leads to inviability. An alternative model is that the essential function of Vrg4p in yeast may simply involve its effect on sphingolipids. If this is so, MIPC and/or M(IP)2C, whose biosynthesis is blocked in the absence of Vrg4p are implicated as playing a critical role in growth and viability. The isolation of the transferase(s) that catalyzes the mannosylation of MIPC and M(IP)2C will allow this idea to be tested.

https://openalex.org/W1972369810,"We have investigated mechanisms of omeprazole (OME)-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP3A, using the rat hepatoma H4IIE cell line, in comparison with mechanisms exerted by traditional aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands such as benso(a)pyrene (B(a)P) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). OME did not bind specifically to AhR, and it could not activate the AhR complex in rat cytosol to a xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE)-binding formin vitro. Genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and daidzein, an inhibitor of casein kinase II, efficiently inhibited OME-mediated but not B(a)P- or TCDD-mediated induction of CYP1A1, as monitored at the transcriptional, mRNA, and protein levels as well as by analysis of activation of XRE-luciferase reporter constructs transfected into H4IIE cells. The protease inhibitorN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) and lavendustin A also had similar OME-specific effects. In addition, insulin pretreatment caused an almost complete inhibition of OME-dependent CYP1A1 induction but only partially affected TCDD and B(a)P-mediated induction of CYP1A1. Staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, impaired the induction by both B(a)P and OME. OME caused an approximately 2-fold increase in the level of CYP3A expression, but all inhibitors used were ineffective in preventing this induction. Gel shift analysis with radiolabeled XRE and specific peptide antibodies toward AhR and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator protein (Arnt) revealed an OME-mediated translocation of the AhR·Arnt complex into the nuclei. Genistein inhibited the specific nuclear XRE binding caused by OME, but it potentiated the formation of the TCDD-induced XRE·AhR complex. Although daidzein was able to effectively inhibit the OME-stimulatedCYP1A1 gene transcription, it did not influence the OME-dependent AhR·XRE complex formation. The data are consistent with a mechanism for OME-mediated induction of CYP1A1 that involves activation of the AhR complex via intracellular signal transduction systems and that is distinct from induction mediated by AhR ligands. We have investigated mechanisms of omeprazole (OME)-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP3A, using the rat hepatoma H4IIE cell line, in comparison with mechanisms exerted by traditional aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands such as benso(a)pyrene (B(a)P) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD).

The data are consistent with a mechanism for OME-mediated induction of CYP1A1 that involves activation of the AhR complex via intracellular signal transduction systems and that is distinct from induction mediated by AhR ligands. CYP1A1 constitutes an extrahepatic form of cytochrome P450, which is responsible for the metabolism of, for example, several different polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The expression of CYP1A1 in liver and other tissues is highly inducible by a variety of compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (reviewed by Gonzalez (1Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1988; 40: 243-288PubMed Google Scholar)). The transcriptional activation of theCYP1A1 gene is mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), 1The abbreviations used are: AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; XRE, xenobiotic-responsive element; DRE, dioxin-responsive element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis; TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; OME, omeprazole; B(a)P, benzo(a)pyrene; Arnt, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator protein; Hsp, heat shock protein; TLCK,N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DTT, dithiothreitol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; hnRNA, heteronuclear RNA; RT, reverse transcriptase. which has been described as a ligand-dependent transcription factor and is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix superfamily of DNA-binding proteins. Unliganded AhR is part of a cytosolic protein complex containing heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) (2Denis M. Cuthill S. Wikström A.C. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.Å. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Binding of the ligand to the AhR results in release of Hsp90 and dimerization to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator protein (Arnt), followed by translocation into the nucleus (5Perdew G.H.

Once inside the nucleus, the AhR·Arnt heterodimer associates with specific cis-acting enhancers, designated xenobiotic- or dioxin-responsive elements (XREs or DREs), that promote the activation of the CYP1A1 gene (8Denison M.S. Fisher J.M. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16478-16482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological role of the AhR remains unknown, but it is likely to be important for the development of the liver and immune system, since AhR-deficient mice have been shown to have reduced liver size and decreased accumulation of lymphocytes in spleen and lymph nodes (9Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.T. Kimura S. Nebert D.W. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Science. 1996; 268: 722-726Crossref Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The substituted benzimidazole, omeprazole (OME), a potent suppressor of gastric acid secretion (10Lind T. Cederberg C. Ekenved G. Haglund U. Olbe L. Gut. 1983; 24: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), has achieved a prominent position in therapy for individuals suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease. OME, as well as other benzimidazoles, has been shown to induce CYP1A in human and rodents. Thus, OME increases the expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 in human hepatocytes (11Diaz D. Fabre I. Daujat M. Saint Aubert B. Bories P. Michel H. Maurel P. Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 737-747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and in the human alimentary tract (12McDonnell W.M.

The mechanism of induction of CYP1A by the benzimidazoles has been under debate. Originally, it was found that OME causes an increased expression of CYP1A mRNA in primary hepatocytes (11Diaz D. Fabre I. Daujat M. Saint Aubert B. Bories P. Michel H. Maurel P. Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 737-747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 18Daujat M. Peryt B. Lesca P. Fourtanier G. Domergue J. Maurel P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as well as in different human cell lines (19Quattrochi L.C. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 504-508PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kikuchi H. Hossain A. Sagami I. Ikawa S. Watanabe M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), indicating a transcriptional activation mediated via the AhR. Traditional ligands for AhR are planar hydrophobic aromatic compounds. Thus, OME and other benzimidazoles do not conform to the structural features of AhR ligands. Accordingly, Daujat et al. (18Daujat M. Peryt B. Lesca P. Fourtanier G. Domergue J. Maurel P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) did not register any specific binding of OME to the hepatic cytosolic AhR as revealed by competition experiments using [3H]TCDD as an AhR ligand. Similar results were obtained using thiabendazole (15Aix L. Reygrobellet X. Larrieu G. Lesca P. Galtier P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1483-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and lanzoprazole (17Curi-Pedrosa R. Daujat M. Pichard L. Ourlin J.C. Clair P. Gervot L. Lesca P. Domergue J. Joyeux H. Fourtanier G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 269: 384-392PubMed Google Scholar) as competitors. In contrast, Quattrochi and Tukey (19Quattrochi L.C. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 504-508PubMed Google Scholar) showed that OME triggered the translocation of proteins to the nuclei, which subsequently bound to the XRE in the regulatory region of the human CYP1A1gene. In the present investigation, we have evaluated the cellular events associated with induction of the CYP1A1 gene by benzimidazoles, using rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. The results indicate that OME activates the AhR complex by a novel intracellular mechanism distinct from those exerted by AhR ligands and which may have components in common with an endogenous activation mechanism for the AhR. Genistein was obtained from Research Biochemicals International. Daidzein and lavendustin A were obtained from Calbiochem.N α-p-Tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), B(a)P, and indole-3-carbinol were purchased from Sigma. Omeprazole was a gift from Astra Hässle AB (Mölndal, Sweden). 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was from Larondan Fine Chemicals (Malmö, Sweden), and [3H]TCDD (specific activity, 34.7 Ci/mmol) (Chemsyn) was purchased from Campro Scientific (Veenendaal, The Netherlands). All cell medium and supplements, including insulin, were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. H4IIE cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Anti-rat CYP1A1 serum was purchased from Gentest Corporation (St. Woburn, MA), and an anti-rat CYP3A1/3A2 serum was a kind gift from Dr. James Halpert (Tucson, AZ). An anti-AhR antibody was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Golden, CO). The specificity of this antibody was determined using an antiserum against the rat AhR prepared in rabbits by immunization of conjugates between ovalbumin and a peptide corresponding to amino acids 12–31 of the rat AhR as described and characterized previously (51Lindros K.O. Oinonen T. Ingelman-Sundberg M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 506-511PubMed Google Scholar). Antiserum against rat Arnt was prepared in rabbits by immunization of the conjugate between ovalbumin and a peptide corresponding to amino acids 39–58 of human Arnt (21Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Coupling was carried out via tyrosine linked to the C terminus of the peptide. Immunization and serum production was accomplished as outlined in Ref. 22$$Google Scholar. The antiserum reacted with a 95-kDa protein as evident from Western blotting analysis. The identity of the band recognized was verified by using a reference Arnt antiserum kindly provided by Dr. Oliver Hankinson (UCLA) and by control experiments in which the antibodies had been preadsorbed by incubation with 1 μm of the peptide used for immunization for 8 h at room temperature. When this serum was used in Western blot analysis, the reactivity of the 95-kDa band was abolished. The rat hepatoma H4IIE cells were grown in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, nonessential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C. When the cells had reached 90% confluence, the medium was exchanged, and cells were cultured for an additional 1 h before treatment with the compounds investigated, which were dissolved in Me2SO. The final concentration of solvent never exceeded 0.2%. Insulin was dissolved in aqueous solution. Control cells were treated with Me2SO. After treatment, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4) and scraped from the plate into PBS. Cells were pelleted by brief centrifugation (1,000 × g), the supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in phosphate buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). The cells were disrupted by sonication for 20 s and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The 10,000 × gsupernatant was collected, and protein concentration was determined according to Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) using a Mini-Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C, Amersham Corp.) for 17 h at 20 mA, and the membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TTBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). The filters were incubated with anti-rat CYP1A1 or CYP3A1/3A2 serum, and the primary antibodies were detected by using peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat immunoglobulin (Dako AS, Glostrup, Denmark) or peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Bio-Rad), respectively. The horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham). Rat livers were perfused in PBS through v. porta, cut into small pieces, and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer, in 3 volumes of EPGM buffer (1 mm EDTA, 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The resulting homogenate was centrifuged for 60 min at 105,000 × g. Excessive lipids were removed from the ensuing supernatant, and the cytosol was frozen in small aliquots at −70 °C. H4IIE cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping. The cells were suspended in cold TEG buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT) and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer with 20 up-and-down strokes, using a B-type pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min, and the resulting supernatant was immediately frozen and stored at −70 °C until use. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay, 20 μl of H4IIE cell cytosol was incubated in the presence of ligand at 28 °C for 3–4 h. An aliquot of the activated cytosol was used in the EMSA as described below. Rat liver cytosol (diluted to 5–8 mg/ml in EPGM buffer) corresponding to 1.5 mg of protein, was incubated with 10 nm of [3H]TCDD for 3 h at 28 °C in the absence or in the presence of competitor. The samples were treated with 5 μl of a charcoal-dextran solution (0.1 mg of dextran/mg of charcoal) in HEDG buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 8.7% glycerol) at a concentration of 40 mg/ml and centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 × g. An 250-μl aliquot was layered onto a 5-ml 5–30% sucrose gradient prepared in HEDG buffer and centrifuged for 18 h at 100,000 ×g, upon which 300-μl fractions were collected from the bottom. Total RNA was isolated according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar), and 15–20 μg of total RNA was used in Northern blot analysis using standard procedures (26Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 12.1.1-12.1.3Google Scholar). Probes for CYP1A1 and β-actin, corresponding to nucleotides 1062–1362 and 566–1043 in the cDNA, respectively, were obtained by RT-PCR amplification of RNA from H4IIE cells. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham). Analysis of the relative amount of CYP1A1 hnRNA (cf. Ref. 27Elferink C.J. Reiners Jr., J.J. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) in variously treated H4IIE cells was performed by competitive PCR according to the PCR MIMIC 228 kit (CLONTECH, Paolo Alto, CA). Total RNA was isolated as described for Northern blot analysis. The reverse transcriptase reaction was carried out with an intron 1-specific primer, RT-primer (5′-GGT CTA TAG AGT GAG ATC CAA GTC AG-3′), using the 1st StrandTM cDNA synthesis kit (CLONTECH) and conditions as recommended by the manufacturer. The forward primer was specific for exon 1 (5′-GGT CCT AGA GAA CAC TCT TCA GTT CAG TC-3′). Three μl of cDNA and 2 μl of MIMIC standard (four or five different dilutions) was amplified in a 25-μl reaction containing 1.7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 0.01% gelatin (w/v), 200 μm dNTP, 0.25 μm concentration of each primer, and 0.6 units of Taq polymerase. The PCR amplification was carried out in a Perkin-Elmer amplifier (model 2400) with an initial denaturing at 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 54 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The program ended with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR fragment corresponding to CYP1A1 hnRNA was 953 bp long, and the fragment containing the MIMIC standard was 561 bp. Half of the total PCR product was analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels. Negative polaroid photographs of the gels were analyzed with a laser densitometer (Personal Densitometer with ImageQuant version 3.2 software, Molecular Dynamics). Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described by Struhl (26Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 12.1.1-12.1.3Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were washed and harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by brief centrifugation. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was washed once in hypotonic buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT). The cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer and allowed to swell on ice for 10 min before homogenization in a glass Dounce homogenizer with 14 up-and-down strokes, using a B-type pestle. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 3,300 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 180–200 μl of low salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT). KCl (2.5 m) was added dropwise to a final concentration of 0.4 m, and the nuclei were incubated for 30 min with continuous gentle mixing. The extracted nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (nuclear extract) was aliquoted and immediately frozen at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (28Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). EMSA was carried out in a total volume of 20 μl with 8–10 μg of nuclear protein and a final concentration of 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 2.25 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.12 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 μg/μl poly[d(I-C) d(I-C)] (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The double-stranded probe (referred to as XRE) corresponding to the mouse DRE3 sequence (5′-GAGCTCGGAGTTGCGTGAGAAGAGCC-3′) was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia) using [γ-32P]ATP (∼3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham). For competition controls, a 10-fold molar excess of the double-stranded oligonucleotide was used. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, in Tris/glycine buffer (50 mm Tris, 380 mmglycine, 2 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. The protein components of the retarded [32P]XRE complex were identified by using specific antiserum against the AhR and Arnt proteins in the incubation reaction. A fragment containing two XRE elements (29Sogawa K. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Yamane M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8044-8048Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was amplified from rat genomic DNA using primers specific for the rat CYP1A1 5′-flanking region (forward primer, 5′-CCG AGC ATT GCA CGA AAC C-3′; reverse primer, 5′- CAT ACT GAA GCA GGC GAC AC-3′). The PCR product was digested with SmaI andBamHI and cloned into the pGL3-prom vector (Promega) containing the firefly luciferase gene as reporter. H4IIE cells were trypsinized and subcultivated at a ratio of 1:4 on six-well plates. Four days after seeding, the cells were transfected using DMRIE-C reagent (Life Technologies). Three μg of the plasmid; 0.2 μg of the control plasmid pRL-SV40 (Promega), containing the renilla luciferase gene as reporter; and 4 μg of DMRIE-C reagent were used for the transfections, which were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations in a total volume of 0.75 ml and in presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. Five hours later, the medium was changed to obtain normal culture conditions (see above). The next day, the medium was changed before treatment with inducers in the absence or presence of inhibitors. After 20 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 100 μl of 1 × Passive Lysis™ buffer (Promega). The luciferase activities were analyzed for 1 min in 10-μl cell extracts with the Dual Luciferase Assay™ kit (Promega) on a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Design). The induction in the system is documented as the ratio between the activity of luciferase ligated to the reporter plasmid and that of theRenilla luciferase constituting the control for the transfection efficiency. Incubation of the rat H4IIE hepatoma cells with OME, B(a)P, and indole-3-carbinol caused a time-dependent induction of CYP1A1. Significant induction after OME treatment was registered after 12 h, and the level of CYP1A1 after 24 h was extensive. Using indole-3-carbinol, maximal induction was achieved already in 6 h, after which the CYP1A1 level declined, probably because of rapid clearance of the carbinol from the medium (Fig. 1). The half-maximal dose, registered under our conditions, was 135 ± 20 μm (n = 4) for OME and 450 ± 60 μm (n = 4) for indole-3-carbinol. CYP1A1 induction following B(a)P treatment was evident after 3 h and increased up to 24 h. Thus, the OME-mediated induction was slower as compared with the effect by other inducers. OME did not exhibit any synergistic effect on the induction of CYP1A1 caused by TCDD (data not shown). The ability of OME to compete with the specific TCDD binding to the AhR was evaluated. Cytosol, corresponding to 1.5 mg of protein, was incubated with 10 nm [3H]TCDD in the presence or absence of competitor for 3 h at 28 °C before being subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation. OME at a concentration of 200 μmwas unable to significantly inhibit binding of TCDD (88 ± 5% of maximum TCDD binding, n = 4), whereas B(a)P at a 40 μm concentration completely abolished specific TCDD binding. Activation of the AhR by TCDD can be monitored in vitro by the ligand-dependent transformation of the cytosolic receptor complex to an XRE-binding form. The ability of OME to cause a similar activation of H4IIE cytosol was evaluated using EMSA. As shown in Fig. 2, OME at 250 and 500 μm (not shown) was incapable of causing such a transition, whereas B(a)P (40 μm) and TCDD (10 nm) caused a pronounced binding of cytosolic proteins to the 32P-labeled XRE probe. Because of the inability of OME to activate the cytosolic AhR to an XRE-binding form in vitro and its inability to compete for specific [3H]TCDD binding to the AhR, it was hypothesized that OME causes activation of the AhR by mechanisms separate from those of traditional AhR ligands. Such an activation could be mediated by an intracellular signal transduction chain that covalently modifies components of the AhR complex, e.g. by phosphorylation. The effect of several different protein kinase inhibitors on OME-, B(a)P-, or TCDD-mediated induction of CYP1A1 was evaluated using Western blotting (Fig. 3). As a control, the OME dependent induction of CYP3A was monitored (cf. Ref. 17Curi-Pedrosa R. Daujat M. Pichard L. Ourlin J.C. Clair P. Gervot L. Lesca P. Domergue J. Joyeux H. Fourtanier G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 269: 384-392PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein has been shown to inhibit the dioxin-dependent activation of the CYP1A1 gene in keratinocytes (30Gradin K. Whitelaw M.L. Toftgård R. Poellinger L. Berghard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23800-23807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the effect of genistein (100 μm) was the opposite in rat hepatoma H4IIE cells, and the compound potentiated the TCDD-mediated induction of CYP1A1 (Fig. 3,A and B). Genistein did not inhibit CYP1A1 induction mediated by B(a)P (40 μm) but almost completely abolished induction of CYP1A1 caused by OME (Fig. 3 B). Another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, lavendustin A, did not influence the B(a)P- or TCDD-mediated induction of CYP1A1, but it inhibited the OME response by about 40% (Fig. 3, A and B). Daidzein is an inactive analogue of genistein regarding its ability to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity. However, it has been shown to inhibit casein kinase II as well as insulin-mediated signaling in Swiss 3T3 cells (31Higashi K. Ogawara H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Daidzein almost completely inhibited OME-dependent induction of CYP1A1, but it neither influenced B(a)P- or TCDD-mediated CYP1A1 induction nor affected the OME-dependent increase in the expression of CYP3A in the cells (Fig. 3, A, B, and C). The extensive effect of daidzein on OME-mediated CYP1A1 induction suggested a cross-talk of an insulin-regulated signal transduction chain and the CYP1A1 induction mechanism. Insulin by itself did not influence the amount of CYP1A1 protein, but it almost totally abolished the OME-mediated induction of the enzyme, whereas it had no significant effect on CYP1A1 induced by B(a)P or TCDD (Fig. 3 B). It has previously been reported that long term treatment with phorbol esters, which down-regulate the level of protein kinase C, or protein kinase C inhibitors such as staurosporine inhibits the dioxin-dependent transcriptional activation of the mouseCyp1a1 and Cyp1a2 genes, as well as theCYP1A1 gene in human keratinocytes (30Gradin K.

It was proposed by Gradin et al. (30Gradin K. Whitelaw M.L. Toftgård R. Poellinger L. Berghard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23800-23807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that at least one of the components in the AhR complex, possibly the AhR itself, is phosphorylated by protein kinase C, causing transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 gene. In rat H4IIE cells, staurosporine (100 μm) inhibited both the OME- and B(a)P-dependent induction of CYP1A1 by approximately 50% (Fig. 3 B). However, staurosporine had no effect on OME-mediated CYP3A induction, indicating the absence of a general effect of the inhibitor on cytochrome P450 expression. To find other components that might be specifically involved in the OME-dependent induction of CYP1A1, s"

The decoy RII is released in a regulated way from the cell surface. Here, we reported that hydroxamic acid inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases inhibit different pathways of decoy RII release, including the following: (a) the slow (18 h) gene expression-dependent release from monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells exposed to dexamethasone; (b) rapid release (minutes) from myelomonocytic cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor, chemoattractants, or phorbol myristate acetate; (c) phorbol myristate acetate-induced release from decoy RII-transfected fibroblasts and B cells. Inhibition of release was associated with increased surface expression of decoy RII. Inhibitors of other protease classes did not substantially affect release. However, serine protease inhibitors increased the molecular mass of the decoy RII released from polymorphonuclear cells from 45 to 60 kDa. Thus, irrespective of the pathway responsible for release and of the cellular context, matrix metalloproteases, rather than differential splicing, play a key role in production of soluble decoy RII.

The spectrum of action of IL-1 encompasses cells of hematopoietic origin, from immature precursors to differentiated leukocytes, vessel wall elements, and cells of mesenchymal, nervous, and epithelial origin (1Dinarello C.A.

The production and action of IL-1 are regulated by multiple control pathways, some of which unique to this cytokine. This complexity and uniqueness is best represented by the term “IL-1 system” (3Colotta F. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. Mantovani A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 562-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The IL-1 system consists of two agonists, IL-1α and IL-1β, a specific activation system (IL-1-converting enzyme), a receptor antagonist produced in different isoforms (4Arend W.P. Adv.

Blood. 1996; 87: 3282-3288PubMed Google Scholar). Two main pathways of regulation of decoy RII release have been identified. Anti-inflammatory signals (e.g.glucocorticoid hormones) augment decoy RII gene expression and eventually release in myelomonocytic cells (18Re F. Muzio M. De Rossi M. Polentarutti N. Giri J.G.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 2534-2541PubMed Google Scholar). Over a period of 18 h, dexamethasone increases the number of monocyte surface RII from 171 to 3742 receptors/cell, and about 150 × 106molecules are released in the culture medium over the same period of time by 20 × 106 monocytes (19Colotta F. Saccani S. Giri J.G. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. Introna M. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2534-2541PubMed Google Scholar). A second pathway of regulation of the decoy RII involves the rapid (5 min) shedding from the cell surface. This rapid pathway of release is activated by chemoattractants, reactive oxygen intermediates, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and TNF (20Colotta F. Orlando S. Fadlon E.J. Sozzani S. Matteucci C.

The present study was designed to assess whether proteolytic enzymes are involved in the gene expression-dependent and -independent pathways of decoy RII. The identification of an mRNA transcript encoding a released version of decoy RII (23Liu C. Hart R.P. Liu X.-J. Clevenger W. Maki R.A. De Souza E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20965-20972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) raised the issue of the relative contribution of proteolytic shedding versus differential splicing in production of soluble decoy RII. The results presented here show that metalloprotease inhibitors block all pathways of soluble decoy RII production and, by implication, that proteolytic shedding is a dominant mechanism for generation of soluble decoy RII. Human PMNs were separated from the peripheral blood of human healthy donors by Percoll gradient centrifugation (24Colotta F. Peri G. Villa A. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 936-944PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, whole blood was fractionated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation (Seromed-Biochem KG, Berlin, Germany), and PMNs, collected from the pellet, were layered on top of 62% Percoll (Pharmacia & Upjohn, Uppsala, Sweden) after a centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 20 min at room temperature. PMN pellets (≥98% pure as assessed by morphology) were resuspended at 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium (Seromed-Biochem KG) with 2 mm glutamine (Seromed-Biochem KG). Human monocytes were separated from the peripheral blood of human healthy donors by Percoll gradient centrifugation (24Colotta F. Peri G. Villa A. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 936-944PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, whole blood was fractionated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation (Seromed-Biochem KG), and mononuclear cells, collected from the ring, were layered on top of 46% Percoll (Pharmacia & Upjohn) after a centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 30 min at room temperature. Monocytes (≥98% pure as assessed by morphology) were resuspended and incubated (5 × 106 cells/ml) for 40 h in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mm glutamine and 30% autologous serum on hydrophobic plates (Petriperm Hydrofob, Heraeus, Osterode, Germany). Human fibrosarcoma cells (line 8387) were transfected with pCEP4β episomal expression vector containing the IL-1RII full-length cDNA (25Re F. Sironi M. Muzio M. Matteucci C. Introna M. Orlando S.

The metalloprotease inhibitor BB-94 was from British Biotechnology (Oxford, United Kingdom); L,680833 (a specific elastase inhibitor) and CT1418 and Ro31,9790 (two metalloprotease inhibitors) were from Pharmacia and Upjohn (Nerviano, Italy); PMA and fMLP were from Sigma; α1-AT and E-64 were from Calbiochem; TNFα was from BASF Knoll (Ludwigshaven, Germany). Media and reagents contained less than 0.125 units/ml of endotoxin as checked by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay (BioWhittaker, Walkerville, MD). The assay was conducted as described (20Colotta F.

Briefly, 12 × 106 cells were incubated with or without the indicated stimuli in serum-free medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 20 min in polypropilene 50-ml conical tubes (Falcon-Beckton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ). Cells were then washed with binding buffer (RPMI 1640 medium, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4), and 4 × 106 cells were incubated with 800 pm125I-labeled IL-1β (specific activity, 180 μCi/μg; NEN Life Science Products, Bad Homburg, Germany) in the presence or absence of a 100-fold molar excess of cold cytokine in 50 μl of binding buffer at 4 °C for 4 h in polystyrene 96-well round-bottomed microplates (Falcon) on a shaking platform. Preliminary experiments showed that binding reached a plateau at 4 h under these conditions. To separate bound from free125I-labeled IL-1β, cells were resuspended, transferred to Eppendorf tubes, washed in binding buffer, resuspended in 70 μl of binding buffer, layered on the top of a 200-μl cushion of 20% sucrose (Merck), 1% bovine serum albumin in 400-μl polypropylene tubes (Beckman Instruments), and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 s at room temperature. The cellular pellets were counted in a γ-counter. 30 × 106 cells were incubated with protease inhibitors and stimuli in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C for 20 min. Medium was recovered and concentrated 10 times by membrane filtration (Amicon, Beverly, MA; cut-off, 10,000). 100 μl were added to 1 nm125I-labeled IL-1β, and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. After addition of 1 mm disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) (Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min, samples were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and dried gels were exposed to autoradiography for 1–3 days. Nonspecific binding was determined by adding a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled IL-1β, 10 μg/ml M1 (blocking mAb anti-IL-1 RI), or M22 (blocking mAb anti-IL-1 RII) (kindly provided by Dr. J. E. Sims (Immunex)) (data not shown). The supernatants from 5 × 106 83C7 cells were collected, concentrated, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and then blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Incubation with primary and secondary antibodies was carried out according to standard protocols. A mouse mAb against decoy RII (clone 8/5) 2G. Peri, unpublished data. was used as primary antibody. Immunoreactive protein bands were revealed by a chemiluminescence-based procedure (ECL Detection, Amersham International, Little Chalfont, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The chemotactic response of human circulating PMNs to fMLP was tested as described (27Sozzani S. Luini W. Molino M. Jilek P. Bottazzi B. Cerletti C. Matsushima K. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2215-2221PubMed Google Scholar, 28Falk W. Goodwin Jr., R.H. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 ± 1 μl of fMLP, diluted in 1% FCS-RPMI 1640 medium, were seeded in the lower compartment of the chemotaxis chamber, and 50 μl of cell suspension (1.5 × 106/ml) were seeded in the upper compartment. The two compartments were separated by a 5-μm pore size polyvinylpirrolidone-free polycarbonate filter (Nucleopore Corp., Pleasant, CA). Chambers were incubated at 37 °C in air with 5% CO2 for 90 min. At the end of the incubation, filters were removed, fixed, and stained with Diff-Quik (Harleco, Gibbstown, NJ), and five high power oil immersion fields were counted. Cells were exposed for 24 h to various stimuli or to medium alone. The supernatants were collected and tested for MCP-1 production by a recently developed sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a sensitivity limit of 30 pg/ml (29Peri G. Milanese C. Matteucci C. Ruco L. Zhou D. Sozzani S. Coletta I. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 174: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Statistical significance was assessed by the Tukey test. In a preliminary series of assays, we examined whether the protease inhibitors used in this study affected cellular functions unrelated to proteolytic activity. BB-94, the matrix metalloprotease inhibitor used most extensively in the present study, and α1-AT did not affect PMN chemotaxis, lipopolysaccharide-induced MCP-1 production in monocytes, or PMA-activated MCP-1 production in 83C7 cells (Fig.1). IL-1 decoy RII is expressed on PMNs as integral transmembrane protein, and it is released very rapidly in the supernatant after treatment of the cells with TNF, chemoattractants, and PMA. To ask what type(s) of enzyme is involved in the cleavage of this molecule, the effects of various protease inhibitors on the release of decoy RII was tested. As shown in Fig.2 A, TNF induced a rapid and drastic decrease of IL-1 binding to PMNs (17 ± 7% of binding compared with 100% of control binding). The metalloprotease inhibitor BB-94, an hydroxamic acid-based inhibitor of metalloproteases, strongly inhibited the TNF action (84 ± 4%). Two other specific metalloprotease inhibitors (CT1418 and Ro31,9790) blocked the action of TNF, although less strongly than BB-94 (67 ± 19% for CT1418 and 59 ± 2% for Ro31,9790). Inhibitors of other classes of proteases, such as serine proteases (α1-AT and L,680833) and cystein proteases (E-64), did not affect TNF-induced release of IL-1 decoy RII. The increase in the amount of IL-1 binding at the level of cell-associated receptor was reflected by a concomitant decrease of the soluble receptor in the supernatant as shown in Fig. 2 B. More precisely, TNF increased the level of a soluble IL-1 binding molecule of 45 kDa, as expected. BB-94 strongly inhibited TNF action; surprisingly, treatment of PMNs with α1-AT, a serine protease inhibitor, did not cause inhibition of TNF action but shifted the size of the released decoy RII from 45 to 60 kDa, the same molecular mass observed in monocytes and IL-1 decoy RII-transfected cells (19Colotta F.

L,680833, a specific elastase inhibitor, also caused the shift in the released decoy RII from 45 to 60 kDa (data not shown). Chemoattractant molecules, such as fMLP and PMA, induced rapid release of decoy RII in PMNs (20Colotta F. Orlando S. Fadlon E.J. Sozzani S. Matteucci C. Mantovani A. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 3861-3868PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the effect of BB-94 on release of IL-1 decoy RII induced by these two stimuli. As shown in Fig.3, fMLP and PMA induced rapid release of decoy RII as reflected by decrease in binding to cells (32 ± 7% and 48 ± 4% for fMLP and PMA, respectively). As expected, BB-94 inhibited the release induced by fMLP and PMA (81 ± 11% and 83 ± 2% of control values, respectively).Figure 3Effect of protease inhibitors on fMLP- and PMA-induced release of the IL-1 decoy RII in PMNs. 10 × 106 PMNs were incubated with TNF (50 ng/ml), fMLP (10−7m), or PMA (50 ng/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium with or without BB-94 (1 μg/ml) and then examined for IL-1 binding. Data are shown as percentage of control of specific binding of IL-1 (mean ± S.D. of three different donors).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Monocytes also express high quantities of surface decoy RII (19Colotta F. Saccani S. Giri J.G. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. Introna M. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2534-2541PubMed Google Scholar). TNF induces rapid (10 min) release of IL-1 decoy RII (22Orlando S Matteucci C. Fadlon E.J. Buurman W.A. Bardella M.T. Colotta F. Introna M. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3861-3868PubMed Google Scholar). When we tested the effects of different protease inhibitors (Fig.4 A), we found that only metalloprotease inhibitors, such as BB-94, CT1418, and Ro31,9790, inhibited the action of TNF. In particular, BB-94 restored the IL-1 binding capacity of TNF-treated cells to 93 ± 12% of control, compared with 26 ± 10% of cells treated with TNF alone; CT1418 and Ro31,9790 also caused a significant inhibition of TNF action (92 ± 8% for CT 1418 and 81 ± 9% for Ro 31,9790). Other protease inhibitors, such as L,680833 and E-64, had no effect on IL-1 decoy RII release. As shown in Fig. 4 B, TNF-stimulated monocytes released a 60-kDa soluble IL-1 decoy RII, and BB-94 inhibited the shedding of soluble receptor. In agreement with previous reports (18Re F. Muzio M. De Rossi M. Polentarutti N. Giri J.G. Mantovani A. Colotta F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 19Colotta F. Saccani S. Giri J.G. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. Introna M. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2534-2541PubMed Google Scholar), dexamethasone augmented the surface expression of the decoy RII (reflected by increased specific binding) in both monocytes and PMNs (Fig. 5, A andC). Concomitantly, dexamethasone augmented the release of soluble versions of decoy RII of 45 and 60 kDa for PMNs and monocytes, respectively (Fig. 5, B and D). BB-94 blocked release of the decoy RII from dexamethasone-treated myelomonocytic cells and concomitantly augmented binding on the cell surface. The results discussed so far were obtained with myelomonocytic cells. It was important to assess whether metalloproteases play a central role in decoy RII release in a different cellular context as well. We therefore examined the effect of metalloprotease inhibitors on decoy RII release from B cells (cell line 1H7, a subline of an Epstein-Barr virus-positive Burkitt lymphoma line Raji, selected for high expression of IL-1 decoy RII (26Stoppacciaro A. Bossù P. Ghiara P. Ruco L.P. Censini S. Scapigliati G. Nuti S. Tagliabue A. Baroni C.D. Boraschi D. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1561-1566PubMed Google Scholar)) and transfected fibroblasts (transfected cell line 8387). Both of these cell lines released large amounts of soluble decoy RII spontaneously and after stimulation with PMA. As shown in Figs.6 B, 6C, and 7B, BB-94 inhibited the spontaneous and PMA-induced release of the decoy RII in transfected fibroblast cells and 1H7 cells. Concomitantly, BB-94 blocked the PMA-induced reduction of IL-1 binding in these nonmyeloid cellular contexts (Figs. 6 A and 7 A). The capacity of BB-94 to block decoy RII release from transfected fibroblasts was observed by both cross-linking and Western analysis.Figure 7Effect of protease inhibitors on PMA-induced release of the IL-1 decoy RII on 1H7 cell line. A, effect on surface binding: 3 × 106 1H7 cells were incubated with α1-AT (100 μg/ml), BB-94 (1 μg/ml), or E-64 (10 μm), with or without PMA (50 ng/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and then examined for IL-1 binding. Data are shown as percentage of control of specific binding of IL-1 (mean with range of two different experiments). B, effect on release in the supernatant: 10 × 106 cell were cultured with or without PMA (50 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of BB-94 (1 μg/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. Supernatants were then recovered, concentrated, mixed with125I-labeled IL-1β, cross-linked with DSS, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results presented here show that one or more enzyme of the metalloprotease class play a key role in the production of soluble versions of the decoy RII. Different inhibitors of metalloproteases inhibited release of decoy RII, whereas agents which act on serine proteases or cysteine proteases had little or no effect. Metalloprotease inhibitors did not affect various functions of the cells used in the present study, including PMN chemotaxis, lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production in monocytes, and PMA-activated cytokine production in transfected fibroblasts. It is therefore unlikely that the capacity of different metalloprotease inhibitors to block decoy RII release is related to effects other than target enzyme inhibition. The decoy RII is present in biological fluids, with augmented levels in inflammatory conditions (16Giri J.G. Wells J. Dower S.K. McCall C.E. Guzman R.N. Slack J. Bird T.A. Shanebeck K. Grabstein K.H.

Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2534-2541PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies had identified two general pathways through which environmental signals activate release of the decoy RII in myelomonocytic cells. Several molecules with anti-inflammatory activity (glucocorticoids, IL-4, and IL-13) augmented gene expression and subsequently surface levels of decoy RII: an increased surface expression is associated with increased release (18Re F.

Sims J.E. Introna M. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2534-2541PubMed Google Scholar). A second pathway is gene expression- and protein synthesis-independent: decoy RII release is activated in about 5 min by chemoattractants, reactive oxygen intermediates, and TNF (20Colotta F. Orlando S. Fadlon E.J. Sozzani S. Matteucci C. Mantovani A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2181-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Sambo P. Fadlon E.J. Sironi M. Matteucci C. Introna M.

The soluble decoy RII present in biological fluids was classically described as a 45-kDa molecule (16Giri J.G. Wells J. Dower S.K. McCall C.E. Guzman R.N. Slack J. Bird T.A. Shanebeck K.

In vitro, we have described two forms of released decoy RII, a 45-kDa molecule released from PMNs (18Re F. Muzio M. De Rossi M. Polentarutti N. Giri J.G. Mantovani A. Colotta F. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 3861-3868PubMed Google Scholar) and a 60-kDa form released from monocytes and transfected fibroblasts (19Colotta F. Saccani S. Giri J.G. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. Introna M. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2534-2541PubMed Google Scholar, 25Re F. Sironi M. Muzio M. Matteucci C. Introna M. Orlando S. Penton-Rol G. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. Colotta F. Mantovani A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1841-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, given the central role of monocytes in inflammation, the 60-kDa version of decoy RII had not previously been described in biological fluids. The results reported here may provide a reasonable explanation for this apparent discrepancy. Serine protease inhibitors had little or no effect on decoy RII release. However, serine protease inhibitors modified the size of decoy RII released from PMNs. In the presence of the inhibitors, PMNs released a 60-kDa, rather than 45-kDa, form of the decoy RII. Thus one could speculate that all cell types release primarily a 60 kDa version of the decoy RII via metalloproteases, and then extracellular serine proteases produced by PMNs and possibly other cellular elements process it to the 45-kDa form found in vivo. The extracellular domains of different membrane proteins, including pro-TNFα, p75 and p55 TNF receptor, IL-6-receptor, Fas-ligand, L-selectin, pro-transforming growth factor α, and thyrotropin receptor are shed in the supernatant in different cell type, by one or more metalloproteases (30McGeehan G.M.

The observation that the juxtamembrane region of the decoy RII shows no primary sequence similarity to other released receptors does not necessarily imply the involvement of different enzyme systems.

Subsequent analysis of a tryptase-specific, phage display peptide library revealed that recombinant mMCP-7 preferentially cleaves an amino acid sequence that is nearly identical to that in the middle of the α-chain of rat fibrinogen.

Mammal. Genome. 1994; 5: 656-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) as one of the candidate loci for the inheritance of intrinsic airway hyper-responsiveness. mMCP-6 and mMCP-7 are stored in granules in their mature, enzymatically active forms ionically bound to the glycosaminoglycan side chains of serglycin proteoglycans (1Reynolds D.S. Stevens R.L. Lane W.S. Carr M.H. Austen K.F. Serafin W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3230-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although mMCP-6 and mMCP-7 both have an overall negative charge at neutral pH, the two exocytosed tryptases differ in their ability to dissociate from serglycin proteoglycans outside the mast cell (18Ghildyal N. Friend D.S. Stevens R.L. Austen K.F. Huang C. Penrose J.F. Šali A. Gurish M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, they are metabolized quite differently in mice undergoing passive systemic anaphylaxis. Tongue, skin, spleen, and heart mast cells of normal BALB/c mice and spleen and liver mast cells of V3 mastocytosis mice all contain substantial amounts of mMCP-6 and mMCP-7 in their secretory granules. Ten min after antigen is administered to IgE-sensitized mice, protease-proteoglycan macromolecular complexes appear in the extracellular matrix adjacent to the activated tissue mast cells. These complexes can be readily stained by anti-mMCP-6 Ig but not by anti-mMCP-7 Ig. In V3 mastocytosis mice sensitized with IgE and challenged with antigen, exocytosed mMCP-7 rapidly makes its way into blood, where it circulates for >1 h. This plasma form of mMCP-7 has an intact N terminus. Moreover, it is properly folded, enzymatically active, and not degraded. Despite the fact that as much as 10% of the proteins in blood are protease inhibitors (19Diem K. Lentner C. Scientific Tables. 7th Ed. Ciba-Geigy Limited, Ardsley, NY1970: 579-580Google Scholar), plasma-localized mMCP-7 does not rapidly form covalent complexes with any protease inhibitor in the blood of V3 mastocytosis mice. Modeling and site-directed mutagenesis of recombinant pro-mMCP-7 suggested that the natural form of the tryptase selectively dissociates from the macromolecular complex when exocytosed into a pH 7.0 environment because the glycosaminoglycan-binding domain on its surface consists predominately of a cluster of His residues rather than predominately Lys and Arg residues (20Matsumoto R. Šali A. Ghildyal N. Karplus M. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), as found in mMCP-6 (18Ghildyal N. Friend D.S.

McNeil H.P. Karplus M. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9023-9034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The prolonged retention of exocytosed mMCP-6 in the extracellular matrix around activated tissue mast cells suggests a local action, whereas the rapid dissipation of mMCP-7 from tissues and its poor ability to be inactivated by circulating protease inhibitors suggests that this tryptase cleaves proteins located at more distant sites. Although mast cell tryptases have been purified from different species in an attempt to deduce their protein substrates, the number of mature mast cells that can be isolated from a mouse is inadequate to obtain enough mMCP-7 for in-depth study. No mast cell has been found that expresses just mMCP-7. For example, the mMCP-7+ mast cells in the skin of the BALB/c mouse also express substantial amounts of similar sized mMCP-4, mMCP-5, mMCP-6, and carboxypeptidase A (22Stevens R.L. Friend D.S. McNeil H.P. Schiller V. Ghildyal N. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because all of these proteases are catalytic at neutral pH, the nearly impossible task of removing 100% of the other mMCPs from the starting preparations of mast cell lysates has prevented definitive studies that address the function of mMCP-7. A contributing problem is the fact that serine proteases like mMCP-7 tend to undergo inactivation during their isolation. We now show that fibrinogen is preferentially degraded when mMCP-7 is released into the circulation of V3 mastocytosis mice that are undergoing systemic anaphylaxis. We show that recombinant mMCP-7 is not readily inhibited by any protease inhibitor in plasma, that this tryptase degrades fibrinogen in a manner comparable to that seen in the V3 mastocytosis mouse, and that the enzymatic activity of this tryptase is not heparin-dependent. Based on these in vivo andin vitro findings, we conclude that fibrinogen is a physiologic substrate of mMCP-7. V3 mastocytosis mice were created and systemically sensitized intraperitoneally with ∼200 μg of anti-trinitrophenol IgE, as described (18Ghildyal N. Friend D.S. Stevens R.L. Austen K.F. Huang C. Penrose J.F. Šali A. Gurish M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23Gurish M.F. Pear W.S. Stevens R.L. Scott M.L. Sokol K. Ghildyal N. Webster M.J. Hu X. Austen K.F. Baltimore D. Friend D.S. Immunity. 1995; 3: 175-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Approximately 24 h later, ∼300 μl of Hank's balanced salt solution alone or containing 10–1000 μg of trinitrophenol-bovine serum albumin was injected intraperitoneally into each mouse. Twenty min after antigen administration, 100–500 μl of blood was obtained from the retroorbital plexus with a Pasteur pipette pretreated with an anticoagulant (either 25 USP units of heparin glycosaminoglycan (Elkins-Sinn, Cherry Hill, NC) or 10 mm EDTA). After a 4-min centrifugation step at ∼10,000 × g and at 4 °C, each 15-μl sample of plasma was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The four prominent ∼34–55-kDa peptides that preferentially appeared after the sensitization and antigen challenge were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and subjected to N-terminal amino acid analysis. Using a polymerase chain reaction approach, an oligonucleotide (5′-GACGACGATGACAAG-3′) encoding the EK-susceptible peptide Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys was inserted into the mMCP-7 cDNA (3McNeil H.P. Reynolds D.S. Schiller V. Ghildyal N. Gurley D.S. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11174-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) between the domain that encodes the pro-peptide and the N terminus of the mature tryptase. EK is a highly specific enzyme that cleaves the Lys-Ile bond in its Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-Ile recognition motif (24Light A. Janska H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 110-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because Ile is the essential N-terminal amino acid of mature mMCP-7 and because EK is a relatively stable enzyme at pH 5.0, it was anticipated that the secreted recombinant pseudozymogen could be activated under conditions where the generated tryptase would have very little enzymatic activity until the pH is raised to 7.0. The FLAG peptide (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys), which consists of the EK-cleavage sequence C-terminal of a 3-residue linker, has been used by many to epitope-tag the N or C terminus of recombinant proteins (25Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V.L. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Biotechnology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Crossref Scopus (754) Google Scholar). To facilitate the purification of the recombinant pseudozymogen with an anti-FLAG IgG antibody (26Prickett K.S. Amberg D.C. Hopp T.P. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 580-589PubMed Google Scholar, 27Brizzard B.L. Chubet R.G. Vizard D.L. Biotechniques. 1994; 16: 730-735PubMed Google Scholar), a second construct (pro-EK-mMCP-7-FLAG) was created that also contained the 8-residue FLAG peptide at its C terminus. These two cDNAs were inserted in the correct orientation into the multiple cloning site of pVL1393 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) downstream of the promoter of the polyhedrin gene, as described for the expression of recombinant pro-mMCP-7 (20Matsumoto R. Šali A. Ghildyal N. Karplus M. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In each instance, purified plasmid DNA (∼5 μg) was mixed with 0.5 μg of linearized BaculoGoldTM DNA (PharMingen) and calcium phosphate. The resulting DNA solution was added to 3 × 106 adherent Spodoptera frugiperda 9 insect cells (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) that were in their log phase of growth, and infected cells were cultured for 7 days at 27 °C in medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30 min) fetal calf serum (Sigma). Recombinant virus particles (≥3 × 107) were added to a culture dish containing 6 × 106 Trichoplusia ni High FiveTMinsect cells (Invitrogen) in their log phase of growth, and the infected cells were cultured in serum-free, Xpress medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). Four days later, the conditioned medium was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 15-min at room temperature. Under these conditions, recombinant pro-EK-mMCP-7 and pro-EK-mMCP-7-FLAG were recovered in the supernatants as soluble proteins. Recombinant pro-EK-mMCP-7 and pro-EK-mMCP-7-FLAG were purified by heparin-Sepharose chromatography, as described for pro-mMCP-7 (20Matsumoto R. Šali A. Ghildyal N. Karplus M. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Alternatively, recombinant pro-EK-mMCP-7-FLAG was purified with a 2-ml column containing the mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (International Biotechnol Inc., New Haven, CT). This anti-FLAG IgG affinity column was washed with 10 ml of 0.1m glycine, pH 3.5, followed by 50 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. After ∼200 ml of insect cell-conditioned medium was passed through the affinity column, the resin was washed with 50 ml of the same pH 7.4 buffer. Bound pro-EK-mMCP-7-FLAG was eluted by washing the column with 0.1m glycine, pH 3.5. The eluate was collected into tubes that contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, to minimize acid-mediated denaturation of the recombinant proteins. The final concentration of each recombinant protein was estimated by measuring the absorbence at 280 nm. Purified pro-EK-mMCP-7 and pro-EK-mMCP-7-FLAG (∼100 μg) was separately suspended in ∼100 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate and 5 mm calcium chloride, pH 5.2. One μl of a solution containing 310 units of calf intestinal EK (Biozyme Laboratories, San Diego, CA) was added to each, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for ∼3 h to allow EK to activate the zymogen. The spectrophotometric method of Svendsen and co-workers (28Svendsen L. Blombäck B. Blombäck M. Olsson P.I. Throm. Res. 1972; 1: 267-278Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (209) Google Scholar) was used to determine whether or not recombinant mMCP-7 and mMCP-7-FLAG were enzymatically active. A 1-μl sample of each activation mixture was placed in 1 ml of assay buffer (pH 7.4 buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml of a p-nitroanilide (pNA) substrate such as tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA (Sigma)). The change in optical density at 405 nm was determined after a 3–5-min incubation at room temperature. In this assay, 1 unit of enzymatic activity is defined as a change in optical density at 405 nm of 0.001 per min. As noted under “Results,” mMCP-7 exhibits an enzymatic activity of 175 to 50 units/μg when tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA is the test substrate. However, analysis of a phage display peptide library revealed that tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA is not the optimal substrate of mMCP-7. Thus, it is likely that the recombinant tryptase exhibits greater enzymatic activity against its physiologic substrate(s). One μg of bovine pancreatic trypsin (Sigma) is equivalent to ∼350 units when tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA is the test substrate. With the more widely used substrateN α-benzoyl-l-Arg-ethyl ester, the reference preparation of trypsin employed in our study for comparative purposes has 11 units/μg. The ability of recombinant mMCP-7 and mMCP-7-FLAG to cleave the trypsin-susceptible substrates tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA, benzoyl-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-pNA, benzoyl-Phe-Val-Arg-pNA, benzoyl-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA, acetyl-Ile-Glu-Ala-Arg-pNA, benzoyl-Val-Gly-Arg-pNA, andd-Ile-Phe-Lys-pNA (Sigma) were also evaluated. Insect cell-conditioned medium (∼20 μl) containing pro-mMCP-7, pro-EK-mMCP-7, pro-EK-mMCP-7-FLAG, or purified EK-activated mMCP-7 (∼1 μl) was diluted in SDS-PAGE buffer (1% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 500 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8) and boiled for 5 min before being loaded onto 12% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or placed in a Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA) immunoblotting apparatus, and the resolved proteins were transferred for 2–4 h at 200 mA to Immobilon-P membranes in a solution consisting of 20% methanol, 16 mm Tris-HCl, and 120 mm glycine, pH 8.3. For analysis of the resulting protein blots, each membrane was incubated for 1 h in 5% non-fat milk and then for 1 h with a 1:500 dilution of affinity-purified rabbit anti-mMCP-7 Ig (29Ghildyal N. Friend D.S. Freelund R. Austen K.F. McNeil H.P. Schiller V. Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2624-2630PubMed Google Scholar) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween 20 (TBST buffer). After 3 washes in TBST buffer, the blots were incubated for 1 h in a 1:1000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (∼1 ng/ml final concentration) in TBST buffer. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with nitro blue tetrazolium (0.2 mg/ml) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (0.1 mg/ml) as substrates. For N-terminal amino acid analysis, SDS-PAGE-resolved proteins were electroblotted onto membranes and briefly stained with 0.5% Ponceau S red (Sigma), and the relevant proteins/peptides were subjected to automated Edman degradation by the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Harvard Biological Laboratories, Cambridge, MA). Samples (50 μg or more) of purified mouse fibrinogen (Sigma) were suspended in 1 mmEDTA and 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.2–0.5 μg of recombinant mMCP-7-FLAG (10–25 units corresponding to 0.007–0.014 nmol of tryptase activated with 0.01 units of EK), ∼0.5 μg of recombinant pro-EK-mMCP-7-FLAG, or 0.01 units of EK and then incubated at 37 °C for various time periods. The resulting digests were subjected to SDS-PAGE. In one experiment, the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the major fibrinogen fragments in an exhaustive digest were determined after a 3-h treatment of 100 μg of fibrinogen with 120 units of mMCP-7-FLAG. The ability of mMCP-7-FLAG, bovine trypsin, and bovine α-chymotrypsin (Sigma) to digest mouse fibrinogen in the presence and absence of the protease inhibitors found in normal mouse plasma was also evaluated. In these latter experiments, mMCP-7-FLAG (10 units), trypsin (10 units), and chymotrypsin (0.03 μg; an amount equal to that of trypsin on a weight basis) were suspended separately in 4 μl of 1 mm EDTA and 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, lacking or containing 2.0–4.0% (v/v) mouse plasma for 30 min at room temperature. Thirty μl of reaction buffer containing 15 μg of fibrinogen was added and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The final fibrinogen:enzyme ratio in each of these experiments was at least 75:1. Comparable amounts of plasma was added to those samples that had not been exposed previously to plasma, and then the digests were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The resulting gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and the extent of digestion of each chain of fibrinogen by mMCP-7 in the presence and absence of plasma was evaluated by measuring the decrease in the optical density of SDS-PAGE separated, Coomassie Blue-stained α-, β-, and γ-chains by means of a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To demonstrate that the α-chain of mouse fibrinogen is much more susceptible to digestion by mMCP-7-FLAG than either the β- or γ-chains, kinetic experiments also were carried in which 70 units of mMCP-7-FLAG was incubated at 37 °C for 1 min to 17 h with 15 μg of mouse fibrinogen in the presence or absence of 2% normal mouse plasma prior to the SDS-PAGE analysis. A standard fibrinogenolysis assay (30Brown B. Hematology: Principles and Procedures. 5th Ed. Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia, PA1988: 219-222Google Scholar) was used to detect mMCP-7 anticoagulant activity in vitro. Sodium citrate-treated, normal mouse plasma (100 μl/assay) was incubated for 30 min to 1 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of ∼4 μg (∼200 units or 0.12 nmol) of EK-activated mMCP-7-FLAG or 10 USP units of heparin (∼100 μg of the glycosaminoglycan). The time required for thrombin to clot the samples was then determined with a fibrometer. The plasma concentration of fibrinogen is ∼3 mg/ml. Thus, even if 100% of the recombinant pseudozymogen was converted to active enzyme by EK treatment, there is ∼75-fold more fibrinogen than mMCP-7 in the assay. The genome of the Ff bacteriophage consists of the 11 genes designated gI to gXI. Although the protein (pIII) encoded by gIII is chymotrypsin-, thermolysin-, and subtilisin-susceptible, it is trypsin-resistant (31Grant R.A. Lin T.-C. Konigsberg W. Webster R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 539-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, phage display peptide libraries can give insight into the substrate specificities of certain proteases (32Mathews D.J. Wells J.A. Science. 1993; 260: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 33Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The N terminus of pIII extends out from the surface of the body of the filamentous phage. By taking advantage of the fact that pIII is trypsin-resistant and exhibits low valency, a phage display peptide library specific for tryptases was generated that encodes a pIII fusion protein containing at its N terminus the FLAG peptide followed by an 8-residue hypervariable peptide. The FLAG peptide was selected as the “tether” ligand so that those phage producing a bioengineered pIII could be readily isolated with the monoclonal anti-FLAG M1 antibody. To create the tryptase-specific library, two complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-CGGCCGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG(X)12A(A/G)G(X)9GC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGC(X)9C(T/C)T(X)12CTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGGCCGGCT-3′, where “X” indicates a random nucleotide) were synthesized such that they could be annealed to one another in vitro to form short double-stranded DNAs that each containedSfiI and NotI restriction sites at their 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Because it was found that recombinant mMCP-7 cleaves tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA, the library was created such that the fifth residue in the hypervariable domain would be either Arg or Lys. The single-stranded oligonucleotides were mixed in approximately equal concentrations, heated to 94 °C for 1 min, and cooled to room temperature. The resulting doublestranded oligonucleotides were ligated intoSfiI/NotI-digested phagemid vector pCANTAB-5E (International Biotechnology). Escherichia coli (strain TG1), transformed by electroporation with the resulting constructs, were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 2 × YT medium (0.09m NaCl containing 1.7% Bacto-tryptone (Difco Labs, Detroit, MI), and 1% Bacto-yeast extract (Difco Labs), pH 7.0) and 2% glucose. Ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and the M13 helper phage K (∼10 phage/bacteria) were added, and the bacteria were incubated at 37 °C for another 1 h to induce the formation of recombinant phage. After the mixture was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 20 min, the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of 2 × YT medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Infected bacteria were incubated overnight at 37 °C and then subjected to a 20-min centrifugation at 2,000 × g to obtain the phage-enriched supernatant. The resulting phage display peptide library was screened with bovine pancreatic trypsin to determine its suitability for substrate specificity studies. Because phage clones were obtained after two rounds of trypsin treatment that possessed different peptide sequences in the random portion of the pIII fusion protein, the library was screened with recombinant mMCP-7-FLAG. To purify the recombinant phage, 10 ml of the phage-enriched supernatant was added to 2 ml of 20% polyethylene glycol (8 kDa; Sigma) and 2.5 m NaCl and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. After a 30-min centrifugation of the mixture at 10,000 × g, the recombinant phage in the pellet were resuspended in 2 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and applied to a 1-ml affinity column containing the anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody. The column was washed three times with 10 ml of the same pH 7.0 buffer to remove unbound phage. Recombinant mMCP-7-FLAG or bovine pancreatic trypsin (∼50 μg in 200 μl of the pH 7.0 buffer) was added, and the column was sealed and incubated at room temperature for 90 min. After treatment with protease, the column was washed with 2 ml of the pH 7.0 buffer to recover those phage that possessed protease-susceptible pIII fusion proteins. Log phase E. coli were infected with the obtained phage to produce phagemid. Bacteria were again grown in 2 × YT medium containing 2% glucose and the phagemid in the bacteria were converted to phage with the addition of helper phage. The selection procedure was repeated one to three additional times to isolate those phage that possessed the most protease-susceptible pIII fusion proteins. E. coli were infected with phage that were susceptible to either trypsin or mMCP-7-FLAG to generate phagemids. The infected bacteria were seeded onto a plate containing 1.5% agar, 2% Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% glucose, 90 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Individual clones were isolated and grown overnight at 37 °C in 2 ml of 2 × YT medium containing 2% glucose with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Samples (50 μl) of the overnight cultures were centrifuged at ∼12,000 × g for 5 min. The bacteria in the pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of water, boiled for 10 min, and again centrifuged. Each polymerase chain reaction was carried out on 2-μl samples of the supernatant with sense (5′-CCCAGCCGGCCGACTACAAGGACG-3′) and antisense (5′-TGTTCCTTTCTATGCGGCCCAGC-3′) primers. Each of the 35 cycles of the polymerase chain reaction consisted of a 1-min denaturing step at 94 °C, a 1-min annealing step at 60 °C, and a 1-min extension step at 72 °C. The polymerase chain reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, and the nucleotide sequences that encode the 8-mer, protease-susceptible peptide domains in the pIII fusion proteins were determined. Relative to V3 mastocytosis mice sensitized with IgE but not challenged with antigen, the plasma from IgE/antigen-treated V3 mastocytosis mice contained large amounts of ∼34-, 40-, and 55-kDa peptides, and lesser amounts of an ∼42-kDa peptide (Fig.1). Changes were also seen in at least three proteins whose molecular masses ranged from ∼100 to 200 kDa. While we were not able to resolve the larger sized proteins well enough to determine their N termini, the ∼34-, 40-, and 42-kDa peptides possessed the same N-terminal amino acid sequence of Thr-Asp-Thr-Glu-Asp-Lys-"
https://openalex.org/W2050031571,"We have identified a previously uncharacterized gene that is implicated in the thermogenic function of brown adipose tissue of mice. This gene, termed Cig30, is the first mammalian member of a novel gene family comprising several nematode and yeast genes, such as SUR4 and FEN1, mutation of which is associated with highly pleiotropic phenotypes. It codes for a 30-kDa plasma membrane glycoprotein with five putative transmembrane domains. The Cig30 mRNA was readily detected only in brown fat and liver. When animals were exposed to a 3-day cold stress, the Cig30 expression was selectively elevated in brown fat more than 200-fold. Similar increases were brought about in two other conditions of brown fat recruitment, namely during perinatal development and after cafeteria diet. The magnitude ofCig30 mRNA induction in the cold could be mimicked by chronic norepinephrine treatment in vivo. However, in primary cultures of brown adipocytes, a synergistic action of norepinephrine and dexamethasone was required for full expression of the gene, indicating that both catecholamines and glucocorticoids are required for the induction of Cig30. We propose that the CIG30 protein is involved in a pathway connected with brown fat hyperplasia.

Brown adipose tissue is a mammalian organ specialized for heat production in the process called nonshivering thermogenesis. The proton potential generated by respiration across the inner mitochondrial membrane is dissipated in brown adipocytes through a unique protein channel, the uncoupling protein (UCP), 1The abbreviations used are: UCP, uncoupling protein; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; GPDH, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GLUT4, glucose transporter 4; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); PCR polymerase chain reaction.1The abbreviations used are: UCP, uncoupling protein; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; GPDH, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GLUT4, glucose transporter 4; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); PCR polymerase chain reaction. and the electrochemical energy is directly transformed into heat (1Nicholls D.G.

Thermogenic activity of brown fat is particularly important in small mammals, such as rodents, when challenged by low ambient temperatures, notably after birth (3Nedergaard J. Connolly E. Cannon B. Brown Adipose Tissue. Edward Arnold Ltd., London1986Google Scholar) or when arousing from hibernation (4Smith R.E. Hock R.J. Science. 1963; 140: 199-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Energy dissipation by brown fat is also believed to control energy balance in animals fed a cafeteria diet (5Rothwell N.J. Stock M.J. Nature. 1979; 281: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar).Activation of nonshivering thermogenesis is controlled centrally from the hypothalamus via sympathetic innervation, and, accordingly, the principal agent controlling heat production is norepinephrine (6Barnard T. Mory G. Néchad M. Biogenic Amines in Development. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1980Google Scholar). Among the acute effects of norepinephrine is an increase in intracellular cAMP concentration and lipolysis of triglycerides to free fatty acids, which are the main substrate for thermogenesis (7Nedergaard J. Lindberg O. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1982; 74: 187-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Catecholamines also enhance glucose transport in the brown adipocytes (8Marette A. Bukowiecki L.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Shimizu Y. Nikami H. Saito M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Liu X. Pérusse F. Bukowiecki L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R914-R920PubMed Google Scholar) and elicit significant changes in phospholipid composition (11Strunecka A. Olivierusova L. Kubista V. Drahota Z. Physiol.

Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 91: 141-146Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). At the gene expression level, adrenergic stimulation of brown fat rapidly increases the transcription of the Ucp gene (14Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Mory G. Thibault J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11583-11586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Jacobsson A. Stadler U. Glotzer M.A. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16250-16254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and elevates mRNA levels of several genes, such as those for LPL (16Carneheim C. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: E327-E333PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mitchell J.R. Jacobsson A. Kirchgessner T.G. Schotz M.C. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E500-E506PubMed Google Scholar), GPDH (18Ratner P.L. Fischer M. Burkart D. Cook J.R. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3576-3579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GLUT4 (19Shimizu Y. Nikami H. Tsukazaki K. Machado U.F. Yano H. Seino Y. Saito M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E890-E895PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, norepinephrine can also induce tissue hyperplasia in brown fat. Increased mitotic activity observed in brown adipose tissue in animals acutely exposed to cold (20Cameron I.L. Smith R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1964; 23: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) leads to a 3–4-fold increase in DNA content in the tissue about 1 week later (21Rehnmark S. Nedergaard J. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 180: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and this induction of proliferation can be mimicked by injection of norepinephrine (21Rehnmark S. Nedergaard J. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 180: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,22Géloen A. Collet A.J. Guay G. Bukowiecki L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C175-C182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Thus, brown adipose tissue is rather unique in responding to a simple, non-invasive environmental stimulus as low ambient temperature by undergoing the recruitment process, i.e. a program of concerted physiological changes leading to accelerated proliferation and differentiation. Also unique is the possibility of using white adipose tissue, which has similar biochemical equipment yet plays a nearly antagonistic role in energy storage and expenditure, as a suitable reference system in a search for genes involved in this recruitment process. Such an approach based on differential screening of cDNA libraries from white adipose tissue and from brown adipose tissue of warm- and cold-adapted animals was employed by Jacobssonet al. (15Jacobsson A. Stadler U. Glotzer M.A. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16250-16254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to isolate the Ucp gene. The authors simultaneously selected several other so-called CIN clones that exhibited a high degree of brown fat specificity and inducibility by cold.We have investigated here one of the CIN clones, the CIN-2. To this end, we cloned and characterized the corresponding full-length mRNA of CIN-2. It proved to be a novel mammalian gene, which we have termedCig30 (cold-inducibleglycoprotein of 30 kDa) and demonstrated that elevation of Cig30 expression is associated with recruitment of brown adipose tissue. We suggest that the CIG30 protein is involved in a membrane event related to cellular proliferation in brown adipose tissue.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have described cloning and characterization of a cDNA from mouse brown adipose tissue that corresponds to a novel mammalian gene, which we have termedCig30. The gene codes for a 30-kDa glycoprotein of yet unknown function. However, our data strongly suggest that this function is associated with recruitment and thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue.All nine proteins homologous to CIG30 that are currently present in the protein banks are fairly well conserved both in being hydrophobic and basic, in the amino acid sequence of the central core (Table I and Fig.1 C), and probably in the overall topology. Similarly to the CIG30 protein, an N-linked glycosylation site has been reported in the N-terminal part of the Fen1p protein (41El-Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and leucine zipper structures found in Sur4p and Fen1p proteins have been suggested to trigger dimerization in the plasma membrane (38Garcı́a-Arranz M. Maldonado A.M. Mazón M.J. Portillo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18076-18082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41El-Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The number of predicted transmembrane stretches reported for different proteins varies from four to six, which is probably the result of some ambiguity in the central part of the consensus. The core region is the most highly conserved amino acid sequence (Fig. 1 C) implicating this segment as being crucial for protein function. We have noticed that the conserved region displays amphiphilic properties (Fig.2 B), which might explain the uncertainty in estimating transmembrane topology. It is possible that this structure is associated with or inserted into the membrane producing an active site. In accordance with the structure published by El-Sherbeini and Clemas (41El-Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the yeast Gns1p protein (which is identical with Fen1p), we suggest that the common topology of this protein family is a five-membrane-spanning structure (Fig.8).Using the Northern blotting approach, we have found that the most prominent feature of Cig30 gene regulation is its high inducibility in brown adipose tissue by cold (Fig. 5 A). The time course of the cold-induced expression is delayed compared with genes directly involved in thermogenesis, such as Ucp andLpl (14Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Mory G. Thibault J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11583-11586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Jacobsson A. Stadler U. Glotzer M.A. Kozak L.P. J. Biol.

Jacobsson A. Kirchgessner T.G. Schotz M.C. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E500-E506PubMed Google Scholar), and is more reminiscent of induction of the genes for GPDH (18Ratner P.L. Fischer M. Burkart D. Cook J.R. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3576-3579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or GLUT4 (19Shimizu Y. Nikami H. Tsukazaki K. Machado U.F. Yano H. Seino Y. Saito M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E890-E895PubMed Google Scholar). As the Cig30 mRNA peaks after 3 days in the cold (Fig. 5 B), it is plausible that CIG30 is primarily related to hyperplastic changes in the tissue during cold acclimation, rather than being involved in immediate heat production. This would be in line with the slow proliferation onset observed in the stimulated brown adipose tissue (20Cameron I.L. Smith R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1964; 23: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Rehnmark S. Nedergaard J. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 180: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).In the present paper, we show that diet-induced thermogenesis is also associated with stimulation of Cig30 gene expression (Fig.5 D). There are two possible effects of a cafeteria diet on brown adipose tissue, either a central effect mediated via the hypothalamus or a direct effect of high blood glucose level on brown adipocytes. We were not able to distinguish these two pathways in our experiments. However, since refeeding after 24-h fasting did not lead to a detectable stimulation of Cig30 mRNA, we speculate that neither glucose nor insulin is sufficient to induceCig30 gene expression. Similarly, fasting could not prevent the early onset of Cig30 mRNA induction on cold exposure (Fig. 5 D). The Cig30 mRNA level in liver was not significantly influenced by any treatment in this experiment (not shown). It may be concluded that the diet-induced increase ofCig30 gene expression is most likely due to norepinephrine release caused by stimulation of the hypothalamus. This is also in agreement with our results demonstrating that chronically administered norepinephrine is sufficient for marked induction of Cig30expression in vivo (Fig. 6).Following chronic treatment with norepinephrine and dexamethasone, we were able to detect high Cig30 mRNA levels in brown adipocytes differentiated in vitro (Fig. 7 A). The requirement for a synergistic effect of these two agents for high expression in vitro was unexpected and did not fully conform with the in vivo results, which indicated that norepinephrine alone is a sufficient stimulus to greatly induceCig30 gene expression. This discrepancy could perhaps be explained by endogenous glucocorticoids, the peak plasma levels of which are only about 10-fold lower (10−7m) than those used in vitro (10−6m). Thus, we could hypothesize that glucocorticoids have only a permissive role in Cig30 gene expression and that the actual gene regulation is physiologically modulated by norepinephrine. Also, the requirement of both glucocorticoid and catecholamine stimuli for fullCig30 gene expression possibly means that the gene may be involved in an anabolic function, which is recruited during tissue hyperplasia.Although the nature of the Cig30 function is at present unknown, significant homology of CIG30 to several yeast proteins indicates that this function has been well conserved during evolution. The homologous yeast genes SUR4 (also calledAPA1) and FEN1 (also called GNS1) have been implicated in a bewildering array of biochemical functions, including phospholipid metabolism (37Desfarges L. Durrens P. Juguelin H. Cassagne C. Bonneau M. Aigle M. Yeast. 1993; 9: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), sterol synthesis (47Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.H. Lanau C.

Revardel E. Bonneau M. Aigle M. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), activation of several glucose-regulated genes (38Garcı́a-Arranz M. Maldonado A.M. Mazón M.J. Portillo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18076-18082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glucose uptake (38Garcı́a-Arranz M. Maldonado A.M. Mazón M.J. Portillo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18076-18082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and glucan synthesis (41El-Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which makes prediction of their primary functions very precarious. Yet, the data available seem to implicate this gene family in remodeling of the plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton in response to growth signals, perhaps by modulating interaction between membrane phospholipids and cytoskeleton.In our hands, however, overexpression of Cig30 in HIB-1B cells did not elicit any significant changes in phospholipid synthesis (Fig. 4) nor did we see any marked abnormalities in cell size, shape, or growth. Since Cig30 mRNA is not normally detectable in HIB-1B cells, it is possible that ectopic expression ofCig30 is redundant to an already existing mechanism, orCig30 needs other factors to provoke any measurable difference in our assay. Nevertheless, in the cold-exposed brown adipose tissue, there is a remarkable increase in turnover of specific phospholipids, particularly that of phosphatidylinositol (11Strunecka A. Olivierusova L. Kubista V. Drahota Z. Physiol. Bohemoslov. 1981; 30: 307-313PubMed Google Scholar), and this increase is attributable to the chronic stimulation of α1-adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine (13Senault C. Meister R. Portet R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 91: 141-146Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 31Mohell N. Wallace M. Fain J.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 64-69PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, it seems of importance to investigate whether the increase in Cig30 expression during tissue hypertrophy could be involved in the elevated phospholipid turnover. Brown adipose tissue is a mammalian organ specialized for heat production in the process called nonshivering thermogenesis. The proton potential generated by respiration across the inner mitochondrial membrane is dissipated in brown adipocytes through a unique protein channel, the uncoupling protein (UCP), 1The abbreviations used are: UCP, uncoupling protein; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; GPDH, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GLUT4, glucose transporter 4; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); PCR polymerase chain reaction.1The abbreviations used are: UCP, uncoupling protein; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; GPDH, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GLUT4, glucose transporter 4; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); PCR polymerase chain reaction. and the electrochemical energy is directly transformed into heat (1Nicholls D.G.

Yet, the data available seem to implicate this gene family in remodeling of the plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton in response to growth signals, perhaps by modulating interaction between membrane phospholipids and cytoskeleton.In our hands, however, overexpression of Cig30 in HIB-1B cells did not elicit any significant changes in phospholipid synthesis (Fig. 4) nor did we see any marked abnormalities in cell size, shape, or growth. Since Cig30 mRNA is not normally detectable in HIB-1B cells, it is possible that ectopic expression ofCig30 is redundant to an already existing mechanism, orCig30 needs other factors to provoke any measurable difference in our assay. Nevertheless, in the cold-exposed brown adipose tissue, there is a remarkable increase in turnover of specific phospholipids, particularly that of phosphatidylinositol (11Strunecka A. Olivierusova L. Kubista V. Drahota Z. Physiol. Bohemoslov. 1981; 30: 307-313PubMed Google Scholar), and this increase is attributable to the chronic stimulation of α1-adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine (13Senault C. Meister R. Portet R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 91: 141-146Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 31Mohell N. Wallace M. Fain J.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 64-69PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, it seems of importance to investigate whether the increase in Cig30 expression during tissue hypertrophy could be involved in the elevated phospholipid turnover. In this report, we have described cloning and characterization of a cDNA from mouse brown adipose tissue that corresponds to a novel mammalian gene, which we have termedCig30. The gene codes for a 30-kDa glycoprotein of yet unknown function. However, our data strongly suggest that this function is associated with recruitment and thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. All nine proteins homologous to CIG30 that are currently present in the protein banks are fairly well conserved both in being hydrophobic and basic, in the amino acid sequence of the central core (Table I and Fig.1 C), and probably in the overall topology. Similarly to the CIG30 protein, an N-linked glycosylation site has been reported in the N-terminal part of the Fen1p protein (41El-Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and leucine zipper structures found in Sur4p and Fen1p proteins have been suggested to trigger dimerization in the plasma membrane (38Garcı́a-Arranz M. Maldonado A.M. Mazón M.J. Portillo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18076-18082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41El-Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The number of predicted transmembrane stretches reported for different proteins varies from four to six, which is probably the result of some ambiguity in the central part of the consensus. The core region is the most highly conserved amino acid sequence (Fig. 1 C) implicating this segment as being crucial for protein function. We have noticed that the conserved region displays amphiphilic properties (Fig.2 B), which might explain the uncertainty in estimating transmembrane topology. It is possible that this structure is associated with or inserted into the membrane producing an active site. In accordance with the structure published by El-Sherbeini and Clemas (41El-Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the yeast Gns1p protein (which is identical with Fen1p), we suggest that the common topology of this protein family is a five-membrane-spanning structure (Fig.8). Using the Northern blotting approach, we have found that the most prominent feature of Cig30 gene regulation is its high inducibility in brown adipose tissue by cold (Fig. 5 A). The time course of the cold-induced expression is delayed compared with genes directly involved in thermogenesis, such as Ucp andLpl (14Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Mory G. Thibault J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11583-11586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Jacobsson A. Stadler U. Glotzer M.A. Kozak L.P. J. Biol.

Jacobsson A. Kirchgessner T.G. Schotz M.C. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E500-E506PubMed Google Scholar), and is more reminiscent of induction of the genes for GPDH (18Ratner P.L. Fischer M. Burkart D. Cook J.R. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3576-3579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or GLUT4 (19Shimizu Y. Nikami H. Tsukazaki K. Machado U.F. Yano H. Seino Y. Saito M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E890-E895PubMed Google Scholar). As the Cig30 mRNA peaks after 3 days in the cold (Fig. 5 B), it is plausible that CIG30 is primarily related to hyperplastic changes in the tissue during cold acclimation, rather than being involved in immediate heat production. This would be in line with the slow proliferation onset observed in the stimulated brown adipose tissue (20Cameron I.L. Smith R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1964; 23: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Rehnmark S. Nedergaard J. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 180: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we show that diet-induced thermogenesis is also associated with stimulation of Cig30 gene expression (Fig.5 D). There are two possible effects of a cafeteria diet on brown adipose tissue, either a central effect mediated via the hypothalamus or a direct effect of high blood glucose level on brown adipocytes. We were not able to distinguish these two pathways in our experiments. However, since refeeding after 24-h fasting did not lead to a detectable stimulation of Cig30 mRNA, we speculate that neither glucose nor insulin is sufficient to induceCig30 gene expression. Similarly, fasting could not prevent the early onset of Cig30 mRNA induction on cold exposure (Fig. 5 D). The Cig30 mRNA level in liver was not significantly influenced by any treatment in this experiment (not shown). It may be concluded that the diet-induced increase ofCig30 gene expression is most likely due to norepinephrine release caused by stimulation of the hypothalamus. This is also in agreement with our results demonstrating that chronically administered norepinephrine is sufficient for marked induction of Cig30expression in vivo (Fig. 6). Following chronic treatment with norepinephrine and dexamethasone, we were able to detect high Cig30 mRNA levels in brown adipocytes differentiated in vitro (Fig. 7 A). The requirement for a synergistic effect of these two agents for high expression in vitro was unexpected and did not fully conform with the in vivo results, which indicated that norepinephrine alone is a sufficient stimulus to greatly induceCig30 gene expression. This discrepancy could perhaps be explained by endogenous glucocorticoids, the peak plasma levels of which are only about 10-fold lower (10−7m) than those used in vitro (10−6m). Thus, we could hypothesize that glucocorticoids have only a permissive role in Cig30 gene expression and that the actual gene regulation is physiologically modulated by norepinephrine. Also, the requirement of both glucocorticoid and catecholamine stimuli for fullCig30 gene expression possibly means that the gene may be involved in an anabolic function, which is recruited during tissue hyperplasia. Although the nature of the Cig30 function is at present unknown, significant homology of CIG30 to several yeast proteins indicates that this function has been well conserved during evolution. The homologous yeast genes SUR4 (also calledAPA1) and FEN1 (also called GNS1) have been implicated in a bewildering array of biochemical functions, including phospholipid metabolism (37Desfarges L. Durrens P. Juguelin H. Cassagne C. Bonneau M. Aigle M. Yeast. 1993; 9: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), sterol synthesis (47Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.H. Lanau C.

https://openalex.org/W2030030744,"Isoforms of the glycoprotein CD44 are cell surface receptors for the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronate. They have been implicated in many biological processes, but their function in these is poorly understood and cannot be explained solely by hyaluronate binding. In the present work we examine the ligand binding properties of alternatively spliced CD44 variant isoforms which are functionally involved in the immune system, embryonic development, and tumor behavior. We show that these isoforms bind directly to the purified glycosaminoglycans chondroitin sulfate, heparin, and heparin sulfate, in addition to being able to bind to hyaluronate. Binding to this extended repertoire of glycosaminoglycans by CD44 depends on the inclusion of peptide sequences encoded by the alternatively spliced exons v6 and v7, and occurs both when the CD44 is solubilized from the plasma membrane and when it is expressed on intact cells. A single point mutation in the most N-terminal hyaluronate binding motif of CD44 ablates both hyaluronate and chondroitin sulfate binding, suggesting that glycosaminoglycans are bound through a common motif, and that only one of the hyaluronate binding motifs is responsible for the majority of glycosaminoglycan binding by CD44 on the cell surface. Taken together, these observations indicate that alternative splicing regulates the ligand binding specificity of CD44 and suggest that structural changes in the CD44 protein have a profound effect on the range of ligands to which this molecule can bind with potentially wide-ranging functional consequences."

It stimulates T cells through a high affinity cell surface receptor (IL-2R) composed of three transmembrane polypeptide chains designated IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ, and IL-2Rγ or γc (3Asao H. Takeshita T.

Resting T cells constitutively express the γ chain (6Nakarai T. Robertson M.J. Streuli M. Wu Z. Ciardelli T.L. Smith K.A. Ritz J. J. Exp.

Science. 1989; 244: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), 2S. Barangé and M. Nabholz, unpublished data.. IL-2Rα is not a member of this family and does not participate in the formation of other known receptors. IL-2Rα expression is undetectable on resting lymphocytes but is induced by signals from the antigen receptor (for review see Waldmann et al. (10Waldmann T.A. White J.D. Goldman C.K. Top L. Grant A. Bamford R. Roessler E. Horak I.D. Zaknoen S. Kasten-Sportes C. England R. Horak E. Mishra B. Dipse M. Hale P. Fleisher T. Junghans E. Jaffe E. Nelson D.L. Blood. 1993; 82: 1701-1712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The capacity of mature T cells to proliferate in response to IL-2 correlates with IL-2Rα expression (11Lowenthal J.W. Tougne C. MacDonald H.R. Smith K.A. Nabholz M. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 931-939PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse T cells that constitutively express the human IL-2Rα chain can respond to IL-2 in the absence of antigen stimulation (12Nishi M. Ishida Y. Honjo T. Nature. 1988; 331: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, IL-2Rα expression controls, at least in part, IL-2 responsiveness. IL-2Rα cell surface expression is regulated mainly through changes in IL-2Rα gene transcription (13Krönke M. Leonard W.J. Depper J.M. Greene W.C. J. Exp.

Kanamori H. Honjo T. Nabholz M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3340-3347PubMed Google Scholar). In mature T cells, antigen induces a transient wave of IL-2Rα transcription. Prolonged, maximal expression of IL-2Rα depends on stimulation by IL-2, which thus acts as a positive feedback regulator of its own high affinity receptor (17Pimentel-Muinos F.X.

The IL-2rE maps to the same position as a DNase I hypersensitive site that appears in the chromatin of normal mouse T cells upon stimulation with concanavalin A and IL-2 (18Soldaini E. Pla M.

Site II also overlaps with a consensus binding site for GATA factors. Site III includes a consensus site for Ets proteins and contributes to IL-2rE activity by binding the constitutive Ets protein Elf-1 (24Serdobova I. Pla M. Reichenbach P. Sperisen P. Ghysdael J.

STAT proteins are latent transcription factors that dimerize in response to cytokine receptor activation. Dimerization results in activation of their specific DNA binding activity and accumulation in the nucleus (22Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). IL-2 predominantly activates STAT5a and STAT5b, two closely related proteins encoded by separate genes (28Hou J. Schindler U.

Here we provide evidence that IL-2 responsiveness of the mouse IL-2rE depends on the binding of STAT5 to both sites I and II and that the synergistic effect of these two sites on enhancer activity is due to the interaction of the bound STAT5 dimers. Our data show that DNA-induced association of STAT dimers, which has been observed for STAT4 and STAT1 (33Xu X. Sun Y.-L. Hoey T.

IL-1 plays a similar role in these cells as antigen in mature T lymphocytes and induces PC60 cells to become IL-2-responsive.

The cells were cultured for 2–3 days in 1 ng/ml human IL-1β before stimulation with 100 units/ml human IL-2 in the continued presence of IL-1. Recombinant interleukins were gifts of Glaxo Institute for Molecular Biology S.A. (Plan-les-Ouates, Geneva, Switzerland). Oligonucleotides from MWG-Biotech (Duebendorf, Germany) or Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland) were annealed, purified on acrylamide gels, quantified, and stored in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl. As a nonspecific competitor (NS) for bandshift assays, a double-stranded oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-AGAGTTAGCTTGCGGTTCCCAGG-3′ was used. Probes were obtained either by annealing appropriate oligonucleotides (FcγRI, single IL-2rE sites I or II, IL-2rE sites I and II, nonspecific probe NS (for sequences see Fig. 1)) or by PCR amplification of different IL-2rE templates with primers spanning segments of the IL-2rE. For competition assays, probes extended from nt −1420 (primer A) to nt −1331 (primer B) of the IL-2Rα 5′-flanking region, including sites I and II. For affinity precipitation and the bandshift experiment in Fig. 7 C, probes extended from nt −1420 (primer A) to nt −1286 (primer C), including site III. To generate probes carrying a mutation in a single enhancer site, we amplified the corresponding reporter plasmid (M4 for site I, M9 for site II, and M12 for site III; see Fig. 1 and Sperisen et al. (19Sperisen P. Wang S.M. Soldaini E. Pla M. Rusterholz C. Bucher P. Corthésy P. Reichenbach P. Nabholz M. J. Biol.

Probes with mutations in more than one site were obtained in three steps, essentially as described in Hoet al. (40Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Puller J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) and explained here for a probe in which all three enhancer sites are destroyed. (a) The plasmid carrying the mutation in site I (M4) was amplified with oligonucleotide A and a 3′ oligonucleotide D′ covering site II, with changes destroying this site. Simultaneously the plasmid with a mutation in site III (M12) was amplified with a 5′ primer (D) complementary to oligonucleotide D′ and oligonucleotide C. (b) The resulting PCR products were gel-purified, denatured, annealed, and used as template for an extension reaction. The resulting full-length IL-2rE fragments were amplified with primers A and C. The final PCR products were quantified and analyzed by sequencing. Expression, activation, and purification of recombinant STAT5a have been described previously (41Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M.

The anti-STAT5 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., STAT5a and b antibodies are from R & D Systems, and horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat-anti-rabbit antibodies were from Amersham. Affinity precipitation of IL-2rE-bound proteins was performed as described in Ref. 30Beadling C. Guschin D. Witthuhn B.A. Ziemiecki A. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Cantrell D.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Lysis and extraction buffers contained protease (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4). Binding reactions were performed in a final volume of 20 μl in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of poly(dI•dC), 0.5 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA) containing 4 μg of cell nuclear extract or the indicated quantity of recombinant STAT5a protein and 2–3 × 104 cpm (30 fmol) of radiolabeled PCR fragments or oligonucleotides (see Fig. 1 for sequences). Reactions were incubated on ice for 20 min and separated on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.3 × Tris/borate/EDTA. For competition experiments, unlabeled PCR fragments or oligonucleotides were mixed with the labeled probe before addition of the proteins. When deoxycholate (DOC) was used, appropriate dilutions were added to the binding reaction at the same time as STAT5 and the probe. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature before loading on the gel. The reference plasmid pGβAcβGlD and the plasmid pwt, in which the mouse IL-2Rα 5′-flanking region and promoter has been joined to the rabbit β-globin gene, have been described previously (19Sperisen P. Wang S.M. Soldaini E. Pla M. Rusterholz C. Bucher P. Corthésy P. Reichenbach P. Nabholz M. J. Biol.

Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). For this purpose, an additionalXbaI site was created by changing the adenine at position −1307 into a guanine. This substitution did not alter IL-2 responsiveness (data not shown). A unique BclI site and the new XbaI site were used to subclone PCR products of the site-directed mutagenesis. Positive clones were sequenced. IL-1-primed cells were transiently transfected using DEAE dextran according to Queen and Baltimore (45Queen C. Baltimore D. Cell. 1983; 33: 741-748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and cultured with IL-1 only or with IL-1 and IL-2. Reporter gene expression was measured 48 h later, as described previously (44Sperisen P. Wang S.M. Reichenbach P. Nabholz M. PCR Methods Applications. 1992; 1: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cotransfected with a defined ratio of an IL-2Rα/rabbit β-globin gene together with the reference plasmid (pGβAcβGlD), which is constitutively expressed in PC60 cells and contains a 40-bp deletion in the second exon (46Kost T.A. Theodorakis N. Hughes S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 8287-8301Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Relative amounts of mRNA transcribed from the reference plasmid and the IL-2Rα/β-globin construct were determined by PCR (see Refs. 19Sperisen P. Wang S.M. Soldaini E. Pla M. Rusterholz C. Bucher P.

PCR Methods Applications. 1992; 1: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar for details). 20 μg of recombinant active STAT5a were digested with 3 μg of thermolysin (Boehringer Mannheim) in a total volume of 400 μl of digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at room temperature for 10 and 30 min. Thermolysin was inactivated by adding 4 μl of 500 mmEDTA, pH 8. Undigested protein was incubated in the same buffer without thermolysin. Electromobility shift assays were performed as described above, with 1 μl of the thermolysin reaction. The remaining reaction was diluted with SDS sample buffer (47Sambrook J. Fritsch F.E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the fragments were separated on a 10% SDS gel. The proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and visualized by Coomassie staining. N-terminal protein sequence analysis was performed by the protein facility at Tularik, Inc. using an AB477A protein sequencer and an AB120A analyzer. Two of the functional sites in the IL-2rE (sites I and II) contain potential STAT binding motifs (see Fig.1 and Sperisen et al. (19Sperisen P. Wang S.M. Soldaini E. Pla M. Rusterholz C. Bucher P. Corthésy P. Reichenbach P. Nabholz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10743-10753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)). To determine whether the IL-2rE could bind IL-2-induced STAT5, we incubated PC60 extracts with a biotinylated, double-stranded oligonucleotide comprising the entire enhancer. Bound proteins were recovered by incubating the probe with streptavidin-coated beads and characterized by Western blotting. The complete IL-2rE binds proteins of about 90 kDa, which are present in extracts from IL-2-stimulated PC60 cells and react with anti-STAT5a and anti-STAT5b antisera (Fig.2 A) as well as with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (data not shown). No STAT5 proteins could be recovered from extracts of cells that had not been treated with IL-2. As expected, IL-2 induces rapid activation of STAT5. The amount of IL-2rE-bound STAT5 continues to increase and reaches a plateau only after 24–48 h of culture in IL-2 (Fig. 2 B). This correlates with the kinetics of IL-2-induced accumulation of IL-2Rα message and IL-2rE-driven reporter gene expression (19Sperisen P. Wang S.M. Soldaini E. Pla M. Rusterholz C. Bucher P. Corthésy P. Reichenbach P. Nabholz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10743-10753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We did not detect any IL-2-inducible proteins that reacted with antisera against STAT1 and STAT3 (data not shown). To determine which segment of the IL-2rE is responsible for STAT5 binding, we used biotinylated IL-2rE oligonucleotides that carry mutations in one or more of the sites required for enhancer function. Fig. 2 A shows that a probe containing an intact site I and mutations in the other sites bind STAT5a and b. Probes containing an intact site II and mutations in the other sites bind a trace of STAT5, whereas probes with mutations in both sites I and II fail to bind STAT5. Incubation of the same filters with an antibody against Elf-1 had shown that only oligonucleotides with an intact site III bind this transcription factor (24Serdobova I. Pla M. Reichenbach P. Sperisen P. Ghysdael J. Wilson A. Freeman J. Nabholz M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that STAT5a and b can specifically bind to site I and, albeit very weakly, to site II. To confirm these data, we carried out bandshift experiments with recombinant STAT5a protein (Fig.3 A) and PC60 nuclear extracts (Fig. 3 B). Fig. 3 shows that both site I and site II can compete specifically for the binding of STAT5a to a probe that contains the STAT binding site of the FcγRI gene (see Fig. 1). Titration of various competitors indicates that the affinities of sites I and II for STAT5a are, respectively, 10-fold and 50-fold lower than that of the FcγRI STAT binding site. Extracts from IL-2-stimulated but not from unstimulated PC60 cells form a complex with the FcγRI probe that is due to IL-2-induced STAT5, as shown by supershift experiments with STAT5-specific antibodies (data not shown). The competition experiment shown in Fig. 3 demonstrates that PC60 STAT5 and recombinant STAT5a have the same relative affinity for site I and site II. In certain experiments, IL-2 also stimulated the appearance of a small amount of STAT1 (visible as a faint specific band below the STAT5 complex in Fig.3 B), but it is unlikely that STAT1 plays a role in IL-2rE activity. Interferon-γ that induces STAT1 but not STAT5 does not stimulate IL-2Rα expression, nor does it affect the response to IL-2 (data not shown). Furthermore, IL-2-dependent IL2Rα expression in T lymphocytes from interferon-γ receptor-deficient mice is normal despite the fact that stimulation with concanavalin A and IL-2 fails to induce STAT1 activation. 3C. Rusterholz, unpublished data. IL-2 responsiveness of the IL-2rE depends on synergy between the individual IL-2rE sites. This could reflect cooperative binding of the transcription factors controlling enhancer activity. Cooperative binding to pairs of weak binding sites has indeed been observed for STAT4 (33Xu X. Sun Y.-L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and STAT1 (34Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Darnell J.J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5616-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The experiments described so far were carried out with a large excess of binding sites and were therefore unlikely to reveal any cooperativity between sites I and II. To look for synergistic binding, we resolved the complexes formed by IL-2rE probes with increasing concentrations of STAT5 in bandshift assays. Since STAT5 complexes formed by crude PC60 extracts with these probes are obscured by other, nonspecific complexes, we resorted to recombinant STAT5 for these experiments. Fig.4 A shows that STAT5a forms two retarded complexes (referred to as C1 and C2) with a 39-bp probe that contains intact sites I and II (probe I/II). Complex C2 comigrates with the specific band formed by the short (20 bp) FcγRI probe used in Fig. 3 (see also Fig. 4 C) and is presumably due to STAT5a dimers. Quantitative analysis (by PhosphorImager) of the amount of probe retained in the two complexes showed that the ratio of C1 to C2 increased with rising concentrations of STAT5 protein, indicating that C1 represents a trimolecular complex between the IL-2rE probe and two STAT5 dimers binding to sites I and II, respectively. Surprisingly, a 39-bp IL-2rE probe containing a single cognate STAT5 binding site (probe I/−) also gave rise to complexes C1 and C2, but both bands were weaker, and the proportion of the C2 complex was higher. Nevertheless, increasing STAT5 concentrations resulted in a shift toward complex C1. A probe with an intact site II and a mutated site I (probe −/II) formed a small amount of complex C1 and virtually no detectable complex C2. Competition experiments confirmed that the mutations in site I and site II abolish detectable binding of STAT5 to these sites (data not shown). The observation that the IL-2rE probes containing a single binding site (probes I/− and −/II) form C1 complexes suggested that a STAT dimer bound to one site could interact with another dimer to form what we will refer to as STAT5 tetramers. Alternatively, complex C1 formed by these probes might be due to preferential binding of a small amount of pre-existing tetramers in the STAT preparation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the capacity of different IL-2rE probes to compete for the C1 and C2 complexes formed by the I/− probe (Fig. 4 B). If formation of C1 by the probes I/− and −/II is due to the higher affinity of preformed STAT5 tetramers for these oligonucleotides, then they should compete better for C1 than for C2. However, the IL-2rE oligonucleotides compete with the same relative efficiency for the two complexes as the short, high affinity FcγRI probe (F). This indicates that formation of STAT5 tetramers is DNA-dependent. This interpretation is supported by experiments with a 39-bp probe in which site I was replaced by the high affinity FcγRI STAT consensus site I, and site II was inactivated (probe F/−). Fig. 4 Cshows that, at low protein concentrations, this probe forms a single complex C2 that comigrates with the complex formed by STAT5a binding to the short FcγRI probe (F) used in Fig. 3. At higher STAT5 concentrations the F/− probe, but not the short F probe, gives rise to an increasing proportion of C1 complexes. As expected, the ratio between C1 and C2 at a given STAT5 concentration is higher when the FcγRI STAT consensus"

It is located in the extracellular part of the modified desmosomes in the cornified layer of the tissue, and its proteolysis (from 52–56 to 33 kDa) is thought to be a major prerequisite of desquamation. We have now further characterized human corneodesmosin. Proteolysis of purified cornified cell envelopes produced immunoreactive fragments, confirming the covalent linkage of the protein to these structures. Sequential extraction of epidermal proteins indicated that the 52–56-kDa precursor form of the protein exists in two distinct pools, one extracted with a nondenaturing hypotonic buffer, and the other with urea. Two-dimensional gel analysis and reactivity with phosphoserine-specific antibodies showed that it is a basic phosphoprotein. Deglycosylation experiments, reactivity with lectins, and chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose indicated that corneodesmosin is N-glycosylated. Partial sequences, 10 and 15 amino acids long, of the purified 52–56-kDa corneodesmosin showed identity with sequences predicted from a previously cloned gene, proved to be expressed in the epidermis and designated S. This indicates that corneodesmosin is probably encoded by the S gene, the function of which was unknown until now. A model of corneodesmosin maturation during cornification is proposed.

Corneocytes are anucleated “mummified” cells derived from keratinocytes during the late stages of terminal differentiation in cornified squamous epithelia such as the epidermis. They mainly consist of a cytokeratin-containing fibrous matrix surrounded by a highly resistant 15-nm thick protein structure called the cornified cell envelope. Stacking of the corneocytes at the outermost layer of the tissue, namely the stratum corneum (SC), 1The abbreviations used are: SC, stratum corneum; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NEpHGE, non-equilibrium pH gel electrophoresis; ConA, concanavalin A.1The abbreviations used are: SC, stratum corneum; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NEpHGE, non-equilibrium pH gel electrophoresis; ConA, concanavalin A. plays a critical role in the epidermal barrier function and in the mechanical protection of the body (1Holbrook K.

During the normal desquamation process, the most superficial corneocytes are shed from the skin surface.

Moreover, in plantar SC, where cell cohesion is very strong, corneodesmosomes can be detected over the whole corneocyte surface up to the top of the layer.

Lastly, it was detected in the core of corneodesmosomes in the SC (7Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Réano A. Ouhayoun J.-P. Bettinger S. Soleilhavoup J.-P. J. Invest.

When extracted from viable layers of human epidermis, corneodesmosin shows an apparent molecular mass of around 52 kDa (here designated as 52–56-kDa corneodesmosin), whereas a molecular form of 33 kDa is the major form extracted from the most superficial and less firmly attached corneocytes (7Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Réano A. Ouhayoun J.-P. Bettinger S. Soleilhavoup J.-P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lundström A. Serre G. Haftek M. Egelrud T. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1994; 286: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, corneodesmosin is proteolysed (from 52–56 to 33 kDa) during SC maturation (23Lundström A. Serre G. Haftek M. Egelrud T. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1994; 286: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Some evidence was obtained in favor of a role of corneodesmosin in corneocyte cohesion, and its proteolysis was proposed as one of the major biochemical changes that lead to desquamation (23Lundström A. Serre G. Haftek M. Egelrud T. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1994; 286: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).In this work, we have further characterized, purified, and partially sequenced the 52–56-kDa human corneodesmosin. The obtained sequences were contained in the product of the S gene, recently identified and located 160 kilobase pairs telomeric to HLA-C (24Zhou Y. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). They confirmed our recent cloning of the human corneodesmosin cDNA.DISCUSSIONIn the studies presented above, we biochemically characterized and partially sequenced human corneodesmosin, a protein specific to cornified squamous epithelia where it is thought to play a major role in corneocyte cohesion and whose proteolysis seems to be a major prerequisite of desquamation.Our data indicate that human corneodesmosin is a glycoprotein containing mainly N-linked oligosaccharides that comprise ∼10% of the protein mass. Indeed, treatment withN-glycosidase F (a glycosidase specific forN-linked sugars) of the 52–56-kDa corneodesmosin induced a 5-kDa decrease in its apparent molecular weight, whereas extensive endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase digestion (an enzyme specific for O-linked sugars) was without effect, even in the presence of neuraminidase and/or N-glycosidase F. Lectins were used to characterize the corneodesmosin carbohydrate moieties. Since the protein bound to ConA-Sepharose, and reacted with biotinylated P. sativum agglutinin, it may contain α-d-mannose and/or α-d-glucose. In addition, corneodesmosin strongly reacted with wheat germ agglutinin and, as expected for an N-glycosylated protein, may therefore contains β-N-acetylglucosamine groups. However, it seems to contain few or no galactose andN-acetylgalactosamine, since it did not react (or barely) with lectins specific for these carbohydrates. More extensive experiments will be necessary to precisely identify the oligosaccharide residues linked to corneodesmosin, and to characterize their linkage. In fact these residues may participate in the adhesion properties of the protein, as described for other corneodesmosomal adhesive proteins, desmogleins and desmocollins (26Kapprell H.-P. Cowin P. Franke W.W. Ponstingl H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 36: 217-229PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the oligosaccharide residues may transiently protect corneodesmosin against proteolysis, during maturation of the SC. Indeed, sugars have been proposed to prevent premature desquamation by protecting the desmosome and corneodesmosome core against extracellular proteases (27Walsh A. Chapman S.J. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1991; 283: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Differences in glycosylation between species may also explain, at least in part, differences in corneodesmosin size previously observed in various mammals (20Montézin M. Simon M. Guerrin M. Serre G. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Internal peptide sequences of both the purified 52–56-kDa corneodesmosin and an immunoreactive fragment derived from it, indicated 100% matching over 25 amino acids with related sequences of the predicted product of the S gene. This gene, identified by CpG island analysis of the class I region of the human major histocompatibility complex, was shown to be located 160 kilobase pairs telomeric to HLA-C (24Zhou Y. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but its function was unknown. Like corneodesmosin, the S gene had been shown to be highly expressed in the epidermal granular keratinocytes (24Zhou Y. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results strongly suggest that corneodesmosin is the product of the S gene. This was confirmed by the recent cloning of the human corneodesmosin cDNA we performed by immunoscreening of an expression library. Consistently with the results reported here, the corneodesmosin cDNA sequence predicts a pI of 8.5, one N-glycosylation site and several protein kinase phosphorylation sites. 2M. Guerrin, M.

J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1985; 13: 450-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), corneodesmosin or allelic variants of the protein may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of this common skin disorder. Indeed, psoriasis is a chronic cutaneous disease involving inflammation, hyperproliferation, and a defective program of differentiation of epidermal cells, with in particular hyperkeratosis and impaired desquamation. No direct role for the MHC peptide has been shown yet. Moreover, abnormal corneodesmosomes have been observed in psoriasis (15Vicanova J. Mommaas A.M. Mulder A.A. Koerten H.K. Ponec M. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), reinforcing the hypothesis of corneodesmosin involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease.In view of our previously published results (7Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Réano A. Ouhayoun J.-P. Bettinger S. Soleilhavoup J.-P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Montézin M.

Res. 1994; 286: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and of the present data, an overall scheme of human corneodesmosin processing during SC maturation can be proposed (Fig.8). The protein is synthesized in the upper spinous and/or lower granular keratinocytes under the form of a 52–56-kDa basic precursor that is extracted with nondenaturing hypotonic buffers. As observed by immunoelectron microscopy (7Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Réano A. Ouhayoun J.-P. Bettinger S. Soleilhavoup J.-P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is exported via keratinosomes, probably into the extracellular space (or less likely to the plasma membrane) where it is associated to the desmosome core. Then, the presence of urea, at a concentration of at least 6 m (or SDS), becomes necessary for the protein to be solubilized. During corneocyte maturation, corneodesmosin is progressively proteolysed, a molecular form of 33 kDa being the major form extracted from the most superficial and less firmly attached corneocytes (7Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Réano A. Ouhayoun J.-P. Bettinger S. Soleilhavoup J.-P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lundström A.

At the same time, the corneodesmosin fragments produced are more firmly bound to corneodesmosomes by intermolecular disulfide bonds and therefore require a reducing agent to be extracted. The fragments and/or the 52–56-kDa form are also cross-linked to cornified cell envelopes, on the external face of the structures, by other covalent bonds whose nature is unknown. Preliminary experiments suggest that corneodesmosin is not a substrate of epidermal transglutaminases, the intracytoplasmic enzymes responsible for the cornified cell envelope formation. Therefore, corneodesmosin could be ester-linked to the hydroxyacyl sphingosines bound to the outside of the cornified cell envelopes. In that case, the enzymes responsible for this linkage remain to be discovered. This linkage to the envelopes may enhance corneocyte cohesion and participate in SC resistance. Since human, pig, guinea pig, mouse, and rat corneodesmosins show similar locations in epidermis, biochemical characteristics and processing (20Montézin M. Simon M. Guerrin M. Serre G. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the model of human corneodesmosin maturation may probably be extended to these mammals.Maturation by proteolysis is not particular to corneodesmosin. Indeed, processing of filensin and other lens-specific proteins by proteolysis during lens fiber cell differentiation has been extensively described (Ref. 29Sandilands A. Prescott A.R. Hutcheson A.M. Quilan R.A. Casselman J.T. FitzGerald P.G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 238-253PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). More closely related, desmocollin 1 undergoes limited cleavage during the later stages of epidermal differentiation, resulting in the accumulation of stable NH2-terminal fragments in the SC (12King I.A. Wood M.J. Fryer P.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 22-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). How corneodesmosin processing is important for the function of the molecule is not clear. However, we recently proposed that desmosomal proteins may be protected and desquamation inhibited until corneodesmosin is proteolysed to 33 kDa (23Lundström A. Serre G. Haftek M. Egelrud T. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1994; 286: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).In conclusion, our results indicate that human corneodesmosin is closely related to the product of the S gene, a gene expressed in epidermis but whose function was unknown until now. Our data also show that corneodesmosin is a basic phosphorylated and glycosylated protein. During SC maturation it is covalently linked to the corneocyte-specific structures, i.e. the corneodesmosome core and the cornified cell envelopes. This association to the superstructure (formed by the envelopes linked to the intracellular matrix, and joined together by corneodesmosomes) responsible for SC cohesion clearly indicates the involvement of corneodesmosin in this process. We think that total degradation of corneodesmosome components and in particular corneodesmosin, at the skin surface, is required to allow cell detachment, i.e. desquamation. This hypothesis is now being tested in our laboratory. Corneocytes are anucleated “mummified” cells derived from keratinocytes during the late stages of terminal differentiation in cornified squamous epithelia such as the epidermis. They mainly consist of a cytokeratin-containing fibrous matrix surrounded by a highly resistant 15-nm thick protein structure called the cornified cell envelope. Stacking of the corneocytes at the outermost layer of the tissue, namely the stratum corneum (SC), 1The abbreviations used are: SC, stratum corneum; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NEpHGE, non-equilibrium pH gel electrophoresis; ConA, concanavalin A.1The abbreviations used are: SC, stratum corneum; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NEpHGE, non-equilibrium pH gel electrophoresis; ConA, concanavalin A. plays a critical role in the epidermal barrier function and in the mechanical protection of the body (1Holbrook K.

During the normal desquamation process, the most superficial corneocytes are shed from the skin surface. The structures involved in the cohesion between individual corneocytes, and the mechanisms that lead to the detachment of these cells are poorly understood. Although intercellular structures, thought to be derived from desmosomes (4Allen T.D. Potten C.S. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1975; 51: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 5Menton D.N.

Recent studies have shown, however, their major importance in corneocyte cohesion, and there is now growing evidence that their degradation is a key event in the desquamation process (6Chapman S.J.

In particular, a tight correlation seems to exist between cell dissociation and proteolysis of some corneodesmosomal components (12King I.A. Wood M.J. Fryer P.R. J. Invest.

Moreover, in plantar SC, where cell cohesion is very strong, corneodesmosomes can be detected over the whole corneocyte surface up to the top of the layer. In non-palmoplantar SC, where cohesion is weaker, they only persist at the periphery of the cells (6Chapman S.J. Walsh A. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1990; 282: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Réano A. Ouhayoun J.-P. Bettinger S. Soleilhavoup J.-P. J. Invest.

In psoriasis, various ichthyoses, and skin xerosis, characterized by an accumulation of corneocytes and by scaling, the number of corneodesmosomes is increased throughout the SC including the upper part (11Rawlings A.V.

Several trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like serine proteases, including the stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme, are thought to be involved in the corneodesmosome proteolysis (17Suzuki Y. Nomura J.

Using three different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), we recently identified a new corneodesmosome protein antigen expressed in various mammals including human, and we called it corneodesmosin (7Serre G.

The protein is synthesized in the upper spinous and/or lower granular keratinocytes under the form of a 52–56-kDa basic precursor that is extracted with nondenaturing hypotonic buffers. As observed by immunoelectron microscopy (7Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Réano A. Ouhayoun J.-P. Bettinger S. Soleilhavoup J.-P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is exported via keratinosomes, probably into the extracellular space (or less likely to the plasma membrane) where it is associated to the desmosome core. Then, the presence of urea, at a concentration of at least 6 m (or SDS), becomes necessary for the protein to be solubilized. During corneocyte maturation, corneodesmosin is progressively proteolysed, a molecular form of 33 kDa being the major form extracted from the most superficial and less firmly attached corneocytes (7Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Réano A. Ouhayoun J.-P. Bettinger S. Soleilhavoup J.-P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lundström A.

At the same time, the corneodesmosin fragments produced are more firmly bound to corneodesmosomes by intermolecular disulfide bonds and therefore require a reducing agent to be extracted. The fragments and/or the 52–56-kDa form are also cross-linked to cornified cell envelopes, on the external face of the structures, by other covalent bonds whose nature is unknown. Preliminary experiments suggest that corneodesmosin is not a substrate of epidermal transglutaminases, the intracytoplasmic enzymes responsible for the cornified cell envelope formation. Therefore, corneodesmosin could be ester-linked to the hydroxyacyl sphingosines bound to the outside of the cornified cell envelopes. In that case, the enzymes responsible for this linkage remain to be discovered. This linkage to the envelopes may enhance corneocyte cohesion and participate in SC resistance. Since human, pig, guinea pig, mouse, and rat corneodesmosins show similar locations in epidermis, biochemical characteristics and processing (20Montézin M. Simon M. Guerrin M. Serre G. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the model of human corneodesmosin maturation may probably be extended to these mammals.Maturation by proteolysis is not particular to corneodesmosin. Indeed, processing of filensin and other lens-specific proteins by proteolysis during lens fiber cell differentiation has been extensively described (Ref. 29Sandilands A. Prescott A.R. Hutcheson A.M. Quilan R.A. Casselman J.T. FitzGerald P.G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 238-253PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). More closely related, desmocollin 1 undergoes limited cleavage during the later stages of epidermal differentiation, resulting in the accumulation of stable NH2-terminal fragments in the SC (12King I.A. Wood M.J. Fryer P.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 22-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). How corneodesmosin processing is important for the function of the molecule is not clear. However, we recently proposed that desmosomal proteins may be protected and desquamation inhibited until corneodesmosin is proteolysed to 33 kDa (23Lundström A. Serre G. Haftek M. Egelrud T. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1994; 286: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).In conclusion, our results indicate that human corneodesmosin is closely related to the product of the S gene, a gene expressed in epidermis but whose function was unknown until now. Our data also show that corneodesmosin is a basic phosphorylated and glycosylated protein. During SC maturation it is covalently linked to the corneocyte-specific structures, i.e. the corneodesmosome core and the cornified cell envelopes. This association to the superstructure (formed by the envelopes linked to the intracellular matrix, and joined together by corneodesmosomes) responsible for SC cohesion clearly indicates the involvement of corneodesmosin in this process. We think that total degradation of corneodesmosome components and in particular corneodesmosin, at the skin surface, is required to allow cell detachment, i.e. desquamation. This hypothesis is now being tested in our laboratory. In the studies presented above, we biochemically characterized and partially sequenced human corneodesmosin, a protein specific to cornified squamous epithelia where it is thought to play a major role in corneocyte cohesion and whose proteolysis seems to be a major prerequisite of desquamation. Our data indicate that human corneodesmosin is a glycoprotein containing mainly N-linked oligosaccharides that comprise ∼10% of the protein mass. Indeed, treatment withN-glycosidase F (a glycosidase specific forN-linked sugars) of the 52–56-kDa corneodesmosin induced a 5-kDa decrease in its apparent molecular weight, whereas extensive endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase digestion (an enzyme specific for O-linked sugars) was without effect, even in the presence of neuraminidase and/or N-glycosidase F. Lectins were used to characterize the corneodesmosin carbohydrate moieties. Since the protein bound to ConA-Sepharose, and reacted with biotinylated P. sativum agglutinin, it may contain α-d-mannose and/or α-d-glucose. In addition, corneodesmosin strongly reacted with wheat germ agglutinin and, as expected for an N-glycosylated protein, may therefore contains β-N-acetylglucosamine groups. However, it seems to contain few or no galactose andN-acetylgalactosamine, since it did not react (or barely) with lectins specific for these carbohydrates. More extensive experiments will be necessary to precisely identify the oligosaccharide residues linked to corneodesmosin, and to characterize their linkage. In fact these residues may participate in the adhesion properties of the protein, as described for other corneodesmosomal adhesive proteins, desmogleins and desmocollins (26Kapprell H.-P. Cowin P. Franke W.W. Ponstingl H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 36: 217-229PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the oligosaccharide residues may transiently protect corneodesmosin against proteolysis, during maturation of the SC. Indeed, sugars have been proposed to prevent premature desquamation by protecting the desmosome and corneodesmosome core against extracellular proteases (27Walsh A. Chapman S.J. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1991; 283: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Differences in glycosylation between species may also explain, at least in part, differences in corneodesmosin size previously observed in various mammals (20Montézin M. Simon M. Guerrin M. Serre G. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Internal peptide sequences of both the purified 52–56-kDa corneodesmosin and an immunoreactive fragment derived from it, indicated 100% matching over 25 amino acids with related sequences of the predicted product of the S gene. This gene, identified by CpG island analysis of the class I region of the human major histocompatibility complex, was shown to be located 160 kilobase pairs telomeric to HLA-C (24Zhou Y. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but its function was unknown. Like corneodesmosin, the S gene had been shown to be highly expressed in the epidermal granular keratinocytes (24Zhou Y. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results strongly suggest that corneodesmosin is the product of the S gene. This was confirmed by the recent cloning of the human corneodesmosin cDNA we performed by immunoscreening of an expression library. Consistently with the results reported here, the corneodesmosin cDNA sequence predicts a pI of 8.5, one N-glycosylation site and several protein kinase phosphorylation sites. 2M. Guerrin, M. Simon, M. Montézin, C. Vincent, and G. Serre, submitted for publication. Furthermore, in light of the strong association of the Cw6 HLA-C allele with Psoriasis vulgaris (28Henseler T. Christophers E. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1985; 13: 450-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), corneodesmosin or allelic variants of the protein may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of this common skin disorder. Indeed, psoriasis is a chronic cutaneous disease involving inflammation, hyperproliferation, and a defective program of differentiation of epidermal cells, with in particular hyperkeratosis and impaired desquamation. No direct role for the MHC peptide has been shown yet. Moreover, abnormal corneodesmosomes have been observed in psoriasis (15Vicanova J. Mommaas A.M. Mulder A.A. Koerten H.K. Ponec M. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), reinforcing the hypothesis of corneodesmosin involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease. In view of our previously published results (7Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Réano A. Ouhayoun J.-P. Bettinger S. Soleilhavoup J.-P. J. Invest.

https://openalex.org/W2058226743,"Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) plays a key role in skeletal growth by stimulating bone cell replication and differentiation. We previously showed that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and other cAMP-activating agents enhanced IGF-I gene transcription in cultured primary rat osteoblasts through promoter 1, the major IGF-I promoter, and identified a short segment of the promoter, termed HS3D, that was essential for hormonal regulation of IGF-I gene expression. We now demonstrate that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) δ is a major component of a PGE2-stimulated DNA-protein complex involving HS3D and find that C/EBPδ transactivates IGF-I promoter 1 through this site. Competition gel shift studies first indicated that a core C/EBP half-site (GCAAT) was required for binding of a labeled HS3D oligomer to osteoblast nuclear proteins. Southwestern blotting and UV-cross-linking studies showed that the HS3D probe recognized a ∼ 35-kDa nuclear protein, and antibody supershift assays indicated that C/EBPδ comprised most of the PGE2-activated gel-shifted complex. C/EBPδ was detected by Western immunoblotting in osteoblast nuclear extracts after treatment of cells with PGE2. An HS3D oligonucleotide competed effectively with a high affinity C/EBP site from the rat albumin gene for binding to osteoblast nuclear proteins. Co-transfection of osteoblast cell cultures with a C/EBPδ expression plasmid enhanced basal and PGE2-activated IGF-I promoter 1-luciferase activity but did not stimulate a reporter gene lacking an HS3D site. By contrast, an expression plasmid for the related protein, C/EBPβ, did not alter basal IGF-I gene activity but did increase the response to PGE2. In osteoblasts and in COS-7 cells, C/EBPδ, but not C/EBPβ, transactivated a reporter gene containing four tandem copies of HS3D fused to a minimal promoter; neither transcription factor stimulated a gene with four copies of an HS3D mutant that was unable to bind osteoblast nuclear proteins. These results identify C/EBPδ as a hormonally activated inducer of IGF-I gene transcription in osteoblasts and show that the HS3D element within IGF-I promoter 1 is a high affinity binding site for this protein. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) plays a key role in skeletal growth by stimulating bone cell replication and differentiation.

IGF-I thus has been proposed to play a central role in skeletal growth and in bone remodeling by acting as a key mediator in hormonal control of these processes. Both parathyroid hormone and PGE2 elevate intracellular levels of cAMP in osteoblasts (9McCarthy T.M. Centrella M. Raisz L.G. Canalis E.

Previous studies have demonstrated that PGE2 induces IGF-I gene transcription in primary cultures of rat osteoblasts (Ob cells) by activating promoter 1, the major IGF-I promoter in most tissues (18Bichell D.P. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1020-1028Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar,19Pash R.J. Delany A.M. Adamo M.L. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 33-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have found additionally that stimulation of transiently transfected IGF-I promoter 1-luciferase reporter genes by PGE2 can be mimicked by co-transfection with the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and inhibited by a mutant regulatory subunit that is unable to bind cAMP (20McCarthy T.L. Thomas M.J. Centrella M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus confirming the role of this second messenger in activating IGF-I gene expression. In recent experiments, we mapped a functional cAMP response element (CRE) to the 5′-untranslated region of IGF-I exon 1 within a previously footprinted site termed HS3D (21Thomas M.J. Kikuchi K. Bichell D.P. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1584-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and showed that this segment of DNA was required for full hormonal responsiveness of IGF-I promoter 1 in osteoblasts (22Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated by gel mobility shift assays that PGE2 treatment induced nuclear protein binding to an HS3D oligonucleotide probe by a mechanism that did not require ongoing protein synthesis (22Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Based on these observations and on the absence of a typical CRE DNA sequence within the hormonally responsive segment of IGF-I promoter 1 (22Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we postulated that the IGF-I gene was regulated by PGE2 by a potentially novel transcriptional mechanism. We now have identified the principal cAMP-activated transcription factor in osteoblasts that binds to and transactivates IGF-I promoter 1 via the HS3D site. We show that C/EBPδ, a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family, appears in osteoblast nuclear extracts after treatment of cells with PGE2, that it interacts with an HS3D oligonucleotide probe with an affinity similar to that of a well characterized C/EBP site, and that it transactivates IGF-I promoter 1 and another neutral promoter only when a native HS3D sequence is present. Our results define C/EBPδ as a cAMP-regulated activator of IGF-I gene transcription in osteoblasts and show that the HS3D element within IGF-I promoter 1 is a functionally important binding site for this protein. Antibodies to C/EBPβ (C-18 and Δ198) and to C/EBPδ (C-22) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).

Cranial sutures were eliminated during dissection, and the bones were digested with collagenase for five sequential 20-min intervals. Cells from the last three digestions were pooled and then plated at 4800/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.1 mg/ml ascorbic acid, penicillin, and streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) were incubated in antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were typically plated at 1 × 105/60-mm diameter tissue culture plate. Rat IGF-I promoter 1-luciferase fusion genes have been described previously (20McCarthy T.L. Thomas M.J. Centrella M.

Other reporter genes were constructed from RSV-LUC, a recombinant vector containing the minimal Rous sarcoma virus promoter cloned into the promoterless luciferase plasmid pGL2 basic (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), which was a gift from Dr. Dwight A. Towler (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) (25Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7508-7515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A pair of 96-bp double-stranded DNA fragments were synthesized containing either four direct repeats of the 19-bp wild type HS3D sequence (5′-AGAGCCTGCGCAATCGAAA-3′) or four copies of a 19-bp mutated HS3D site, M6 (22Thomas M.J.

The recombinants were designated +4 × WT HS3D and +4 × mut HS3D, respectively. C/EBPβ expression vectors were constructed from a rat C/EBPβ cDNA in pHDIL6DBD (26Polli V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 63: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). A segment containing the coding region was subcloned into plasmid Bluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to make pBS-C/EBPβ. An EcoRI fragment from pBS-C/EBPβ was then inserted into EcoRI-digested pSV7d (27Truett M.A. Blacher R. Burke R.L. Caput D. Chu C. Dina D. Hartog K. Kuo C.H. Masiarz F.R. Merryweather J.P.

C/EBPδ expression vectors were constructed as follows. First, the coding region of the intronless rat C/EBPδ gene was isolated from genomic DNA by nested PCR, using the oligonucleotide primers listed in Table I. The amplified fragment was purified, cloned between BamHI and EcoRI sites of plasmid Bluescript to make pBS-C/EBPδ, and sequenced in its entirety. Appropriate restriction fragments were then subcloned into expression vectors to generate pSV7d-C/EBPδ and pcDNA3-C/EBPδ.Table IOligonucleotides for isolating the rat C/EBPδ gene by PCROligonucleotideOrientationSequence1-aRestriction sites used for cloning are underlined.Location1-bRelative to translation initiation site (38).First PCRSense5′-TGCGCGTCAGCTGGGGCTAG−87 to −68Antisense5′-CAGTGCCCAAGAAACTGTAG906 to 887Second PCRSense5′-GCGGATCCGAGGTGACAGCCCAACTTG−45 to −26Antisense5′-GGAATTCGGTCGTTCGGAGTCTCTAAG841 to 8221-a Restriction sites used for cloning are underlined.1-b Relative to translation initiation site (38Kageyama R.

IGF-I promoter 1-luciferase fusion genes were co-transfected with C/EBP expression plasmids and with a vector carrying the β-galactosidase gene under SV40 promoter control (Promega Corp.) to normalize for transfection efficiency. Cultures at 50% confluent density were rinsed in serum-free medium and exposed to plasmids in the presence of LipofectinTM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 3 h. The solution was then replaced with growth medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were incubated for 48 h until reaching confluent density. The cells then were rinsed with serum-free medium and treated for 6 h with vehicle (ethanol diluted 1:1000 or greater in serum-free medium) or 1 μmPGE2. After incubation, the medium was aspirated, the cultures were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cell lysis buffer (Promega Corp.), and luciferase activity was measured as described previously (20McCarthy T.L. Thomas M.J. Centrella M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol.

COS-7 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, as described (24Hall L.J. Kajimoto Y. Bichell D.P. Kim S.W. James P.L. Counts D. Nixon L. Tobin G. Rotwein P. DNA and Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105/60-mm dish in complete medium and incubated overnight. Four h after the medium was changed, DNA was added. A total of 1 μg of reporter gene was co-transfected with up to 100 ng of expression plasmid (pcDNA3, pcDNA3-C/EBPβ, or pcDNA3-C/EBPδ) and 1 ng of a vector containing the Renilla luciferase gene under control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer/promoter (pRL-CMV, Promega Corp.) to normalize for transfection efficiency. The medium was changed at 24 h after the addition of DNA, and 24 h later, following aspiration of medium and rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed and extracts were assayed, using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega Corp.). Light emission was measured with a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence, Ann Arbor, MI) by integration over 10 s of the reaction. Rat osteoblast nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (20McCarthy T.L. Thomas M.J. Centrella M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent osteoblast cultures were deprived of serum for 20 h. Cells then were rinsed with serum-free medium and incubated with vehicle (ethanol diluted 1:1000 or greater) or 1 μm PGE2 for up to 4 h. Medium was aspirated, and cultures were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Cells were harvested with a cell scraper and gently pelleted, and the pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Lee et al. (28Lee K.A.W. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (20McCarthy T.L. Thomas M.J. Centrella M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) with phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.4 mm microcystin CL), protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), and 1% Triton X-100. Nuclei were pelleted and were resuspended in hypertonic buffer containing 0.42m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, and the phosphatase and protease inhibitors indicated above. Soluble proteins released by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was dialyzed for 2 h against 2000 volumes of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20% glycerol), containing the protease inhibitors listed above. Protein concentrations were quantitated using a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Rat liver nuclear proteins were extracted according to previously published methods (21Thomas M.J. Kikuchi K. Bichell D.P. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1584-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured as indicated above. Nuclear extracts were aliquoted and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage. C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ proteins were generated using a coupled in vitro transcription-translation system (TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems (Promega)) by following the manufacturer's directions. Plasmid DNA was incubated with amino acid mix minus methionine, [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.), rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and T3 RNA polymerase in reaction buffer at 30 °C for 2 h. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis through 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and the dried gels were exposed to x-ray film. C/EBP proteins were expressed in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Cells were grown in 150-mm diameter tissue culture dishes and were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation, as outlined above, using 20 μg of expression vectors (pcDNA3, pcDNA3-C/EBPβ, or pcDNA3-C/EBPδ). Twenty-four h later, the medium was changed, and after an additional 24 h, cells were harvested and nuclear extracts were prepared as described above for osteoblast cultures. Gel mobility shift experiments followed previously published methods (22Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled double-stranded DNA probes were synthesized by annealing complementary oligonucleotides (Table II), followed by fill-in of single-stranded overhangs with dCTP, dGTP, TTP, and [α-32P]dATP (800 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products), using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Nuclear protein extracts (5–20 μg) were preincubated for 20 min on ice with up to 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) with or without unlabeled specific or nonspecific DNA competitor or antibodies in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 7.5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.025% bovine serum albumin. After the addition of 5 × 104 cpm of DNA probe for 30 min on ice, samples were applied to a 4–20% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel (Novex, San Diego, CA) that had been pre-electrophoresed for 30 min at 12.5 V/cm at 25 °C in 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA. Electrophoresis proceeded for 2.5 h under identical conditions. The dried gels were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen.Table IIOligonucleotides used in gel mobility shift experimentsOligonucleotide2-aTop DNA strand is shown.SequenceReferenceHS3D wild type5′-TTCAGAGCAGATAGAGCCTGCGCAATCGAA22Thomas M.J.

Modified radiolabeled double-stranded DNA probes were synthesized as described above with the substitution of bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate (Sigma) for TTP. Osteoblast nuclear protein extracts (30 μg) were preincubated for 30 min on ice as outlined above for gel mobility shift assays. After the addition of 5 × 104 cpm of bromodeoxyuridine-modified HS3D probe for 30 min on ice, the reaction mixture was exposed to 300-nm UV light for 1 h at a distance of 5 cm, as described (29Chodosh L.A.

After electrophoresis by SDS-PAGE, dried gels were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C with intensifying screens. Southwestern blotting followed a previously described protocol (30Silvennoinen O.

Osteoblast nuclear proteins (30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE using 15% linear gels, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Following a denaturation-renaturation step using progressively reduced concentrations of guanidine-HCl in blocking/binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6.4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), membranes were incubated in the same buffer for 1 h at 25 °C. Blots then were hybridized with 1 × 107 cpm of labeled probe in 5 ml of buffer for 1 h at 25 °C. After washing with the same buffer, membranes were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Osteoblast nuclear proteins (20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (32Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7874-7878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and 2% goat serum in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl for 1 h at 25 °C, they were incubated with an antibody to C/EBPδ (c150; diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer) for 1 h at 25 °C. Subsequent steps were performed as described (32Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7874-7878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting system, Amersham), followed by exposure to x-ray film. In previous studies, we identified HS3D as an atypical cAMP response element in the 5′-untranslated region of rat IGF-I exon 1 that mediated hormonally stimulated IGF-I gene transcription in primary rat osteoblasts (20McCarthy T.L.

By gel mobility shift assay, nuclear protein binding to this element was absent under basal conditions but was induced rapidly in osteoblast cultures exposed to PGE2(22Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This DNA fragment contained a core octameric sequence, 5′-CGCAATCG-3′, which was required for both nuclear protein binding and transcriptional activation (22Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We thus performed competition gel-mobility shift experiments to define the key nucleotides within the HS3D octameric core that were necessary for binding of PGE2-induced nuclear proteins. A series of double-stranded oligomers 31 bp in length were generated with single nucleotide substitution mutations of purines for purines and pyrimidines for pyrimidines at eight different positions (Fig.1 A). Results with these competitor oligonucleotides indicated that only three mutants, 6B, 6D, and 7A, failed to inhibit binding of the 32P-HS3D probe when used at a 200-fold molar excess (Fig.2 B), although mutant 6B was partially effective. Therefore, only three nucleotides within the HS3D core, 5′-CG C AA TCG-3′ (underlined and in boldface type) appear to be critic"

An AHR protein with normal ligand binding activity is expressed in the mutant but ligand treatment of mutant cell extract fails to induce binding of the AHR·ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) dimer to the xenobiotic responsive element (XRE). AHR cDNAs derived from the mutant encode a protein that is unimpaired in ligand-dependent dimerization with ARNT, but the AHR·ARNT dimer so formed is severely impaired in XRE binding activity. The mutant cDNAs contain a C to G mutation at base 648, causing a cysteine to tryptophan alteration at amino acid 216, located between the PER-ARNT-SIM homology region (PAS) A and PAS B repeats. Introduction of the same mutation in the wild-type AHR sequence by site-directed mutagenesis similarity impaired XRE binding activity. Substitution with the conservative amino acid, serine, had no effect on XRE binding. The tryptophan mutation, but not the wild-type allele, was detectable in genomic DNA of the mutant. The implication that an amino acid within the PAS region may be involved in DNA binding indicates that the DNA binding behavior of AHR may be more anomalous than previously suspected.

Puga A. Vasiliou V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 685: 624-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Unliganded AHR is located in the cytoplasm associated with two molecules of the 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) and possibly another protein(s) (2Chen H. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27554-27558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After binding ligand, AHR dissociates from this complex and dimerizes with the ARNT protein. In the nucleus, this dimer acts as a transcription factor. Most if not all of the pathological effects mediated by AHR appear to depend on modulation of transcription by the receptor. The mechanism of transcriptional regulation is best understood for the CYP1A1gene. Activation of transcription occurs through interaction of the AHR·ARNT dimer with several copies of short sequences, termed xenobiotic responsive elements (XREs), located in the 5′-flanking region of the gene (reviewed in Ref. 3Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar).The AHR and ARNT proteins both contain basic helix-loop-helix motifs toward their amino termini. More centrally located in both proteins is an approximately 300 amino acid PAS homology region, containing two approximately 50 amino acid degenerate direct repeats, PAS A and PAS B. Analysis of deletion mutants has identified putative functional domains of both proteins. Ligand binding occurs in a region encompassing the PAS B repeat of AHR (4Whitelaw M.L. Gottlicher M. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4169-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 5Poland A. Palen D. Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 915-921PubMed Google Scholar). One molecule of HSP90 appears to bind within the PAS region of AHR. The other molecule of HSP90 appears to require interaction at two sites: one over the basic helix-loop-helix region and the other located within the PAS region (6Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. Mcguire J.

The PAS regions of both proteins facilitate dimerization. The basic submotifs of AHR and ARNT are required for DNA binding but not for dimerization (7Fukunaga B.N. Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszaz S.

Site-directed mutagenesis of individual amino acids confirmed this last observation and also indicated that an additional block of basic amino acids of AHR located amino-terminal to the above basic submotif also appears to contact DNA (9Fukunaga B.N.

The mouse hepatoma cell line, Hepa-1, is highly inducible for CYP1A1 by PAHs and TCDD. We isolated mutants of Hepa-1 cells that are resistant to the toxicity of benzo(a)pyrene. These arose spontaneously at the relatively low rate of 2 × 10−7events per cell generation, and their frequency was increased markedly by mutagenesis. All of the clones had much reduced or undetectable CYP1A1-dependent AHH activities after treatment with concentrations of PAHs and HAHs that lead to maximal induction in wild-type Hepa-1 cells (16Hankinson O.

Analysis of somatic cell hybrids between individual clones and the Hepa-1 parental line demonstrated that most of the clones are recessive to the wild-type cells, whereas a few of the clones are dominant. Somatic cell hybridization experiments performed between the recessive clones permitted their assignment to four complementation groups (18Hankinson O. Somatic Cell Genet. 1983; 9: 497-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Karenlampi S.O. Legraverend C. Gudas J.M. Carramanzana N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10111-10117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mutants have been used extensively for analyzing the mechanism of CYP1A1 induction and the mechanism of action of AHR and ARNT (20Hankinson O. Weber G. Advances in Enzyme Regulation. 34. Elsevier Science Inc., Tarrytown, NY1994: 159-171Google Scholar). One complementation group corresponds to the CYP1A1 gene (21Montisano D.F. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 698-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Kimura S. Smith H.H. Hankinson O. Nebert D.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1929-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Clones assigned to the other three complementation groups are all affected in functioning of the AHR·ARNT dimer. Clones in complementation group B express markedly reduced levels of AHR mRNA and appear to be defective in a factor required for transcription of the AHR gene (23Zhang J.Z. Watson A.J. Probst M.R. Minehart E. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1454-1462PubMed Google Scholar). Clones in complementation group C are defective in activity of the ARNT protein (24Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Agbunag R.V. Ong M.S. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 511-518PubMed Google Scholar). One clone was isolated in complementation group D. Analysis of the D mutant demonstrated that it has moderately reduced levels of ligand binding to AHR, but appeared to be even more severely deficient in ligand-dependent translocation of AHR to the nucleus (19Karenlampi S.O. Legraverend C. Gudas J.M. Carramanzana N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10111-10117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The original D mutant analyzed in these previous studies exhibited an unstable phenotype. In the studies reported here we utilize a subclone of the original mutant that possesses a stable phenotype, maintaining undetectable TCDD-inducible AHH activity over many months in culture. We demonstrate here that the stable subclone carries a point mutation in the Ahr gene that does not affect ligand binding or dimerization with ARNT, but markedly reduces the efficiency with which the encoded AHR protein binds the XRE. This mutation changes a cysteine residue located in the PAS region to a tryptophan residue. This region was previously not thought to be involved in DNA binding, and our results point to the possibility that this region represents a novel DNA binding domain in AHR.DISCUSSIONOur previous studies demonstrated that the non-inducibility phenotype of the mutant is expressed in a recessive fashion in somatic cell hybrids formed between D cells and Hepa-1 cells, indicating that the mutant does not express a novel activity that eliminates inducibility. These studies also found that binding to AHR is moderately reduced in the D mutant, but that nuclear translocation of AHR is more severely affected. We proposed that the strain is either mutated in AHR or in a protein required for functionality of AHR (19Karenlampi S.O. Legraverend C. Gudas J.M. Carramanzana N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10111-10117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous results were obtained with the original D mutant, c35, and several subclones of the mutant that exhibit an unstable phenotype in that they slowly reacquired TCDD-inducible AHR activity as they were maintained in culture. The current results were obtained with a subclone (c35-3) of the original D mutant, that possesses a stable phenotype, maintaining low TCDD-inducible AHH activity (less than 1% of that of wild-type Hepa-1 cells) over many months in culture (Ref. 19Karenlampi S.O. Legraverend C. Gudas J.M. Carramanzana N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10111-10117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholarand data not shown). In the current studies we thereby avoided potential confounding effects of an unstable phenotype. In this paper we confirm that ligand binding is moderately reduced in the mutant. Furthermore, we show that the D mutant possesses levels of AHR mRNA and AHR protein equivalent to its ligand binding activity (in each case about one third to one half of the magnitude in Hepa-1 cells). Thus, the AHR protein that is expressed in the D mutant appears to have normal ligand binding activity, indicating that the defect in the mutant does not reside in a protein required for ligand binding (such as HSP90) or in a segment of AHR required for this function. Reversal of the mutant phenotype by a retroviral expression vector for AHR indicated that loss of CYP1A1 inducibility in the mutant is principally, if not totally, ascribable to its loss of AHR function.XRE binding in nuclear extracts obtained from D mutant cells was found to be severely reduced. Three possible explanations for the reduced XRE binding in the D mutant were envisaged: viz. that the D strain is mutated in (i) a portion of AHR that affects DNA binding or (ii) in a protein required for a necessary step preceeding DNA binding or (iii) in a protein directly required for AHR to bind DNA. (This last protein could be a protein kinase, for example, since AHR appears to require phosphorylation to bind the XRE (but not to dimerize with ARNT) (40Berghard A. Gradin K. Pongratz I. Whitelaw M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 677-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), or it could be a protein required to maintain AHR in the reduced state required for DNA binding (41Ireland R.C. Li S.Y. Dougherty J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).) To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed AHR cDNAs derived from the D mutant. The AHR proteins expressed from the D mutant-derived cDNAs exhibited normal dimerization activity toward ARNT. However, seven different cDNAs, derived from three independent RT-PCR reactions performed on the D mutant, exhibited markedly reduced XRE binding activities, demonstrating that the D mutant carries a mutation in theAHR gene, and in particular, one that affects XRE binding. Subsequent sequencing of the cDNAs identified this mutation as being a C to G transversion, leading to a Trp from Cys mutation located between the PAS A and PAS B domains. Generation of the Trp mutation by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type AHR confirmed that this mutation leads to a dramatic decrease in XRE binding activity. Interestingly, conservative substitution of cysteine with serine had no effect on XRE binding.The D mutant cDNAs were also markedly deficient in their ability to transactivate transcription from an AHR-dependent reporter gene. This deficiency is probably secondary to the defect in DNA binding, since no evidence indicates that the PAS region possesses transcriptional transactivation activity (12Li H. Dong L. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28098-28105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jain S. Dolwick K.M. Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31518-31524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the activity of the D mutant cDNAs in the transactivation assay are less markedly reduced than their activities in the XRE binding assay may reflect differences in the ratios or absolute amounts of AHR, ARNT, and/or DNA in these two assays. We have observed a similar discrepancy with regard to the results obtained with these two assays for in vitro generated mutants of AHR that are affected in XRE binding (9Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3743-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The nearly complete absence of TCDD-inducible AHH activity in D mutant cells (1% of that in Hepa-1 cells) is probably ascribable to a combination of both reduced AHR expression (one-quarter to one-half of wild-type) as well as reduced XRE binding activity of the expressed protein (less than 10% of wild-type).Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that the D mutant cells contain two chromosomal segments that hybridize to a probe that maps to the centromeric region of mouse chromosome 12, very close to where the Ahr gene is located (39Le Beau M.M. Carver L.A. Espinosa III, R. Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 66: 172-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while Hepa-1 cells contain three copies. It is likely therefore that D and Hepa-1 cells contain two and three copies of the Ahr gene, respectively. However, only the mutant AHR sequence (Trp216) was detected in genomic DNA from the D mutant, while only the wild-type sequence was detected in the genomic DNA of Hepa-1 cells. Furthermore, all 12 cDNAs derived from the D mutant contained the mutation, while neither of those derived from the Hepa-1 strain contained it. Thus the mutation must have arisen de novo in the D mutant. A possible scenario for the origin of the c35-3 mutant strain is that it arose from Hepa-1 cells by loss of two copies of the Ahr gene and mutation of one copy (not necessarily in that order), followed by duplication of the mutant allele. This suggestion is compatible with the observation that the strain expresses reduced levels of AHR compared with Hepa-1 cells. The proposed mode of origin of the D strain is consistent with the known mechanism of action of gamma irradiation, which was used to induce the D mutant (19Karenlampi S.O. Legraverend C. Gudas J.M. Carramanzana N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10111-10117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gamma irradiation is known to cause G to C transversions as well as gross chromosomal deletions, including loss of whole chromosomes, in mammalian cells (42Miles C. Meuth M. Mutat. Res. 1989; 227: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 43Hoebee B. Brouwer J. van de Putte P. Loman H. Retel J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6252-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We previously observed that the originally isolated D mutant strain, c35, and certain subclones derived from it exhibited an unstable phenotype, is that they slowly increased in TCDD-inducible CYP1A1 activity as they were maintained in culture (19Karenlampi S.O. Legraverend C. Gudas J.M. Carramanzana N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10111-10117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that each of these strains consists of a heterogenous population of cells, some possessing and some lacking the wild-type Ahr allele, and that instability is due to an increase in the proportion of cells containing the wild-type allele. The clone used in the present paper, c35–3, exhibited a stable phenotype.The DNA binding behavior of AHR is very different from that of other basic helix-loop-helix PAS proteins, including ARNT. DNA contacts within the basic domain of AHR are restricted to its carboxyl-terminal half. An amino-terminal basic segment of AHR separated from the above basic domain may also contact the XRE (although this latter point is controversial) (9Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3743-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Bacsi S.G. Hankinson O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31657-31665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mutated cysteine residue, Cys216, is embedded in an arginine and cysteine-rich region of AHR: 212RCFRCRLRC220, that is conserved in rat and human AHR (except for Arg215, which is Ile in human AHR). This region is highly basic like the above two regions of AHR believed to contact DNA. It is thus possible that DNA binding by AHR is even more anomolous than hitherto suspected, with DNA contacts also occurring within the PAS region where Cys216is located. Several large deletions in the PAS region of AHR have previously been characterized by several investigators. Large deletions encompassing Cys216 eliminate XRE binding (6Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. Mcguire J. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 756-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fukunaga B.N. Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszaz S. Hankinson O. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 8566-8570Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), consistent with the notion that Cys216 contacts DNA, although these deletion mutations may compromise other activities preceeding DNA binding (such as dimerization), rather than DNA bindingper se. Another explanation for the phenotype of the D mutant is that Cys216 does not contact DNA, but that mutation of Cys216 to Trp216 alters the tertiary structure of AHR in such a way as to eliminate DNA binding. If indeed the loss of DNA binding by the D mutant protein is due to an alteration in tertiary structure rather than a specific effect on DNA binding, then this alteration must be relatively minor, since the above mutation does not affect either ligand binding or dimerization with ARNT.Dougherty and co-workers (41Ireland R.C. Li S.Y. Dougherty J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)demonstrated that binding of the AHR·ARNT heterodimer to the XRE in vitro could be reversibly activated or inhibited by agents that reduce or oxidize cysteine residues, respectively, and that dimerization of AHR with ARNT was not affected by these agents. A number of considerations suggested to us that the (or a) target for redox regulation of AHR·ARNT DNA binding might be Cys216 of AHR: (i) no cysteine residues exist in the first 100 residues of AHR, that encompasses all previously identified domains involved in DNA binding, and no cysteine residues occur in the basic region of ARNT, which is its only known DNA binding region (8Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 10Bacsi S.G. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8843-8850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). (ii) Basic residues are located either side of Cys216. The presence of basic residues on both sides of a cysteine residue dramatically enhances its reactivity (48Snyder G.H. Cennerazzo M.J. Karalis A.J. Field D. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6509-6517Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), potentially making it particularly susceptible to oxidation. (iii) Redox regulation of DNA binding by Jun and Fos is mediated by single cysteine residues in the DNA binding domains of these proteins. Like Cys216of AHR, these cysteine residues are each flanked on both sides by basic residues (49Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility we tested the effect of oxidation/reduction on the XRE binding activities of in vitro transcription/translation-generated, dialyzed, and TCDD-treated AHR·ARNT dimers. Diamide treatment reduced XRE binding of the wild-type AHR·ARNT dimer by 2-fold, and this effect was reversed by dithiothreitol. 3This relatively mild effect of oxidation on XRE binding of the AHR·ARNT dimer is in agreement with recent observations of Dr. John Dougherty (cf. Ref. 41Ireland R.C. Li S.Y. Dougherty J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). He informed us, “The oxidized form of the Ah receptor-Arnt dimer migrates as a diffuse band in gel retardation assays. This can accentuate the apparent difference in the amounts of binding when autoradiograms of these assays are examined visually. When scintillation counting was used to quantitate the retardation of 2 nm XRE-E of the CYP1A1 gene by purified AHR·ARNT dimer, the fully reduced form retarded only four times the counts retarded by the fully oxidized form.”The Ser216 mutant AHR·ARNT dimer responded to these agents in exactly the same manner (data not shown). Thus Cys216 of AHR does not appear to mediate redox regulation of XRE binding.We previously reported that the D mutant is severely affected in ligand-dependent nuclear translocation of AHR, as assessed by conventional subcellular fractionation analysis. One possible explanation for these results is that amino acids 212–220 represent part or all of a nuclear translocation signal (this region is rich in basic amino acids like other known nuclear translocation signals) and that the Trp216 mutation negates activity of this signal. An alternative explanation is that, because of its defect in DNA binding, the AHR mutant binds with reduced avidity to DNA and is therefore more readily extracted from nuclei during the subcellular functionality procedure. Immunocytochemical analysis will be required to determine whether nuclear translocation of AHR is genuinely defective in the mutant.We now possess mutants affected in the major proteins involved in induction of CYP1A1. Certain of our mutants (originally called A mutants) are mutated in the Cyp1a1 gene, others (originally called C mutants) are defective in ARNT function and are probably mutated in the Arnt gene, while we identify here a mutation (in the D mutant) in the Ahr gene. These mutants, which are all derived from the same cell line, together provide a powerful experimental system for investigating the role of this induction mechanism in any cellular process that is expressed in these cells. AHR knockout mice have previously been reported by two research groups (50Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S.T. Kimura S. Nebert D.W. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Science. 1995; 268: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar,51Schmidt J.V. Su G.H.-T. Reddy J.K. Simon M.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6731-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). AHR null mutant cell lines that are potentially obtainable from these mice strains would constitute a complementary system for studying the role of AHR in cellular processes.It should be noted that another class of mutants of Hepa-1 cells, the B mutants, have previously been used to investigate the role of AHR in particular cellular functions (52Puga A. Nebert D.W. Carrier F. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 53Vasiliou V. Kozak C.A. Lindahl R. Nebert D.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, we recently demonstrated that the B mutants are deficient in a factor required for expression of the Ahr gene, rather than being mutated in theAhr gene itself, and may potentially be defective in expression of many other genes besides Ahr (23Zhang J.Z. Watson A.J. Probst M.R. Minehart E. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1454-1462PubMed Google Scholar). Our demonstration that the D mutant is specifically mutated in theAhr gene makes this mutant much preferable to the B mutants for investigating the role of AHR in cellular physiological processes. Our observation that the D strain is mutated in the Ahr gene also sheds light on certain previous observations. For example, we previously studied differentiated and dedifferentiated derivatives of the rat hepatoma line, H4IIE-C3, and found that dedifferentiated variants express CYP1A1 inducibility while differentiated variants generally do not. Treatment of the differentiated variants with 5-azacytidine or sodium butyrate, which are known to be able to reactivate expression of silenced genes, restored inducibility and AHR activity to these cells. Furthermore, the non-inducibility phenotype of the differentiated variants was complemented in somatic cell hybrids between these cells and the A, B, and C mutant classes of Hepa-1 cells, but was not complemented in somatic cells hybrids formed between these cells and the D mutant (54Gudas J.M. Hankinson O. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 513-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We can now conclude that lack of CYP1A1 inducibility in the differentiated variants is due to silencing of theAHR gene in these cells.

Defects in genes that regulate chloroplast gene expression or that are involved in the maturation or assembly of photosynthetic complexes are likely to cause a nonphotosynthetic phenotype. C. reinhardtii is an attractive organism for studying these genes, because nonphotosynthetic mutants are viable when provided with acetate as a carbon and energy source. With the ultimate goal of understanding the mechanisms by which nucleus-encoded factors regulate chloroplast gene expression and function, we have generated tagged nonphotosynthetic mutants, focusing initially on the isolation and characterization of nuclear genes required for the biogenesis of the cytochrome b 6 f complex of C. reinhardtii. The cytochrome b 6 f complex carries out photosynthetic electron transfer between photosystem (PS) 1The abbreviations used are: PS, photosystem; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); ORF, open reading frame; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; SGII, Sager-Granick medium; SuIV, subunit IV.

The binding sites for the hemes and the Fe2S2center are well defined, and each cofactor binding site lies within a single polypeptide. This feature makes theb 6 f complex particularly suited for studies of cofactor-polypeptide association and assembly. Previous studies have identified a number of nuclear genes required for the biogenesis of the cytochrome b 6 fcomplex (9Girard-Bascou J. Pierre Y. Drapier D. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Howe G. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1992; 12: 2789-2801Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Lemaire C. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A.

Among these are a distinct subset of four nuclear loci that are also required for synthesis of cytochromec 6. 2Xie, Z., Culler, D., Dreyfuss, B. W., Kuras, R., Wollman, F.-A., Girard-Bascou, J., and Merchant, S. (1998)Genetics, in press.Cytochrome c 6, a functional substitute for plastocyanin, is a soluble heme-containing protein that carries out electron transfer between the cytochromeb 6 f complex and PS I; its expression is induced under copper-deficient conditions (11Howe G. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1992; 12: 2789-2801Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Merchant S. Bogorad L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cytochromec 6 and cytochrome f arec-type cytochromes in which the heme prosthetic group is covalently attached to the apoproteins. While cytochrome fis chloroplast-encoded, cytochrome c 6 is encoded by the nuclear Cyc6 gene, synthesized in the cytosol, and imported post-translationally into the chloroplast (26Merchant S. Bogorad L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 27Merchant S. Hill K. Howe G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, there are few biosynthetic steps that are common for cytochromec 6 and cytochrome f besides translocation across the thylakoid membrane, lumenal processing, and heme attachment. In previous work, we identified several mutants that display a cytochromeb 6 f −/cytochrome c6− phenotype, and biochemical characterization confirmed that the strains were able to translocate and process precursor and intermediate forms of cytochrome fand c 6 but were unable to convert the apocytochromes to their respective holoforms (11Howe G. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1992; 12: 2789-2801Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Howe G. Mets L. Merchant S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This work defined a specific biochemical phenotype for heme attachment mutants (cytochromeb 6 f −/cytochromec 6−) and suggested that a common set of proteins is required for holocytochrome formation in the thylakoid lumen. One of these is the product of the chloroplast-encodedccsA gene, which is required for the biosynthesis and accumulation of the cytochrome b 6 fcomplex and cytochrome c 6 (29Xie Z. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Loss of CcsA function results in a defect at the step of heme attachment to apocytochromes c 6 and f. In the present study, we describe the isolation and characterization of a nuclear gene, Ccs1 (c -typecyt synthesis), which is required for assembly of the cytochrome b 6 f complex and cytochrome c 6. On the basis of a pleiotropicc-type cytochrome deficiency in a strain lacking functional Ccs1, we suggest that its gene product functions in the same pathway as CcsA. C. reinhardtii strain nit1–305 cw15, which is the wild type for photosynthesis, was used as a recipient for nuclear transformations. C. reinhardtii strain CC-125 (wild type) was obtained from the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center (Duke University, Durham, NC). Strain B6, isolated by Gal et al. (30Gal A. Mets L.J. Ohad I. Baltscheffsky M. Current Research in Photosynthesis. II. Kluwer Academic, The Netherlands1990: 779-781Google Scholar), does not accumulate cytochrome c 6or the cytochrome b 6 f complex due to a frameshift mutation in the chloroplast ccsA gene (11Howe G. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1992; 12: 2789-2801Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Xie Z. Merchant S. J. Biol.

CC-125 and B6 were used as positive and negative control strains, respectively, for the analyses of cytochrome c 6and cytochrome f synthesis. E. coli strains XL1-Blue and DH5α were used as hosts for recombinant DNA techniques (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Sager-Granick medium (33Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, Inc., New York1989: 575-576Crossref Google Scholar) supplemented with ammonium nitrate (SGII-NH4) under continuous light (50 microeinsteins/m2 s) and transformed by the glass bead method (34Kindle K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1228-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). 0.5 μg of plasmid pNIT1 DNA (35Sodeinde O.A. Kindle K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9199-9203Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) linearized with EcoRI was used per transformation, after which the cells were plated on SGII agar plates supplemented with potassium nitrate (SGII-NO3) and grown under dim light (5 microeinsteins/m2 s) until colonies were visible (∼3 weeks). The colonies were then picked onto plates to screen for nonphotosynthetic mutants by growth under the following conditions: 1) acetate-containing SGII-NO3 plates in dim light (permissive condition), and 2) acetate-deficient SGII-NO3 plates in bright light (100 microeinsteins/m2 s; restrictive condition). Transformation experiments to demonstrate complementation of the nonphotosynthetic phenotype were performed with 5 μg of λ DNA, 1 μg of plasmid DNA, or no DNA, as described. Photosynthetic colonies were selected on acetate-free SGII-NO3 agar plates. For analyses of cellular proteins, cells were grown in high salt acetate, Tris-acetate phosphate (33Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, Inc., New York1989: 575-576Crossref Google Scholar) or copper-free Tris-acetate phosphate (36Quinn J. Merchant S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) media to exponential to early stationary phase (2–6 × 106cells/ml). For immunoblots of total cell extracts, cells were harvested by centrifugation and boiled for 5 min in loading buffer (0.0625m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.00005% bromphenol blue). After centrifugation, 25 μl of the supernatant was loaded into a 12 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were separated by electrophoresis as described previously (27Merchant S. Hill K. Howe G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose paper using a Bio-Rad Transblot semidry apparatus (Bio-Rad). Antibodies against cytochrome f and cytochrome b 6 were obtained from Dr. R. Malkin (University of California, Berkeley, CA). The antibody against subunit IV (SuIV) has been described previously (37Chen X. Kindle K. Stern D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3627-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The antibody against the D2 protein of PS II was obtained from Dr. M. Kuchka (Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA). These primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000. The ECL chemiluminescent system (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) was used to detect immunoreactive proteins. For detection of cytochromes, cells were collected by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 5 min), washed in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and resuspended to a chlorophyll concentration of 1 mg/ml in the same buffer. Cells were lysed by two cycles of slow freezing to −80 °C followed by thawing to room temperature. The soluble cell extract was separated from the insoluble membrane fraction by centrifugation (16,000 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min, and both fractions were returned to the original sample volume with buffer. The proteins were separated by nondenaturing or denaturing gel electrophoresis as described previously (11Howe G. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1992; 12: 2789-2801Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), except that the denaturation buffer contained 50 mm dithiothreitol instead of β-mercaptoethanol, and the samples were denatured on ice to preserve the integrity of the heme group of the cytochromes. Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) at 4 °C, and heme-containing proteins were identified by a heme staining procedure using chemiluminescent reagents (38Vargas C. McEwan A.G. Downie J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Membranes were immersed in the Supersignal Chemiluminescent Substrate CL-HRP (Pierce) for 30 s and exposed to film (Reflection, NEN Life Science Products). Following exposure to film, membranes were rinsed with TBS buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies against plastocyanin (1:5000), cytochrome c 6 (1:1000), and cytochromef (1:5000) as a primary antibody. Bound primary antibody was detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody for cytochrome immunoblots and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for plastocyanin immunoblots. To monitor cytochrome f synthesis, cells were radiolabeled as described previously (39Li H.H. Quinn J. Culler D. Girard-Bascou J. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31283-31289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The cells were pulse-labeled for 10 min with Na235SO4 followed by a 40-min chase in the presence of unlabeled sulfate and chloramphenicol (250 μg/ml). The initial immunoprecipitation of cytochrome f is essentially quantitative in the case of extracts from mutant strains, while for wild-type extracts, approximately 50% of total cytochromef is removed in the first immunoprecipitate. Isolation of plasmid DNA was performed either by the boiling method (40Holmes D.S. Quigley M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) or by a modified alkaline lysis procedure (41Lee S. Rasheed S. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 676-679PubMed Google Scholar). C. reinhardtii DNA was isolated as described previously (42Kindle K.L. Schnell R.A. Fernandez E. Lefebvre P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). C. reinhardtiitotal RNA was prepared either by the method of Shepherd et al. (43Shepherd H.S. Ledoigt G. Howell S.H. Cell. 1983; 32: 99-107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or as described by Merchant et al. (27Merchant S. Hill K. Howe G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), while poly(A)+ RNA was isolated as described previously (44Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Southern blotting and hybridization of C. reinhardtii DNA to radioactive probes was performed as described previously (35Sodeinde O.A. Kindle K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9199-9203Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). RNA blot hybridization was performed as described by Hill et al.(45Hill K.L. Li H.H. Singer J. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15060-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). petA mRNAs were identified by hybridization to a 600-bp HindIII/AccI radiolabeled fragment from plasmid pHA0.6 (16Buschlen S. Choquet Y. Kuras R. Wollman F.-A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and mRNAs encoding cytochromec 6 (Cyc6) were identified by hybridization to a 710-bp EcoRI radiolabeled fragment from plasmid pGEM1Crc552 7A-4 (46Merchant S. Bogorad L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9062-9067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RbcS2-specific probe consisted of the 0.8-kb EcoRI cDNA insert of the plasmid p149A, which was obtained from the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center. 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments were performed using poly (A)+ RNA from C. reinhardtii strainnit1–305 cw15, Ccs1-specific primers (5′-AAGCTCGAGAACTGGGC-3′ and 5′-ATGAAGGTGCCCAGGCC-3′), and the Superscript Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA was digested with SalI, ligated, and transformed by electroporation into E. coli (47Tam L.-W. Lefebvre P.A. Genetics. 1993; 135: 375-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A fragment from the rescued plasmid was used as a probe to screen aC. reinhardtii genomic library comprising strain 21gr DNA in λFIX II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA); this library was obtained from Dr. R. Schnell and Dr. P. Lefebvre (University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN; Ref. 48Schnell R.A. Lefebvre P.A. Genetics. 1993; 134: 737-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A C. reinhardtii cDNA library made from RNA isolated from vegetative cells of strain CC-621 in λZAP II (Stratagene) was obtained from Dr. J. Woessner and Dr. U. Goodenough (Washington University, St. Louis, MO; Ref. 49Waffenschmidt S. Woessner J.P. Beer K. Goodenough U.W. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 809-820PubMed Google Scholar). The library (8 × 104 independent plaques) was screened with a mixture of probes made from the 0.45-kb SphI and 1.5-kbSphI/KpnI fragments (probes 2 and 3, Fig. 4) of pCcs1–1. Since we were unable to convert the cDNA insert from the single positive plaque into a plasmid by superinfection with a helper, the cDNA insert was polymerase chain reaction-amplified (30 cycles of the following: 92 °C for 30 s; 45 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 2 min) using T3 and T7 primers. The fragment was digested withEcoRI/ScaI and XhoI/ScaI to produce 0.5-kb ScaI/EcoRI and 2.0-kbXhoI/ScaI fragments, which were then subcloned into pBluescript KSII− (the ScaI site is located within the cDNA, while the terminal EcoRI andXhoI sites are derived from the λZAP II vector). Plasmid pCcs1–1 was digested withSacI and religated to make the plasmid pCcs1–4 in which the 5′-region of genomic DNA in pCcs1–1 was deleted. pCcs1–4 was used as a template for genomic sequencing. Nested deletions of plasmids containing cDNA fragments were made using the Erase-a-Base kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Plasmids were sequenced using the Silver Sequence DNA sequencing system (Promega) or by dye terminator cycle sequencing using 3′ dye-labeled dideoxynucleotide triphosphates and run on an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). The DNA sequence was derived from sequencing the entire length of both strands of the cDNA and genomic clones. Nuclear transformation was used to generate insertion mutations in genes required for biogenesis of the cytochromeb 6 f complex of C. reinhardtii. Approximately 2500 independent transformants were grown on acetate-supplemented plates and subsequently screened for mutants that had lost the ability to grow phototrophically. Eight nonphotosynthetic transformants were identified and screened further for defects in accumulation of the cytochromeb 6 f complex by immunoblot analysis using an antibody against subunit IV (SuIV) to probe total cell extracts. Since strains that carry mutations affecting the accumulation of cytochrome f, cytochrome b 6, or SuIV also fail to accumulate the other subunits of the complex (14Lemaire C. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A. Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 229-238Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 37Chen X. Kindle K. Stern D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3627-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,50Kuras R. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the abundance of SuIV is diagnostic of the entire cytochromeb 6 f complex. Four of the eight strains accumulated drastically reduced amounts of SuIV (strains 3, 9, 30, and 34; Fig. 1). These strains were designated as abf (accumulation of the b 6 f complex) mutants. The abf mutants did not accumulate cytochromeb 6 or cytochrome f, as expected (Fig.1). All abf mutants exhibited wild-type levels of the D2 protein of PS II, which suggests that these mutations do not affect the accumulation of cytochrome b 559, which is an integral component of PS II. We next performed a Southern blot analysis to determine whether the mutants exhibited an RFLP that might indicate an insertion in eitherPetC and PetM, the two known nuclear genes that encode subunits of the complex. Since no PetC orPetM RFLPs were observed (data not shown), we concluded that the lesions in the abf mutants most likely affected 1) a previously unidentified nucleus-encoded subunit of the complex, 2) a regulatory gene required for the expression of structural genes of the complex, or 3) a gene required for the maturation or assembly of the complex. Nuclear mutations have defined four loci,CCS1–CCS4, involved specifically in the biogenesis of chloroplast c-type cytochromes.2 These strains exhibit a pleiotropic c-type cytochrome deficiency that is characteristic of a defect at the post-translational step of heme attachment. To determine whether any of the abf mutants harbored lesions of this type, the mutants were screened for cytochromec 6 accumulation by performing immunoblots, which assess polypeptide abundance, and heme staining, which assesses holocytochrome abundance. Cell extracts were isolated from cells grown in copper-deficient medium to induce transcription of Cyc6, which is repressed by copper (27Merchant S. Hill K. Howe G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 51Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 623-628PubMed Google Scholar). The B6 mutant of C. reinhardtii, which contains a mutation in the chloroplastccsA gene and does not accumulate cytochrome f or cytochrome c 6 (29Xie Z. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), was included as a control. As shown in Fig. 2, A andB, holocytochromes c 6 andf do not accumulate in either abf3 or B6. To confirm that the cells were copper-deficient and hence under conditions allowing expression of the Cyc6 gene, the extracts were tested for plastocyanin content, since cells accumulate plastocyanin only when the medium contains copper. Since little plastocyanin was detected under copper-deficient conditions (Fig. 2 B, bottom; compare lanes 2, 4, and 6 withlanes 1, 3, and 5), the cells were indeed copper-deficient. Moreover, Cyc6 transcripts accumulated under these conditions (Fig. 2 C). Hence, the cytochrome c 6 deficiency could not result simply from lack of Cyc6 expression due to copper contamination in the medium. The mutation did not affect accumulation of petAmRNA (Fig. 2 C), and pulse-chase labeling experiments demonstrated that abf3, like B6 and previously described heme attachment mutants (11Howe G. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1992; 12: 2789-2801Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), synthesizes but is unable to accumulate cytochrome f (Fig. 2 D). The presence of plastocyanin and the PS II-associated Oee1 protein (data not shown) in extracts of cells grown in the presence of copper confirms that the synthesis of other lumenal proteins is not affected in these strains. Thus, it is unlikely that abf3 is defective in some component of the chloroplast-SecA thylakoid transport pathway (52Yuan J. Henry R. McCaffery M. Cline K. Science. 1994; 266: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 53Voelker R. Barkan A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3905-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that abf3 most likely harbors a mutation(s) in a gene(s) required for the attachment of heme to chloroplast c-type cytochromes. A Southern blot analysis of DNA isolated from abf3 that was hybridized with a Nit1-specific probe revealed that the mutant harbored a single insertion of pNIT1 (data not shown). Since the mutation in abf3 was presumably a consequence of this plasmid DNA insertion, we attempted plasmid rescue to isolate the DNA that flanked the insertion site in abf3 (47Tam L.-W. Lefebvre P.A. Genetics. 1993; 135: 375-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recovered plasmid contained a 1.3-kb C. reinhardtii DNA fragment. When a genomic DNA blot was probed with this fragment, an RFLP was detected between wild type and abf3 (Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and2). If the nonphotosynthetic phenotype was indeed due to the insertion, the RFLP should cosegregate with the mutant phenotype in genetic crosses. However, crosses between abf3 and an appropriate marker strain did not yield viable progeny. Theref"

Wade R.D. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A. Titani K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). PKG shares significant homology with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in amino acid sequence, structure, and catalytic competence, with the major difference being that the regulatory (R) and catalytic (C) components of PKA are located on separate polypeptides encoded by separate genes (8Takio K. Wade R.D. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A. Titani K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 9McKnight G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This difference impacts the mechanisms of cyclic nucleotide-dependent activation of PKA and PKG. PKA activation occurs through cAMP-dependent dissociation of the protein into separate regulatory and catalytic entities, although total dissociation may not be required (10Johnson D.A. Leathers V.L. Martinez A.M. Walsh D.A. Fletcher W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6402-6410Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Yang S. Fletcher W.H. Johnson D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6267-6271Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, PKG activation is constrained to involve only conformational rearrangements, since dissociation into separate regulatory and catalytic entities is not possible. In this regard, the structure of PKG is more similar to many members of the protein kinase family in which the regulatory and catalytic domains exist on a single polypeptide. The structure of PKA catalytic subunit has been solved by x-ray diffraction (12Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar), and the structure of the catalytic domain of PKG has been modeled upon what is now recognized as the conserved core of essentially all mammalian protein kinases (13Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Like the other kinases whose structures have been solved (14DeBondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J.J.

Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar), the catalytic domain of PKG is predicted to be bilobal with a catalytic cleft located between the two lobes (5Hofmann F. Dostmann W. Keilbach A. Landgraf W. Ruth P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Protein substrate binding to PKG shares many features in common with that of PKA (19Mitchell R.D. Glass D.B. Wong C. Angelos K.L. Walsh D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 528-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and significant homology is also evident between the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate domains of the two kinases (20Francis S.H. Smith J.A. Colbran J.L. Grimes K. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20748-20755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Both kinases also contain shared recognition determinants within their catalytic center for substrate and pseudosubstrate binding (21Glass D.B. Feller M.J. Levin L.R. Walsh D.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1728-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Release of the autoinhibition occurs upon cyclic nucleotide binding,i.e. the cyclic nucleotide-dependent activation of protein kinase activity. The crystal structure of the two in tandem cAMP-binding sites of PKA has been solved using the Δ91 truncated RI subunit of PKA (22Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and the two sites are structurally similar to that of the cAMP-binding pocket of the Escherichia coli catabolite gene activation protein, CAP (23Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The two cGMP-binding sites of PKG are homologous in amino acid sequence to both the cAMP-binding sites of PKA and of CAP (8Takio K. Wade R.D. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A. Titani K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and thus there is a very high likelihood that the overall structure of the two cGMP in tandem binding sites of PKG will closely mimic that determined for the regulatory subunit of PKA (24Weber I.T. Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6122-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One noted difference exists between the cyclic nucleotide-binding sites of PKA and PKG in that the two in tandem sites have different cyclic nucleotide binding characteristics. These two sites are termed A and B in both kinases with reference to their location along the polypeptide, with site A more proximal and site B more distal to the amino terminus. In PKA, site B is the higher affinity cAMP binding site and the site into which cyclic nucleotide would first equilibrate. Site A is of lower affinity and releases bound cAMP more readily (25Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Neitzel J.J. Dostmann W.R.G. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because of the kinetic differences in the rates of cAMP dissociation from the two sites, A and B are often termed the “fast” and “slow” sites, respectively. In type I PKG, the kinetic characteristics of these two sites are reversed. Site A is the high affinity cGMP binding site, and site B is the low affinity site (28Corbin J.D. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11391-11397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Doskeland S.O. Vintermyr O.K. Corbin J.D. Ogreid D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17570-17575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). How these differences in the kinetic properties of the cyclic nucleotide binding sites may modulate the mechanism of activation of PKG and PKA remains to be elucidated. Both PKA and PKG holoenzymes are dimers, with interactions of the amino-terminal domains of the regulatory region/subunit important for dimerization. Removing this region by limited proteolysis produces monomeric units of catalytic and regulatory domains/subunits that still display cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase activity. The protein interactions that account for dimerization of the two kinases, however, appear to be different. In PKG-Iα there is a prominent leucine zipper motif that is predicted to provide for dimerization, and NMR spectroscopy of a peptide composed of the first 39 amino-terminal residues shows that it dimerizes by such a mechanism (31Atkinson R.A. Saudek V. Huggins J.P. Pelton J.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9387-9395Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Leucine zipper motifs are also apparent in PKG-Iβ and PKG-II, (32Gamm D.M. Francis S.H. Angelotti T.P. Corbin J.D. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27380-27388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13586-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These motifs are not present in any of the PKA isoforms (Iα, Iβ, IIα, IIβ) (9McKnight G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 34Bubis J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2163-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the conformational changes that accompany the progressive cGMP binding to PKG by small angle x-ray scattering and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. We demonstrate that cGMP causes a major conformational shift in PKG and that the full shift requires binding at both the high and low affinity cGMP binding sites. This work follows upon the previous conclusions of Wolfe et al. (35Wolfe L. Francis S.H. Landiss L.R. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16906-16913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), based upon anion exchange chromatographic profiles, and of Landgraf et al. (36Landgraf W. Hofmann F. Pelton J.T. Huggins J.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9921-9928Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), from CD spectroscopy, that cGMP prompts conformational changes in PKG. In a companion paper (37Chu D. Corbin J.D. Grimes K. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the types of conformational changes that we have observed here were identified employing quite different experimental approaches and conditions. Both sets of data provide fully complementary conclusions. Type Iα PKG was purified to apparent homogeneity from bovine lung using the methods previously described (38Francis S.H. Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 322-341Google Scholar). Purity was analyzed using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The purified protein was stored in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 150 mm NaCl at 4 °C. X-ray scattering experiments were performed within 1 week of purification to minimize possible time-dependent aggregation effects as well as potential loss of enzyme catalytic activity. Protein kinase catalytic activity was assayed as described previously in the absence and presence of 10 μm cGMP using the heptapeptide (RKRSRAE) as substrate (39Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PKG activity was stimulated >10-fold by the addition of cGMP. The cAMP and cGMP content of the purified PKG was determined using the PKA or PKG activation assays previously described (40Corbin J.D. Getty T.W. Blackmore P.F. Beebe S. Francis S.H. Glass D.B. Redmon J.B. Sheorain V.S. Landiss L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cAMP content of purified PKG was <2%, and the cGMP content was <0.1% of the concentration of cyclic nucleotide binding sites. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay as standardized by repeated amino acid analyses of purified PKG and the determined amino acid composition (8Takio K. Wade R.D. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A. Titani K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 39Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PKG samples used for the scattering experiments were ∼1.5 mg/ml, as noted for each experiment. Cyclic GMP was added to the protein at the indicated stoichiometric levels from a concentrated stock solution prepared in the same buffer as that of the protein. The cGMP concentration in the stock solution was determined by measuring optical density (molar extinction coefficient (ε252) = 13,700). The PKG samples used for FTIR measurements were further concentrated to 7.8 mg/ml using a Centricon-30 concentrator, followed by dialysis against 10 mm KH2PO4 in D2O, pH 6.8 (uncorrected meter reading), containing 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol, with no observed change of enzymatic activity. cGMP was exchanged into D2O by repeated lyophilization in the presence of excess D2O. FTIR samples were prepared by the addition of either 10 mm cGMP in D2O or D2O alone, to give a final concentration of 50 μm PKG-dimer with or without 1 mmcGMP. FTIR spectra were recorded at 4-cm−1 resolution using a Bomem Interferometer equipped with a Perkin-Elmer solution cell with CaF2 windows separated by a 100-μm path length. FTIR data were analyzed using Bomem Grams/386 software. Typically, 1024 scans were coadded and triangularly apodized to increase the signal:noise ratio. Data were analyzed using the techniques of spectral subtraction and second derivative analysis as described by Trewhella et al. (41Trewhella J. Liddle W.K. Heidorn D.B. Strynadka N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1294-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Background buffer spectra were obtained using the buffer samples collected from the flow-through from the Centricon concentration procedure and treated identically as the PKG samples. X-ray scattering experiments were carried out using the small angle station at Beam Line 4–2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (42Wakatsuki S. Hodgson K.O. Eliezer D. Rice M. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1992; 63: 1736-1742Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as well as on the instrument at Los Alamos described by Heidorn and Trewhella (43Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Scattering measurements were made on one sample using both instruments, and the data were carefully compared to evaluate possible radiation-induced aggregation effects arising from the very bright synchrotron source at SSRL. In addition, the synchrotron data were collected in intervals of 2 min to monitor possible time-dependent aggregation effects or other changes. Protein aggregation would be evidenced by an increase in the forward or zero angle scattering (I 0), which is directly proportional to the molecular weight of the scattering particle times its concentration in units of mg/ml (44Kringbaum W.R. Kugler F.R. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). PKG samples showed no change in scattering over the 20-min data collection times used for the synchrotron experiments. In addition, there were no differences between the scattering data collected at Los Alamos and SSRL, apart from the expected improved statistics obtained with the synchrotron intensities. Thus, all of the data presented here are from the SSRL measurements for which the sample-to-detector distance was 2.3 m and the wavelength (λ) was 1.3 Å. Scattering data were measured as a function of scattering angle 2θ, and reduced to I(Q) versus Q, whereQ (equal to 4πsinθ/λ) is the amplitude of the scattering vector or momentum transfer of the scattered x-rays whose wavelength is λ. All scattering data were normalized by the incident beam intensity recorded by an ion chamber monitor before the sample. The net scattering from the protein was calculated by subtracting a buffer scattering profile measured in the same sample cell immediately before or after the protein measurement. The sample cells were made of Teflon to give a ∼1-mm path length with circular mica windows (diameter, ∼5 mm) that provided an area for irradiation larger than the x-ray beam (∼3 × 1 mm2). The mica window material was ∼10 μm thick. For the experiments presented here, the temperature was maintained at 15 °C. X-ray scattering data were collected on PKG samples in which the molar ratio of cGMP to PKG-dimer was varied from 0 to 20 (i.e.0–5-fold molar excess over total number of cGMP binding sites). In the first set of experiments, we observed no time-dependent aggregation of PKG in the absence of cGMP; however, the addition of cGMP resulted in some protein aggregation after 2–3 h. Subsequent experiments were therefore conducted using samples to which cGMP was added less than 10 min before they were placed in the x-ray beam for measurement, and under such conditions no aggregation was apparent. Scattering data were collected for 10–20 min for each sample. To demonstrate that the effects observed on the scattering are specific to cGMP, measurements were also performed using 5′-GMP. The radius of gyration (R g ) forward scattering (I 0), and vector distribution function (P(r)) were calculated from the scattering data using both Guinier (45Guinier A. Ann. Phys. (Paris). 1939; 12: 161-196Google Scholar) andP(r) (46Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982: 17-51Google Scholar, 47Feigen L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small Angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987: 25-55Google Scholar) analyses. For a homogeneous solution of monodispersed particles, the Guinier approximation, which holds for sufficiently small Q values, is as follows.I(Q)=I0e−Q2Rg2/3Equation 1 A plot of log[I(Q)] versus Q 2 thus yields R g andI 0 from the slope and the intercept with the log[I] axis, respectively. If one or two dimensions of the scattering particle are much larger than the other(s), one can multiply by Q to remove the longer dimension(s) from the scattering. This scaling yields corresponding Guinier approximations for rodlike and disklike forms, respectively,QI(Q)=I0ce−Q2Rc2/2Equation 2 Q2I(Q)=I0te−Q2Rt2Equation 3 from which the radius of gyrations of cross-section and thickness, R c and R t , can be calculated. P(r) is obtained from the inverse Fourier transformation of the scattering data (46Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982: 17-51Google Scholar, 47Feigen L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small Angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987: 25-55Google Scholar),P(r)=12π2∫I(Q)Qr sin(Qr)drEquation 4 using Tikhonov's regularization method (48Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigen L.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1988; 44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar).I 0 and R g can also be calculated as the zeroth and second moments ofP(r), respectively. P(r) is the distribution of all possible vector lengths between scattering centers (atoms) within the scattering particle, and it therefore goes to zero at the maximum linear dimension, d max.R g is the root mean square distance of all scattering centers from their center of mass, which is equivalent to the root mean square of all vector lengths between scattering centers. Purified PKG (∼0.6 mg/ml, 14 μm total cGMP-binding sites) in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 2 mmEDTA, and 0.15 m sodium chloride was incubated with the indicated concentrations of [3H]cGMP (15–30 Ci/mmol) at 15 °C for 8 min. Four 5-μl aliquots were then removed for determination of total bound [3H]cGMP, and then a 50-fold excess of unlabeled cGMP was added to the remainder of the assay mixture. Aliquots of 5 μl were then removed at regular intervals over a period of 2 h to determine the rate of release of bound [3H]cGMP. All 5-μl aliquots were added into 2 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate at 4 °C, and then the total sample was filtered through 0.45-μm nitrocellulose papers, prewetted with 1 ml of ice-cold saturated ammonium sulfate, using a Millipore vacuum filtration system as described previously (28Corbin J.D. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11391-11397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose papers were washed with 3 × 1 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate, dried, and then placed into vials, thoroughly agitated with 1 ml of 2% SDS and counted with 10 ml of aqueous scintillant. Separate blanks were used that contained all of the same components of the binding mixture except PKG, before and after the addition of unlabeled cGMP. Release from the low affinity “fast” site occurred within a few seconds. The t½ for release from the high affinity “slow” site was ∼38 min. Site occupancy was determined in comparison with PKG saturated with 100 μm[3H]cGMP (7-fold excess of total cGMP to total cGMP sites). X-ray scattering data were collected for PKG in the absence of cGMP and over a range of cGMP:PKG stoichiometries. Fig.1 shows the scattering profiles for PKG with no cGMP (○) and with five incremental concentrations of cGMP, and Fig. 2 shows example Guinier plots for two of these data sets at 0 and 4.4 mol of cGMP/PKG-dimer. TheP(r) functions calculated from the data in Fig. 1are shown in Fig. 3, along with theP(r) function for PKG in the presence of saturating 5′-GMP (dashed line). A summation of the structural parameters derived from the scattering data is presented in Table I for an extended range of cGMP:PKG stoichiometries. As demonstrated by these data, the Guinier plots obtained for PKG in both the absence and presence of cGMP are linear to low Q values (Fig. 2), and there is good agreement between the R g values calculated from the Guinier andP(r) analyses (Table I) and the normalizedI 0 values in the absence of cGMP and at each of the cGMP: PKG stoichiometries are identical within error (Table I) except for the very highest concentration of cGMP evaluated, which shows only a small increase. These three observations provide good evidence that the PKG samples are aggregation-free and not adversely affected by the x-ray irradiation. In addition, comparison ofI 0 values for the PKG samples and a standard calmodulin sample (49Kreuger J.K. Olah G.A. Rokop S.E. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6017-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) gave the expected ratio based on the molecular weights of the two proteins, confirming that the PKG samples were aggregation-free.Figure 2Guinier plots of the data according to Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3. From top to bottom,R g , R c , and R t are shown in three panels. Two data sets from Fig. 1 are shown with each panel for PKG-dimer with 0 (○) and 4.4 (□) mol of bound cGMP. Data are shifted on the vertical axis to facilitate comparison. For the 4.4 mol of cGMP sample, there is a second linear region (at Q > 0.06 Å−1 or Q 2 > 0.004 Å−2) in the R c plot, indicating a second axis of rotation, and the linear region in theR t plot is smaller and shifts toward higherQ values. These data indicate that PKG becomes less disk-shaped when saturated with cGMP. As cGMP is titrated to the sample, the R t linear Q region shifts gradually outwards. The Q region shown in the figure was that used to calculate the R t value.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Pair distribution functions,P(r), obtained from the data shown in Fig. 1using Equation 4.

https://openalex.org/W2068822275,"Protein kinase C signaling pathways have been implicated in the disruption of intercellular junctions, but mechanisms are not clear. p100 and p120 are members of the Armadillo family of proteins and are localized to cellular adherens junctions. In strain I Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, protein kinase C activation leads to disruption of tight junctions and an increase in permeability of cell monolayers. We show that this permeability increase is accompanied by dephosphorylation of p100/p120 on serine and threonine residues. The dephosphorylation of these proteins can also be induced by the kinase inhibitors staurosporine, KT5926, and Gö 6976. Treatment of cells with phosphatase inhibitors induced hyperphosphorylation of p100 and p120. Thus, p100 and p120 participate in a regulatable cycle of serine/threonine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Protein kinase C must act, directly or indirectly, by perturbing this phosphorylation cycle, by inhibition of a p100/p120 kinase and/or activation of a phosphatase. These data clearly show that p100 and p120 are targets of a novel protein kinase C signaling pathway. Dephosphorylation of these proteins precedes the permeability increase across epithelial cell monolayers seen in response to phorbol esters, raising the possibility that this pathway may play a role in the modulation of intercellular junctions. Protein kinase C signaling pathways have been implicated in the disruption of intercellular junctions, but mechanisms are not clear. p100 and p120 are members of the Armadillo family of proteins and are localized to cellular adherens junctions. In strain I Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, protein kinase C activation leads to disruption of tight junctions and an increase in permeability of cell monolayers. We show that this permeability increase is accompanied by dephosphorylation of p100/p120 on serine and threonine residues. The dephosphorylation of these proteins can also be induced by the kinase inhibitors staurosporine, KT5926, and Gö 6976. Treatment of cells with phosphatase inhibitors induced hyperphosphorylation of p100 and p120. Thus, p100 and p120 participate in a regulatable cycle of serine/threonine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Protein kinase C must act, directly or indirectly, by perturbing this phosphorylation cycle, by inhibition of a p100/p120 kinase and/or activation of a phosphatase. These data clearly show that p100 and p120 are targets of a novel protein kinase C signaling pathway. Dephosphorylation of these proteins precedes the permeability increase across epithelial cell monolayers seen in response to phorbol esters, raising the possibility that this pathway may play a role in the modulation of intercellular junctions. Intercellular junctions are important sites of regulation. Cells recognize and adhere only to their correct neighbors. Once contact is made, they signal each other to stop growing and interact to form a cooperating unit. In certain physiological situations, such as wound healing or tissue morphogenesis, cell junctions can be disrupted in a controlled manner to allow cell migration (for a review, see Ref. 1Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Conversely, inappropriate disruption of junctions can have unfortunate consequences. For example, loss or mutation of certain components of junctions in transformed cells results in increased invasiveness and metastatic potential (2Behrens J. Mareel M.M. Van Roy F.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2435-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 3Frixen U.H. Behrens J. Sachs M. Eberle G. Voss B. Warda A. Lochner D. Birchmeier W. J.

Cell-cell junctions are particularly well developed in epithelial cells. These have discrete, specialized regions of cell-cell adhesion comprising the tight junction, which forms the main barrier to paracellular traffic, the adherens junction, and the desmosome. Evidence suggests that the adherens junction is an important site of regulation and may be an important target for signaling pathways. Furthermore, other junctions, such as the tight junction, are dependent on prior formation of the adherens junction (6Gumbiner B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 7Gumbiner B. Stevenson B. Grimaldi A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1575-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and therefore indirectly subject to modulation of adherens junction function. The basic architecture of adherens junctions is well established. They are formed by Ca2+-dependent homotypic interaction between cadherin molecules on adjacent cells (8Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2977) Google Scholar, 9Geiger B. Ayalon O. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 307-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The cadherins are linked to the actin-based cortical cytoskeleton via α-, β-, and γ-catenins, which bind to the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins and are essential for adhesion (10Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 11Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 12Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). α-Catenin is homologous to vinculin and so may provide the link to the actin cytoskeleton (13Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Tsukita S. Cell. 1991; 65: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 14Herrenknecht K. Ozawa M. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Lente M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proteins comprising this family contain copies of a 42-amino acid repeat motif that was first identified in the Drosophila segment polarity gene product Armadillo (19Riggleman B. Wieschaus E. Schedl P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 20Peifer M. McCrea P.D. Green K.J. Wieschaus E. Gumbiner B.M. J.

A number of different signaling pathways can regulate intercellular junctions. Several studies have suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation plays a role in controlling junctional integrity, and evidence has pointed to components of the adherens junction as possible molecular targets. The tyrosine kinases c-Yes, c-Src, and c-Lyn have been found at adherens junctions (22Tsukita S. Oishi K. Akiyama T. Yamanishi Y. Yamamoto T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), where levels of phosphotyrosine can, under certain conditions, become elevated (22Tsukita S. Oishi K. Akiyama T. Yamanishi Y. Yamamoto T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 23Maher P.A. Pasquale E.B. J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Transfection of epithelial cells with oncogenic Src or Ras leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of components of the adherens junction, and this correlates with loss of cell-cell adhesion (4Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. Van Roy F. Mareel M.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 25Matsuyoshi N. Hamaguchi M. Taniguchi S.

In cells with well developed junctions, tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors also lead to increased tight junction permeability in association with tyrosine phosphorylation of junctional proteins (28Staddon J.M. Herrenknecht K. Smales C. Rubin L.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p120, like β-catenin, is a member of the Armadillo family of proteins, having 11 copies of the 42-amino acid Armadillo repeat (29Reynolds A.B. Herbert L. Cleveland J.L. Berg S.T. Gaut J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2439-2445PubMed Google Scholar). It was first discovered as a protein whose phosphorylation on tyrosine residues correlated with transformation in cells transfected with pp60v- src (30Linder M.E. Burr J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2608-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 31Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). p120 is also tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation of cells by the growth factors epidermal growth factor, colony-stimulating factor, and platelet-derived growth factor (32Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 33Downing J.R. Reynolds A.B. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 607-613PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, p120 has been shown to be localized to adherens junctions via interaction with cadherins, and a number of different, closely related, isoforms have been identified (34Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P. Wheelock M.M. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Staddon J.M. Smales C. Schulze C. Esch F. Rubin L.L. J.

The association of p120 with cadherins is further intriguing evidence that cell-cell adhesion may be regulated by signaling pathways. Protein kinase C (PKC), 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; PDB, phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DiC8, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol; PAA, phosphoamino acid; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; PDB, phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DiC8, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol; PAA, phosphoamino acid; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. a serine/threonine kinase, has for some time been implicated in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion, but although much is known about the kinase itself (38Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19 (33): 73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar), in molecular terms its effects on adhesion are very poorly understood. PKC plays a role in assembly of tight junctions (39Nigam S.K. Denisenko N. Rodriguez-Boulon E. Citi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 40Balda M.S. Gonzalez-Mariscal l. Contreras R.G. Macias-Silva M. Torres-Marquez M.E. Garcia Sainz J.A. Cereijido M. J. Membr.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), but its activation can also lead to disruption of those of established cell monolayers, causing an increase in paracellular permeability (42Ojakian G. Cell. 1981; 23: 95-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 43Soler A.P. Laughlin K.V. Mullin J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 44Stenson W.F. Easom R.A. Reihl T.E. Turk J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G955-G962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKC activation has also been strongly implicated in cell growth control, which also involves alterations in cell-cell adhesion. The targets of the PKC signaling pathway and how changes in cell adhesion are achieved are not known. In this study, we report that components of the adherens junction, p120 and the related protein p100, are major targets of a PKC-mediated signaling pathway in epithelial cells and thus may play a role in modulation of cell-cell adhesion. Strain I MDCK cells (epithelial cells derived from canine kidney) were provided by Barry Gumbiner (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). Strain II MDCK cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. LLC-PK1(epithelial cells derived form porcine kidney) and Caco-2 cells (epithelial cells derived from a human colonic tumor) were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Salisbury, UK). All cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in humidified air. MDCK cells were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Caco-2 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 15% fetal calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1 μg/ml bovine insulin. LLC-PK1 cells were grown in M199, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. For whole cell lysate analysis, 105 cells were plated on 6.5-mm diameter, 0.4-μm, polycarbonate Transwell filters from Costar (Cambridge, MA) in 0.25 ml of medium. The basolateral chamber contained 0.75 ml of medium. For immunoprecipitation analysis, 5 × 105 cells were plated onto 24-mm Transwell filters in 2 ml of medium, with 3 ml of medium in the lower chamber. In both cases, cells were used 4–7 days after plating. Tissue culture materials were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Renfrewshire, UK). Phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDB), bisindolylmaleimide I, bisindolylmaleimide V, KT5926, staurosporine, Gö 6976, Gö 7874 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, UK), 4α-PDB (Alexis Corp., UK), and Ro 31–8425 (synthesized and provided by Eisai Tsukuba Laboratories, Japan) were made up as stock solutions at appropriate concentrations in Me2SO and added to cells at a 1:1000 dilution. 1,2-Dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DiC8) (Cambridge BioScience, UK) was made up as 50 mm stock in Me2SO and added at 1:100 to give a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Okadaic acid (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) was made up as a 100 μm stock in Me2SO and added at 1:100. Calyculin A (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) was made up as 10 μm stock in PBS and added to cells at 1:100. In all cases, appropriate vehicle controls were performed and found to have no effect. Whole cell lysates were prepared by rapidly replacing the culture medium of cells on filters with hot Laemmli sample buffer (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206271) Google Scholar), followed by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Immunoprecipitations were carried out at 4 °C, in which case, after appropriate treatment, confluent monolayers of cells were washed rapidly with ice-cold PBS (containing 0.9 mmCaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2) before the addition of 0.5 ml of appropriate lysis buffer. The filters were then gently scraped, and the lysate was removed and centrifuged at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was precleared with 10% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia, UK) in lysis buffer for 30–60 min. Appropriate primary antibodies were added to the lysate, and after 2–3 h the immune complex was isolated, using rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) and protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, and the bound protein was solubilized in SDS-sample buffer, followed by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Where protein was labeled with [35S]methionine, cells were incubated for 48 h in 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) in methionine-free minimal essential medium prior to immunoprecipitation. For the immunoprecipitations, Triton lysis buffer or TDS lysis buffer was used. Triton lysis buffer (pH adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH) contained 25 mm Hepes, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1m NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate, and protease inhibitors. TDS lysis buffer (pH 7.4) comprised Triton lysis buffer supplemented with 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.2% SDS. The protease inhibitors used in each case were leupeptin (10 μg/ml), α2-macroglobulin (0.1 unit/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml), and PMSF (1 mm). Monoclonal antibodies recognizing E-cadherin, β-catenin, and p100/120 were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Cell extracts or immunoprecipitates in SDS sample buffer were resolved by SDS-PAGE (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206271) Google Scholar). The slab gels were then equilibrated in buffer comprising 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 20% methanol, and 0.03% SDS. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Hybond ECL; Amersham), which were Ponceau S-stained and then blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Filters were then probed with p120 antibody at a dilution of 1:2500. After washing, filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Amersham), at a dilution of 1:5000. The filters were then extensively washed in PBS, 0.5% Tween 20, and immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) following the manufacturer's instructions. MDCK I cells grown to confluence on 24-mm filters were incubated overnight in phosphate-free minimal essential medium containing 0.5% serum (dialyzed against 0.9% NaCl and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5)) and 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham). Cells were treated with or without 200 nm PDB for 30 min and then lysed into TDS buffer and immunoprecipitated with p120 antibodies as described above. Following transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose, the filters were exposed overnight to film, and the resulting autoradiograph of [32P]labeling was scanned by densitometry using a Bio-Rad imaging densitometer model GS-670. The filters were then probed with p120 antibodies, and the resulting ECL exposure was scanned in the same way to quantify protein loading. For phosphoamino acid (PAA) analysis, MDCK I cells were labeled as above with [32P]orthophosphate, and the p100 and p120 were extracted from PDB-treated or control cells by immunoprecipitation. Following transfer to Immobilon P (Millipore, Bedford MA) and immunoblotting to assess recovery of protein, the area of the filter containing p100 and p120 was excised. The proteins were hydrolyzed at 110 °C for 1 h in 5.7 m HCl to release PAAs. Following lyophilization, two-dimensional PAA separation and detection was carried out as described previously (46Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed at room temperature for 20 min in 3% paraformaldehyde made up in PBS containing 0.5 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mmMgSO4. Fixed cells were washed and then permeabilized by incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After washing, the cells were incubated for 30 min in PBS containing 10% calf serum and 0.1 m lysine, pH 7.4. Incubation with p120 antibody (0.5 μg/ml) was in PBS containing 10% calf serum for 1 h. After washing, the cells were then incubated for 60 min with a 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) in PBS containing 10% calf serum. After washing, the filters were mounted with Citifluor (Citifluor Products, Canterbury, UK) and examined using a Nikon Microphot-FXA fluorescence microscope fitted with 40 × and 60 × objectives. Photographs were taken using Kodak T-Max film (400 ASA). Resistance measurement of cells grown on 6.5-mm transwells were taken using a Millicell-ERS resistance system (Millipore Corp.). For paracellular flux measurements, 1 μCi of [U-14C]sucrose in 25 μl of PBS was added to the apical side of cells grown on 6.5-mm transwells. Cells were incubated at 37 °C, shaken at 10-min intervals, and all the medium from the basolateral chamber was removed for scintillation counting at the times indicated. MDCK cells are a kidney-derived epithelial cell line. Two strains exist: strain I, which develop high electrical resistance across monolayers in culture due to extremely well developed tight junctions; and strain II, which have lower electrical resistance. (47Richardson J.C.W. Scalera V. Simmons N.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 673 (26): 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Most of the following experiments were carried out using strain I cells. These cells were grown on polycarbonate filters, allowing measurement of resistance across cell monolayers. Cells with a resistance of 2000–4000 ohms·cm2 were used. Consistent with previous findings (42Ojakian G. Cell. 1981; 23: 95-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the addition of 200 nm PDB caused a rapid decrease in resistance (in our hands, resistance dropped to 58.3 ± 7.7% of control after 30 min of incubation with PDB). As part of a series of experiments analyzing the effects of PDB on junctional proteins, whole cell lysates from MDCK I cells treated with or without 200 nm PDB for 30 min were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with antibodies to the adherens junction proteins p100/p120 (Fig.1). Whereas the p100 and p120 from untreated cells were visualized as rather diffuse bands, these proteins from PDB-treated cells appeared as tighter, faster migrating bands. In contrast, the mobility and the amount of E-cadherin were unaffected (Fig. 1 B), indicating equal protein loading, and, as previously reported for fibroblasts (48Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Turner C.E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22060-22065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mobility of paxillin was reduced (Fig. 1 C). PKC activation leads to increased paracellular permeability in other epithelial cell lines (43Soler A.P. Laughlin K.V. Mullin J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 44Stenson W.F. Easom R.A. Reihl T.E. Turk J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G955-G962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated whether p100 and p120 isolated from these cells showed altered mobility during electrophoresis. Resistance of Caco-2 and LLC-PK1monolayers decreased following PDB stimulation (as previously reported). Paracellular flux of [14C]sucrose is also increased (Fig. 2, A andC). MDCK II cells did not show an appreciable drop in resistance in response to PDB, but did show an increase in paracellular flux across cell monolayers (Fig. 2 E), indicating some disruption of cell-cell junctions. In all of these cell lines, stimulation of PKC led to increased mobility of p100/p120 (Fig. 2,B, D, and F). Pretreatment of MDCK I cells with the specific PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (49Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loroille F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Ro 31–8425 (50Wilkinson S.E. Parker P.J. Nixon J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) for 5 min prior to PDB addition completely abolished the p100/p120 band shift (Fig.3 A). Bisindolylmaleimide V, a member of the bisindolylmaleimide class that does not inhibit PKC, was unable to block the PDB-induced band shift. Analysis of dose dependence showed that PDB was effective at concentrations between 30 and 100 nm (Fig. 3 B), corresponding to the concentrations required to activate PKC (51Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Rozengurt E. Rodriguez-Pena M. Smith K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7244-7248Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Also, an inactive stereoisomer of PDB, 4α-PDB, had no effect on p100/p120 mobility (Fig. 3 C). The effect of PDB could be also be obtained with a cell-permeant diacylglycerol analogue, DiC8 (Fig.3 D). These results demonstrate that the p100/120 band shift occurs as a response to PKC activation by PDB. A time course experiment showed that the p100/p120 mobility shift occurred rapidly, with maximal effect within 5 min of PDB treatment (Fig. 4 A). The effect on p100/p120 could be reversed, either by washing away the PDB (data not shown), or by subsequent addition of bisindolylmaleimide I. These data show that interconversion of p100 and p120 from slower to faster migrating forms is dynamic, clearly arguing against the possibility that the increased p100/p120 mobility was due to proteolysis. In these cells, the mobility shift of p100 and p120 correlates closely with the kinetics of permeability increase across the cell monolayer, and reversal of the shift by the addition of bisindolylmaleimide I is rapidly followed by re-establishment of monolayer resistance (Fig.4 B). We investigated the possibility that the altered pattern of migration during electrophoresis of p100 and p120 following treatment with PDB was due to a change in the phosphorylation state of these proteins. MDCK I cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and treated with or without PDB, and the p100 and p120 were isolated by immunoprecipitation. This immunoprecipitation was carried out in TDS lysis buffer to remove any associated proteins from p100 and p120. Protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and autoradiographed (Fig.5 A). The level of phosphate present in p100 and p120 from untreated cells was compared with that from PDB-treated cells by densitometric scanning of the resulting autoradiograph (Fig. 5 B). Immunoblotting of these filters, followed by scanning, allowed the phosphate signal to be normalized in relation to the amount of protein analyzed. (Fig. 5, A andB). This corrected for small errors due to slight differences in protein recovery. It was calculated that the [32P]phosphate content of p100 and p120 was reduced by approximately 40% following PDB treatment. The dephosphorylation of p100 and p120 is specific, since there was no change either in the phosphorylation of E-cadherin immunoprecipitated from the same cell lysates or in the phosphorylation state of proteins in whole cell extracts (data not shown). This rules out the extremely unlikely possibility that the effect on p100/p120 was an artifact due to nonspecific effects of PDB on labeling of the γ-phosphate of the cellular ATP pool. PAA analysis of p100/p120 from MDCK I cells showed that in resting cells these proteins contained mainly phosphoserine, with a small amount of phosphothreonine and no detectable phosphotyrosine (Fig.5 C). Following the addition of PDB, there was a reduction in the level of phosphorylation of both serine and threonine residues. Densitometric analysis of the autoradiographs of the PAA analysis revealed a reduction in phosphate signal of approximately 40% (data not shown), agreeing with the values obtained from the whole protein phosphate labeling experiments. To bring about dephosphorylation of p100/p120, PKC activation must lead to net kinase inhibition and/or phosphatase activation. Since the effect on p100/p120 is rapid and can easily be reversed, it is clear that p100/p120 is capable of cycling between phosphorylated and lesser phosphorylated forms, subject to the action of kinase(s) and phosphatase(s). To test this further, MDCK I cells were treated with kinase or phosphatase inhibitors in an attempt to perturb this cycle. Thus, 100 nm staurosporine, a kinase inhibitor (53Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar), induced a p100/p120 band shift similar to that seen in response to PDB (Fig. 6 A). This would be consistent with direct inhibition of a p100/p120 kinase by staurosporine. However, staurosporine inhibits many kinases, and it could be argued that its effects on p100 and p120 were indirect. Screening a variety of kinase inhibitors showed that the addition of KT5926, a staurosporine derivative that has a more restricted number of targets (54Nakanishi S. Yamada K. Iwahashi K. Kuroda K.

This response involves gene reprogramming manifested by the re-expression of fetal genes, such as the previously reported isoform switch from adult α- to embryonic β-myosin heavy chain. We now report the transient re-expression of a second fetal gene, skeletal α-actin in rat myocardium at 7 days post-infarction, and its subsequent down-regulation coincident with the delayed induction of S100β, a protein normally expressed in brain. In cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, co-transfection with an S100β-expression vector inhibits a pathway associated with hypertrophy, namely, α1-adrenergic induction of β-myosin heavy chain and skeletal α-actin promoters mediated by β-protein kinase C. The induction of β-myosin heavy chain by hypoxia was similarly blocked by forced expression of S100β. Our results suggest that S100β may be an intrinsic negative regulator of the hypertrophic response of surviving cardiac myocytes post-infarction. Such negative regulators may be important in limiting the adverse consequences of unchecked hypertrophy leading to ventricular remodeling and dysfunction.

In a rat model of myocardial infarction, surviving terminally differentiated cardiac myocytes undergo a phenotypic transition post-infarction, involving cellular hypertrophy and re-expression of genes normally restricted to the fetus, including the embryonic β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), 1The abbreviations used are: β-MHC, β-myosin heavy chain; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; NE, norepinephrine; PE, phenylephrine; PKC, protein kinase C; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; skACT, skeletal α-actin; bp, base pair(s); RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; LUX, luciferase. the skeletal isoform of α-actin (skACT), atrial natriuretic factor, and a fetall-type calcium channel (1Orenstein T.L.

This response is comparable to the hypertrophic response of the heart to acute pressure overload, during which the induction of several fetal genes including β-MHC and skACT has been observed (5Schwartz K. de la Bastie D.

The existence of feedback mechanisms limiting the hypertrophic response is suggested by the observation that the induction of β-MHC and skACT, in response to pressure overload, is down-regulated after 8–11 days in association with moderation of the increase in myocardial mass (5Schwartz K. de la Bastie D.

Mahdavi V. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 970-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Since the attenuation of the hypertrophic response post-infarction may be beneficial in tempering adverse ventricular remodeling (1Orenstein T.L. Parker T.G. Butany J.W. Goodman J.M. Dawood F.

The signaling pathways activated by myocardial infarction are likely to be multifactorial and the relative contributions of hypoxia, ischemia, and activation of local and systemic trophic factors in the hypertrophy of surviving myocytes is unknown. Hypertrophy and its associated program of fetal gene re-expression can be reproduced in vitro in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes by treatment with a number of trophic effectors including peptide growth factors and α1-adrenergic agonists such as norepinephrine (NE) and phenylephrine (PE) (8Simpson P.C.

To date, no intrinsic candidates for limiting the hypertrophic response have been put forward. S100 protein is a 20-kDa Ca2+-binding protein dimer composed of two subunits S100α and S100β, that have different tissue distributions (22Isobe T. Okuyama T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 89: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 23Isobe T. Okuyama T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 24Kato K. Kimura S. Biochim.

While human myocardium normally expresses S100α (24Kato K. Kimura S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 842: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 26Haimoto H. Kato K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we detected, unexpectedly, in post-mortem myocardium of human subjects deceased with chronic lung disease, the presence of S100β, a subunit usually expressed in brain, presumably induced in heart prior to death by elevated levels of endogenous or exogenously administered catecholamines (27Kahn H.J. Baumal R. Van Eldik L.J. Marks A. Dunn R.J. Modern Pathol. 1991; 4: 698-701PubMed Google Scholar). S100β has been shown to bind specifically in vitro to several substrates of PKC inhibiting their phosphorylation by the enzyme, with a preferential inhibition of phosphorylation of some substrates by recombinant β-PKC relative to the α- and γ-PKC subtypes (28Albert K.A.

In the present article, report that, first, as in response to pressure overload, the induction of skACT in rat myocardium post-infarction is transient, and its down-regulation is temporally associated with the delayed induction of S100β. Second, transfection of an S100β expression vector into cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes inhibits the β-PKC mediated induction of β-MHC and skACT by NE and PE, respectively. Third, hypoxia induces β-MHC transcription in cultured myocytes, a response similarly blocked by forced expression of S100β. These results suggest that the appropriately timed induction of S100β is part of an intrinsic negative regulatory pathway that limits the hypertrophic response following myocardial infarction. The experimental model of lateral wall myocardial infarction by surgical left coronary artery ligation was established in male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 12–14 weeks as described previously (1Orenstein T.L. Parker T.G. Butany J.W. Goodman J.M. Dawood F. Wen W.-H. Wee L. Martino T. McLaughlin P.R. Liu P.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 858-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A DNA construct DO3.44 encoding the complete amino acid sequence of human S100β flanked by 16 and 650 nucleotides of 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences, respectively, was assembled by joining the cDNA clone KN3 (32Allore R.

A control DNA construct DO3.5 was assembled by joining DO2 with KN3 in the reverse orientation. The two constructs were inserted into the pECE expression vector (34Ellis J. Clauser E. Morgan D.O.

Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) to derive plasmids pPDO3.44 (directing the expression of S100β mRNA) and pPDO3.5 (control). The reporter plasmids β-MHC-CAT, skACT-CAT, and α-MHC-CAT in which the respective rat β-MHC, skACT, and α-MHC promoters are joined to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), and RSV-LUX, in which a luciferase (LUX) reporter gene is constitutively driven by the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) long terminal repeat, as well as the expression plasmids SRα-PKCβ (specifying wild-type β-PKC) and SRα-ΔPKCβ (specifying a constitutively active β-PKC) (18Kariya K.

Neonatal cardiac myocytes were isolated from the ventricles of 2-day old Sprague-Dawley rats and established in primary culture as described (8Simpson P.C. Circ.

Transfection was carried out by CaPO4 precipitation (18Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10023-10026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the specific quantities of the following plasmids: β-MHC-CAT or skACT-CAT, 2 pmol (9 μg); RSV-LUX, 0.02 pmol (0.1 μg); pECE, pPDO3.44 or pPDO3.5, 2 pmol (9 μg); SRα-PKCβ or SRα-ΔPKCβ, 0.2 pmol (1 μg), as indicated in legends. Myocyte cultures were maintained in medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum for 18 h following transfection, prior to transfer to serum-free medium and treatment with NE (20 μm), PE (20 μm), or vehicle (100 μm ascorbic acid) for 48 h as specified in legends. The cell lysates were assayed for LUX and CAT activity using published techniques (35De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. De Luca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar, 36Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). Co-transfection with any of the plasmids or treatment of cultures as described above did not affect LUX activity. The differences of the respective LUX and CAT activities between duplicate dishes were <10% of their mean. CAT activity was normalized for transfection efficiency on the basis of LUX activity in the same dish. Treated/control ratios were tested for deviation from unity by calculation of confidence limits. Cardiac myocytes under normoxic conditions were maintained in a well humidified incubator at 37 °C in 1.5% CO2, 98.5% air. Hypoxic conditions were achieved by placing myocyte cultures in an incubator for 18 h, flushed with a gas mixture containing 5% CO2 and 95% N2. RNA was isolated from residual non-infarcted rat left ventricular myocardium outside the territory supplied by the ligated coronary artery by a one-step acid guanidinium phenol method (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63167) Google Scholar). RNase protection assays to determine steady-state levels of skACT mRNA, S100β mRNA, and glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA were performed by modifying published conditions (38Rokosh D.G. Bailey B.A. Stewart A.F.R. Karns L.R. Long C.S. Simpson P.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Antisense riboprobes for the rat S100β (39Dunn R. Landry C. O'Hanlon D. Dunn J. Allore R. Brown I. Marks A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3562-3566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), skACT (a gift from Dr. L. K. Karns, Laboratory of Molecular Neuro-Oncology, University of Virginia Health Sciences, Charlottesville, VA), and GAPDH (Ambion, Austin, TX) were labeled with [α-32]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham, Oakville, Ontario) by in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase of appropriate RNA synthesis vectors. The S100β, skACT, and GAPDH probes (2 ng, 106 dpm) were hybridized with 25 μg (S100β) or 15 μg (skACT, GAPDH) of total RNA from rat heart or brain, or rat tRNA for 18 h at 45 °C and RNase-resistant hybrids were recovered using a commercial kit (Ambion), analyzed on 8m urea, 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels and visualized by autoradiography. RNA was isolated from myocyte cultures (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63167) Google Scholar) and pretreated with RNase-free DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim, Laval, Quebec) prior to first strand cDNA synthesis with random hexamer primers. The primers used for PCR amplification were 5′-TGGACAATGATGGAGACGG-3′ and 5′-ATTAGCTACAACACGGCTGG-3′ located in the coding and 3′-untranslated regions, respectively, of exon 3 of the human S100β gene (indicated in Fig. 2). These primers direct the synthesis of a 210-bp fragment from human but not rat DNA. PCR was performed for 30 cycles, with denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, with an extra 5-min extension for the last cycle. Aliquots of PCR products (10 μl) were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels in 40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Gels were visualized after ethidium bromide staining under UV transillumination. The steady-state levels of skACT and S100β mRNAs were measured in a rat model of myocardial infarction resulting from coronary artery ligation (1Orenstein T.L. Parker T.G. Butany J.W. Goodman J.M. Dawood F. Wen W.-H. Wee L. Martino T. McLaughlin P.R. Liu P.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 858-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The skACT mRNA, normally present in fetal and neonatal, but absent from adult rat myocardium, was re-expressed up to 7 days post-infarction and absent at 21 and 35 days, suggesting a down-regulation of the mRNA (Fig.1 A). S100β mRNA, absent from normal heart, was induced beginning at 7 days and increased up to day 35 post-infarction (Fig. 1 B). GAPDH steady state mRNA levels served as a control for the quality and loading of the mRNA. To investigate a possible functional role for S100β induction in cardiac myocytes surviving infarction, we took advantage of primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (8Simpson P.C. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 884-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). As a first step toward investigating if S100β could modulate pathways associated with hypertrophy in cell culture, we verified the expression of S100β mRNA in cardiac myocytes following transfection with the human S100β expression plasmid pPDO3.44 (Fig.2). Since 3–5% of cultured cardiac myocytes are transfected by exogenous DNA (18Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10023-10026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used RT-PCR to demonstrate that pPDO3.44 directed the expression of human S100β mRNA following transfection (Fig.3). The uptake of co-transfected plasmids by the same competent cells in cardiac myocyte cultures allows the measurement of the modulation of reporter constructs by co-transfected signaling molecules in the setting of low transfection efficiency (18Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10023-10026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Karns L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The use of reporter constructs in which cardiac-specific promoters are fused to CAT and expression vectors specifying putative signaling molecules in this system offers an effective strategy for dissecting the pathways associated with hypertrophy. While signal transduction pathways activated following myocardial infarction are likely to be multifactorial, α1-adrenergic stimulation of cardiac myocyte cultures results in a hypertrophic phenotype involving the reproducible induction of β-MHC and skACT (9Bishopric N.H.

To investigate whether S100β could modulate this specific pathway, we co-transfected cultured myocytes with β-MHC-CAT and pPDO3.44 prior to NE treatment. The approximately 3-fold induction of β-MHC-CAT by NE was inhibited by co-transfection with pPDO3.44, but not by pPDO3.5 or pECE (Fig. 4), suggesting that expression of S100β was responsible for the abrogation of the NE response. S100β had no effect on basal transcription from the β-MHC promoter. In parallel experiments, we showed that co-transfection of pPDO3.44 also inhibited the induction of skACT-CAT by PE (Fig. 5).Figure 5Induction of the skACT promoter by PE is inhibited by co-transfection with an S100β expression vector.Duplicate cultures of cardiac myocytes were co-transfected with plasmids skACT-CAT and RSV-LUX in combination with one of the following plasmids: pECE, pPD03.44, or pPDO3.5, and treated for 48 h with PE or vehicle alone (control).

To establish that S100β blocked the NE or PE activation of the β-MHC or skACT promoters, respectively, by interrupting the PKC signaling pathway, we examined the effect of co-transfection of a constitutively active mutant of β-PKC (ΔPKCβ) and S100β on β-MHC and skACT transcription. Transfection with ΔPKCβ (but not wild type β-PKC) induced the β-MHC and skCAT promoters approximately 2.5-fold (Figs.6 and 7), as described previously (18Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol.

Co-transfection with S100β blocked the induction of β-MHC-CAT and skACT-CAT by ΔPKCβ when the cells were concomitantly treated with NE and PE, respectively, or by increasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration from 2 to 3 mm (Figs. 6 and 7). Since these treatments promote release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (40Eckel J. Gerlach-Eskuchen E. Reinauer H. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1991; 23: 617-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), or increase extracellular Ca2+ influx, and by themselves (i.e. in the absence of co-transfection with S100β) do not block the induction of β-MHC or skACT by ΔPKCβ (data not shown), our results suggest that S100β interruption of the PKC signaling pathway is Ca2+ dependent. In additional experiments, we demonstrated that expression of S100β in cardiac myocytes did not block the induction of the α-MHC promoter by thyroid hormone, a non-PKC mediated signaling pathway (data not shown). This result confirmed the specificity of action of S100β on the PKC signaling pathway in cardiac myocytes and eliminated the possibility of a generalized inhibition of trans-activation.Figure 7Induction of the skACT promoter by a constitutively active β-PKC (ΔPKCβ) is inhibited by co-transfection with an S100β expression vector in the presence of PE or an increased extracellular Ca2+ concentration.Duplicate culture of cardiac myocytes were co-transfected with skACT-CAT and RSV-LUX together with expression plasmids SRα-PKCβ (specifying wild type β-PKC) or SRα-ΔPKCβ (specifying a constitutive active β-PKC) and, in addition, where shown, with pECE or pPDO3.44. As indicated, in some experiments, cultures co-transfected with pPDO3.44 were concomitantly treated with PE (20 μm) or exposed to a higher extracellular Ca2+ concentration (increased from 2 to 3 mm) for 48 h following transfection. Bars denote mean ± S.E. of a ratio of CAT activities of experimental to control cultures (co-transfected with the expression vector SRα, skACT-CAT, and RSV-LUX, and treated with vehicle) (set at 1.0) of four independent experiments.

Hypoxia induced the β-MHC promoter approximately 2.5-fold with β-MHC transcription returning to baseline following 24 h of re-exposure to normal oxygen tension (Fig.8). S100β overexpression significantly attenuated the hypoxic induction of the β-MHC promoter to approximately 1.3-fold over baseline. Confirming no effect on basal transcription, S100β did not alter β-MHC promoter activity under either normoxic conditions or following hypoxia with subsequent re-oxygenation. Hypoxia did not result in cellular necrosis as myocyte numbers in culture remained unchanged during the time course of these experiments (data not shown). Acute myocardial infarction remains the leading cause of death in the developed world.

https://openalex.org/W2091746347,"Abstract Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is an abundant platelet α-granule heparin-binding protein. We have previously shown that PF4 accelerates up to 25-fold the proteolytic conversion of protein C to activated protein C by the thrombin·thrombomodulin complex by increasing its affinity for protein C 30-fold. This stimulatory effect requires presence of the γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain in protein C and is enhanced by the presence of a chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) domain on thrombomodulin. We hypothesized that cationic PF4 binds to both protein C and thrombomodulin through these anionic domains. Qualitative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of avidin extracts of solutions containing biotinylated PF4 and candidate ligands shows that PF4 binds to GAG+ but not GAG− forms of thrombomodulin and native but not Gla-domainless protein C. Quantitative analysis using the surface plasmon resonance-based BIAcoreTM biosensor system confirms the extremely high affinity of PF4 for heparin (K D = 4 nm) and shows that PF4 binds to GAG+ thrombomodulin with aK D of 31 nm and to protein C with aK D of 0.37 μm. In contrast, PF4 had no measurable interaction with GAG− thrombomodulin or Gla-domainless protein C. Western blot analysis of normal human plasma extracted with biotinylated PF4 demonstrates PF4 binding to protein C in a physiologic context. Thus, PF4 binds with relative specificity and high affinity to the GAG− domain of thrombomodulin and the Gla domain of protein C. These interactions may enhance the affinity of the thrombin·thrombomodulin complex for protein C and thereby promote the generation of activated protein C."

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome predicts only three proteins with canonical Ran binding domains. Mutation of one of these, YRB1, results in defects in transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope (Schlenstedt, G., Wong, D. H., Koepp, D. M., and Silver, P. A.

The second one, encoded byYRB2, is a 327-amino acid protein with a Ran binding domain at its C terminus and an internal cluster of FXFG and FG repeats conserved in nucleoporins. Yrb2p is located inside the nucleus, and this localization relies on the N terminus. Results of both genetic and biochemical analyses show interactions of Yrb2p with the Ran nucleotide exchanger Prp20p/Rcc1. Yrb2p binding to Gsp1p (yeast Ran) as well as to a novel 150-kDa GTP-binding protein is also detected. The Ran binding domain of Yrb2p is essential for function and for its association with Prp20p and the GTP-binding proteins.

In yeast, YRB1 is essential for cell growth, and temperature-sensitive mutants display nuclear transport defects (46Schlenstedt G. Wong D.H. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A.

Some portion of Yrb1p is located at the nuclear envelope and may provide a “docking” site for Ran at the nuclear pore complex (46Schlenstedt G. Wong D.H. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5367-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, Yrb1p was also identified in a screen for mutants of yeast with destabilized chromosomes (47Ouspenski I.I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1975-1978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), thus supporting the notion that there may be additional functions for Gsp1p and its regulators. Only two additional yeast proteins, Yrb2p and Nup2p, contain predicted Ran binding domains (48Hartmann E. Görlich D.

Cell. 1993; 4: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Nup2p is dispensable for normal yeast cell growth (52Loeb J.D.J. Davis L.I. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One possibility is that Nup2p and Yrb1p play redundant roles as Ran-docking sites. Yrb2p was identified as an open reading frame encoding a protein with similarity to the other Ran binding proteins (46Schlenstedt G. Wong D.H. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5367-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The YRB2 coding sequence predicts a 36-kDa protein of 327 amino acids in length with the Ran binding domain at the C terminus. In addition, Yrb2p is predicted to contain two FXFG and three FG amino acid repeats that are typically found in nucleoporins. At its N terminus, Yrb2p is rich in charged and hydrophilic amino acids with several potential phosphorylation sites and short sequences similar to NLSs. Unlike Yrb1p, cells missing Yrb2p are viable except at low temperatures and show no obvious defects in nuclear transport (53Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Nakashima N. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because of its similarity to Yrb1p and the important role of Ran-regulators in nuclear function, we now present results concerning the function of Yrb2p that appear to distinguish it from Yrb1p. Yrb2p is primarily localized in the nucleus. In addition, Yrb2p interacts and functions with Prp20p, based on both biochemical and genetic experiments.

Positions of oligonucleotides used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are described by numbers when A of the initiation codon is positioned as +1. The YRB2 gene was cloned by inserting two PCR fragments generated with yeast genomic DNA as a template into pBluescriptKS(+) (Stratagene). Primers used for PCR were: GS59 (−654 to −636 with a KpnI site, 5′-CTGCCGATCTGGTACCACC-3′), GS64 (an antisense primer, 109 to 88, 5′-CCCTCGGTCTCTTAGGAGTTCC-3′), GS61 (1 to 20 with a BamHI site, 5′-CGGGATCCATGAGTGAGACCAATGGTGG-3′), and GS60 (an antisense primer, 1080 to 1062 with a XbaI site, 5′-GCTCTAGACGGGGTCCAGGGTGCGACC-3′). After generating 0.75- and 1.08-kb PCR fragments with the combinations of GS59/GS64 and GS61/GS60, respectively, the DNA was treated with KpnI andPstI (for GS59/GS64) or PstI and XbaI (GS61/GS60), and both fragments were inserted together intoKpnI-XbaI sites of pBluescriptKS(+) to yield pPS842. For YRB2 expression in yeast cells, pPS844 and pPS848 were constructed as follows: a KpnI-XbaI 1.73-kb fragment prepared from pPS842 or aBamHI-XbaI double digested 1.08-kb PCR fragment prepared with GS61/GS60 and genomic DNA as template (see above) were inserted into KpnI-XbaI sites of a CEN URA3 vector, pRS316 (58; for pPS844 construction), orBamHI-XbaI sites of a 2μ URA3 pGALvector, pPS293 (59; for pPS848). Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged YRB2(YRB2::HA) plasmids were prepared by placing the tag between the 6th and 7th codons of YRB2 using the two additional primers TT7 (5′-CCGCTCGAGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGGCAATGCAGCCAGGG-3′), which carries a XhoI site and the HA coding sequence followed by 19 to 34 nucleotides of YRB2 coding sequence, and TT8 (5′-CCGCTCGAGACCATTGGTCTCACTCATGC-3′), a primer carrying aXhoI site followed by an anti-coding sequence of 18 to −2. pPS842 was used as a template for PCR with GS59/TT8 and TT7/GS60 to produce 0.67- and 1.10-kb fragments, respectively. After digestion withKpnI and AvaI (for GS59-TT8 fragment) orAvaI and XbaI (for TT7-GS60), the fragments were inserted into the KpnI-XbaI sites of pRS316 to yield pPS1081. YRB2::HA fragment amplified from pPS1081 with TT9 (5′-CGGGATCCATGAGTGAGACCAATGG-3′), a primer with a BamHI site and the first 17 bases of theYRB2 coding region, and GS60 was cloned into pPS293 usingBamHI and XbaI sites to generate pPS1082. A 1.08-kb YRB2 fragment generated for the construction of pPS848 was placed on the 3′ end of GST (encoding glutathioneS-transferase gene) of pPS892 (13Koepp D.M. Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1163-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) by usingBamHI-XbaI sites to yield pPS1083. 471 with aEcoRI site (5′-CGGAATTCAACATACTGAAAAAC-3′), TT14; anti-coding of 588–572 with a SmaI site (5′-TCCCCCGGGTTTTGGTTTGTCTTTTG-3′), TT15; 982–1000 with aSmaI site (5′-TCCCCCGGGTAAGTAAAGAGAAATAACG-3′). After treatment of the PCR fragments with proper restriction enzymes (AvaI and EcoRI for the TT7-TT21 fragment,EcoRI and XbaI for TT17-GS60, AvaI for the TT7-TT14, AvaI and XbaI for TT15-GS60), fragments were ligated into XhoI-XbaI digested pPS1081 to replace YRB2 with the truncated genes. For construction of a YRB2 chimeric gene with the Yrb1p Ran binding domain, we produced two PCR fragments. A 0.50-kb fragment, carrying HA followed codons 7 to 157 of YRB2, was generated with primers TT7 and TT18 (anti-coding of 471 to 451 with an EcoRI site, 5′-CGGAATTCGTTTTTCAGTATGTTGAAGCC-3′) and with pPS842 as a template. A 0.53-kb PCR fragment was obtained with TT19 (anEcoRI primer which codes codons 30 to 34 of YRB1, 5′-CGGAATTCGGTGGTAAGAAGGCCG-3′), TT20 (a SmaI primer carrying anti-coding sequence of codons 194 to 201 of YRB1, 5′-CCCCCGGGAGCCTTTTTGTTGATTTCTTGAG-3′), and pPS849 (46Schlenstedt G. Wong D.H. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5367-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) as a template. After digestion of both fragments with AvaI andEcoRI, we replaced the YRB2 part of pPS1086 (ΔC) with these fragments by using XhoI-SmaI sites that were treated with AvaI to yield pPS1087. Allyrb2 deletion mutants and the chimeric gene were recloned into pPS293 to make these genes galactose inducible (GAL-ΔN, pPS1088; GAL-ΔNup, pPS1089;GAL-ΔC, pPS1090; GAL-Chimera, pPS1091) and into pPS892 to produce GST-tagged versions (GST-ΔN, pPS1092; GST-ΔNup, pPS1093; GST-ΔC, pPS1094; GST-Chimera, pPS1095). All PCR reactions for plasmid constructions were carried out with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) or Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). YRB2was deleted as described by Baudin et al. (60Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A 1.10-kb DNA fragment, which carries theHIS3 gene as well as 46 bases flanking regions of theYRB2 open reading frame, was generated by PCR. The resulting fragment was introduced into diploid cells (PSY878; Ref. 13Koepp D.M. Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1163-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), andHIS + transformants were selected. Colonies carrying HIS3 integrations at YRB2 were screened by PCR with GS59 and a HIS3 internal primer (5′-GCCTCATCCAAAGGCGC-3′). The integration was then confirmed by Southern blotting. Yeast cells were grown in complete media or selective media containing 2% (w/v) glucose to a density of 1–5 × 107 cells/ml. For expression of genes under control of the GAL promoter, cells were grown in selective media containing 2% raffinose to a density of 0.5–2 × 107 cells/ml, then galactose was added to 2% (w/v), and induction was conducted for 2–4 h. Cells were fixed by treatment with 1/10 volume of 37% formaldehyde for 60–90 min and prepared for immunofluorescence as described previously (46Schlenstedt G. Wong D.H. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5367-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was used at 1/4000 dilution in 5% bovine serum albumin with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) were used at 1/1000 dilution. Poly (A)+ mRNA was localized using a protocol from Amberg et al. (32Amberg D.C. Goldstein A.L. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1173-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) with some modifications (59Lee M.S. Henry M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1233-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Cells containing plasmids expressing GST protein fusions were induced by addition of 2% galactose for 2–4 h. Procedures for purification were based on our previous report (46Schlenstedt G. Wong D.H. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5367-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) with modifications and carried out at 4 °C if not otherwise mentioned. After harvesting, cells were washed twice with Buffer A (20 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 0.25 msorbitol, 150 mm KOAc, 5 mmMg(OAc)2), frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C before use. Cells were resuspended into PBSMT + PI (PBS, 3 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, and each 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, leupeptin, antipain, and chymostatin), mixed with glass beads (about half the volume of cell suspension), and disrupted. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, protein concentration of the lysate was determined with protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The resulting cell lysate was mixed with glutathione-conjugated agarose beads (Glutathione-Sepharose 4B, 50% slurry, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and incubated for 1–2 h. Nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs (5′-guanylyl imidodiphosphate, GMPPNP, Sigma) or GDP analogs (guanosine 5′-O-2-(thio)diphospate, GDPβS, Sigma) were added to the lysate at 1 mm prior to the mixing with glutathione beads if necessary. Beads were washed twice with PBSMT+PI and twice with PBSM (PBS, 3 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2). Proteins bound to the beads were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer (61; bound fraction). Supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min (unbound fraction). Binding assays with Ntf2p-agarose beads (62Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3755-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were carried out essentially by the same procedure as for GST-tagged proteins. Cell lysates with or without 1 mm nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs were mixed with Ntf2p-agarose and incubated for 1 h. After washing the beads, both bound and unbound fractions were prepared as described above. Proteins were separated with 10 or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (61Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and stained with silver nitrate (56Ausubel F.M.

In the present study, we have characterized the signaling pathways induced by anti-CD5 stimulation in human T lymphocytes. In T lymphocytes, anti-CD5 co-stimulation enhances the phytohemagglutinin/anti-CD28-induced interleukin-2 (IL-2) mRNA accumulation 1.6-fold and IL-2 protein secretion 2.2-fold, whereby the up-regulation is mediated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. The CD5 signaling pathway up-regulates the IL-2 gene expression by increasing the DNA binding and transactivation activity of activator protein 1 but affects none of the other transcription factors like nuclear factor of activated T cells, nuclear factor κB, Oct, and CD28-responsive complex/nuclear factor of mitogen-activated T cells involved in the regulation of the IL-2 promoter activity. The CD5-induced increase of the activator protein 1 activity is mediated through the activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent (CaM) kinase type IV, and is independent of the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p38/Mpk2, and calcium/calmodul-independent kinase type II. The expression of a dominant negative mutant of CaM kinase IV in T lymphocytes transfected with an IL-2 promoter-driven reporter construct completely abrogates the response to CD5 stimulation, indicating that CaM kinase IV is essential to the CD5 signaling pathway. In addition, it is demonstrated that calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase type IV is also involved in the stabilization of the IL-2 transcripts, which is observed after co-stimulation of phytohemagglutinin/anti-CD28 activated T lymphocytes with anti-CD5.

The cytoplasmic domain of CD5 possesses no intrinsic enzymatic activities; however, it does contain a potential tyrosine kinase phosphorylation motif (YX 11YXX) also present in the TCR ζ and CD3 chains (4Beyers A.D.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2862-2870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This motif contains two tyrosine residues that can serve as docking sites for Src homology 2 domain containing proteins once they have been phosphorylated (11Raab M. Yamamoto M. Rudd C.E. Mol. Cell.

Upon engagement of the TCR/CD3 complex by ligand, the cytoplasmic domain of CD5 becomes rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues similar to the TCR ζ chain (5Burgess K.E. Yamamoto M. Prasad K.V.S.

The protein tyrosine kinase p56 lck , which is associated with CD4 or CD8 (18Rudd C.E. Janssen O. Prasad K.V.S. Raab M. da Silva A. Telfer J.C. Yamamoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 239-266PubMed Google Scholar), seems to be responsible for this phosphorylation. It has also been demonstrated that p56 lck binds to the cytoplasmic domain of CD5 through its Src homology 2 domain and becomes fully activated once bound to CD5, probably by autophosphorylation (11Raab M. Yamamoto M. Rudd C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2862-2870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the targets of p56 lck are unknown, it remains unclear how CD5 generates the increase of intracellular Ca2+. It seems likely that p56 lck directly or indirectly activates an effector protein that will induce the activation of Ca2+-specific ion channels in the membrane, resulting in the influx of Ca2+, similar to the epidermal growth factor- and platelet-derived growth factor-induced Ca2+ influx, which is mediated through the small Ras-related GTPase Rac1 (19Peppelenbosch M.P.

The expression of the IL-2 gene is tightly controlled by the 300-base pair promoter (21Durand D.B. Shaw J.-P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belagaje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), which contains several well defined binding sites for both ubiquitous and T cell-specific transcription factors, including NFAT, NFκB, AP-1, Oct, and CD28RC/NF-MAT (22Jain J.

AP-1, which is a heterodimer composed of different fos andjun family members can bind to the IL-2 promoter alone or complexed with NFAT1 (25Jain J. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. J.

The AP-1 activity is regulated both at the level of fos and jun gene transcription and by post-translational modifications of the fos andjun proteins. The MAP kinases Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Fos-regulating kinase stimulate the transcriptional activity of c-jun and c-fos, respectively, by phosphorylation of the transactivation domains (28Deng T. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 371: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 29Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.W. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I.

The AP-1 proteins are also involved in the regulation of the IL-2 promoter through the proximal Oct site. At this site, fosand jun family members cooperate functionally with different octamer proteins, like the ubiquitous factor Oct-1 and the lymphoid-specific factor Oct-2. It has been shown that the binding offos and jun proteins to this site is induced via a signal transduction route involving the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent, cyclosporin A-sensitive phosphatase calcineurin (39Pfeuffer I. Klein-Hessling S. Heinfling A. Chuvpilo S. Escher C. Brabletz T. Hentsch B. Schwarzenbach H. Matthias P. Serfling E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5572-5585PubMed Google Scholar, 40Ullman K.S. Northrop J.P.

Our results in the present study demonstrate that CD5 signaling regulates the IL-2 gene expression through the AP-1 binding site in the IL-2 promoter and through stabilization of the IL-2 mRNA. Most interestingly, we found that the CD5 signaling pathway involves the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase type IV, which mediates the effects of the CD5 signal at the transcriptional level as well as at the post-transcriptional level. Human peripheral blood cells were obtained from healthy volunteer platelet donors, and mononuclear cell suspensions were prepared by Ficoll-Hypaque (Lymphoprep; Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) density gradient centrifugation. T lymphocytes were isolated by 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide-treated sheep red blood cell rosetting. The sheep red blood cells were lysed with 155 mmNH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm EDTA according to standard procedures. The remaining cell preparations contained more than 98% T lymphocytes as assessed by flow cytometric analysis after staining with an anti-CD2 monoclonal antibody (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) and less than 1% CD14-positive cells (Becton Dickinson). After isolation, T lymphocytes were kept overnight at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) containing 2% fetal calf serum (FCS; HyClone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 6 ng/ml colistin. Human T lymphocytes (5 × 106/ml) were incubated for various time periods with 2 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA; Sigma), in combination with a monoclonal antibody against CD28 (a gift from Dr. R. van Lier, Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) used at a final concentration of 5% hybridoma culture supernatant and/or a monoclonal antibody against CD5 (83-P2E6; MCA Development, Groningen, The Netherlands) also used at 5% hybridoma culture supernatant. Anti-CD3 (WT32; Division of Clinical Immunology, University of Groningen, The Netherlands) was also used at a final concentration of 5% hybridoma culture supernatant. Various inhibitors were added 30–60 min before stimulation: PD98059 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), an inhibitor of MEK1, was used at a final concentration of 10 μm; SB203580 (a gift from Dr. J.C. Lee, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, PA), a p38/Mpk2 inhibitor, was used at a final concentration of 1 μm; and KN-62 (AleXis Corporation, Läufelfingen, Switzerland), an inhibitor of CaM kinases, was used at a final concentration of 10 μm. Human T lymphocytes (3 × 106/ml) were stimulated with PHA alone or PHA in combination with anti-CD28 in the presence or the absence of anti-CD5 for 24 h. Co-stimulations of anti-CD3 with anti-CD28 for 24 h in the presence or the absence of anti-CD5 were also performed. Inhibitors were added 30 min before stimulation. Secreted IL-2 protein was quantified in cell-free supernatants using a human IL-2 ELISA kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as recommended by the manufacturer. Total cellular RNA from 15 × 107 human T lymphocytes stimulated with PHA alone or PHA in combination with anti-CD28 in the presence or the absence of anti-CD5 for 6 h was isolated using the guanidium isothiocyanate/cesium chloride method (42Vellenga E. Rambaldi A. Ernst R.J. Ostapovicz D. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1988; 71: 1529-1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KN-62 was added 1 h prior to stimulation. To determine the mRNA stability, half-life studies were performed by adding actinomycin D (Boehringer Mannheim) to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml after 6 h of stimulation with PHA and anti-CD28 in the presence or the absence of anti-CD5. 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the addition of actinomycin D, total cellular RNA of the T lymphocytes was isolated. 20-μg samples of total cellular RNA were size fractionated on 1.1% agarose gels with 2.2m formaldehyde and blotted onto nylon membranes (Qiabrane Nylon Plus, QiaGen, Chatsworth, CA) (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) using the oligolabeling kit (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. The following cDNA probes were used: 1) the 0.8-kilobase pair PvuII insert of human IL-2 cDNA purified from the pGEM-T plasmid (a gift from Dr. E. G. E. de Vries, Division of Medical Oncology, University of Groningen, The Netherlands) and 2) the EcoRI-linearized pBR322 plasmid containing a 7.8-kilobase pair human 28 S cDNA insert. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C for 18 h in 0.5m Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 1 mmEDTA, 7% SDS. Membranes were washed once in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS; once in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS; and finally in 0.3 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C. mRNA levels were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). mRNA levels were normalized with respect to the 28 S signal. 5 × 106 T lymphocytes were incubated for 15 min with 2.5 μm Fluo-3/AM (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and subsequently stimulated with either PHA plus anti-CD28 or PHA with anti-CD28 plus anti-CD5 in the presence or the absence of KN-62. KN-62 was added 1 h prior to stimulation. The fluorescence of Fluo-3 was measured in time with a AMINCOBOWMAN® Series 2 Luminescence spectrometer (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL) (excitation wavelength = 488 nm; emission wavelength = 526 nm). The stimuli were added at time 0. The fluorescence of Fluo-3 is a measure for the intracellular calcium concentrations. Nuclear extracts of stimulated T lymphocytes were prepared by a modification of the method described by Park et al. (44Park J. Yaseen N.R. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Sharma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20653-20659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 12 × 107 T lymphocytes were stimulated with PHA in combination with anti-CD28 in the presence or the absence of anti-CD5 for 2 h. KN-62 was added 1 h prior to stimulation. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended to 12.5 × 108 cells/ml in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 1 mm DTT) (45Dignam J.P. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

After a 10-min incubation on ice, cells were lysed by adding Nonidet P-40 (Boehringer Mannheim) to a final concentration of 0.05% and incubated for another 7 min on ice. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 500 ×g for 5 min by 4 °C. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in 45 μl of buffer C, a high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm DTT) (45Dignam J.P. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

The suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min with regular shaking to extract the nuclear proteins and finally spun down in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. The supernatants containing the extracted nuclear proteins were divided in small aliquots and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration of the nuclear extracts was determined by the Bradford assay (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The sequences of the synthetic oligonucleotides containing the binding sequences of the human IL-2 promoter used in the gel shift assays were as follows: NFAT, 5′-GGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGT-3′ (corresponding to positions −286 to −257 in the human IL-2 promoter); AP-1, 5′-AAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAGA-3′ (positions −160 to −140); Oct, 5′-TTTGAAAATATGTGTAATATGTAAAACAT-3′ (positions −97 to −69); NFκB, 5′-AACAAAGAGGGATTTCACCTACAT-3′ (positions −213 to −190); and CD28 response element, 5′-gatcGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAA-3′ (positions −168 to −151) (40Ullman K.S.

Annealing of the two strands was performed by heating the mixture for 2 min at 90 °C and slow cooling to room temperature. 12 μg of nuclear extract were incubated with 0.1–0.2 ng of double-stranded labeled oligonucleotide in 15 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.06 mm EDTA, 0.6 mm DTT, 2 mmspermidine, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 2 μg (NFAT, AP-1, Oct and NFκB) or 5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (CD28 response element). The binding reaction was performed for 20 min at 26 °C. In competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was preincubated with the nuclear extract for 10 min on ice prior to the addition of the labeled oligonucleotide. The samples were loaded onto a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA and run for 1 h at 140 V.

The reporter plasmid pX3-CAT (referred to as pCAT-3×AP-1/IL2 in this report; also a gift from Dr. C. L. Verweij) contains three copies of the distal AP-1 site in front of the minimal SV40 promoter. The empty pCAT3 enhancer plasmid and the pCAT3 control reporter plasmid (Promega) served as negative and positive controls in the transfection assays. The dominant negative CaMK IV was constructed using the previously described constitutively active Thr196 → Ala form of CaMK IV cloned into the XbaI-NotI restriction sites of pME18s (52Tokumitsu H.

The nucleotide sequence of the mutant was confirmed by automated sequencing using the Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer. Resting primary T cells are refractory to conventional transfection methods; subsequently it was necessary to use a prestimulation method (55Park J.-H. Kaushansky K. Levitt L. J. Biol.

Purified human T lymphocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics, supplemented with PHA at 1 μg/ml and recombinant human IL-2 (Cetus, Emoryville, CA) at 100 units/ml. After 2 days of culture, the nonadherent cells were harvested, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics, supplemented with only recombinant human IL-2 at 100 units/ml. The T cells were incubated for 2 more days, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and used for transient transfection assays. 15 × 106 T lymphocytes were resuspended in 400 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine, antibiotics, and 100 units/ml IL-2, and either 20 μg (1 μg/μl) of reporter plasmid DNA or 15 μg of reporter plasmid DNA plus 15 μg of expression plasmid DNA was added.

https://openalex.org/W2131162385,"Cyclic nucleotide binding activates cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, but the molecular mechanism is unknown. In the present studies, cGMP binding to type Iα or type Iβ cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) caused (i) a large electronegative charge shift of each enzyme on ion exchange chromatography, (ii) an increase in the Stokes radius (>3 Å) of each enzyme, and (iii) a decreased mobility of type Iβ PKG on native gel electrophoresis. These physical changes were not detected in the monomeric form of type Iβ PKG upon activation by cGMP. However, the results of partial proteolysis of type Iα PKG revealed some degree of cGMP-induced conformational change within the PKG-monomer, since cGMP binding protects the PKG-monomer against chymotryptic cleavage. The altered sensitivity to proteolysis occurs at Met-200, which is located between the B and C α-helices in the high affinity site (site A), and implies that the cGMP-induced structural perturbations in this region may participate in activation of dimeric PKG. The cGMP-induced conformational effects observed using the physical separation methods are likely to reflect altered interactions within the dimeric PKG that are caused by structural alterations within the subunits.

Protein kinases catalyze the transfer of the γ-phosphate of ATP to serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues on many cellular proteins and play key roles in regulating such diverse physiological processes as metabolism, gene expression, cell growth, cell differentiation, cardiac and skeletal muscle contraction, smooth muscle function, and synaptic transmission. Most serine/threonine- or tyrosine-specific protein kinases are activated by allosteric ligand binding (e.g. cAMP, cGMP, calcium, insulin, epidermal growth factor), but the molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of the protein kinases by ligands are largely unknown. It has been suggested that maintenance of a low basal activity results from intramolecular interactions between the autoinhibitory domains of the kinases and their catalytic sites (1Corbin J.D.

The binding of activating allosteric ligands could induce conformational changes that relieve autoinhibition, thus activating the protein kinases, but there is little evidence to support such conformational changes. Since many regulatory and catalytic features of protein kinases have been conserved throughout evolution, it is possible that the molecular events that lead to the relief of autoinhibition of protein kinases upon binding of an activating ligand may be similar. Two homologous serine/threonine-specific protein kinases, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) 1The abbreviations used are: PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (the term PKG-dimer is used to denote the holoenzyme containing the the two dimerized polypeptide chains; the term PKG-monomer is used to denote a single polypeptide chain containing the catalytic and regulatory domains but with the dimerization domain deleted); PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; RIIα, regulatory subunit of type IIα PKA; 8-Br-PET-cGMP, β-phenyl-1-N 2-etheno-8-bromo-cGMP; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), are major intracellular mediators for cGMP and cAMP actions. However, the activation mechanism of these enzymes by cyclic nucleotide binding is poorly understood. A number of studies have suggested that binding of cyclic nucleotides to these kinases induces a conformational change that relieves autoinhibition, thereby activating the catalytic site of the respective kinase (1Corbin J.D.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9921-9928Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For instance, the proteolytic sensitivities of the autoinhibitory domains in type I PKGs are increased markedly in the presence of cGMP (7Francis S.H. Smith J.A. Colbran J.L. Grimes K. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20748-20755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which suggests that a conformational change has occurred that increases the solvent exposure of this region. Studies of the type Iα PKG using far-ultraviolet circular dichroism suggest that cGMP binding to the enzyme causes changes in the circular dichroism spectra that are consistent with the induction of β-sheet elements from random coil (8Landgraf W. Hofmann F. Pelton J.T. Huggins J.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9921-9928Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The circular dichroism studies were performed at very high concentrations of PKG and cGMP, which greatly exceed their physiological levels (16Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 26: 115-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The physical changes that accompany activation of a ligand-regulated protein kinase using concentrations of enzyme that approach physiological levels have not been assessed. Such structural changes can be studied using type I PKGs, since they are available as highly purified soluble enzymes. In addition, the regulatory and catalytic domains of PKG reside on a single polypeptide chain, which is typical of other members of the protein kinase family. Consequently, studies of conformational changes in PKG upon activation by cGMP may relate to the structural events that accompany the activation mechanisms utilized by other protein kinases. Insights into the activation of PKG may be particularly pertinent to PKA activation, since the overall domain structures of PKA and PKG are quite similar, and cyclic nucleotide binding may cause similar molecular perturbations in each protein kinase. In mammalian tissues, two major isozymes of PKG, termed type I and type II, have been identified, and these derive from separate genes. The type I isozyme has at least two isoforms, designated Iα and Iβ, and these isoforms are the products of alternative mRNA splicing (9Lincoln T.M. Thompson M. Cornwell T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17632-17637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol.

Each of these subunits contains several domains of well defined functions. The regulatory component is located in the amino-terminal segment of PKG, which includes the dimerization domain, the autoinhibitory domain containing multiple autophosphorylation sites, and two homologous cGMP-binding sites that are arranged in tandem. The cGMP-binding sites in the primary sequence are followed by the catalytic component, which contains the MgATP and protein substrate binding sites (15Hofmann F. Dostmann W. Keilbach A. Landgraf W. Ruth P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 26: 115-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the two type I isoforms differ only in their amino-terminal ∼100 residues, in which they share only 36% identity (17Sandberg M. Natarajan V. Ronander I. Kalderon D. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. Jahnsen T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although the cyclic nucleotide-binding sites in type Iα and type Iβ PKG have identical amino acid sequences, the two isoforms show very different cGMP binding properties, suggesting that the amino termini affect the binding of cGMP to the enzymes (10Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Sekhar K.R. Hatchett R.J. Shabb J.B. Wolfe L. Francis S.H. Wells J.N. Jastorff B. Butt E.

To examine possible conformational changes that are associated with the process of activation of the PKG by cGMP, four approaches have been used: (i) ion exchange chromatography, which resolves proteins based on their surface charges; (ii) gel filtration chromatography, which resolves proteins based on their masses and shapes; (iii) native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which provides resolution based on both the surface charges and shapes of proteins; and (iv) partial proteolysis, which reveals alterations in structure based on the susceptibility of PKG to selective digestion by proteases. Purified type Iα and type Iβ PKG have been used for these studies, since features that are central to the regulatory and catalytic mechanisms are likely to be conserved in these homologous kinases. The present studies showed that cGMP binding to PKG produces distinct conformational changes in the enzyme as evidenced by increased surface electronegativity, a larger Stokes radius, decreased mobility on native gel electrophoresis, and altered susceptibility to proteases. These results agree well with those reported in the accompanying manuscript (40Zhao J. Trewhella J. Corbin J. Francis S. Mitchell R. Brushia R. Walsh D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and complement that study. Bovine lung type Iα and bovine aorta type Iβ PKG were purified to homogeneity as described by Francis et al. (20Francis S.H. Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of PKG was determined by the phosphocellulose paper assay using heptapeptide substrate (RKRSRAE) as described previously (10Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dimeric regulatory subunit of bovine heart type IIα PKA (RIIα) was purified according to the method of Corbin et al. (1Corbin J.D. Sugden P.H. West L. Flockhart D.A. Lincoln T.M. McCarthy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3997-4003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding activity of RIIα was measured by a [3H]cAMP binding assay as described previously (21Rannels S.R. Beasley A. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Urea denaturation of RIIα to remove cyclic nucleotides was performed as described by Poteet-Smithet al. (22Poteet-Smith C.E. Shabb J.B. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Like native RIIα, this urea-treated cAMP-free RIIα exhibited two active cAMP-binding sites, inhibited the catalytic subunit of PKA stoichiometrically, and had a dimeric structure as verified by determination of its sedimentation coefficient. The cyclic nucleotide contents of the purified proteins were determined using the modified version of the cyclic nucleotide assay described by Corbin et al. (23Corbin J.D. Gettys T.W. Blackmore P.F. Beebe S.J. Francis S.H. Glass D.B. Redmon J.B. Sheorain V. Landiss L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified proteins were placed in a boiling water bath for 2 h and then centrifuged for 7 min in a Beckman Microfuge B. The resulting supernatant fractions were removed and chilled on ice, and the concentrations of cAMP and cGMP of these supernatants were measured by PKA and PKG activation assays. For RIIα, 0.5 m HCl was added to the protein for a final concentration of 13.8 mmbefore boiling, and the supernatant was neutralized by adding the same volume of 1 m K2HPO4 as the volume of HCl added. The sample was then diluted ∼10-fold with H2O to lower the ionic strength for the assay. Purified PKG was incubated with unlabeled cGMP (∼500-fold excess of cGMP-binding sites) at 4 °C overnight to assure full saturation of the cGMP-binding sites of the enzyme. For native gel electrophoresis experiments, purified PKG was incubated with unlabeled cGMP or cGMP analog, β-phenyl-1,N 2-etheno-8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-PET-cGMP), as described above to obtain cyclic nucleotide-bound PKG. Because type Iα and type Iβ PKG have quite different affinities for DEAE-Sephacel resin, different salt gradients were used to elute the enzymes (10Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified PKG that had been preincubated in the absence or presence of cGMP was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (0.9 × 10 cm) equilibrated in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol (KPEM) at 4 °C. The column was washed with 30 ml of KPEM containing 0.12 m (for type Iα PKG) or 0.17 m (for type Iβ PKG) NaCl. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient (200 ml) of NaCl (0.12–0.24m for type Iα PKG, 0.17–0.24 m for type Iβ PKG) in KPEM, and fractions (4 ml) were collected in silanized tubes containing 100 μl of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml) to minimize protein sticking to the glass. Fractions were assayed for PKG activity as described above to determine the elution position of the enzyme. For experiments utilizing cGMP-bound PKG, the column was preequilibrated with KPEM containing 100 μm cGMP, and the KPEM elution buffer also contained 100 μm cGMP to assure that the cGMP-binding sites of the enzyme remained saturated with cGMP during chromatography. The cGMP concentration in the KPEM buffer was measured by absorbance at 252 nm. Purified PKG that had been preincubated in the absence or presence of cGMP was combined with crystalline catalase (4 mg) in a volume of 500 μl and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 column (0.9 × 168 cm) equilibrated with KPEM buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl at 4 °C. The catalase served as an internal standard for all of the gel chromatographies. The column was eluted with the same buffer, and fractions (1.5 ml) were collected and assayed for PKG activity to determine the elution position of the enzyme. Catalase was located by the absorbance at 280 nm and/or 400 nm. In experiments in which PKG was presaturated with cGMP, the column was saturated with 100 μm cGMP, and the column buffer also contained 100 μm cGMP. Because cGMP in the column buffer interfered with the absorbance at 280 nm, absorbance at 400 nm was used to determine the peak position of catalase for those experiments involving cGMP-bound PKG. To compare the effect of different wavelength absorbances on the elution position of catalase, absorbances at 280 and 400 nm were done for several purified PKG experiments, and there was no difference in the location of the catalase peak. Apparent Stokes radii of purified PKGs in the presence and absence of cGMP were determined by the method described previously (10Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mixtures of protein standards with known Stokes radii (trypsin inhibitor, 24.5 Å; ovalbumin, 30.5 Å; apoferritin, 59.4 Å) were chromatographed on Sephacryl S-300 under identical conditions as described above, and the A 280 orA 400 was measured to generate the standard curve. A standard curve was constructed by plotting (−logK av)½ versus Stokes radius. The equation used to calculate the K av was as follows.Kav=Elution volume−Void volumeInclusion volume−Void volumeEquation 1 The Stokes radii of the PKGs were determined from the standard curve based on elution volume. The sedimentation coefficients of the enzymes were determined using linear sucrose gradients (5–20%) in KPEM containing 0.15 m NaCl in the presence and absence of 100 μm cGMP and proteins of known sedimentation coefficients (catalase, 11.3 S; hemoglobin, 4.6 S) as internal standards as described previously (10Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent molecular weights, frictional ratios, and axial ratios were calculated according to the method of Siegel and Monty (24Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar) together with the procedures of Cohn and Edsall (25Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids, and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold Publishing Corp., New York1943: 424-425Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed on a 9.5% polyacrylamide gel and 4% stacking gel without sodium dodecyl sulfate at 4 °C using constant current (∼10 mA) for 5 h. Proteins were detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. To produce partial proteolysis of purified type Iα PKG, the enzyme (0.17 mg/ml) in 10 mm KPEM containing 0.15 m NaCl was treated with chymotrypsin at 30 °C in the absence or presence of cGMP (10 μm) or cAMP (110 μm). Aliquots were removed at various times and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE to determine patterns of digestion. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For the time courses of partial digestion, the ratio of PKG to chymotrypsin ranged from 350:1 to 50:1 (w/w). For production of the R81-PKG-Iα and the M201-PKG-Iα fragments for physical characterization and amino acid sequence analysis, 150 μg of purified bovine type Iα PKG (in the presence or absence of 110 μm cAMP, respectively) was treated with 3 μg of chymotrypsin for ∼1 h at 30 °C. Chymotrypsin treatment of PKG saturated with either cGMP or cAMP produced the the same pattern of PKG fragments. To purify the fragments for characterization and amino acid sequence, cAMP was used due to its much lower affinity for PKG, thus making it easier to remove from the resulting PKG fragment. The digest was cooled to 4 °C, and an aliquot of [3H]H2O was added prior to chromatography of the sample on a standardized Sephacryl S-200 column (0.9 × 55 cm) in KPEM containing 0.05 m NaCl. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and the resulting fragments were located using 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, [3H]cGMP binding, and protein kinase activity. Amino acid sequences for the R81PKG-Iα (81RKFTKSERSKDL-) and the M201PKG-Iα (201MRTGLIKHTEY-) fragments were determined by the protein microsequencing facility in the Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington (Seattle, WA). Cyclic GMP-binding saturation and the rate of cGMP dissociation was determined as described previously (38Corbin J.D. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11391-11397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using aliquots of the PKG fragments from the Sephacryl S-200 chromatography described above. For studies of [3H]cGMP binding saturation, the enzyme (∼18 μg/ml) in KPEM containing 0.05 m NaCl was incubated in the presence of histone II-AS (1 mg/ml) and [3H]cGMP (0.05–7 μm) at 30 °C for 30 min to promote full labeling of the cGMP binding sites. The mixture was then cooled to 4 °C and incubated for another 20 min prior to removal of aliquots for the 0 t determination using Millipore filtration in the presence of saturated ammonium sulfate as described previously (38Corbin J.D. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11391-11397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For studies of cGMP dissociation, the PKG fragments (∼18 μg/ml) in KPEM containing 0.05 m NaCl were incubated with [3H]cGMP (final concentration, 10 μm; specific activity, 10 mCi/mmol) and histone II-AS (final concentration, 1 mg/ml) as above. Aliquots were then removed for determination of O t binding. A 100-fold excess of unlabeled cGMP was then added, and aliquots were removed at various times and subjected to vacuum filtration using saturated ammonium sulfate. Heptapeptide substrate was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories. Phosphocellulose paper was from Whatman. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. cGMP was obtained from Sigma, and [3H]cGMP was from Amersham Corp. 8-Br-PET-cGMP was from Biolog Life Science Institute. DEAE-Sephacel and Sephacryl S-300 resins were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Bovine serum albumin, bovine liver catalase, soybean trypsin inhibitor, hen egg ovalbumin, chymotrypsin, and bovine hemoglobin were from Sigma. Horse spleen apoferritin was obtained from Calbiochem. Endoproteinase Lys-C was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. The physical effects of cGMP binding and activation of type I PKGs were examined using ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, native gel electrophoresis, and partial proteolysis. Purified PKGs commonly contain some cyclic nucleotides, since the enzymes exist as both cyclic nucleotide-free and cyclic nucleotide-bound forms in tissues (6Wolfe L. Francis S.H. Landiss L.R. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16906-16913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cAMP is added to elute these enzymes from a cAMP-affinity resin during purification (20Francis S.H. Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although extensive efforts were made in the last step of the purifications to remove cyclic nucleotides from the enzymes, it was critical to verify the absence of cyclic nucleotides in PKGs for the present studies. The cAMP and cGMP contents of the purified enzymes were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cyclic nucleotide occupancy of cGMP-binding sites of purified PKGs used for the following experiments was less than 3%. Therefore, these purified type Iα and type Iβ PKGs were considered to be cyclic nucleotide-free forms. To obtain cGMP-bound PKGs, purified enzymes were incubated with a large excess of cGMP, and equal occupation of the two intrasubunit cGMP-binding sites was verified by [3H]cGMP dissociation assays (data not shown). When purified cyclic nucleotide-free type Iα PKG was chromatographed on a DEAE-Sephacel column as described under “Experimental Procedures,” a single peak of PKG activity was obtained (Fig. 1, top panel). When cGMP-bound type Iα PKG was chromatographed in the presence of buffer containing 100 μm cGMP, a single PKG activity peak was also obtained, but this peak eluted at higher ionic strength (Fig.1, bottom panel). This same pattern was also found for the cyclic nucleotide-free and -bound type Iβ PKG isoform (Fig.2). It should be noted that different NaCl gradients were used for these chromatographies, since type Iβ PKG binds more tightly to DEAE than does the type Iα PKG. The increased affinity of the cGMP-bound forms of types Iα and Iβ PKGs for the positively charged DEAE resin indicated that when cyclic nucleotide was bound, the net negative surface charge of these enzymes was increased. This increased electronegativity could be due to a conformational change of these PKGs, which exposes more negatively charged amino acids; alternatively, since the cyclic phosphate of cGMP is negatively charged, the overall negative charge of these enzymes could increase when cGMP binds. The crystal structure of a truncated form of regulatory subunit of the homologous PKA was recently reported (26Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.-H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In this regulatory subunit-cAMP complex, the cyclic phosphate of bound cAMP is not near the surface of the protein. The predicted structure of the cGMP-binding sites of type I PKGs based on the crystal structure of the cAMP-binding domain of the E. colicatabolite gene activator protein (27Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) is similar to the cAMP-binding site of PKA (26Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.-H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 28Weber I.T. Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D.

Therefore, it seems unlikely that the charge shift of the PKGs on the DEAE matrix is due to a direct interaction of the negative charge of the cGMP molecule with the resin. A conformational change produced by cGMP binding, which causes increased net surface electronegativity of the enzymes, is a more plausible explanation.Figure 2Effect of cGMP binding on DEAE-Sephacel chromatography of type Iβ PKG. Either cyclic nucleotide-free enzyme (15 μg, top) or cGMP-bound enzyme (8 μg,bottom) in a volume of ∼50 μl was chromatographed and analyzed as described in Fig. 1. The results are representative of four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cyclic nucleotide-free and cGMP-bound type Iα and type Iβ PKGs were also subjected to gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-300 column in the presence of the internal standard catalase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” It can be seen that the cGMP-bound form of type Iα PKG eluted significantly earlier from the column than did the cGMP-free form (Fig.3), and a similar pattern was obtained for the type Iβ isoform (Fig. 4). These shifts in the elution position of the PKGs could be easily discerned when the PKG kinase activity profile was compared with the elution position of the internal standard catalase. The resolution of proteins using gel filtration chromatography depends on several factors including the mass and overall shape of the molecule, which together confer the Stokes radius of the protein (24Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar, 30Porath J. Flodin P. Nature. 1959; 183: 1657-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). A collection of proteins of known Stokes radii were chromatographed on the same column, and their elution positions were used to generate a standard curve; based on this standard curve, the Stokes radii of the respective cGMP-bound PKGs were calculated to be approximately 3.5 Å larger than that of the cyclic nucleotide-free form for either type Iα or type Iβ PKG (Table I).Figure 4Effect of cGMP binding on Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration chromatography of type Iβ PKG. A mixture of cyclic nucleotide-free enzyme (15 μg, top) and catalase (4 mg) or a mixture of cGMP-bound enzyme (8 μg, bottom) and catalase (4 mg) was chromatographed and analyzed as described in Fig.3.

https://openalex.org/W1980114424,"There is growing evidence that the amino-terminal globular domain of apolipoprotein B (apoB) is essential for lipoprotein particle formation in the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum. To identify the structural requirements for its function in lipoprotein assembly, cysteine (Cys) pairs required to form the seven disulfide bonds within the amino-terminal 21% of apoB were replaced in groups or individually by serine. Substitution of Cys pairs required for formation of disulfide bonds 1–3 or 4–7 (numbered from amino to carboxyl terminus) completely blocked the secretion of apoB28 in transfected HepG2 cells. To identify the specific disulfide bonds required for secretion, Cys pairs were mutated individually. Substitution of Cys pairs required for disulfide bonds 1, 3, 5, 6, or 7 had little or no impact on apoB28 secretion or buoyant density. In contrast, individual substitution of Cys pair 2 (amino acid residues 51 and 70) or 4 (218 and 234) severely inhibited apoB28 secretion and its capacity to undergo intracellular assembly with lipid. The same assembly and secretion defects were observed when these mutations were expressed as part of apoB50. These studies provide direct evidence that the ability of the internal lipophilic regions of apoB to engage in the recruitment and sequestration of lipid during translation is critically dependent upon a structural configuration contained within or affected by the amino-terminal 5% of the protein. There is growing evidence that the amino-terminal globular domain of apolipoprotein B (apoB) is essential for lipoprotein particle formation in the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum. To identify the structural requirements for its function in lipoprotein assembly, cysteine (Cys) pairs required to form the seven disulfide bonds within the amino-terminal 21% of apoB were replaced in groups or individually by serine. Substitution of Cys pairs required for formation of disulfide bonds 1–3 or 4–7 (numbered from amino to carboxyl terminus) completely blocked the secretion of apoB28 in transfected HepG2 cells. To identify the specific disulfide bonds required for secretion, Cys pairs were mutated individually. Substitution of Cys pairs required for disulfide bonds 1, 3, 5, 6, or 7 had little or no impact on apoB28 secretion or buoyant density. In contrast, individual substitution of Cys pair 2 (amino acid residues 51 and 70) or 4 (218 and 234) severely inhibited apoB28 secretion and its capacity to undergo intracellular assembly with lipid.

These studies provide direct evidence that the ability of the internal lipophilic regions of apoB to engage in the recruitment and sequestration of lipid during translation is critically dependent upon a structural configuration contained within or affected by the amino-terminal 5% of the protein. Little is known about how the initial folding of apolipoprotein B (apoB) 1The abbreviations used are: apoB, apolipoprotein B; MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein(s); DTT, dithiothreitol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. influences its interactions with microsomal triglyceride transfer proteins (MTP) and other factors to initiate the process of hepatic apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly (1Yao Z.

Based on the use of dithiothreitol (DTT) to probe protein folding in vivo, the amino-terminal domain of apoB was shown to undergo a folding reaction that is completed before the translation and translocation of the internal lipophilic regions of apoB. If DTT was added to cells during the translation of this domain, thereby preventing its proper folding, apoB was incapable of engaging in lipoprotein assembly (8Shelness G.S. Thornburg J.T. J.

Furthermore, it could not be established whether the block in lipoprotein assembly caused by DTT was caused only by perturbed apoB amino-terminal folding or whether it also resulted from DTT-mediated inhibition of one or more assembly factors. In the current study, the relationship between the structure of the amino-terminal domain of apoB and its capacity to initiate lipoprotein assembly in vivo was examined by performing systematic mutagenesis to disrupt its normal pattern of disulfide bonding (10Yang C.-y.

Individual substitution of five of the seven Cys pairs within the amino-terminal domain had little or no impact on apoB assembly or secretion. However, substitution of Cys pairs required for formation of disulfide bonds 2 or 4 virtually abolished the capacity of both apoB28 and apoB50 to engage in lipoprotein particle assembly and secretion. These studies indicate that the ability of the lipophilic regions of apoB (11Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler.

It is possible that this domain serves as part of a recognition site for MTP or engages in an initial lipid recruitment step required to convert nascent apoB polypeptides into acceptor particles for the cotranslational phase of MTP-dependent lipid transfer. Restriction and DNA modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Tissue culture media and supplements were obtained from ICN (Irvine, CA) or MediaTech (Washington, D. C.). Tran35S-label (∼5:1 mixture of [35S]Met and Cys) was from ICN. Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (an antibody that recognizes the 8-amino acid FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) positioned at the carboxyl-terminal end of apoB28F and apoB50F) and anti-FLAG M2-agarose were from Eastman Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems (New Haven, CT). FLAG peptide was synthesized and purified by the Protein Analysis Core Laboratory of the Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University. Centricon-10 and Centriprep-10 centrifugal concentrators were from Amicon (Beverly, MA). Pairwise Cys to Ser mutations were made in apoB28F (9Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol.

Mutations were introduced by overlap PCR extension (12Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U.

PCR amplification products were digested with restriction enzymes, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and used to replace the corresponding restriction fragment of wild type apoB28F cloned into pBluescript II SK+ (9Ingram M.F.

The following restriction sites with corresponding amino acid coordinates (13Cladaras C. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Zannis V.I.

Multiple mutations were obtained by using mutant apoB28F as a template for subsequent PCRs and as the recipient for the mutant PCR restriction fragments. Once the appropriate sequence alterations were completed in the pBluescript plasmid, the entire apoB28 coding region was transferred to the pCMV5 expression vector (14Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was accomplished by digesting wild type apoB28F contained in pCMV5 with EcoRI (5′-flanking site) and XhoI (3′-end of the apoB28 coding sequence) and replacing it with the same restriction fragment generated by digestion of the mutant apoB28F pBluescript clone. All mutations were verified by sequencing the entire area within each clone that was created by PCR. Mutant forms of apoB50F were made by digesting the appropriate apoB28F mutant plasmid withEcoRV (amino acid 580) and KpnI (3′-flanking site) and replacing it with the EcoRV and KpnI fragment from wild type apoB50F (15Shelness G.S.

HepG2 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (8Shelness G.S. Thornburg J.T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 408-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For studies involving apoB secretion 35-mm dishes in six-well format were employed. For studies in which apoB from cells or media was analyzed by density gradient centrifugation or proteolytic digestion, 150-mm dishes were employed. In both cases, cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method and subjected to metabolic labeling 48–72 h after transfection, as described (8Shelness G.S. Thornburg J.T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 408-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After metabolic labeling, media and cells were recovered and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose as described (15Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immune pellets were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris base, 4% SDS, 12% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue) containing 100 mm DTT for 5 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. Gels were soaked in 1 m sodium salicylate, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (16Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Quantitation of radioactive band intensity was performed with a model 445 SI PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or by film densitometry using a pdi 325oe scanning densitometer (Protein and DNA Imageware Systems). Transiently transfected HepG2 cells (150-mm dishes) were lysed as described (15Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin. After centrifugation to remove nuclei and cell debris, supernatants were adjusted to 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated for 3.5 h with gentle inversion at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody conjugated to agarose beads (50-μl bed volume). After washing the beads three times with lysis buffer, bound proteins were displaced by two rounds of batch elution with 125 μl of lysis buffer containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 150 μg/ml FLAG peptide. The eluted fractions were pooled and incubated with trypsin (0.5 μg/ml; Boehringer Mannheim) at room temperature. At the times indicated, 20-μl aliquots were removed from the reaction and added to microcentrifuge tubes containing soybean trypsin inhibitor (final concentration of 500 μg/ml). Samples were subsequently adjusted to 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated in ice for 15 min. After addition of an equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, samples were boiled for 10 min and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. Seven of the eight disulfide bonds present in apoB100 are positioned within the amino-terminal 21% of the protein (10Yang C.-y. Kim T.W. Weng S.-a. Lee B. Yang M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5523-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The effects of disrupting these disulfide bonds were assessed using a polypeptide containing the amino-terminal 28% of apoB to which the 8-amino acid FLAG epitope was attached at the carboxyl-terminal end (apoB28F) (9Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Brizzard B.L. Chubet R.G. Vizard D.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 730-734PubMed Google Scholar). Sequential disruption of disulfide bonds from the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of apoB28F (Fig. 1 A) was achieved by making pairwise Cys to Ser substitutions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transiently transfected HepG2 cells expressing the wild type and mutant forms of apoB28F were metabolically labeled for 3 h with [35S]Met/Cys, and the amount of radioactive protein present in media and cells was assessed by immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. When the 2 Cys residues required to form disulfide bond 1 (C1) were mutated to Ser, the ratio of apoB28F in media and cells was unaffected relative to wild type (Fig. 1 B). However, when Cys pairs 1 and 2 (C1–2) or 1, 2, and 3 (C1–3) were mutated, apoB28F secretion was essentially abolished. No inhibition of secretion was observed upon substitution of Cys pair 7 (C7). An ∼50% decrease in the media:cell ratio was observed when Cys pairs 6 and 7 (C6–7) or 5, 6, and 7 (C5–7) were mutated. Finally, when Cys pairs 4–7 (C4–7) were replaced by Ser a complete block in secretion was observed. The analysis above suggests that Cys pairs 2 and 4 may individually be critical for apoB secretion. To confirm this, individual Cys pair mutations were made in apoB28F, and the effects on secretion were assessed by pulse-chase analyses. Transiently transfected HepG2 cells were pulsed for 10 min with35[S]Met/Cys and chased for the times indicated with medium containing an excess of unlabeled amino acids (Fig.2). ApoB28F bearing mutations in Cys pairs 1, 3, 5, and 7 (C1, C3, C5, C7) displayed little or no effect on secretion kinetics or efficiency relative to wild type. In each case ∼40–55% of the peak apoB28F radioactivity present in cells after the 10-min pulse was recovered in the medium after 3 h of chase. Substitution of Cys pair 6 (C6) caused a partial secretion defect in which only 15% of the apoB28F synthesized during the 10-min pulse was recovered in the medium. As predicted from the sequential deletion analysis (Fig. 1 B), individual pairwise Cys to Ser substitutions that block formation of disulfide bonds 2 or 4 (C1, C2) virtually abolished apoB28F secretion. In both cases less than 3% of the peak apoB28F radioactivity present in cells after the pulse was recovered in the medium after 3 h of chase. Although these mutations inhibited secretion, they did not affect intracellular degradation dramatically. For mutants C2 and C4, ∼60–80% of the peak radioactivity present in cells after the pulse was recovered in cells and medium after the 3-h chase, a value similar to that observed for the wild type. The requirement for disulfide bonds 2 and 4 in the assembly of apoB was explored further by examining the effects of Cys mutations on the capacity of apoB28 to recruit lipid intracellularly. For these studies the buoyant density of wild type apoB28F from intracellular pools was compared with that of mutant forms that had either no impact on apoB secretion (C1) or inhibited secretion strongly (C2 and C4). Transiently transfected HepG2 cells were labeled for 3 h with [35S]Met/Cys, and postnuclear membranes were prepared and extracted with sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, to obtain lumenal contents (15Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation, pellet fractions were subjected directly to immunoprecipitation. Supernatant fractions were neutralized, adjusted to 1.25 g/ml with KBr, and analyzed by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation as described (9Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The top (d < 1.25 g/ml) and bottom (d > 1.25 g/ml) fractions were immunoprecipitated and fractionated along with the carbonate-extracted membrane pellets by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.3, carbonate-extractable wild type apoB28F and the C1 mutant were recovered in the lipoprotein-containing top fractions, whereas the C2 and C4 forms were predominantly confined to the bottom fractions. These results indicate that apoB28F incapable of forming disulfide bonds 2 or 4 is defective in its ability to recruit or sequester lipid in the ER. Based on the cotranslational nature of the initial stage of lipoprotein assembly it can be assumed that steps required to initiate small forms of apoB, such as apoB28, are similar to those required to initiate native apoB48 and 100-containing lipoproteins (4Spring D.J. Chen-Liu L.W. Chatterton J.E. Elovson J. Schumaker V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14839-14845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Borén J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm this prediction, several of the mutant apoB28F cDNA clones were extended with wild type apoB sequences to form the equivalent carboxyl-terminal epitope-tagged form of apoB50 (apoB50F) (15Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When these constructs were expressed and analyzed as described in Fig. 1 B, the same pattern of secretion was observed. Both wild type and the C1 forms of apoB50F were found in media and cells at equivalent ratios (Fig.4; the arrow indicates apoB50F; an asterisk, a protein that immunoprecipitates nonspecifically). However, individual pairwise substitution of Cys residues required for disulfide bonds 2 and 4 severely inhibited the secretion of apoB50F from transiently transfected HepG2 cells. Because apoB50F contains more extensive lipid binding sequences than apoB28F (11Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) we explored the possibility that, although incapable of secretion, mutant forms were able to recruit an appreciable amount of lipid intracellularly. As displayed in Fig.5, most of the carbonate-extractable apoB50F wild type and C1 mutant floated in the top, d< 1.25 g/ml gradient fraction. For the C2 and C4 mutations, a small amount of buoyant apoB50F was observed. However, the ratio of buoyant to lipid poor apoB50F was much lower for disulfide bond mutants C2 and C4 (∼0.5) compared with the wild type and C1 mutant (∼6). Furthermore, relative to the wild type and C1 mutant, a smaller percentage of the C2 and C4 forms of apoB50F was extracted by sodium carbonate. This behavior would be expected for apoB that was unable to engage in lipoprotein assembly and, therefore, may engage in binding to the inner leaflet of the ER membrane or aggregation. We conclude, therefore, that Cys pairs 2 and 4 are essential for the assembly of native forms of apoB. To examine whether Cys to Ser substitutions grossly affected the pattern of disulfide bonding, wild type and mutant forms of apoB from intracellular pools were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (9Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In each case, the mobility of each protein was similar and, more critically, existed as a single electrophoretic species (data not shown). This result indicates that removal of one disulfide bond does not disrupt disulfide bonding elsewhere in the molecule and that a predominant structural configuration exists for each mutant. Intracellular forms of wild type and mutant apoB28F were also digested with proteases to assess possible conformational differences caused by mutagenesis (19Price N.C. Johnson C.M. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 163-180Google Scholar). As observed in Fig. 6, the overall susceptibilities of both wild type and mutant forms of apoB28F to proteolytic degradation are similar. However, the wild type and C1 mutants, both of which are assembly- and secretion-competent, were cleaved internally giving rise to two predominant peptides of ∼65 and 75 kDa. In contrast, the assembly-defective mutants, C2 and C4, displayed only limited formation of these peptides and instead produced a larger peptide of ∼120 kDa. These results indicate that disruption of either the C2 or C4 disulfide bond affects the capacity of apoB28 to fold into a conformation capable of engaging in lipoprotein formation in the ER. Previous studies in which DTT was used to perturb disulfide bonding in apoB28 (9Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and apoB100 (8Shelness G.S. Thornburg J.T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 408-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that the amino-terminal disulfide-bonded domain of apoB may be critically important for the initiation of apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly. However, because of the relatively wide distribution of disulfide bonds within the amino-terminal 950 amino acids of apoB it was not possible to identify which of the seven disulfide bonds are essential. In the current report Cys pairs involved in disulfide bond formation within the amino-terminal 21% of apoB were systematically replaced in groups or individually by Ser, and the effects on apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly and secretion were assessed. Remarkably, it was found that disruption of two of the four Cys pairs located within the amino-terminal 5% of apoB severely limited the ability of apoB28 and apoB50 to engage in lipoprotein particle assembly. Because we have shown previously that the disulfide bonds in the amino-terminal domain of apoB form during the process of translation (8Shelness G.S. Thornburg J.T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 408-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) it can be concluded that folding events that occur almost immediately after entry of apoB into the ER are critically important to promote hepatic lipoprotein assembly. Digestion of the two assembly-defective forms of apoB (C2 and C4) with trypsin revealed a different pattern of degradation relative to wild type and an assembly-competent mutant (C1) (Fig. 6). This result indicates that the C2 and C4 forms of apoB28F exist intracellularly in an altered conformation which prevents lipoprotein formation. However, it is possible that the structural differences observed in the C2 and C4 mutants are not inherent to the altered folding per sebut instead reflect the absence of a conformational change that occurs upon assembly with lipid. In this regard, it will be of interest to examine the pattern of protease digestion for both wild type and mutant forms of apoB expressed in lipoprotein-producing and non–lipoprotein-producing cell lines. Although the data presented here provide compelling evidence as to the importance of the amino-terminal region of apoB in lipoprotein assembly, it is not known how this domain functions. Previous studies have demonstrated a physical interaction between MTP and the amino-terminal domain of apoB (20Patel S.B. Grundy S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18686-18694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Wu X. Zhou M. Huang L.-S. Wetterau J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10277-10281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is possible therefore that discrete disulfide-bonded loops within this domain form a critical recognition site for the initial interaction of MTP with the nascent apoB polypeptide chain. In addition, the amino-terminal domain of apoB has been shown to recruit phospholipid autonomously upon incubationin vitro with vesicles composed of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (22Herscovitz H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Walsh M.T. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. Small D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7313-7317Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or during cell-free translation in the presence of rat liver microsomes (23Rusiñol A.E. Jamil H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8019-8025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hence, an alternative or additional function provided by the amino-terminal domain of apoB may involve recruitment of a phospholipid surface that serves as an acceptor site for MTP-dependent transfer of neutral and polar lipids. This recruitment step could be achieved in a number of ways including formation of a membranous bleb or bud on the lumenal side of the ER membrane (4Spring D.J. Chen-Liu L.W. Chatterton J.E. Elovson J. Schumaker V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14839-14845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Olofsson S.-O. Bjursell G. Boström K. Carlsson P. Elovson J. Protter A.A.

Chem. 1986; 15: 403-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The requirement of the amino-terminal domain to initiate or achieve this budding process is supported in part by studies demonstrating that forms of apoB containing as little as the amino-terminal 15% of the protein are capable of inserting into the inner leaflet of the ER membrane in a carbonate-inextractable form (26Pease R.J. Harrison G.B. Scott J. Nature. 1991; 353: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In large part, the various hypothetical functions of the amino-terminal domain of apoB discussed above are based on cell-free assays. However, no experimental relationship has been established to link the capacity of the amino-terminal domain to interact with MTP, lipids, and membranes in vitro and its ability to initiate lipoprotein particle assembly in vivo. It will be of interest to assess how the same structural alterations produced by mutagenesis which affect lipoprotein assembly in cells will affect the capacity of this domain to associate with MTP, lipids, and membranes in cell-free assays. The critical function of the amino-terminal domain may emerge by identifying which cell-free assay(s) display a structure-function profile similar to that observed for the capacity of apoB to initiate lipoprotein assembly in vivo. Although disulfide bonds 2 and 4 appear necessary for apoB assembly and secretion it is interesting that removal of five of the seven disulfide bonds within the amino-terminal domain of apoB had little or no impact on secretion (Figs. 1 and 2) or buoyant density (data not shown). It is not uncommon that mutagenic removal of disulfide bonds fails to affect and can even enhance folding and secretion rates (27Taniyama Y. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4619-4624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yuk M.H. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20169-20176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that the insensitivity of apoB assembly to substitution of particular Cys pairs reflects the multifunctional nature of the amino-terminal domain. For example, disulfide bond mutations that fail to affect the first cotranslational phase of lipoprotein assembly, which predominates in HepG2 cells (4Spring D.J. Chen-Liu L.W. Chatterton J.E. Elovson J. Schumaker V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14839-14845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could nonetheless have an impact on the posttranslational ability of apoB48 to form very low density lipoprotein particles in hepatocytes or oleate stimulated rat hepatoma cells (29Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 69: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 30Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also conceivable that although competent for secretion, these disulfide bond mutations will affect intravascular aspects of apoB metabolism such as its ability to undergo lipoprotein lipase-mediated lipolysis (31Choi S.Y. Sivaram P. Walker D.E. Curtiss L.K. Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Attie A.D. Deckelbaum R.J. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol.

Kane J.P. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1841-1851Google Scholar). One of the most common genetic disorders involving apoB (1/500–1/1000 in Western populations) is heterozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia (34Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 521-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these individuals frameshift and nonsense mutations result in the production of truncated forms of the apoB protein. Invariably, these mutations result in low plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol either because of reduced expression of the mutant allele or an enhanced rate of intravascular clearance. However, in cases where mutations were predicted to form very short apoB proteins (smaller than apoB30), no evidence of truncated apoB was detected in plasma (35Collins D.R. Knott T.J. Pease R.J. Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Robertson S. Pullinger C.R. Milne R.M. Marcel Y.L. Humphries S.E. Talmud P.J. Lloyd J.K. Miller N.E. Muller D. Scott J.

Based on the results presented here, it is a formal possibility that missense mutations at one of the 4 Cys residues required for the formation of disulfide bonds 2 or 4 or at other residues that participate in the formation of this critical amino-terminal structural domain could underlie some cases of this lipid disorder.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two forms of cytochrome c, iso-1-cytochrome c and iso-2-cytochrome c, which are encoded by the nuclear genesCYC1 and CYC7, respectively. Iso-1-cytochromec and iso-2-cytochrome c, which are 80% identical, normally comprise 95 and 5% of total cytochromec, respectively, in aerobically grown, derepressed cells (1Sherman F. Taber H. Campbell W. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Both iso-cytochromes c are synthesized in the cytosol, as apo-cytochrome c, and subsequently translocated into the mitochondria. Heme is covalently attached to the apo-cytochromesc by cytochrome c heme lyase (CCHL), 1The abbreviations used are: CCHL, cytochromec heme lyase; apo-1, apo-iso-1-cytochrome c; apo-2, apo-iso-2-cytochrome c; HA, the hemagglutinin epitope YPYDVPDYA; Ub, normal synthetic ubiquitin; Ub-K48R, Ub with a K48R replacement; HA-Ub, Ub with the HA attached to the N terminus of Ub; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase. which is encoded by the gene CYC3, resulting in the formation of the mature holo-cytochromes c (2Dumont M.E.

Import of the apo-cytochromesc is dependent on the action of CCHL, andcyc3-Δ mutants, lacking CCHL, accumulate apo-cytochromesc in the cytosol (3Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15928-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, apo-1 (apo-iso-1-cytochromec) is not detected in cyc3-Δ mutants, whereas apo-2 (apo-iso-2-cytochrome c) is present at the corresponding level of holo-iso-2-cytochrome c in relatedCYC3 + strains.

In this study, we have demonstrated that apo-1 degradation requires functional proteosomes and is mediated by the ubiquitin-dependent pathway. The ubiquitin system is the major pathway for targeting and selective degradation of proteins in the cytosol and nucleus of eukaryotes (5Ciechanover A.

Ubiquitin is a 76-residue protein that is joined reversibly to protein substrates by linkage between the α-carboxyl group of ubiquitin and ε-amino groups of certain lysine residues of the acceptor proteins through an isopeptide bond in a multistep reaction. Ubiquitin is first activated through the formation of of a thiol ester bond of C-terminal glycine by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme. Ubiquitin then forms a thiol ester bond with a second protein, one of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, E2. The transfer of ubiquitin to protein substrates by an E2 is done with or without the participation of a ubiquitin-protein ligase, E3. Additional ubiquitin molecules are usually added to the substrate by the same enzyme cascade, in which ubiquitin moieties are linked to the lysine 48 of each previously conjugated ubiquitin molecule until multi-ubiquitin chains are formed, which facilitates a more rapid degradation by the action of the 26 S proteosome or sometimes by the action of vacuoles. The conclusions on the degradation of apo-1 and the lack of degradation of apo-2 were based on the use of defined conditional mutants of the proteosome, on mutants lacking one of more of the E2-conjugating enzymes, on the inhibition of multi-ubiquitination by overexpression of the altered ubiquitin Ub-K48R, and on the identification of ubiquitinated forms of apo-1 but not apo-2. Because multi-ubiquitinated proteins also can be degraded by the action of vacuoles (or lysosomes), we have also examined pep4-Δ mutants, which are defective in a subset of vacuolar proteinases and which are reduced in the degradation of numerous proteins. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Strain WCG4-11/22a, obtained from Dr. Dieter H. Wolf, along with our laboratory strains, were used to construct pre2-2 cyc7-Δand pre1-1 cyc7-Δ strains. CYC3 +genes were disrupted by transforming ura3-52 strains with a 3-kilobase pair EcoRI-XhoI linear fragment, which was derived from the plasmid pAB609 and which corresponds to a segment encompassing the CYC3 gene in which the coding region was replaced by the URA3 gene. Strains B-10105 through B-10108, B-10109 through B-10112, and B-101155 through B-10158 represent three tetrads resulting from a cross of B-7553 and B-10104.

(16Yamamoto T. Moerschell R.P. Wakem L.P. Ferguson D. Sherman F. Yeast. 1992; 8: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the CYC3 gene was disrupted in each of the strains as described above, resulting in strains B-10627 to B-10630 (Table I). Strain B-10631 is isogenic to this series. The deletions or disruptionscyc7-67, cyc7-Δ::CYH2, cyc3-Δ::URA3, ubc1-Δ::LEU2, ubc4-Δ::HIS3,. andubc5-Δ::LEU2 were identified or confirmed from the size of the pertinent PCR fragment, as compared with size of the fragment obtained with the wild type allele, as described previously (17Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The pre2-2 and pre1-1 mutant alleles were identified by sequencing the appropriate PCR product encompassing nucleotide positions 974 and 595, respectively, using the dideoxy chain termination method (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar) with a Sequenase dGTP DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Similarly, the sequence of thecyc1-851, cyc1-864, cyc1-867, andcyc1-885 alleles was confirmed by sequencing of the appropriate PCR fragment. Pulse-chase and Western blot analyses of apo-1 from strains involving pre2-2 or variousubc-Δ strains were carried out with yeast grown to stationary phase in 15 ml of YPD (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% dextrose). Pulse-chase and Western blot analyses of apo-1 from strains containing p[PCUP1-Ub], p[PCUP1-Ub-K48R), and p[PCUP1-HA-Ub] plasmids were carried out with yeast grown to stationary phase in 15 ml of SD (0.67% Difco yeast nitrogen base and 2% dextrose) containing the required supplements. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 1 min, washed once in sterile distilled water, and resuspended in the same volume of fresh SD medium containing the required supplements and 100 μm CuSO4; the culture was incubated for an additional 5–8 h. All yeast strains were grown at 30 °C except for pre2-2 strains and related control strains, which were grown at 23 °C. Anti-cytochrome c antibody was prepared essentially as described by Matner and Sherman (19Matner R.R. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 257: 9811-9821Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Antibodies to the HA epitope (12CA5) were obtained from Berkeley Antibody Co. Inc. Yeast strains grown as described above were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 12 ml of semisynthetic sulfate-free medium (20Reid G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), lacking yeast extract and containing 2% raffinose, 0.1% glucose, and, if required, 100 μm CuSO4. After 1 h of incubation, [35S]methionine (1300 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) was added to a concentration of 0.125 Ci/ml, and the cells were incubated for an additional 15 min, followed by a chase in 30 mm (final concentration) methionine. Identical volumes of cells (1.5 ml) were taken at the times indicated, collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 1 min, washed once in sterile distilled water, and resuspended in 0.4 ml of sterile distilled water. Cells were lysed in an equal volume of 0.4m NaOH containing 1.7% 2-mercaptoethanol. After incubating the cell suspension on ice for 10 min, 0.2 ml of 100% trichloroacetic acid was added to precipitate the cell and protein mixture. After 10 min on ice, each sample was centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 10 min, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed in 1 ml of acetone and recentrifuged at 15000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was washed once more in acetone, allowed to dry, and subsequently solubilized by boiling for 5 min in 2 × loading buffer (4% SDS, 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mmEDTA, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.002% bromphenol blue). The solubilized samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the pellets discarded. Apo-1 was immunoprecipitated as described previously for holo-1-cytochrome c (17Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (21Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal.

Yeast were grown in the appropriate conditions, and proteins were either solubilized or immunoprecipitated and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, as described above. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose by standard procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Nonspecific protein binding was blocked by 2 h of incubation in 10% nonfat dried milk or 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc). The filters were incubated for 3 h with either anti-HA antibody or anti-cytochrome c antibody at concentrations of 1:5000 or 1:1000, respectively. The filters were visualized using either anti-mouse or anti-goat horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase development reagents (Bio-Rad). Determination of the steady-state level and turnover of apo-1. As described above, apo-1 is rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm when import into the mitochondria and maturation is blocked by the deletion ofCYC3, which encodes CCHL. In contrast, apo-2 is not degraded under these conditions (4Dumont M.E. Matthews A.J. Nall B.T. Baim S.B. Eustice D.C. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2733-2739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have investigated the pathway of degradation by examining whether or not the level of apo-1 is diminished in strains either having alterations or deficiencies in the following components: iso-1-cytochrome c having the stabilizing global suppressor N52I; defective proteasomal subunits encoded by pre2-2 and pre1-1; protease-defective vacuole due to the pep4-Δ mutation; the ubiquitin Ub-K48R, which prevents multi-ubiquitination; and the lack of one or more of the E2-conjugating enzymes Ubc1p, Ubc4p, and Ubc5p. These studies were carried out with strains lacking CCHL due to thecyc3-Δ::URA3 deletion, and lacking apo-2 due to either the cyc7-67 or cyc7-Δ::CYH2deletion (denoted cyc7-Δ below). The steady-state levels of apo-1 in these CYC1 + cyc3-Δ cyc7-Δ derivatives were determined by Western blot analysis, and the turnover of apo-1 was determined by pulse-chase experiments. Finally, we investigated why apo-1 is targeted for degradation through the ubiquitin-dependent pathway, while apo-2 is not, by examining apo-1 with various altered N-terminal sequences, including the N-terminal region corresponding to apo-2. Previous work has established that the N52I replacement in iso-1-cytochrome c acts as a “global” suppressor, counteracting defects located at at least three different sites in the molecule (23Berroteran R.W. Hampsey D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24Das G. Hickey D.R. McClendon D. McClendon G. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). G6S, G27S, and H33P are three replacements that result in nonfunctional iso-1-cytochromec, whose function is at least partially restored by the single amino acid replacement N52I in vivo. Furthermore, the N52I iso-1-cytochrome c has an enhanced stability in vivo (25Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, the N52I replacement causes an unprecedented increase in the thermodynamic stability of the proteinin vitro (26Hickey D.R. Berghuis A.M. Lafond G. Jaeger J.A. Cardillo T.S. McLendon D. Das G. Sherman F. Brayer G.D. McLendon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11686-11694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of various replacements of Asn-52 suggested that hydrophobic interactions are the main factor involved in stabilizing the N52I iso-1-cytochrome c (26Hickey D.R. Berghuis A.M. Lafond G. Jaeger J.A. Cardillo T.S. McLendon D. Das G. Sherman F. Brayer G.D. McLendon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11686-11694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Linske-O'Connell L. Sherman F. McLendon G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7094-7102Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have examined N52I apo-1 to determine if the degradation may be dependent on the overall thermostability of the protein. The result of the steady-state levels indicated that the normal apo-1 and the N52I apo-1 in strains B-8107 and B-8108, respectively, were equally degraded (data not presented), indicating that the degradation may not be dependent on the overall stability. Thus, the difference in apo-1 and apo-2 degradation cannot be simply explained by the difference in stability. However, we have not directly demonstrated the N52I replacement stabilizes apo-cytochrome c, as it does for holo-cytochrome c. We have established that functional proteasomes are required for degradation of apo-1 by examining the levels of apo-1 inpre2-2 and pre1-1 mutants having defective proteasomal subunits (28Heinemeyer W. Kleinschmidt J.A. Saidowsky J. Escher C. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 29Heinemeyer W. Gruhler A. Mohrle V. Mahe Y. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5115-5120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pre2-2 mutation corresponds to a T → C nucleotide substitution at nucleotide position 974, causing an Ala → Val replacement in the Pre2p subunit, whereas the pre1-1 mutation corresponds to a C → T nucleotide substitution at nucleotide position 595, causing a Ser → Phe replacement in the Pre1p subunit (28Heinemeyer W. Kleinschmidt J.A. Saidowsky J. Escher C. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 29Heinemeyer W. Gruhler A. Mohrle V. Mahe Y. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5115-5120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of apo-1 were compared in pre2-2 CYC1 + cyc7-Δ cyc3-Δ andPRE2 + CYC1 + cyc7-Δ cyc3-Δ strains that were derived as meiotic segregants from a cross involving the following two strains: B-10104 (pre2-2 CYC1 + cyc7-Δ cyc3-Δ::URA3 ura3–52) and B-7553 (PRE2 + CYC1 + cyc7-Δ ura3–52) (Table I). The genotypes were determined for the segregants, B-10105 through B-10108, B-10109 through B-10112, and B-10155 through B-10158, corresponding to three tetrads. The cyc3-Δ::URA3 alleles were inferred from the Ura+ phenotype, and thePRE2 +/pre2-2 alleles were distinguished by sequencing the appropriate PCR product encompassing nucleotide position 974. As shown in Fig. 1, Western blot analysis of apo-1 in these CYC1 + cyc7-Δ cyc3-Δ segregants revealed considerable increases in the steady-state levels of apo-1 in the pre2-2 strains (lanes 3 and 6), as compared withPRE2 + strains (lanes 2, 4, 5 and7) (Fig. 3). Similar results also were obtained forpre1-1 and pre1-1 pre2-2 CYC1 + cyc7-Δ cyc3-Δ (data not presented). Furthermore, pulse-chase labeling revealed that rapid degradation of apo-1 occurred inPRE2 + strains (B-10106 and B-10111) compared with pre2-2 (B-10107 and B-10109) segregants (Fig.2). Thus, these result establish that the proteasome is involved in turnover of apo-1.Figure 3E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes are involved in ubiquitination of apo-1.

https://openalex.org/W2074637788,"Drosophila factor 2 has been identified as a component of negative transcription elongation factor (N-TEF) that causes the release of RNA polymerase II transcripts in an ATP-dependent manner (Xie, Z. and Price D. H. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 11043–11046). We show here that the transcript release activity of factor 2 requires ATP or dATP and that adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS), adenosine 5'-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate (AMP-PNP), or other NTPs do not support the activity. Factor 2 demonstrated a strong DNA-dependent ATPase activity that correlated with its transcript release activity. At 20 μg/ml DNA, the ATPase activity of factor 2 had an apparentK m (ATP) of 28 μm and an estimated K cat of 140 min−1. Factor 2 caused the release of nascent transcripts associated with elongation complexes generated by RNA polymerase II on a dC-tailed template. Therefore, no other protein cofactors are required for the transcript release activity of factor 2. Using the dC-tailed template assay, it was found that renaturation of the template was required for factor 2 function. Drosophila factor 2 has been identified as a component of negative transcription elongation factor (N-TEF) that causes the release of RNA polymerase II transcripts in an ATP-dependent manner (Xie, Z. and Price D. H. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 11043–11046).

Therefore, no other protein cofactors are required for the transcript release activity of factor 2. Using the dC-tailed template assay, it was found that renaturation of the template was required for factor 2 function. Control of transcription elongation has been recognized as an important mechanism regulating eucaryotic gene expression (1Platt T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 339-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2833-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 777-786PubMed Google Scholar). The strategy to achieve the elongation control is to first apply a negative elongation potential to block and ultimately terminate RNA polymerase II transcription. The premature termination is then regulated by positive factors which enable RNA polymerase II to read through the block to transcription elongation. Based on our in vitrostudies of Drosophila RNA polymerase II transcription, we proposed a model for the control of elongation by RNA polymerase II that incorporated the function of both negative and positive factors (4Kephart D.D. Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2067-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). According to the model, all RNA polymerase II molecules that initiate from a promoter are destined to produce only short transcripts because of the action of negative transcription elongation factor (N-TEF). 1The abbreviations used are: N-TEF, negative transcription elongation factor; P-TEF, positive transcription elongation factor; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); AMP-PNP, adenosine 5'-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; VTF, virus-encoded translation factor; PEI, polyethyleneimine; nt, nucleotide(s); TRCF, transcription repair coupling factor. Escape from this abortive elongation into productive elongation requires the action of positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEF). P-TEFb, one of the components of P-TEF, has been purified and was found to phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (6Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12335-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar,7Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Factor 2, the first identified component of N-TEF, has been purified to apparent homogeneity as a monomer with a molecular mass of 154 kDa (8Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Factor 2 associates with early elongation complexes and causes premature termination by releasing RNA polymerase II transcripts generated from early elongation complexes in an ATP-dependent manner (8Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ATP has been found to be required for factor-dependent termination in several transcription systems. Autoantigen La, an RNA polymerase III transcription termination factor, hydrolyzes ATP to provide energy for the termination reaction (9Bachmann M. Pfeifer K. Schroder H.C. Muller W.E. Cell. 1990; 60: 85-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of La was dependent on RNA binding and was only activated by double-stranded RNA or DNA-RNA hybrid (9Bachmann M. Pfeifer K. Schroder H.C. Muller W.E. Cell. 1990; 60: 85-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In vaccinia virus, transcription termination mediated by virus-encoded termination factor (VTF) also requires ATP hydrolysis, though VTF itself is not directly responsible for the ATP hydrolysis. Instead, VTF is required to recognize a special sequence in the nascent RNA and transduce the signal to an activity named factor X, which catalyzed the ATP hydrolysis required for transcript release (10Yeh E. Gustafson K. Boulianne G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7036-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Rho-dependent transcription termination inEscherichia coli requires ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by rho, an RNA-dependent ATPase (11Yager T.D. von Hippel P.H. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 1241-1275Google Scholar, 12Richardson J.P. Biochim.

Rho binds to RNA and translocates along nascent transcripts to track elongating complexes and catalyzes transcript release by hydrolyzing ATP. Though ATP is required for the transcript release activity of factor 2, the role of the nucleotide and its functional relationship with factor 2 is not clear. To understand the mechanism of factor 2 function, in this study, we investigated the importance of ATP hydrolysis in the transcript release reaction and tested for the potential ATPase activity of factor 2. In addition, we examined the transcript release activity of factor 2 using a defined system based on an immobilized dC-tailed DNA template and pure RNA polymerase II. The transcript release assay using an immobilized Drosophila actin 5C template was as described (5Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 8Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Transcript release assays using an immobilized 3025 dC-tailed template utilized the same protocol, except that the generation of elongation complexes was as described (14Chafin D.R. Guo H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19114-19119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). RNase H (15Sluder A.E. Price D.H. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9917-9925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added to dC-tailed template assays to cause template renaturation as described in the text. To examine the sensitivity of RNA transcripts to RNase A or RNase H, isolated elongation complexes were incubated with the indicated nucleases for 15 min at 25 °C and then stopped with 18 μl of HKE (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mmKCl, and 10 mm EDTA). To test the effect of α-amanitin on the transcript release activity of factor 2, high salt-washed early elongation complexes were first incubated with 2 μg/ml α-amanitin at room temperature for 2 min before factor 2 and ATP or dATP were added to the reaction mixture. Labeled transcripts were quantitated using a Packard InstantImager. Assays used factor 2 (0.7 μm) from glycerol gradient fraction 15 described earlier (8Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of Drosophilafactor 2 was assayed by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). The ATPase assay (8 μl) contained 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 μm ATP, with indicated amount of factor 2 and double-stranded Act5C (4Kephart D.D. Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2067-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) DNA template linearized with HpaI. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 μl of 4 × label mixture (containing 80 mm HEPES, 20 mm MgCl2, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm ATP) and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 0.5m EDTA and placed on ice. The reaction mixture (1 μl) was spotted on polyethyleneimine (PEI) thin layer chromatography plate (E. Merck). The thin layer chromatography plate was developed by using 1 m formic acid and 0.5 m lithium chloride as the running buffer. The percentage of the ATP hydrolyzed was determined by quantitating the amount of the released γ-32Pi and the unhydrolyzed [γ-32P]ATP using a Packard InstantImager. To determine the K m for the ATPase activity of factor 2, initial rates were measured at different concentrations of substrate ranging from 5 to 600 μm ATP. The ATPase assays to measure the initial rates were carried out in the presence of 20 μg/ml of HpaI linearized actin Act5C transcription template (4Kephart D.D. Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2067-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The initial rates (pmol of ATP/min) versus the substrate ATP concentration (μm) were plotted, and the apparent K m value was obtained from the double reciprocal plot of 1/V versus 1/[ATP]. Previous work showed that ATP was required forDrosophila factor 2 to cause release of transcripts by RNA polymerase II (8Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here we examined the nucleotide specificity for the transcript release activity. Using an immobilized DNA fragment containing the Act5C promoter, early elongation complexes were generated and washed with 1 m KCl solution to remove the associated factor 2 (Fig. 1,diagram at top). The high salt-washed complexes were incubated with the indicated nucleotide in the presence or absence of purified factor 2 for 5 min. Released transcripts were separated from the template-associated transcripts by magnetic concentration. Only ATP and dATP supported the transcript release activity, while GTP, CTP, UTP, dGTP, dCTP, or dTTP did not (Fig. 1 A). The non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs ATPγS or AMPPNP did not support the transcript release activity (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that the hydrolysis of ATP was required. α-Amanitin, which binds to RNA polymerase II and inhibits transcription elongation (16Cochet-Meilhac M. Chambon P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 353: 160-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), was also examined for its effect on the activity of factor 2. The isolated elongation complexes were first incubated with α-amanitin and then treated with factor 2 and the indicated nucleotide (Fig.1 A). α-Amanitin did not affect the ability of factor 2 to release RNA transcripts in the presence of either ATP or dATP (Fig.1 A). Though both ATP and dATP can be utilized by factor 2 to release RNA transcripts, 10 μm ATP was utilized with the same efficiency of 300 μm dATP (Fig. 1 B). It is not likely that the activity seen with dATP is due to contamination with ATP since the dATP contains less than 0.5% ATP (information provided by Phamarcia Biotech). Since ATP hydrolysis was required for the function of factor 2, we determined if factor 2 had an ATPase activity. A standard thin layer chromatography assay that separated free [32P]phosphate from ATP was performed, and factor 2 alone was found to have a low level of ATPase activity (Fig.2, A and B). Previous experiments indicated that factor 2 associated with early elongation complexes (8Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and had a strong affinity to DNA cellulose, 2Z. Xie and D. Price, unpublished results. suggesting that factor 2 might bind DNA. To see if DNA might activate the ATPase activity of factor 2, reactions were supplemented with increasing amounts of DNA. At a fixed concentration of 6 nm factor 2, ATPase activity was dramatically stimulated by DNA and did not plateau even when the concentration of DNA was increased up to 80 μg/ml (Fig.2, A and B). The DNA-dependent ATPase activity of factor 2 required a divalent cation with Mg2+or Mn2+ functioning equally well (data not shown). When the DNA concentration was fixed at 5 μg/ml, increasing factor 2 caused a linear increase in ATPase activity until the percent hydrolysis was so great that ATP became limiting during the reaction (Fig. 2,C and D). Although our previous results suggested that factor 2 may associate with DNA (8Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the lack of saturation with either DNA or factor 2 suggests that there is no stable interaction with DNA in the presence of ATP. Since dATP also supported transcript release, we examined the ability of factor 2 to hydrolyze [α-32P]dATP to dADP. dATPase activity was detected and, consistent with the reduced transcript release activity supported by dATP, was about 5% of the ATPase activity. To provide further evidence that the DNA-dependent ATPase was associated with factor 2, an ATPase assay was performed across the glycerol gradient fractions of the final step of factor 2 purification (8Xie Z.

Results from both an ATPase assay and a transcript release assay across the same set of fractions (data from Ref. 8Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were quantitated and compared (Fig. 3). The ATPase correlated with the transcript release, suggesting that the DNA-dependent ATPase activity was intrinsic to factor 2. Primary kinetic parameters for the ATPase activity of factor 2 were also determined under conditions similar to that used for transcription except that only ATP was used. The apparentK m (ATP) for factor 2 was determined by measuring the initial velocity of ATP hydrolysis at different concentrations of ATP (Table I). A double reciprocal plot (1/V versus 1/[ATP]) of the data (Fig.4) yielded an apparentK m (ATP) for factor 2 of 28 μm and a V max of 6.25 pmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min. After estimating the amount of factor 2 based on the absorbance at 280 nm (A 280), the turnover number K cat was calculated to be about 140 min−1. These results indicated that factor 2 is very active in hydrolyzing ATP under conditions normally used for transcription.Table IATPase activity of factor 2ATPATP hydrolyzedmmpmol/min30.6050.93101.62303.021004.713006.406007.12The ATPase activity of factor 2 was assayed at indicated ATP concentrations in the presence of 20 μg/ml double-stranded DNA. Open table in a new tab The ATPase activity of factor 2 was assayed at indicated ATP concentrations in the presence of 20 μg/ml double-stranded DNA. To determine if factor 2 was competent to function as a transcript release factor without additional protein cofactors, we used a dC-tailed template that allows efficient transcription initiation by pure RNA polymerase II. As diagrammed in (Fig. 5, top), initiation of prebound RNA polymerase II was accomplished with a 30-s pulse. The labeled complexes were isolated and then chased to generate transcripts between 50 and 250 nt in length. The resulting elongation complexes containing transcripts longer than 20 nt were examined for their sensitivity to factor 2 (transcripts less than 20 nt were analyzed separately and will be discussed below). When the isolated elongation complexes were incubated with only buffer or ATP, less than 10% of the transcripts were released (Fig. 5 A). When the reactions were supplemented with factor 2 and ATP, an additional 17% of the nascent transcripts were released (Fig. 5 A). The transcripts resistant to release by factor 2 did not result from the use of a subsaturating level of factor 2 since increasing the amount of factor 2 by 3-fold did not cause further release (Fig. 5 A). These results suggested that factor 2 could function alone with the caveat that most of the transcripts were resistant to factor 2. Although it was possible that a protein cofactor might be required to achieve complete release of transcripts in the dC-tailed template assay, it was more likely that the factor 2-resistant complexes resulted from an unusual feature of transcription of dC-tailed templates. It has been found that most of the transcripts generated byDrosophila RNA polymerase II are in heteroduplex with the template strand (RNase H sensitive), which prevents the renaturation of the template (15Sluder A.E. Price D.H. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9917-9925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, RNase H degraded 80% of the transcripts associated with elongation complexes (beads) but did not affect the small amount of transcripts found in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 5 B). Consistent with this result, less than 20% of the transcripts associated with elongation complexes were sensitive to RNase A, whereas the transcripts in the supernatant were completely sensitive (Fig. 5 B). The fraction of transcripts released from elongation complexes by factor 2 was similar to the fraction of transcripts sensitive to RNase A or resistant to RNase H. This suggested that factor 2 caused release of only transcripts that were not in heteroduplex. Indeed, the transcripts found in factor 2-resistant complexes were sensitive to RNase H (last two lanes in Fig. 5 B). The transcripts around 13 nt in length were resistant to factor 2 function (Fig. 5 A) and were also resistant to RNase H and RNase A digestion (Fig.5 B). In a complementary experiment, elongation complexes generated in the presence of RNase H were examined for sensitivity to factor 2. To confirm that the transcripts were no longer in heteroduplex, the complexes were incubated with either RNase H or RNase A. The transcripts present in these elongation complexes were not sensitive to RNase H but were degraded by RNase A (Fig.6 A). When these elongation complexes were incubated with only ATP, a low level (about 15%) of transcripts was released in the supernatant fraction, which is similar to the level of transcript release during the RNase H incubation (Fig.6 B). When factor 2 was added along with ATP, transcript release increased to 35% (Fig. 6 B). When the level of factor 2 was tripled, transcript release was increased to a total of more than 80% (Fig. 6 B). Transcript release was dependent on ATP as found before (data not shown). These results indicate that no other protein factors were required for the transcript release activity of factor 2 and that only transcripts displaced from the template strand were released by factor 2. Factor 2 has been shown to promote the dissociation of RNA polymerase II transcripts from ternary elongation complexes in an ATP-dependent manner (8Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To understand how factor 2 causes transcript release and ultimately elucidate its role in elongation control, we investigated the biochemical properties of the factor in defined in vitro systems. With an immobilized template assay, we found that hydrolysis of ATP was required for the transcript release activity of factor 2 and that only dATP could substitute for ATP. Using pure factor 2, we found that it exhibited an ATPase activity that was strongly dependent on DNA. We employed a dC-tailed template assay with pure RNA polymerase II and found that factor 2 did not require any other protein cofactors. In addition, we demonstrated that transcript release occurred only under conditions that caused transcript displacement and template renaturation. Even though factor 2 shares a requirement for ATP hydrolysis with other termination factors, our results suggest that factor 2 utilizes a different mechanism for transcript release. ATP hydrolysis is required for termination by vaccinia VTF (17Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Deng L. Shuman S. J.

Cell. 1997; 88: 707-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the ATPase activity of factor 2 is activated by double-stranded DNA, whereas that of rho and La are only stimulated by RNA or RNA containing nucleic acids but not double-stranded DNA. Furthermore, unlike the other factors, association of factor 2 with a specific sequence in the nascent RNA is not required for its transcript release activity. Factor 2 associated with early elongation complexes containing RNA less than 10 nucleotides in length and caused transcript release (8Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Such short transcripts are probably still sequestered within RNA polymerase II (20Hagler J. Shuman S. Science. 1992; 255: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Coppola J.A. Field A.S. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and thus factor 2 is unlikely to translocate along the nascent transcript to locate paused elongation complexes. Instead, factor 2 is more likely to find elongation complexes through an interaction with the template and hydrolyze ATP to provide energy to disrupt the interaction of nascent RNA with RNA polymerase II. Though DNA strongly activates the ATPase activity of factor 2, the mechanism of the activation is not clear. Nucleic acids have been shown to play an important role in activating various ATPases. RNA is an essential cofactor for the ATPase rho. RNA stabilizes rho as a hexamer (22Finger L.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 203-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and lowers its sensitivity to trypsin digestion (23Bear D.G. Andrews C.L. Singer J.D. Morgan W.D. Grant R.A. von Hippel P.H. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1911-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that RNA may activate its ATPase activity by inducing conformational change of rho. DNA has also been shown, for example, to activate the ATPase activity of E. coli Rep protein, by inducing dimerization (24Chao K.L. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1165-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25Chao K. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or Rec A, by causing conformational changes (26Kumar K.A. Mahalakshmi S. Muniyappa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26162-26170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor 2 is a monomer of 154 kDa with little ATPase activity in the absence of DNA. It is possible that DNA induces a conformational change or causes oligomerization of factor 2 and, thereby, stimulates its ATPase activity. The characterization of factor 2 function using a dC-tailed template assay revealed that transcript release was blocked when the RNA remained in heteroduplex with the template. It is possible that extensive heteroduplex formation stabilizes the association of the RNA with the template and thus increases the energy required to cause transcript release beyond that provided by factor 2. However, another more interesting explanation is that double-stranded DNA, not RNA/DNA hybrid, is required upstream of elongation complexes for factor 2-mediated transcript release. This possibility is suggested by the finding that the 13-mer generated on a dC-tailed template was resistant to the transcript release activity of factor 2 (Fig. 5 A). Factor 2 has been shown to dissociate transcripts as short as 9 or 10 nucleotides in length generated from promoter containing templates (8Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is possible that the resistance of 13-mer to factor 2 is due to the lack of double-stranded DNA upstream of the ternary complex. However, previous studies suggested that the polymerases with nascent 13-mers had properties of the arrested state (27Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8963-8969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Guo H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18762-18770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which raised a possibility that the insensitivity of 13-mers to factor 2 action might be caused by the arrested state of the polymerase. To examine this possibility on more normal arrested complexes, an immobilized template was used to generate complexes arrested 112 base pairs downstream of the Act5C promoter (4Kephart D.D. Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2067-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These complexes are not able to elongate in the presence of 600 μm nucleotide triphosphates but are sensitive to DmS-II action (4Kephart D.D. Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2067-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). When these complexes were incubated with factor 2 in the presence of ATP, more than 60% of the transcripts were released (data not shown). The elongation complexes blocked at the same site were also observed to be sensitive to factor 2 action during elongation (Fig. 4B in Ref. 8Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, factor 2 can release transcripts associated with arrested elongation complexes. The insensitivity of 13-mer to factor 2 is likely caused by the physical state of DNA upstream of the elongation complex. Double-stranded DNA may be required for appropriate localization of the ATPase activity of factor 2 and may enable its coupling with transcript release. Since the elongation complexes formed on dC-tailed template were generated by pure RNA polymerase II, a particular localization of factor 2 in relationship to the elongation complex may be essential for a specific interaction between factor 2 and RNA polymerase. How factor 2 activity is directed toward a subset of the total complexes is not understood. The transcript release activity of factor 2 per se does not need other protein cofactors. However, factor 2 may be modulated by other factors in the process of transcription elongation. An inhibitory activity of factor 2 was found to associate with low salt-washed early elongation complexes and protect a fraction of the complexes from being released by factor 2 (8Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in reactions containing the factors required for the generation of DRB-sensitive long runoff transcripts, the appearance of DRB-sensitive runoff transcripts were suppressed by increasing the amount of purified factor 22 but not by a partially purified factor 2 fraction (6Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12335-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that factor 2 has the ability to terminate the potentially productive elongation complexes that are going to generate DRB-sensitive runoff transcripts. The antitermination activity of factor 2 associated with the low salt-washed early elongation complexes or contained in the partially purified factor 2 fraction is likely required to restrict factor 2 from acting on the potentially productive elongation complexes. A preliminary result suggests that a 14-kDa protein that copurified with factor 2 through multiple steps, but was removed during chromatography on hydroxyapatite column, is required to support the production of DRB-sensitive runoff transcripts in the presence of purified factor 2.2 Thus, during transcription elongation, the transcript release activity of factor 2 is likely to be regulated by other factors so that factor 2 preferentially acts on the elongation complexes that are not rescued by P-TEF. In addition to a role in transcription elongation, factor 2 exhibits several of the properties of the E. coli transcription repair coupling factor (TRCF) (29Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4882-4889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Like TRCF, factor 2 has an associated ATPase activity (this paper) and causes the transcript release from stalled elongation complexes (8Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, ERCC6, a putative human homologue of TRCF, has been found to have an ATPase activity that can be activated by DNA. However, ERCC6 lacks the ability to terminate stalled RNA polymerase II (30Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). It was suggested that eucaryotes might utilize a different mechanism in transcription-coupled repair than E. coli in which the polymerase backs away from the damaged DNA due to the action of S-II (30Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 31Hanawalt P.C. Donahue B.A. Sweder K.S. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 518-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is not clear why such a difference should exist since similar transcript cleavage factors GreA and GreB exist in E. coli (32Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In support of this idea, it has recently been shown that S-II is not required for transcription-coupled repair in yeast (33Verhage R.A. Heyn J. Vandeputte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We suggest the possibility that factor 2 may function as a TRCF, but further examination of the role of factor 2 in repair will be necessary to clarify its cellular function."

Since LTA-H could play a key role in determining what biologically active lipids are generated by activated endothelium during the inflammatory process, we studied possible mechanisms by which this enzyme may be regulated. We find that LTA-H is phosphorylated under basal conditions in human endothelial cells and in this state does not exhibit epoxide hydrolase activity (i.e. conversion of LTA4 to LTB4). LTA-H purified from endothelial cells is efficiently dephosphorylated by incubation with protein phosphatase-1 in the presence of an LTA-H peptide substrate and not at all in the absence of substrate. Under conditions that lead to dephosphorylation, protein phosphatase-1 activates the epoxide hydrolase activity of LTA-H. Using peptide mapping and site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified serine 415 as the site of phosphorylation of LTA-H by a kinase found in endothelial cell cytosol. In parallel, we have studied a human lung carcinoma cell line that expresses active LTA-H. Although these cells have cytosolic kinases that phosphorylate recombinant LTA-H, they do not target serine 415 and thus do not inhibit LTA-H activity. We believe that LTA-H is regulated in intact cells by a kinase/phosphatase cycle and further that the kinase in endothelial cells specifically recognizes and phosphorylates a regulatory site in the LTA-H.

It is interesting to note, however, that 5-lipoxygenase, the enzyme that generates LTA4, has a much more restricted distribution than LTA-H, and thus, many more cell types appear to have the ability to metabolize LTA4 than have the capacity to synthesize it. This has led several groups to study the transfer of LTA4 from PMNL to cells that lack the 5-lipoxygenase including erythrocytes (13Fitzpatrick F. Liggett W. McGee J. Bunting S. Morton D.

We have focused on endothelial cells (EC), because the interaction of PMNL with the endothelium is the critical initiating step of the inflammatory process and because LTB4 induces PMNL accumulation in the extravascular space and initiates the PMNL-dependent component of edema formation. Our earliest studies demonstrated that porcine aortic endothelial cells could metabolize LTA4 to LTC4 but not to LTB4 (17Feinmark S.J. Cannon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16466-16472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and later work extended these observations to other endothelial cell types including human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (25Feinmark S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). If EC contain active LTA-H, the presentation of LTA4 by activated, marginal PMNL could provide an important source of substrate for EC LTB4 synthesis. Unregulated, this pathway could lead to uncontrolled synthesis of this bioactive lipid and result in inappropriate accumulation of PMNL and other manifestations of inflammation. Therefore, it has been proposed that EC may have a mechanism for regulating the activity of LTA-H (19Feinmark S.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1992; 146: S51-S55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is this question that we address in the present report. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured as previously reported (25Feinmark S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in M-199 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, endothelial cell growth supplement (3 μg/ml), and heparin (2 units/ml) in Petri dishes coated with 0.2% gelatin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. HUVEC were used in first to third passages. EA.hy 926 and A549 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Cora-Jean Edgell (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). EA.hy 926 is a hybridoma line formed by the fusion of HUVEC with the human lung carcinoma cell line, A549. These cells have proven to be a good model for HUVEC in many studies (26Brown K.A. Vora A. Biggerstaff J. Edgell C.-J.S. Oikle S. Mazure G. Taub N. Meager A. Hill T. Watson C. Dumonde D.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 163: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Edgell C.-J.S. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). EA.hy 926 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (27Edgell C.-J.S. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). A549 cells were cultured in the presence of 6-thioguanine (0.1 μm) in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum as described earlier (28Lieber M. Smith B. Szakal A. Nelson-Rees W. Todaro G. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Proteins, separated on 7.5% gels by SDS-PAGE, were transferred to nitrocellulose according to the method of Towbin (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of the blots was done with commercially available alkaline phosphatase-linked reagents. The primary antibodies were rabbit anti-human LTA-H (raised against recombinant LTA-H) or the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody, M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.). Total RNA (20 μg) extracted from cultured HUVEC, EA.hy 926 cells, and A549 cells according to the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) was fractionated on a 1% denaturing agarose gel, blotted to Hybond-N (Amersham Corp.) by capillary action, and cross-linked with UV light. The blots were probed with an EcoRI fragment excised from the LTA-H expression vector, pEX85 (31Minami M. Minami Y. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Ohno S. Suzuki K. Ohishi N. Shimizu T. Seyama Y. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The probes were labeled by random priming according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). Radiolabeled probe was added to the hybridization solution to a final concentration of approximately 106 cpm/ml and incubated with the blot overnight at 42 °C. The membrane was washed once with 2 × SSC (0.15m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate) with 0.5% SDS for 30 min at room temperature and three times for 20 min at 65 °C in 1 × SSC with 0.1% SDS. After drying, the blot was exposed to x-ray film overnight. EC or A549 monolayers were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and bathed in the same buffer containing 0.5% human serum albumin (2 ml). LTA4 (5 μm; prepared as the lithium salt by saponification of LTA4 methyl ester (32Ohishi N. Izumi T. Seyama Y. Shimizu T. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); Biomol) was added, and each dish was gently rocked for 30 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2incubator. The reaction was terminated with ice-cold ethanol (10 ml) containing PGB2 as internal standard (0.3 nmol), and the samples were kept at −20 °C for at least 30 min. Any precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the sample was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in mobile phase and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) using a Nucleosil C18 column (3 μm; 3 × 100 mm) eluted at 0.4 ml/min with methanol/water/acetic acid (70:30:0.1, v/v/v). Metabolites of LTA4 were detected by UV absorbance at 270 nm. EC were scraped from culture dishes with a rubber policeman and suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin) at 106 cells/ml. The cells were disrupted by sonication with a Branson sonifier model S-250 (three times, 1 min each; duty cycle 70%, output 3). The cell supernatant was obtained by centrifuging the sonicate at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The enzyme was partially purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation (40–70% saturation). The resulting precipitate was resuspended in buffer A and dialyzed against several changes of the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. The dialyzed sample was filtered (0.45 μm) and applied to an anion exchange column (Mono Q) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, on a Pharmacia FPLC system. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of KCl from 0 to 0.15 mover 60 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions containing LTA-H were identified by measuring the aminopeptidase activity of the enzyme as described below. Typically, LTA-H was found in fractions 36–41 (approximately 65–85 mm KCl). Active fractions were pooled, and the buffer was changed to 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, by ultrafiltration (50,000 molecular weight cut-off; Centricon). LTA-H was further purified from the Mono Q fractions by chromatofocusing on a Mono P column (HR 5/5, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Samples were applied in 25 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.7, and eluted with a linear gradient of Polybuffer 74 (pH 3.7; 10%, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions were tested for aminopeptidase activity, and active fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and reconstituted in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. Recombinant LTA-H was expressed in bacteria as described elsewhere (31Minami M. Minami Y. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Ohno S. Suzuki K. Ohishi N. Shimizu T. Seyama Y. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The enzyme was purified from sonicated bacterial cultures essentially as described above. Recombinant LTA-H (1–2 μg) was incubated in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, with human serum albumin (2 mg/ml; 50 μl) and LTA4 (25–100 μm) at 37 °C for 1 min. The reaction was terminated by adding ice-cold methanol (150 μl) containing PGB2 (3.3 nmol) as internal standard. The sample was stored at −20 °C for at least 30 min, and precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. LTB4 was quantified by RP-HPLC on a Nucleosil C18 column eluted with methanol/water/acetic acid (65:35:0.01, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The eluant was monitored at 270 nm, and LTB4 was quantified by comparison with a standard curve generated from known amounts of LTB4and PGB2. The identity of LT peaks was verified by parallel analysis of synthetic standards. The aminopeptidase activity was determined by incubating recombinant LTA-H (1–2 μg) with alanine-p-nitroanilide (1 mm) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) in 96-well microtiter plates at 37 °C for 30 min. Formation ofp-nitroaniline was monitored at 405 nm and quantifiedversus a standard curve on a Multiscan plate reader (model EL312, BIO-TEK Instruments). Spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected for by subtracting the absorbance of control incubations without enzyme. Confluent cultures were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in 20 mm HEPES-buffered, phosphate-free DMEM. After 4 h, the monolayers were washed twice more and incubated with this medium (2.4 ml/100-mm dish) plus dialyzed serum (0.3 ml) and [32P]orthophosphate (0.3 ml; stock 10 mCi/ml; NEN Life Science Products). After 1 h at 37 °C, the labeling medium was removed, and the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped into Netal's buffer (0.5 ml of 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100) with added sodium orthovanadate (1 mm) and sodium fluoride (25 mm). The cells were further disrupted by three freeze/thaw cycles, and the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation of the suspension at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was precleared by incubation with normal rabbit serum (1:200) followed by protein A-agarose (Oncogene Science). One portion of the resulting supernatant was mixed with recombinant LTA-H (10 μg) before both were incubated with LTA-H antibody (1:200) on a rotating table for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose was added again to each tube, and the incubation was continued overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with Netal's buffer without bovine serum albumin and with 1% Triton X-100. The beads were boiled in sample buffer, and the eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Problott, and the specific LTA-H band was identified and excised from the blot. The strip of membrane containing the labeled LTA-H was rinsed with water, and the protein was hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl (200 μl) at 110 °C for 1 h. The hydrolysate was transferred to a clean tube and reduced to dryness in a SpeedVac. The residue was dissolved in pH 1.9 buffer (5 μl of 2.2% formic acid, 7.8% glacial acetic acid (v/v)) containing unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards (0.5 μg each), and the phosphoamino acids were separated by thin layer electrophoresis according to the method of Hunter (33Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The first dimension was run for 20 min at 1.5 kV in pH 1.9 buffer. After thoroughly drying and rotating the plate, a second dimension was run in pH 3.5 buffer (5% glacial acetic acid, 0.5% pyridine (v/v)) for 20 min at 1.3 kV. The plate was dried, sprayed with ninhydrin solution (0.25% in acetone), and developed at 65 °C for 15 min. The location of the standards was noted and the plate was exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C overnight. EC extracts were prepared from confluent EA.hy 926 cell cultures. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped off the plates with a rubber policeman. EC were recovered in a pellet after centrifugation at 4 °C and were resuspended in kinase buffer (100 μl/100-mm plate of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.34 mm EDTA, 0.34 mm EGTA, 1.67 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The cells were sonicated three times for 15 s each time (duty cycle 30%, output 4), and a cytosolic extract was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min. [γ-32P]ATP (150 μm, 20–50 μCi; NEN Life Science Products) was added to the cell lysate (300 μl; approximately 1.4 mg of total protein), and the reaction was begun by the addition of recombinant LTA-H. Labeled LTA-H was separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and used for peptide mapping (34Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The band corresponding to LTA-H was identified, excised from the membrane, and cut into smaller pieces. The membrane pieces were incubated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (0.5%, w/v) in acetic acid (100 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C to block nonspecific binding. The acid was aspirated, and the membrane pieces were washed five times with water. The immobilized proteins were then carboxymethylated with iodoacetate (100 mm) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. After the membranes were washed three times with water, the proteins were denatured with urea (1.5 m) in borate buffer (100 μl; 50 mm, pH 8.0), and the protein was digested with sequencing grade trypsin or endoproteinase Lys-C (10 μg; Boehringer Mannheim) at 37 °C overnight. The digested peptides were eluted from the membrane by sonication, transferred to a clean tube, and lyophilized. The residue was reconstituted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the digest was fractionated by RP-HPLC on a Vydac semimicro C18 column (2.1 × 250 mm). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile over 140 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluant was monitored at 220 nm, and 30-s fractions were collected. Radioactivity in each fraction was determined by Cerenkov counting. pEX85, the bacterial expression vector that contains the cDNA for human LTA-H, was used as a template to amplify the 2-kilobase insert by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The original vector encoded a fusion protein with 10 extraneous amino acids at the N terminus. Primers were designed to replace this section with the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) and were synthesized in the Columbia University DNA Core. The sense primer, ACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGCCCGAGATAGTGG, contains a Kozak translation initiation consensus sequence followed by the coding sequence for the FLAG epitope and then a stretch of LTA-H sequence. The antisense sequence was 5′-TCAATACGCAGGTCTTTAATCCACTTTTAAGTCTTTCCCC-3′. The sense primer was phosphorylated at its 5′-end by T4 polynucleotide kinase. A 20-cycle PCR reaction was run containing deoxynucleotides (25 μm each), pEX85 (100 ng), sense and antisense primers (50 pmol each), and Taq DNA polymerase (5 units) in PCR buffer (50 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin). The initial denaturing step was 2 min at 94 °C followed by 19 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min). The final extension reaction was 7 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was directly ligated to the PCR3.1 vector at 14 °C overnight, and a portion of the ligation mixture (2 μl) was used to transform Escherichia coli. Transformants were selected on LB plates containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Several clones were picked and expanded, and the plasmid DNA was purified with Magic minipreps (Promega). The orientation of the insert was confirmed by restriction digestion of the plasmid, and positive clones were sequenced to ensure that the insert had no mutation. FLAG-LTA-H cDNA was subcloned into a pET vector (Promega) for expression in bacteria and for site-directed mutagenesis. The mutation of serine 415 to alanine was accomplished with the PCR-based QuikChange system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene), and the wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli. Bacteria were grown in LB/AMP medium to a density of 0.6 at 600 nm and were induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm). FLAG-LTA-H and S415A-FLAG-LTA-H were purified from the 10,000 × g supernatants of sonicated E. coli by ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion exchange chromatography as described above, followed by affinity chromatography over an M2 column (Kodak). The column was washed with three aliquots of glycine, (5 ml, 0.1 m, pH 3.5), followed by three washes with Tris-buffered saline (5 ml of 50 m Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Partially purified enzyme was applied to the column, which was then washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (12 ml/wash). The FLAG-tagged proteins were then eluted by the application of excess FLAG peptide (five 1-ml aliquots at 100 μg/ml). Fractions were tested for aminopeptidase activity as described above. The active fractions were pooled, and the buffer was changed to 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, by ultrafiltration. The purity of the protein was checked by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue. In some experiments, the identity of the FLAG-tagged protein as LTA-H was verified by immunostaining with anti-LTA-H antibody. FLAG-LTA-H or S415A-FLAG-LTA-H (8 μg) was incubated with EC or A549 cell lysate as described above. Typically, the reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 3 min and was stopped by rapid dilution (10 volumes of ice-cold kinase buffer). FLAG-LTA-H was purified from the reaction mixture by immunoaffinity chromatography over an M2 column and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film to localize the radioactive bands, or radioactivity was quantified on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences between the means were determined by a pairedt test or, where appropriate, by a repeated measures analysis of variance. Postexperiment comparisons of individual means were performed using Tukey's procedure. Despite the fact that LTA-H activity was not detected in various endothelial cells, we tested for the presence of messenger RNA and enzyme protein in these cells. Both Northern and Western blots demonstrated the presence of LTA-H in HUVEC and in the endothelial cell line, EA.hy 926. Similarly, the human lung carcinoma line, A549, that served as the fusion partner for the EA.hy 926 was positive for LTA-H message and protein (Fig.1). We next retested these cells for the presence of LTA-H activity in an assay that measures the production of LTB4 from exogenous LTA4. Neither HUVEC (data not shown; see Ref. 25Feinmark S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) nor EA.hy 926 cultures (Fig.2 B) converted LTA4to LTB4. A549, on the other hand, readily converted LTA4 to LTB4 (Fig. 2 C). To be sure that the apparent absence of LTA-H activity was not due to some inability of the cells to transport LTA4 across the cell membrane, we repeated these assays in cell lysates and on purified enzyme obtained from these cultures. The results confirmed our findings in the intact cells. LTA-H purified from HUVEC and EA.hy 926 was inactive, while the same enzyme obtained from A549 cells readily converted LTA4 to LTB4 (data not shown). A brief examination of the deduced amino acid sequence of LTA-H showed that the enzyme contains multiple phosphorylation sites. To determine if the inactivity of the purified EC enzyme might be due to a post-translational modification by a kinase, we incubated HUVEC cultures with [32P]orthophosphate, lysed the cells, and recovered the endogenous LTA-H by immunoprecipitation. The precipitate was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and exposed to x-ray film. LTA-H incorporated radioactive phosphate under these conditions, confirming that the native, inactive enzyme is phosphorylated in intact HUVEC (data not shown). Enzyme purified from [32P]orthophosphate-loaded HUVEC was hydrolyzed in 6n HCl for phosphoamino acid analysis. The only radiolabeled amino acid in this preparation was phosphoserine (Fig.3). Identical results were obtained with EA.hy 926 cultures (data not shown). To identify the site(s) of LTA-H phosphorylation, we analyzed the peptide map of recombinant LTA-H phosphorylated in vitro by the kinase(s) in cell lysates prepared from EA.hy 926 cell cultures. Phosphorylated LTA-H was digested either with trypsin or Lys-C as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” and the resulting peptides were fractionated by RP-HPLC. Digestion with either proteinase yielded one major phosphopeptide (Fig. 4,A and B). These peptides were indistinguishable by HPLC analysis. However, the Lys-C digest of LTA-H phosphorylated by A549 lysate was clearly different (Fig. 4, B andC). Although phosphorylation was always on a serine (data not shown), these data indicate that the kinases of the two cell types targeted different sites in the LTA-H. We focused our attention on the 14 peptides that overlap in the trypsin and Lys-C peptide maps and contain a serine residue. The radiolabeled peptide obtained from enzymatic digests of LTA-H phosphorylated by EC lysate was identified by microsequencing to be the tetrapeptide FSYK, and thus the phosphorylated residue was serine 415. The recombinant LTA-H used in our earliest studies was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein that contained 10 extraneous amino acids on the N terminus (31Minami M. Minami Y. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Ohno S. Suzuki K. Ohishi N. Shimizu T. Seyama Y. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Prior to initiating site-directed mutagenesis studies, the expression vector for this recombinant LTA-H, pEX85, was reengineered to replace this extraneous sequence with the FLAG epitope. FLAG-tagged recombinant LTA4 hydrolase (FLAG-LTA-H) was expressed and purified over an anti-FLAG immunoaffinity column. Using a PCR-based mutagenesis, the serine corresponding to residue 415"
https://openalex.org/W2085640419,"c-Ski protein possesses a C-terminal dimerization domain that was deleted during the generation of v-ski, and has been implicated in the increased potency of c-ski in cellular transformation compared with the viral gene. The domain is predicted to consist of an extended α-helical segment made up of two motifs: a tandem repeat (TR) consisting of five imperfect repeats of 25 residues each and a leucine zipper (LZ) consisting of six heptad repeats. We have examined the structure and dimerization of TR or LZ individually or the entire TR-LZ domain. Using a quenched chemical cross-linking method, we show that the TR dimerizes with moderate efficiency (K d = 4 × 10−6m), whereas LZ dimerizes poorly (K d > 2 × 10−5m). However, the entire TR-LZ domain dimerizes efficiently (K d = 2 × 10−8m), showing a cooperative effect of the two motifs. CD analyses indicate that all three proteins contain predominantly α-helices. Limited proteolysis of the TR-LZ dimer indicates that the two helical motifs are linked by a small loop. Interchain disulfide bond formation indicates that both the LZ and TR helices are oriented in parallel. We propose a model for the dimer interface in the TR region consisting of discontinuous clusters of hydrophobic residues forming “leucine buttons.” c-Ski protein possesses a C-terminal dimerization domain that was deleted during the generation of v-ski, and has been implicated in the increased potency of c-ski in cellular transformation compared with the viral gene.

We propose a model for the dimer interface in the TR region consisting of discontinuous clusters of hydrophobic residues forming “leucine buttons.” When overexpressed from a retroviral vector, the c-skiproto-oncogene, like its viral homolog v-ski, induces transformation and promotes muscle differentiation in cultured avian fibroblasts (1Colmenares C.

The c-ski gene has a total of eight coding exons and is alternatively spliced (4Grimes H.L. Szente B.E. Goodenow M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1989Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The largest transcript contains all eight exons and encodes an 84-kDa protein (6Sutrave P. Copeland T.D. Showalter S.D. Hughes S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3137-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The v-ski oncogene is derived from the first five coding exons of c-ski and encodes a 49-kDa protein (7Stavnezer E. Brodeur D. Brennan L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4038-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the c-Ski protein is a more potent transforming agent than v-Ski as determined by morphological transformation and focus formation assays (1Colmenares C. Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Stavnezer E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4929-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stronger biological activity of c-Ski has been attributed to its C-terminal dimerization domain (8Heyman H.C. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26996-27003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is missing in v-Ski (5Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Mol. Cell.

This domain is predicted to be α-helical and contains two amino acid sequence motifs: an N-terminal motif formed of five tandem repeats of 25 amino acid residues each (9Sleeman J. Laskey R.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 67-77PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nagase T. Nomura N. Ishii S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13710-13716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that both motifs are necessary for high affinity homodimerization of Ski and heterodimerization between Ski and the product of a ski-related gene, sno (8Heyman H.C. Stavnezer E. J.

Laskey R.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 67-77PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid composition analysis shows that alanine (11%), leucine (14%), arginine (12%), lysine (14%), and glutamate (17%) constitute two thirds of the residues in the TR. This composition profile is consistent with that of a leucine zipper coiled coil, which is common among several transcription factors (11Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. KcKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar, 12Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The leucine zipper motif consists of heptad repeats with leucine or other hydrophobic residues at two neighboring positions on the helix of each monomer. These residues form a hydrophobic interface that extends along the long axis of the double helix. However, the predicted TR α-helix of Ski does not have a continuous hydrophobic face. Instead, there is a strong pattern of alternating leucines and charged residues at the heptad positions normally occupied exclusively by hydrophobic residues (9Sleeman J. Laskey R.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 67-77PubMed Google Scholar). If the tandem repeat motif does form a coiled coil, it must rely on an as yet uncharacterized interhelical interaction. Moreover, the proposed TR helix involves 125 amino acid residues, stretching over 180 Å in length. Helices of such length are not uncommon among fibrous and muscle proteins but are rare among transcription factors such as Ski (13Engert J.C. Servaes S. Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Rosenthal N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2988-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), having been found in only a single bacterial factor (14Hurme R. Berndt K.D. Namork E. Rhen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12626-12631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The leucine zipper helices of all other transcription factors consist mostly of five or six heptad repeats (12Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar), such as the leucine zipper immediately downstream of the TR domain in Ski. We now report the findings of a structure-function study of the Ski dimerization domain. Our aim is to define the roles of the two identified structural elements in dimerization, and particularly to determine whether the tandem repeats form α-helices. For this purpose, polypeptides consisting of the tandem repeat motif, the leucine zipper motif, or both are analyzed by hydrodynamic measurements, chemical cross-linking, circular dichroism spectropolarimetry, and partial proteolysis. In addition, we describe a newly devised quenched cross-linking method to quantify dimerization affinity. Our results provide strong evidence that the tandem repeats and the leucine zipper motifs cooperate in forming a parallel helical dimer. Because the tandem repeat helices do not contain the amphipathic structure of classical coiled coils, we propose a new discontinuous dimer interface involving the unique array of residues that constitute the core consensus of the repeat (LXXELEXLR). AnMslI-XbaI fragment of the chicken c-ski c-DNA sequence FB29 (6Sutrave P. Copeland T.D. Showalter S.D. Hughes S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3137-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which encodes the entire C-terminal dimerization domain of c-Ski from Ser558 to Asn750, was used to generate the coding sequences for the proteins studied. To facilitate cloning and expression, the sequence CCATGGGGGGATC was added to the 5′ (MslI) end of the fragment to produce construct c-skinm, coding for the protein called TR-LZ. To generate the construct that encodes only the tandem repeat motif, c-skinm was 3′-truncated at a ScaI site. The resultant construct, c-skinms, encodes the TR protein, which contains the c-Ski sequence Ser558–Lys684. To generate the construct that encodes only the leucine zipper motif, theMslI-XbaI fragment was 5′-truncated at the sameScaI site. A short sequence CCATGGATC was attached to theScaI end to produce construct c-skins, coding for the LZ protein, which contains the c-Ski sequence Ser686–Asn750. For in vitro translation, c-skinm and c-skins were cloned as NcoI-XbaI fragments at the cognate sites in plasmid 5′EETM1 (a gift from Dennis Templeton). c-skinms was cloned as anNcoI-ScaI fragment at NcoI andSacI sites in the same plasmid. 35S-Labeled TR-LZ, TR, and LZ proteins were made using the reticulocyte lysate TNT-coupled transcription-translation kit of Promega. For bacterial expression, c-skinm and c-skinms were cloned into plasmid pET28 and expressed in strain BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen). c-skinm was cloned as an NcoI (filled)-XbaI fragment inserted at NheI (filled) and XbaI sites. It was expressed as a fusion protein containing an N-terminal histidine tag. c-skinms was cloned as an NcoI-ScaI fragment inserted atNcoI and XhoI (filled) sites, and the resultant fusion protein contains a C-terminal histidine tag. For bacterial expression of LZ, a polymerase chain reaction fragment was generated using a primer pair CATGCCATGGGCAAAGAATGCGGTGGAGCCCAGATTGAGGACCTAC (prmlzn) and CTAGTCGACTTTGCCGCCAGGCCACAGCTGTTCCT (prmlzc2) and c-skinm as template. The fragment was cleaved byNcoI and SalI and cloned into pET28 atNcoI and XhoI sites. The LZ motif expressed from this construct contains a C-terminal histidine tag and is flanked by a lysine residue at both N and C termini to facilitate chemical cross-linking and by a cysteine residue at the N terminus for determination of helix orientation. Bacterial cell culture, protein induction, and histidine tag-based protein purification were performed according to the Invitrogen manual. For further purification, the proteins were placed in buffer containing 50 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl, 1.4m (NH4)2SO4, and 5 mm DTT and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column. The column was developed with a linear gradient of decreasing (NH4)2SO4 to a final concentration of 0 m. The eluted TR-LZ, LZ, or TR was dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mm Na2PO4 (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT. The concentration of TR-LZ or LZ was determined by its absorbance at 280 nm following the method of Edelhoch (15Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). TR does not contain tyrosine or tryptophan residues, and its concentration was determined as follows. Samples containing serial dilutions of TR, BSA, and IgG were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE). Following electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the band intensities of TR samples were compared with those of the BSA and IgG standards using a densitometer. Because the band intensities generated by equal amounts of BSA and IgG are slightly different, average values for these proteins were used to estimate the amount of TR protein. Samples in 2.7% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol (βME) were incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a Tris-Tricine buffer system (16Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10477) Google Scholar). For detection of unlabeled proteins, gels were fixed with 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid and stained with Coomassie Blue. For detection of35S-labeled proteins, gels were fixed, soaked in Enlightning (DuPont), dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Relative intensities of the protein bands were determined by scanning the film with a densitometer. For more sensitive and direct quantitation of35S-labeled bands, gels were fixed, dried, exposed directly to PhosphorImager plates, and analyzed using the ImageQuant software of Molecular Dynamics. Gel filtration of in vitro translated 35S-labeled proteins was performed using a Sephacryl S-200HR column (1 × 45 cm, 35 ml) equilibrated with buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 20% glycerol. The total column volume accessible to solvent (V i) and the void volume (V o) were determined using thymidine and blue dextran 2000, respectively. The column was developed at 4 °C at a flow rate of 1 ml/h, and 0.7-ml fractions were collected. For determination of sedimentation coefficient, 100 μl of sample protein was layered onto a 5-ml linear glycerol gradient (15–30%) prepared in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 200 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 23 h at 4 °C. The gradient was then fractionated from the bottom of the tube at 0.2 ml/fraction. Both the column and the gradient were internally calibrated by including protein standards of known Stokes radii (Å) and sedimentation coefficients (s 20, w = S), including: catalase, 52.2 Å, 11.3 S; aldolase, 48.1 Å, 8.27 S; bovine serum albumin, 35.5 Å, 4.22 S; ovalbumin, 30.5 Å, 3.55 S; and RNase A, 16.4 Å, 1.85 S. Fractions collected from the column or the gradient were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%), followed by Coomassie Blue staining to detect the protein standards, autoradiography to detect the35S-labeled sample proteins, and densitometry to determine the peak elution or sedimentation positions of these proteins. For gel filtration, a calibration curve was derived using the known Stokes radii and the elution positions of the standards, following the equation of Porath (17Porath J. Pure Appl. Chem. 1963; 6: 233-244Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The Stokes radius of the sample protein was determined from the curve according to its elution position relative to the standards. For sedimentation analysis, a calibration curve was derived by plotting the known sedimentation coefficients of the standards as a function of their sedimentation positions. The sedimentation coefficient of the sample protein was determined from its sedimentation position relative to the standards. Native molecular weight, frictional ratio (f/f o ), and axial ratio of the sample proteins were calculated as described (18Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar, 19Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Canto C.R.

Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1980: 552-562Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) was performed essentially as described (8Heyman H.C. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26996-27003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. For analysis of the dimerization of in vitrotranslated TR, BS3 cross-linking was performed at room temperature in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and 20% glycerol. The reactions were terminated by addition of 100 mm glycine. For analysis of the effect of salt concentration on TR dimerization, in vitro translated TR was diluted to about 2 nm and reacted with BS3 in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and varying amounts of NaCl. Oxidation of in vitro translated TR was performed in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 20% glycerol. The protein solution (100 μl) was placed in a 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tube and incubated at 4 °C with the lid open. Samples (10 μl) were taken at intervals of 1, 2, 5, and 8 days of incubation and frozen at −70 °C in sealed tubes. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE as usual except that the βME was eliminated from the sample buffer. For cross-linking using the homobifunctional, cysteine-specific reagent bismaleimidohexane (BMH), the cross-linker was dissolved in Me2SO and added to in vitro translated TR to a final concentration of 0.5 mm in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol. The reaction was performed at room temperature with constant shaking for 1 h and terminated by addition of DTT to 5 mm. For detection of dimerization of bacterially expressed LZ protein, BS3 cross-linking was performed as described above except in buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm DTT. To obtain maximum cross-linking at each protein concentration, BS3concentration was varied from 0.1 to 20 mm. The maximum amount of cross-linked dimer was used for estimating the dissociation constant for the LZ dimer. For determination of helix orientation in the LZ dimer, BMH cross-linking was performed as described above except in buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 12 μm LZ protein. To perform the same reaction under denaturing condition, 6 m guanidine was included in the buffer. Oxidation of LZ was performed as described above except in buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 123 μm LZ protein. For dimer-monomer equilibrium analysis of TR protein using quenched cross-linking (described in detail under “Results”), bacterially produced TR was diluted to 300, 150, 30, 3, and 0.3 μm, in 60 μl of 10 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT. Each sample also contained 0.25 μl of in vitro translated,35S-labeled TR as a tracer. The samples were allowed to equilibrate overnight (about 16 h) at 25 °C. One-twentieth volume (3 μl) of glycine (2 m, pH 7.0) was added to each sample, followed by addition of one-twentieth volume (3 μl) of BS3 (40 mm). After incubation at 25 °C for 5 min, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) in Tris-Tricine and the amount of cross-linked dimer relative to the total amount of the protein was determined by PhosphorImager analysis as described above. Partial cross-linking of the TR-LZ protein was performed similarly, except that the bacterially produced protein was diluted to 400, 40, 4, 0.47, and 0.047 nm in volumes of 60 μl (400, 40, and 4 nm), 600 μl (0.47 nm), and 6 ml (0.047 nm). After cross-linking, the samples were precipitated with one-third volume of 50% trichloroacetic acid containing sodium deoxycholate (2 mg/ml), followed by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analysis by SDS-PAGE. For a single protein species, the monomer-dimer equilibrium is described by Equation1.Kd=m2/dEquation 1 K d is the dissociation constant, mis the concentration of monomer, and d is the concentration of dimer. To transform this equation into one that contains terms for total protein concentration (T) and fraction of protein as dimer (F), letT=m+2dEquation 2 F=(2d)/T.Equation 3 Solving for m and d in Equations 2 and 3 and substituting these values in Equation 1 yields Equation 4.Kd=(1/F)(2T)(1−F)2Equation 4 Equation 4, when solved for F, yields Equation 5.F=(1/4T){4T+Kd−[(4T+Kd)2−16T2](½)}Equation 5 Because the dimer is detected by partial cross-linking, letf be the fraction of cross-linked dimer relative to the total amount of protein and B be the ratio betweenF and f. Thus,f=F/BEquation 6 orF=Bf.Equation 6b Substituting f for F in Equation 5 yields Equation 7.f=(1/B)(1/4T){4T+Kd−[(4T+Kd)2−16T2](½)}Equation 7 The experimental results yield a set of f values determined by partial cross-linking at different values ofT, as described in the preceding section. The constant components of Equation 7, B and K d , are then determined by fitting the set of T and fpairs into Equation 7 by nonlinear regression using the curve fitting feature of SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). The standard equilibrium curve is generated following Equation 5 by entering the values ofK d determined in this way. To determine how well the data points fit this curve, the (f, T) set is converted to (F, T) following Equation 6b and replotted as F versus T. Samples (20 μl) containing bacterially produced, purified LZ-TR protein (20 μm) were incubated with 0, 1, 10, or 100 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 10 min. The digestions were terminated by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 1 mm, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%, Tris-Tricine) and stained by Coomassie Blue. The molecular masses of intact and protease-digested TR-LZ proteins were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. These analyses were performed on 10–100 ng of bacterially expressed and purified TR-LZ protein using a Fisons, Inc. instrument calibrated with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, hen egg white lysozyme, and bovine carbonic anhydrase. For the determination of the mass of the intact TR-LZ protein, carbonic anhydrase (M r 28,987) was included as an internal standard. Circular dichroic spectra of the TR-LZ, LZ, and TR proteins were acquired using a JASCO J-710 spectropolarimeter calibrated withd 10-camphorsulfonic acid. A water-jacketed, cylindrical quartz cuvette with a 0.05-cm path length was used. All samples were dissolved in PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl), and the spectra reported are corrected for a buffer blank. Protein concentrations were calculated as described above, and helix contents estimated from [θ]222 as described by Greenfield and Fasman (21Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3320) Google Scholar). Other methods of evaluation gave qualitatively similar results. Each spectrum represents the mean of four to eight independent scans. Samples were equilibrated at the indicated temperatures for at least 10 min prior to collecting data, and the first and last spectra at each temperature were compared to verify that the samples had attained conformational equilibrium. We undertook a hydrodynamic analysis of the Ski dimerization domain as a first approach to examining its shape and self-association. Proteins TR (Ser558–Lys684), LZ (Ser686–Asn750), and TR-LZ (Ser558–Asn750) (Fig.1) were translated in vitro in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine, and their Stokes radii and sedimentation coefficients were determined by gel filtration and glycerol gradient centrifugation, respectively (TableI). These data were used to calculate the native molecular weights and axial ratios of these proteins. The data show that TR-LZ has a calculated molecular weight of 41,000, close to the predicted sum of two monomers (2 × 22,800), suggesting that it exists as a homodimer. On the other hand, both TR and LZ alone have calculated molecular weights close to their predicted monomer sizes, suggesting that they are essentially monomers.Table IHydrodynamics of the dimerization domain of SkiStokes radiusSedimentation coefficientPredictedM r (monomer)Calculated native M rFrictional ratioAxial ratioK dÅSμmTR28.31.715,80019,8001.4794TR (disulfide-linked)34.02.215,80030,8001.407ND1-aND, not done.LZ22.01.19,50010,0001.336NDTR-LZ41.52.422,80041,0001.52100.021-a ND, not done. Open table in a new tab All three proteins have large Stokes radii and small sedimentation coefficients relative to their native molecular weights, suggesting elongated overall shapes. For example, the TR-LZ dimer has a calculated frictional ratio of 1.52, which corresponds to an axial ratio of 10:1, consistent with an overall rodlike shape. To determine whether the LZ protein could dimerize at protein concentrations much higher than that produced by in vitro translation, a 65-residue, histidine-tagged protein containing the LZ motif was produced in bacteria and purified. The bacterial LZ protein indeed contains a mixed population of monomers and dimers. To determine the extent of dimerization at various LZ concentrations, we treated LZ with a saturating dose of the chemical cross-linker BS3 (8Heyman H.C. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26996-27003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We find that at 25 °C about 20% of the molecules exist as dimers at a total protein concentration of 4 μm and that the fraction of dimers rises to 77% as the protein concentration increases to 123 μm (data not shown). These numbers probably represent an overestimation of dimers due to the likely effect of cross-linking on the monomer:dimer equilibrium. However, the data show that the LZ motif is capable of self-dimerization and that the fraction of dimers is dependent on the protein concentration within this range. Therefore, we estimate the lower limit of the dissociation constant (K d ) to be approximately 17 μm. At 123 μm, the circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the LZ protein show that it contains a high fraction of α-helix and no β-sheet (Fig. 2 A). The helical content is calculated to be 50–55% at 25 °C, which agrees well with the fact that only 77% of the molecules exist in the dimer form and that only 47 residues in the 65-residue protein are derived from the LZ motif (72%). Thus, the data are consistent with the notion that only the dimer is α-helical. CD spectra obtained at different temperatures show a cooperative and reversible loss of helicity in response to increases in temperature (Fig. 2 A), confirming that the formation of the LZ helix follows two-state kinetics. The LZ protein contains a single engineered cysteine at the N terminus of the LZ motif. To determine the relative orientation of the two LZ α-helices in the dimer, the protein was either treated with the homobifunctional, sulfhydryl-specific cross-linker BMH or allowed to auto-oxidize by air exposure. Covalent linkages formed through the cysteines may occur only if the two helices are oriented in parallel in the dimer (29O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, BMH cross-links the LZ protein, but does so only in the absence of guanidine denaturation, suggesting that the cross-linking is facilitated by the α-helical structure. Auto-oxidation also results in a covalent dimer linked by a disulfide bridge (Fig. 2 B). Both results suggest that the helices are in parallel. Based on these data, we conclude that the LZ motif self-dimerizes in the form of two parallel α-helices. A previous study using chemical cross-linking readily detected dimers of in vitrotranslated Ski proteins containing only the TR region of the dimerization domain (8Heyman H.C. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26996-27003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The failure to detect TR dimers hydrodynamically (Table I) probably reflects the fact that with the limited quantities of proteins produced by in vitrotranslation, the dimer exists only transiently. In contrast, under similar conditions, dimers of in vitro translated TR-LZ protein are detected hydrodynamically, suggesting that the presence of the LZ motif significantly stabilizes the dimer. To quantitate the differences between the potential of these proteins to dimerize, we undertook a comparison of their equilibrium constants. For these studies, histidine-tagged TR-LZ and TR proteins were produced in bacteria and purified. These proteins were then serially diluted to desired concentrations, and the relative amounts of monomer and dimer were measured as a function of the total protein concentration. To extend the sensitivity of the measurements to the submicromolar range, a trace amount of 35S-labeled, in vitrotranslated protein was added as a tracer. After reaching equilibrium during a 16-h incubation, the samples were treated with BS3, permitting subsequent separation and quantitation of dimer and monomer by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. A general concern for using a chemical cross-linker in such analyses is that it may shift the equilibrium in favor of dimer. To minimize this potential interference, we have designed a method in which the cross-linking reaction is performed as a short pulse, during which a fixed fraction of the dimer population is cross-linked. To accomplish this, the reaction is performed in the presence of a glycine quenc"

Similarly, an 18-bp sequence within the first intron of the α1(II) collagen gene has been shown to control promoter expression in cartilaginous tissues by binding a transcriptional complex that includes the SOX9 activator (8Lefebvre V.

Finally, expression of the proximal promoter of α2(I) collagen in dermis, tendon, and the fibrous layers of many internal organs has been reported to be significantly augmented by a far-upstream enhancer that contains fibroblast-specific DNase-hypersensitive sites (10Bou-Gharios G.

We are interested in the control of the genes coding for the subunits of the so-called minor fibrillar collagens (11Linsenmayer T.F. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1991: 7-44Crossref Google Scholar). The two members of this subgroup of collagens, types V and XI, play a critical role in regulating the formation of the types I and II fibrillar networks in cartilaginous and non-cartilaginous tissues, respectively (12Andrikopoulos K. Liu X. Keene R.D. Jaenisch R. Ramirez F. Nat. Genet. 1995; 3: 31-36Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Li Y. Lacerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R. Yoshioka H. Ninomiya Y. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. Andrikopoulos K. Ramirez F. Wardell B.B. Lifferth G.D. Teuscher C. Woodward S.R. Taylor B.A. Seegmiller R.E. Olsen B.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 423-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). They can also give rise to cross-type trimers consisting of α2(V) and α1(XI) chains in vascular muscles and in the developing bone, among other tissues (11Linsenmayer T.F. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1991: 7-44Crossref Google Scholar). Although the precise function of this cross-type molecule remains a mystery, its tissue distribution implies that the α2(V) and α1(XI) collagen (COL5A2 andCOL11A1) genes are more broadly expressed than those coding for the subunits of the parental trimers, as well as the co-expressed types I and II collagen genes. This in turn endows COL11A1with the distinction of being the sole collagen gene to be transcribed in both cartilaginous and non-cartilaginous tissues. We have previously reported the characterization of the proximal upstream sequence ofCOL11A1 (14Yoshioka H. Greenwel P. Inoguchi K. Truter S. Inagaki Y. Ninomiya Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 418-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing has revealed that the promoter contains GC-rich boxes in place of the TATA motif. DNA transfections have established that cis-acting elements located between nucleotides −541 and −199 drive constitutive transcription from the proximal promoter in α1(XI) collagen-producing cells. The latter tests have employed the rhabdomyosarcoma A-204 line and vascular smooth muscle cells (smc), as the COL11A1-positive cells, and the fibrosarcoma HT-1080 line, as the COL11A1-negative cell. Finally, DNase I footprinting assays have mapped nine areas of interaction with nuclear proteins (FP1 to FP9) within the proximal promoter (Fig. 1). Based on sequence homologies, most of them were thought to represent binding sites for ubiquitous activators, like AP2 and Sp1 (14Yoshioka H. Greenwel P. Inoguchi K. Truter S. Inagaki Y. Ninomiya Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 418-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). An interesting correlation was also noted with the proximal promoter of the coordinately expressed COL5A2 gene (15Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two collagens were in fact found to share an upstream element, called FPB in COL5A2 and FP7 in COL11A1, that binds the same ubiquitously expressed trans-acting factor (14Yoshioka H. Greenwel P. Inoguchi K. Truter S. Inagaki Y. Ninomiya Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 418-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to further characterize thecis-acting elements of the −541 to −199 segment and implicitly, the trans-acting factors involved inCOL11A1 regulation. The results indicate that constitutive and cell type-specific transcription of the −541COL11A1promoter is under the control of FP9, an element farther upstream of FP7. More importantly, the experimental evidence suggests that the transcription factor binding to FP9 is an apparently new member of the zinc-finger family of nuclear proteins. The factor (FP9C) is mostly expressed in cells of mesenchymal origin and always in those actively transcribing COL11A1. Interestingly, we also found a positive correlation between the level of FP9C binding and the stage of differentiation of osteoblastic and skeletal muscle cell lines. Human cell lines included primary embryonic dermal fibroblasts (CF 37), adult keratinocytes, neonatal melanocytes, umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and the rhabdomyosarcoma A-204 and T-lymphocyte Jurkat lines. Keratinocytes, melanocytes and HUVEC were purchased from Cascade Biologics, Inc. (Portland, OR). Rat cells included primary vascular smooth muscle cells (smc) and hepatocytes, the neurogenic PC12 line, the osteosarcoma lines ROS 17/2.8 and ROS 25, and the chondrosarcoma line RCS. Mouse cells included primary costal chondrocytes, NIH3T3 fibroblasts, the multipotential mesodermal line C3H10T1/2, C2C12 myoblasts, the C3H10T1/2-derived P2 myogenic line, MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like calvarial cells, and erythroleukemia cells (MELC). Consensus recognition sequences for and antibodies against various transcription factors were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Most cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. MC3T3-E1 and Jurkat cells were cultured in 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with α-minimal essential medium and RPMI medium, respectively; melanocytes and keratinocytes were cultured in Medium 154 supplemented with HMGS and HKGS, respectively; HUVEC were grown in Medium 200 supplemented with LSGS. C2C12 myoblasts and the myogenic P2 line were induced to differentiate by placing confluent cells in 2% horse serum (16Relaix F. Weng X. Marazzi G. Yang E. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Spence S.E. Sassoon D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Short term cultures of mouse costal chondrocytes were prepared as described (17Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was purified from cultured cells and subjected to Northern hybridization to probes for COL11A1and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase according to standard protocols (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar). Progressive 5′ deletion of the COL11A1promoter and internal substitutions of the 45-bp and 20-bp FP9 with unrelated sequences were engineered using specific oligonucleotide primers and the polymerase chain reaction technique and were all verified by DNA sequencing (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar). The mutant sequences were subcloned 5′ of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in the vector pBLCAT3 (19Lackow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Purified plasmid DNA was introduced into the cells by the calcium phosphate method according to the published protocol along with the normalizing standard pSVLUC, a plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional control of the SV40 promoter (20Boast S. Su M.W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). About 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and assayed for CAT and luciferase activities. Values were normalized for the co-transfected plasmid and expressed relatively to parallel transfections of the pSVCAT vector. Cell transfections were performed multiple times and the resulting data were evaluated using Student'st test. Crude nuclear extracts were purified according to our published protocol (15Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, 5 μg of nuclear proteins were used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) together with approximately 10,000 dpm of labeled oligonucleotide probe as described previously (15Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlabeled competitors were added in the amounts indicated in the figure legends, or otherwise at 100-fold molar excess. In the zinc-dependence assay, 0.5 μl of 1,10-phenanthroline (OPA) resuspended in ethanol at the concentration of 1 m, 0.2 m, or 0.1m was added to 47.5 μl of buffer solution containing nuclear proteins and dI-dC and was then incubated on ice for 5.5 h. This was followed by addition of the labeled probe and incubation on ice for an additional 30′ prior to EMSA. Conditions for DNase I footprinting and DNA methylation interference assays were essentially identical to the published protocols (15Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To estimate the molecular weight of denatured FP9C, nuclear extracts from A-204 cells (500 μg) were dissolved in 500 μl of denaturing buffer containing 6m guanidine HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and left on ice for 30 min. After clearing it by centrifugation, the solution was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column (50 cm × 1 cm, inner diameter) equilibrated in the same denaturing buffer. Fractions (0.75 ml) were collected and analyzed by EMSA after microdialysis of 100-μl aliquots against 20% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Marker proteins ranging from 14 to 100 kDa were fractionated through the same column under identical conditions and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A previous study has delineated the shortest segment of the proximal COL11A1 promoter capable of directing constitutive and cell type-specific expression of the reporter CAT gene in transient transfection experiments (14Yoshioka H. Greenwel P. Inoguchi K. Truter S. Inagaki Y. Ninomiya Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 418-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The segment extends from nucleotide −541 to nucleotide −199 with respect to the major start site of transcription of this tissue-specific TATA-less gene. Within it, DNase I footprinting assays identified six distinct areas of protection from nuclease digestion by nuclear proteins, which were termed FP9 to FP4 (Fig. 1). In the present study, the same combination of DNA transfection and DNA-binding assays was used to further characterize the 342-bp upstream segment ofCOL11A1. To dissect the functional properties of the 342-bp segment, the activity of mutant constructs harboring progressive 5′ promoter deletions, from FP9 to FP4, were compared after transfection into A-204 cells. The analysis showed that all mutant plasmids drive expression of the CAT gene to levels comparable to the basal activity of the −199COL11A1promoter (Fig. 2 A). The results therefore suggested that the 45-bp-long FP9 may be the principle contributor to transcription from the −541 promoter. This postulate was corroborated by the finding that the −541 promoter construct containing an unrelated sequence in place of the 45-bp FP9 (construct −541/45) displayed the same activity as the basal −199COL11A1 plasmid (Fig. 2 C). To establish whether other elements in the 342-bp segment might be required to support FP9 activity and indirectly to confirm the above results, another mutant construct was tested by transient transfection. The mutation was engineered using BstXI restriction sites conveniently located at nucleotides −482 and −316 and resulted in the internal loss of the segment spanning from FP8 to FP6 (Fig.2 A). The mutant plasmid (construct −541/Δ167) exhibited slightly higher activity than the wild-type construct (Fig.2 C). Although a similar test was not performed for the sequence encompassing FP4 and FP5, the results strongly suggested that FP9 is the major contributor to constitutive and cell type-specific transcription from the proximal COL11A1 promoter. Incidentally, wild-type and mutant constructs transfected into the HT-1080 line were transcriptionally inactive (data not shown). The EMSA was initially employed to assess the complexity of the FP9 binding pattern, as well as its specificity. To this end, nuclear proteins purified from A-204 cells were incubated with the radiolabeled 45-bp-long FP9 probe without and with increasing amount of the same unlabeled sequence. The results revealed the formation of a single predominant complex which migrates toward the top of the gel and is specifically competed by the same 45-bp-long sequence (Fig.3 A). Occasionally, we observed a lesser intense and faster moving complex (see Fig. 3 C) whose identity was not investigated in the present study. Next, the methylation interference assay was performed to further characterize the trans-acting factor that binds to FP9. This delineated the main area of DNA-protein interaction by identifying the G residues that are contacted by the nuclear protein. Three major contact points and two minor ones were located within the 20-bp core of FP9 (Fig.4 A). This sequence is characterized by an imperfect palindrome with a 2-bp interruption and strong homology to the binding site for GATA proteins (Fig. 1) (21Simon M.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The EMSA reiterated the importance of the 20-bp core by documenting the ability of this sequence to compete for binding to FP9 almost as effectively as the 45-bp long oligonucleotide (Fig. 3 A). It also documented the specificity of the interaction, in that both the 45-bp and 20-bp oligonucleotides competed formation of the complex with comparable efficiency (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, it showed that the competitiveness of the core sequence was somewhat diminished by substitutions outside of the GATA motifs (M1 andM4, Fig. 3 A) and was completely abolished by those introduced within them (M2 and M3, Fig.3 A). Altogether, the results of the in vitrobinding tests implicated the imperfect GATA palindrome as the major recognition site of the FP9 complex (FP9C). Consistent with this conclusion, substitution of the 20-bp core of FP9 with an unrelated sequence rendered the −541 promoter construct (−541/20) as inactive as the plasmid without the entire FP9 or the construct with the mutant version of the 45 bp (Fis. 2, B and C).Figure 4Methylation interference analyses.

Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To test whether or not the imperfect FP9 palindrome could be recognized in vitro by GATA proteins, binding of MELC nuclear proteins to FP9 and the GATA consensus sequence were compared. The erythroleukemia cells were chosen for the test because they produce large amounts of GATA-1, the prototype of the GATA family (22Tsai F.Y. Martin D.K. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The assay documented the ability of FP9 to bind in vitro the same protein of the MELC nuclear extract as the GATA consensus sequence (Fig. 3 B). Aside from the similar migration, identity between the two complexes was supported by the finding that they were both supershifted by anti-GATA-1 antisera but not by anti-GATA-3 or anti-Sp1 antibodies (Fig. 3 B). Based on the above results, we tested whether A-204 nuclei contain a GATA-like binding activity and found that the GATA consensus sequence failed to yield a retarded band in the EMSA (Fig. 3 C). To confirm the absence of GATA-like proteins in this α1(XI) collagen-producing tumor line, two additional EMSAs were performed. The first revealed that the A-204 nuclear factors that binds to the FP9 sequence is not recognized by the anti-GATA antibodies or by the control anti-Sp1 antisera (Fig. 3 B). In the second EMSA, formation of the complex between A-204 nuclear proteins and the FP9 sequence was challenged with molar excess of the GATA consensus sequence or the 45-bp oligonucleotide. As expected, 20-fold excess of the latter abrogated FP9C binding; by contrast, competition with the GATA consensus sequence had no significant effect on FP9C formation even when the oligonucleotide was added in vast molar excess (Fig. 3 C). Hence, a transcription factor other than GATA binds to the imperfect GATA palindrome of FP9 in theCOL11A1-positive rhabdomyosarcoma cells. OPA is a potent chelator of zinc and an effective inhibitor of DNA binding by zinc-finger proteins (23Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Consistent with this property, formation of GATA-1 between the MELC extract and the GATA consensus sequence was gradually blocked by increasing amounts of OPA (Fig.5 A). The same result was obtained with the FP9 probe and the A-204 nuclear extract, thus implying that the factor recognizing the dyad of symmetry in the COL11A1promoter is most certainly a zinc-finger protein. Assuming a globular conformation for both proteins, the slower migration of FP9C compared with GATA-1 could be interpreted as suggesting that the former complex may be larger than the average GATA protein (∼50 kDa) (21Simon M.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we estimated the molecular mass of the denatured protein by gel filtration chromatography. To this end, A-204 nuclear extract was denatured before being applied to the column equilibrated in the same denaturing buffer and the resulting fractions were renatured prior to be tested by the EMSA. Maximum FP9C binding activity was observed around a molecular range (80–120 kDa) significantly greater than the one expected for a GATA protein (Fig. 5 B). A similar estimate was obtained for the native protein using glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis (data not shown). In sum, the above experiments suggested that an apparently novel ∼100-kDa zinc-finger protein binds to a critical upstream regulator of the proximalCOL11A1 promoter. The absence of FP9C binding activity in MELC nuclei raised the possibility that theCOL11A1 activator may only be present in a restricted number of cells. To test this hypothesis, we undertook a systematic EMSA screen of nuclear extracts from normal and transformed cell lines. In addition to the rhabdomyosarcoma A-204, substantial amount of FP9C was observed in cells of mesenchymal origins, such as chondrocytes and smc, and in keratinocytes and vascular endothelial cells (Fig.6 A). By contrast, little or no FP9C binding activity was seen with nuclear extracts from fibroblasts, T-lymphocytes, neurogenic cells, hepatocytes, and melanocytes (Fig.6 A). Binding of the ubiquitous NF-1 protein to its cognate site was nearly the same in fibroblasts compared to A-204 nuclear extracts, thus indirectly validating the significant difference in FP9C content between the cell lines (Fig. 6 B). Finally, Northern blot hybridizations established a positive correlation between FP9C binding activity and COL11A1 gene expression (Fig.6 C). Altogether, the results strongly suggested that FP9C may be a regulator of cell type-specific transcription, in addition to controlling COL11A1 gene expression. Aside from FP9C, smc nuclear extracts yielded a second and less evident complex whose relative migration appeared similar to that of GATA-1 (Fig. 6 A). This raised the possibility that the second complex could either correspond to an smc-specific GATA protein or represent a product of FP9C degradation. A methylation interference test was therefore performed on each of the smc retarded bands to discriminate between these alternatives. As expected, the slower migrating EMSA band of the smc sample (B1) yielded the same contact points as the single band of the A-204 sample (Fig. 4, compareA and B). By contrast, the faster migrating band of the smc sample (B2) yielded a pattern different from FP9C but identical to GATA-1 (Fig. 4, compare B and C). Furthermore, competition with GATA consensus sequence eliminated the faster but not the slower migrating complex of the smc sample (data not shown). Recent expression data support the idea that the smc complex bound by FP9 is likely to correspond to GATA-6 (24Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Aside from establishing the contact points of GATA-6, the methylation interference assay reiterated the specificity of FP9C binding and the identity of the F"
