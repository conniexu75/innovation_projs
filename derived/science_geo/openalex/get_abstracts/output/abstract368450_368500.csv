https://openalex.org/W1589359576,"Helical Dirac fermions-charge carriers that behave as massless relativistic particles with an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) locked to its translational momentum-are proposed to be the key to realizing fundamentally new phenomena in condensed matter physics. Prominent examples include the anomalous quantization of magneto-electric coupling, half-fermion states that are their own antiparticle, and charge fractionalization in a Bose-Einstein condensate, all of which are not possible with conventional Dirac fermions of the graphene variety. Helical Dirac fermions have so far remained elusive owing to the lack of necessary spin-sensitive measurements and because such fermions are forbidden to exist in conventional materials harbouring relativistic electrons, such as graphene or bismuth. It has recently been proposed that helical Dirac fermions may exist at the edges of certain types of topologically ordered insulators-materials with a bulk insulating gap of spin-orbit origin and surface states protected against scattering by time-reversal symmetry-and that their peculiar properties may be accessed provided the insulator is tuned into the so-called topological transport regime. However, helical Dirac fermions have not been observed in existing topological insulators. Here we report the realization and characterization of a tunable topological insulator in a bismuth-based class of material by combining spin-imaging and momentum-resolved spectroscopies, bulk charge compensation, Hall transport measurements and surface quantum control. Our results reveal a spin-momentum locked Dirac cone carrying a non-trivial Berry's phase that is nearly 100 per cent spin-polarized, which exhibits a tunable topological fermion density in the vicinity of the Kramers point and can be driven to the long-sought topological spin transport regime. The observed topological nodal state is shown to be protected even up to 300 K. Our demonstration of room-temperature topological order and non-trivial spin-texture in stoichiometric Bi(2)Se(3).M(x) (M(x) indicates surface doping or gating control) paves the way for future graphene-like studies of topological insulators, and applications of the observed spin-polarized edge channels in spintronic and computing technologies possibly at room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1999611081,"The basal ganglia support learning to exploit decisions that have yielded positive outcomes in the past. In contrast, limited evidence implicates the prefrontal cortex in the process of making strategic exploratory decisions when the magnitude of potential outcomes is unknown. Here we examine neurogenetic contributions to individual differences in these distinct aspects of motivated human behavior, using a temporal decision-making task and computational analysis. We show that two genes controlling striatal dopamine function, DARPP-32 (also called PPP1R1B) and DRD2, are associated with exploitative learning to adjust response times incrementally as a function of positive and negative decision outcomes. In contrast, a gene primarily controlling prefrontal dopamine function (COMT) is associated with a particular type of 'directed exploration', in which exploratory decisions are made in proportion to Bayesian uncertainty about whether other choices might produce outcomes that are better than the status quo. Quantitative model fits reveal that genetic factors modulate independent parameters of a reinforcement learning system."

https://openalex.org/W2110652874,"Evf2 is a polyadenylated, noncoding RNA that is transcribed from the intergenic region of Dlx5 and Dlx6, which are genes for homeodomain transcriptional factors. The authors now show that the loss of Evf2 in mice results in a substantial reduction of GABAergic interneurons via interference with Dlx5/6 expression. Genomic studies demonstrate that, although the majority of the mammalian genome is transcribed, only about 2% of these transcripts are code for proteins. We investigated how the long, polyadenylated Evf2 noncoding RNA regulates transcription of the homeodomain transcription factors DLX5 and DLX6 in the developing mouse forebrain. We found that, in developing ventral forebrain, Evf2 recruited DLX and MECP2 transcription factors to important DNA regulatory elements in the Dlx5/6 intergenic region and controlled Dlx5, Dlx6 and Gad1 expression through trans and cis-acting mechanisms. Evf2 mouse mutants had reduced numbers of GABAergic interneurons in early postnatal hippocampus and dentate gyrus. Although the numbers of GABAergic interneurons and Gad1 RNA levels returned to normal in Evf2 mutant adult hippocampus, reduced synaptic inhibition occurred. These results suggest that noncoding RNA–dependent balanced gene regulation in embryonic brain is critical for proper formation of GABA-dependent neuronal circuitry in adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W2114342948,"Oscar Fernandez-Capetillo and colleagues report a mouse model of the human Seckel syndrome characterized by a deficiency in ATR. The Seckel mice show high levels of replicative stress during embryogenesis, and the adults show premature aging. Although DNA damage is considered a driving force for aging, the nature of the damage that arises endogenously remains unclear. Replicative stress, a source of endogenous DNA damage, is prevented primarily by the ATR kinase. We have developed a mouse model of Seckel syndrome characterized by a severe deficiency in ATR. Seckel mice show high levels of replicative stress during embryogenesis, when proliferation is widespread, but this is reduced to marginal amounts in postnatal life. In spite of this decrease, adult Seckel mice show accelerated aging, which is further aggravated in the absence of p53. Together, these results support a model whereby replicative stress, particularly in utero, contributes to the onset of aging in postnatal life, and this is balanced by the replicative stress–limiting role of the checkpoint proteins ATR and p53."

https://openalex.org/W2044947801,"What are the atomic motions at enzymatic catalytic sites on the timescale of chemical change? Combined experimental and computational chemistry approaches take advantage of transition-state analogs to reveal dynamic motions linked to transition-state formation. QM/MM transition path sampling from reactive complexes provides both temporal and dynamic information for barrier crossing. Fast (femtosecond to picosecond) dynamic motions provide essential links to enzymatic barrier crossing by local or promoting-mode dynamic searches through bond-vibrational space. Transition-state lifetimes are within the femtosecond timescales of bond vibrations and show no manifestations of stabilized, equilibrated complexes. The slow binding and protein conformational changes (microsecond to millisecond) also required for catalysis are temporally decoupled from the fast dynamic motions forming the transition state. According to this view of enzymatic catalysis, transition states are formed by fast, coincident dynamic excursions of catalytic site elements, while the binding of transition-state analogs is the conversion of the dynamic excursions to equilibrated states."

These enzymes have therefore emerged as promising targets for antiparasitic drugs. We report the crystal structures of three major parasite cysteine proteases, cruzain, falcipain-3, and the first reported structure of rhodesain, in complex with a class of potent, small molecule, cysteine protease inhibitors, the vinyl sulfones. These data, in conjunction with comparative inhibition kinetics, provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that drive cysteine protease inhibition by vinyl sulfones, the binding specificity of these important proteases and the potential of vinyl sulfones as antiparasitic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2101640561,"Learned associations between effects of abused drugs and the drug administration environment are important in drug addiction. Histochemical and electrophysiological studies suggest that these associations are encoded in sparsely distributed nucleus accumbens neurons that are selectively activated by drugs and drug-associated cues. Although correlations have been observed between nucleus accumbens neuronal activity and responsivity to drugs and drug cues, no technique exists for selectively manipulating these activated neurons and establishing their causal role in behavioral effects of drugs and drug cues. Here we describe a new approach, which we term the 'Daun02 inactivation method', that selectively inactivates a minority of neurons previously activated by cocaine in an environment repeatedly paired with cocaine to demonstrate a causal role for these activated neurons in context-specific cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization in rats. This method provides a new tool for studying the causal roles of selectively activated neurons in behavioral effects of drugs and drug cues and in other learned behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2086484705,"Notch1 inhibits cardiac progenitor cell expansion by preventing the accumulation of phosphorylated β-catenin, which normally promotes their proliferation. In a feedback loop, Notch1 positively regulates the expression of cardiac transcription factors to induce progenitor cell differentiation, whereas β-catenin has the reverse effect. Regulation of multipotent cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) expansion and subsequent differentiation into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle or endothelial cells is a fundamental aspect of basic cardiovascular biology and cardiac regenerative medicine. However, the mechanisms governing these decisions remain unclear. Here, we show that Wnt/β-catenin signalling, which promotes expansion of CPCs1,2,3, is negatively regulated by Notch1-mediated control of phosphorylated β-catenin accumulation within CPCs, and that Notch1 activity in CPCs is required for their differentiation. Notch1 positively, and β-catenin negatively, regulated expression of the cardiac transcription factors, Isl1, Myocd and Smyd1. Surprisingly, disruption of Isl1, normally expressed transiently in CPCs before their differentiation4, resulted in expansion of CPCs in vivo and in an embryonic stem (ES) cell system. Furthermore, Isl1 was required for CPC differentiation into cardiomyocyte and smooth muscle cells, but not endothelial cells. These findings reveal a regulatory network controlling CPC expansion and cell fate that involves unanticipated functions of β-catenin, Notch1 and Isl1 that may be leveraged for regenerative approaches involving CPCs."
https://openalex.org/W2080795320,"The in vitro generation of neurons from embryonic stem (ES) cells is a promising approach to produce cells suitable for neural tissue repair and cell-based replacement therapies of the nervous system. Available methods to promote ES cell differentiation towards neural lineages attempt to replicate, in different ways, the multistep process of embryonic neural development. However, to achieve this aim in an efficient and reproducible way, a better knowledge of the cellular and molecular events that are involved in the process, from the initial specification of neuroepithelial progenitors to their terminal differentiation into neurons and glial cells, is required.In this work, we characterize the main stages and transitions that occur when ES cells are driven into a neural fate, using an adherent monolayer culture system. We established improved conditions to routinely produce highly homogeneous cultures of neuroepithelial progenitors, which organize into neural tube-like rosettes when they acquire competence for neuronal production. Within rosettes, neuroepithelial progenitors display morphological and functional characteristics of their embryonic counterparts, namely, apico-basal polarity, active Notch signalling, and proper timing of production of neurons and glia. In order to characterize the global gene activity correlated with each particular stage of neural development, the full transcriptome of different cell populations that arise during the in vitro differentiation protocol was determined by microarray analysis. By using embryo-oriented criteria to cluster the differentially expressed genes, we define five gene expression signatures that correlate with successive stages in the path from ES cells to neurons. These include a gene signature for a primitive ectoderm-like stage that appears after ES cells enter differentiation, and three gene signatures for subsequent stages of neural progenitor development, from an early stage that follows neural induction to a final stage preceding terminal differentiation.Overall, our work confirms and extends the cellular and molecular parallels between monolayer ES cell neural differentiation and embryonic neural development, revealing in addition novel aspects of the genetic network underlying the multistep process that leads from uncommitted cells to differentiated neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1984538804,"Synaptic plasticity is dependent on the differential sorting, delivery and retention of neurotransmitter receptors, but the mechanisms underlying these processes are poorly understood. We found that differential sorting of glutamate receptor subtypes began in the endoplasmic reticulum of rat hippocampal neurons. As AMPA receptors (AMPARs) were trafficked to the plasma membrane via the conventional somatic Golgi network, NMDA receptors (NMDARs) were diverted from the somatic endoplasmic reticulum into a specialized endoplasmic reticulum subcompartment that bypasses somatic Golgi, merging instead with dendritic Golgi outposts. This endoplasmic reticulum subcompartment was composed of highly mobile vesicles containing the NMDAR subunits NR1 and NR2B, the microtubule-dependent motor protein KIF17, and the postsynaptic adaptor proteins CASK and SAP97. Our data demonstrate that the retention and trafficking of NMDARs in this endoplasmic reticulum subcompartment requires both CASK and SAP97. These findings indicate that NMDARs are sorted away from AMPARs via a non-conventional secretory pathway that utilizes dendritic Golgi outposts."
https://openalex.org/W2009169025,"Trade in ornamental fishes represents, by far, the largest route for the importation of exotic vertebrates. There is growing pressure to regulate this trade with the goal of ensuring that species are sustainably harvested and that their point of origin is accurately reported. One important element of such regulation involves easy access to specimen identifications, a task that is currently difficult for all but specialists because of the large number of species involved. The present study represents an important first step in making identifications more accessible by assembling a DNA barcode reference sequence library for nearly half of the ornamental fish species imported into North America.Analysis of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene from 391 species from 8 coral reef locations revealed that 98% of these species exhibit distinct barcode clusters, allowing their unambiguous identification. Most species showed little intra-specific variation (adjusted mean = 0.21%), but nine species included two or three lineages showing much more divergence (2.19-6.52%) and likely represent overlooked species complexes. By contrast, three genera contained a species pair or triad that lacked barcode divergence, cases that may reflect hybridization, young taxa or taxonomic over-splitting.Although incomplete, this barcode library already provides a new species identification tool for the ornamental fish industry, opening a realm of applications linked to collection practices, regulatory control and conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2004153371,"During neuronal development, the axonal growth rate is regulated in conjunction with pathfinding. Stimulation of localized mRNA translation of the polarity protein PAR3 by neural growth factor (NGF) and netrin-1 is now shown to be required for axonal outgrowth. During development, axon growth rates are precisely regulated to provide temporal control over pathfinding1,2. The precise temporal regulation of axonal growth is a key step in the formation of functional synapses and the proper patterning of the nervous system. The rate of axonal elongation is increased by factors such as netrin-1 and nerve growth factor (NGF), which stimulate axon outgrowth using incompletely defined pathways. To clarify the mechanism of netrin-1- and NGF-stimulated axon growth, we explored the role of local protein translation. We found that intra-axonal protein translation is required for stimulated, but not basal, axon outgrowth. To identify the mechanism of translation-dependent outgrowth, we examined the PAR complex, a cytoskeleton regulator3. We found that the PAR complex, like local translation, is required for stimulated, but not basal, outgrowth. Par3 mRNA is localized to developing axons, and NGF and netrin-1 trigger its local translation. Selective ablation of Par3 mRNA from axons abolishes the outgrowth-promoting effect of NGF. These results identify a new role for local translation and the PAR complex in axonal outgrowth."

https://openalex.org/W2062632981,"Prevalence and risk factors for respiratory symptoms and airway obstruction in HIV-infected subjects in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are unknown. We evaluated respiratory symptoms and measured airway obstruction to identify the impact of HAART and other risk factors on respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function.Two hundred thirty-four HIV-infected adults without acute respiratory symptoms were recruited from an HIV clinic. All subjects were interviewed and performed spirometry. Multivariate linear and logistic regressions were performed to determine predictors of respiratory symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) percent predicted, and FEV(1)/forced vital capacity (FEV(1)/FVC). Thirty-one percent of subjects reported at least one respiratory symptom. Smoking status (current or former versus never) (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.41-5.22, p = 0.003), higher log plasma HIV viral levels (OR = 1.12, 95%CI = 1.02-1.24, p = 0.02), and lower FEV(1)/FVC (OR = 1.06 for every 0.01 decrease in FEV(1)/FVC, 95%CI = 1.02-1.14, p = 0.001) were independent predictors of respiratory symptoms. Age (p = 0.04), pack-year smoking history (p<0.001), previous bacterial pneumonia (p = 0.007), and HAART use (p = 0.04) were independent predictors of decreased FEV(1)/FVC.Respiratory symptoms remain common in HIV-infected subjects, especially in those with a smoking history. Subjects who were older, had a greater pack-year history of smoking, or previous bacterial pneumonia had lower FEV(1)/FVC ratios. Interestingly, use of HAART was independently associated with a decreased FEV(1)/FVC, possibly secondary to an immune response to subclinical infections, increased autoimmunity, or other factors associated with HAART use."

https://openalex.org/W2091843601,"The phase 2b trial of Merck's recombinant adenovirus type 5–based HIV-1 vaccine was halted as the vaccine seemed to have increased HIV-1 acquisition in vaccine recipients who had preexisting immunity to the adenovirus vector. One theory to explain these results is that the preexisting antibody response to the vector may have been a surrogate for increased vector-specific CD4+ T cells, which would have been amplified after vaccination and may have served as increased target cells during subsequent HIV-1 exposure. Daniel Barouch and his colleagues and Michael Betts and his colleagues now challenge this view. The immunologic basis for the potential enhanced HIV-1 acquisition in adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5)-seropositive individuals who received the Merck recombinant Ad5 HIV-1 vaccine in the STEP study remains unclear. Here we show that baseline Ad5-specific neutralizing antibodies are not correlated with Ad5-specific T lymphocyte responses and that Ad5-seropositive subjects do not develop higher vector-specific cellular immune responses as compared with Ad5-seronegative subjects after vaccination. These findings challenge the hypothesis that activated Ad5-specific T lymphocytes were the cause of the potential enhanced HIV-1 susceptibility in the STEP study."
https://openalex.org/W2083811314,"Pairing centres are specialized regions on worm chromosomes that mediate homologous pairing during meiosis. Sequence motifs that recruit proteins involved in pairing have been identified and they are sufficient for chromosome synapsis and segregation during meiosis. Caenorhabditis elegans chromosomes contain specialized regions called pairing centres, which mediate homologous pairing and synapsis during meiosis. Four related proteins, ZIM-1, 2, 3 and HIM-8, associate with these sites and are required for their essential functions. Here we show that short sequence elements enriched in the corresponding chromosome regions selectively recruit these proteins in vivo. In vitro analysis using SELEX indicates that the binding specificity of each protein arises from a combination of two zinc fingers and an adjacent domain. Insertion of a cluster of recruiting motifs into a chromosome lacking its endogenous pairing centre is sufficient to restore homologous pairing, synapsis, crossover recombination and segregation. These findings help to illuminate how chromosome sites mediate essential aspects of meiotic chromosome dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2047955093,"STIM1 and ORAI1, the two limiting components in the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) signaling cascade, have been reported to interact upon store depletion, culminating in CRAC current activation. We have recently identified a modulatory domain between amino acids 474 and 485 in the cytosolic part of STIM1 that comprises 7 negatively charged residues. A STIM1 C-terminal fragment lacking this domain exhibits enhanced interaction with ORAI1 and 2-3-fold higher ORAI1/CRAC current densities. Here we focused on the role of this CRAC modulatory domain (CMD) in the fast inactivation of ORAI1/CRAC channels, utilizing the whole-cell patch clamp technique. STIM1 mutants either with C-terminal deletions including CMD or with 7 alanines replacing the negative amino acids within CMD gave rise to ORAI1 currents that displayed significantly reduced or even abolished inactivation when compared with STIM1 mutants with preserved CMD. Consistent results were obtained with cytosolic C-terminal fragments of STIM1, both in ORAI1-expressing HEK 293 cells and in RBL-2H3 mast cells containing endogenous CRAC channels. Inactivation of the latter, however, was much more pronounced than that of ORAI1. The extent of inactivation of ORAI3 channels, which is also considerably more prominent than that of ORAI1, was also substantially reduced by co-expression of STIM1 constructs missing CMD. Regarding the dependence of inactivation on Ca(2+), a decrease in intracellular Ca(2+) chelator concentrations promoted ORAI1 current fast inactivation, whereas Ba(2+) substitution for extracellular Ca(2+) completely abrogated it. In summary, CMD within the STIM1 cytosolic part provides a negative feedback signal to Ca(2+) entry by triggering fast Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of ORAI/CRAC channels."
https://openalex.org/W2046520914,"Background and Aims Celiac sprue is a life-long disease characterized by an intestinal inflammatory response to dietary gluten. A gluten-free diet is an effective treatment for most patients, but accidental ingestion of gluten is common, leading to incomplete recovery or relapse. Food-grade proteases capable of detoxifying moderate quantities of dietary gluten could mitigate this problem. Methods We evaluated the gluten detoxification properties of two food-grade enzymes, aspergillopepsin (ASP) from Aspergillus niger and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) from Aspergillus oryzae. The ability of each enzyme to hydrolyze gluten was tested against synthetic gluten peptides, a recombinant gluten protein, and simulated gastric digests of whole gluten and whole-wheat bread. Reaction products were analyzed by mass spectrometry, HPLC, ELISA with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an immunodominant gluten epitope, and a T cell proliferation assay. Results ASP markedly enhanced gluten digestion relative to pepsin, and cleaved recombinant α2-gliadin at multiple sites in a non-specific manner. When used alone, neither ASP nor DPPIV efficiently cleaved synthetic immunotoxic gluten peptides. This lack of specificity for gluten was especially evident in the presence of casein, a competing dietary protein. However, supplementation of ASP with DPPIV enabled detoxification of moderate amounts of gluten in the presence of excess casein and in whole-wheat bread. ASP was also effective at enhancing the gluten-detoxifying efficacy of cysteine endoprotease EP-B2 under simulated gastric conditions. Conclusions Clinical studies are warranted to evaluate whether a fixed dose ratio combination of ASP and DPPIV can provide near-term relief for celiac patients suffering from inadvertent gluten exposure. Due to its markedly greater hydrolytic activity against gluten than endogenous pepsin, food-grade ASP may also augment the activity of therapeutically relevant doses of glutenases such as EP-B2 and certain prolyl endopeptidases."

These findings indicate no causative role for Ad5-specific CD4(+) T cells in increasing HIV-1 susceptibility in the STEP trial."
https://openalex.org/W1992655510,"The multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin (MARTX) toxin of Vibrio cholerae causes destruction of the actin cytoskeleton by covalent cross-linking of actin and inactivation of Rho GTPases. The effector domains responsible for these activities are here shown to be independent proteins released from the large toxin by autoproteolysis catalyzed by an embedded cysteine protease domain (CPD). The CPD is activated upon binding inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)). In this study, we demonstrated that InsP(6) is not simply an allosteric cofactor, but rather binding of InsP(6) stabilized the CPD structure, facilitating formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. The 1.95-A crystal structure of this InsP(6)-bound unprocessed form of CPD was determined and revealed the scissile bond Leu(3428)-Ala(3429) captured in the catalytic site. Upon processing at this site, CPD was converted to a form with 500-fold reduced affinity for InsP(6), but was reactivated for high affinity binding of InsP(6) by cooperative binding of both a new substrate and InsP(6). Reactivation of CPD allowed cleavage of the MARTX toxin at other sites, specifically at leucine residues between the effector domains. Processed CPD also cleaved other proteins in trans, including the leucine-rich protein YopM, demonstrating that it is a promiscuous leucine-specific protease."
https://openalex.org/W2041400263,"Cellular response to DNA damage involves the coordinated activation of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. The early steps of DNA damage recognition and signaling in mammalian cells are not yet fully understood. To investigate the regulation of the DNA damage response (DDR), we designed short and stabilized double stranded DNA molecules (Dbait) mimicking double-strand breaks. We compared the response induced by these molecules to the response induced by ionizing radiation. We show that stable 32-bp long Dbait, induce pan-nuclear phosphorylation of DDR components such as H2AX, Rpa32, Chk1, Chk2, Nbs1 and p53 in various cell lines. However, individual cell analyses reveal that differences exist in the cellular responses to Dbait compared to irradiation. Responses to Dbait: (i) are dependent only on DNA-PK kinase activity and not on ATM, (ii) result in a phosphorylation signal lasting several days and (iii) are distributed in the treated population in an ""all-or-none"" pattern, in a Dbait-concentration threshold dependant manner. Moreover, despite extensive phosphorylation of the DNA-PK downstream targets, Dbait treated cells continue to proliferate without showing cell cycle delay or apoptosis. Dbait treatment prior to irradiation impaired foci formation of Nbs1, 53BP1 and Rad51 at DNA damage sites and inhibited non-homologous end joining as well as homologous recombination. Together, our results suggest that the hyperactivation of DNA-PK is insufficient for complete execution of the DDR but induces a ""false"" DNA damage signaling that disorganizes the DNA repair system."
https://openalex.org/W2100790556,"There is little information on how neuropeptide Y (NPY) proteolysis by peptidases occurs in serum, in part because reliable techniques are lacking to distinguish different NPY immunoreactive forms and also because the factors affecting the expression of these enzymes have been poorly studied. In the present study, LC-MS/MS was used to identify and quantify NPY fragments resulting from peptidolytic cleavage of NPY(1-36) upon incubation with human serum. Kinetic studies indicated that NPY(1-36) is rapidly cleaved in serum into 3 main fragments with the following order of efficacy: NPY(3-36) >> NPY(3-35) > NPY(2-36). Trace amounts of additional NPY forms were identified by accurate mass spectrometry. Specific inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV, kallikrein, and aminopeptidase P prevented the production of NPY(3-36), NPY(3-35), and NPY(2-36), respectively. Plasma kallikrein at physiological concentrations converted NPY(3-36) into NPY(3-35). Receptor binding assays revealed that NPY(3-35) is unable to bind to NPY Y1, Y2, and Y5 receptors; thus NPY(3-35) may represent the major metabolic clearance product of the Y2/Y5 agonist, NPY(3-36)."
https://openalex.org/W2019326965,"Background Amino acid absorption in the form of di- and tripeptides is mediated by the intestinal proton-coupled peptide transporter PEPT-1 (formally OPT-2) in Caenorhabditits elegans. Transporter-deficient animals (pept-1(lg601)) show impaired growth, slowed postembryonal development and major changes in amino acid status. Principal Findings Here we demonstrate that abolished intestinal peptide transport also leads to major metabolic alterations that culminate in a two fold increase in total body fat content. Feeding of C. elegans with [U-13C]-labelled E. coli revealed a decreased de novo synthesis of long-chain fatty acids in pept-1(lg601) and reduced levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. mRNA profiling revealed increased transcript levels of enzymes/transporters needed for peroxisomal β-oxidation and decreased levels for those required for fatty acid synthesis, elongation and desaturation. As a prime and most fundamental process that may account for the increased fat content in pept-1(lg601) we identified a highly accelerated absorption of free fatty acids from the bacterial food in the intestine. Conclusions The influx of free fatty acids into intestinal epithelial cells is strongly dependent on alterations in intracellular pH which is regulated by the interplay of PEPT-1 and the sodium-proton exchanger NHX-2. We here provide evidence for a central mechanism by which the PEPT-1/NHX-2 system strongly influences the in vivo fat content of C. elegans. Loss of PEPT-1 decreases intestinal proton influx leading to a higher uptake of free fatty acids with fat accumulation whereas loss of NHX-2 causes intracellular acidification by the PEPT-1 mediated proton/dipeptide symport with an almost abolished uptake of fatty acids and a lean phenotype."

In this ALI model, C5aR expression (protein) was found to occur on upper (bronchial) and lower (alveolar) airway epithelial cells. An adenovirus construct (siRNA) was used to silence mRNA for C5aR in the lung. Under such conditions, C5aR protein was markedly reduced on lung epithelial cells, resulting in much reduced leakage of albumin into the lung, diminished buildup of PMNs, and lower levels of proinflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. These studies indicate that bronchial and alveolar epithelial cell C5aR is up-regulated and greatly contributes to inflammation and injury in the lung. The use of siRNA administered into the airways avoids systemic suppression of C5aR, which might compromise innate immunity. It is possible that such an intervention might be employed in humans with ALI or acute respiratory distress syndrome as well as in upper-airway inflammatory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, where there is evidence for complement activation and buildup of PMNs.—Sun, L., Guo, R.-F., Gao, H., Sarma, J.

https://openalex.org/W1969321117,"Transthyretin (TTR) is one of thirty non-homologous proteins whose misfolding, dissociation, aggregation, and deposition is linked to human amyloid diseases. Previous studies have identified that TTR amyloidogenesis can be inhibited through stabilization of the native tetramer state by small molecule binding to the thyroid hormone sites of TTR. We have evaluated a new series of β-aminoxypropionic acids (compounds 5–21), with a single aromatic moiety (aryl or fluorenyl) linked through a flexible oxime tether to a carboxylic acid. These compounds are structurally distinct from the native ligand thyroxine and typical halogenated biaryl NSAID-like inhibitors to avoid off-target hormonal or anti-inflammatory activity. Based on an in vitro fibril formation assay, five of these compounds showed significant inhibition of TTR amyloidogenesis, with two fluorenyl compounds displaying inhibitor efficacy comparable to the well-known TTR inhibitor diflunisal. Fluorenyl 15 is the most potent compound in this series and importantly does not show off-target anti-inflammatory activity. Crystal structures of the TTR∶inhibitor complexes, in agreement with molecular docking studies, revealed that the aromatic moiety, linked to the sp2-hybridized oxime carbon, specifically directed the ligand in either a forward or reverse binding mode. Compared to the aryl family members, the bulkier fluorenyl analogs achieved more extensive interactions with the binding pockets of TTR and demonstrated better inhibitory activity in the fibril formation assay. Preliminary optimization efforts are described that focused on replacement of the C-terminal acid in both the aryl and fluorenyl series (compounds 22–32). The compounds presented here constitute a new class of TTR inhibitors that may hold promise in treating amyloid diseases associated with TTR misfolding."

In the current study, long-term cultures of rat spermatogonial stem cells were evaluated after cryo-storage for their potential to restore fertility to rats deficient in the DAZ-like (DAZL) gene. Detailed histological analysis of DAZL-deficient rat testes revealed an apparently intact spermatogonial stem cell compartment, but clear failure to produce mature haploid gametes resulting in infertility. After proliferating >1 million-fold in cell number during culture post-thaw, as few as 50,000 donor spermatogonia transplanted into only a single testis/recipient effectively restored fecundity to DAZL-deficient rats, yielding 100% germline transmission to progeny by natural mating. Based on these results, the potency and efficacy of this donor stem cell line for restoring fertility to azoospermic rodents is currently unprecedented. Prospectively, similar successes in humans could be directly linked to the feasibility of obtaining enough fully functional spermatogonial stem cells from minimal testis biopsies to be therapeutically effective. Thus, regeneration of sperm production in this sterile recipient provides an advanced pre-clinical model for optimizing the efficacy of stem cell therapies to cure a paradoxically increasing number of azoospermic men. This includes males that are rendered infertile by cancer therapies, specific types of endocrine or developmental defects, and germline-specific de novo mutations; all of whom may harbor healthy sources of their own spermatogonial stem cells for treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2092726410,"Despite the important role of T cell activation in the adaptive immunity, very little is known about the functions of proteins that are differentially expressed in the activated T cells. In this study, we have employed proteomic approach to study the differentially expressed proteins in activated T cells. A total of 25 proteins was characterized that displayed a decreased expression, while a total of 20 proteins was characterized that displayed an increased expression in the activated T cells. Among them, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was identified unexpectedly as one of the up-regulated proteins. Western blot analysis of proteins separated by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis had identified several modified GAPDHs which were detectable only in the activated T cells, but not in resting T cells. These modified GAPDHs had higher molecular mass and more basic PI, and were present in the nucleus of activated T cells. Promoter occupancy studies by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that nuclear GAPDH could be detected in the promoter of genes that were up-regulated during T cell activation, but not in the promoter of genes that were not unaffected or down-regulated. Our results suggest that nuclear GAPDH may function as transcriptional regulator in activated T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2018757429,"Background Neurosteroids have various physiological and neuropsychopharmacological effects. In addition to the genomic effects of steroids, some neurosteroids modulate several neurotransmitter receptors and channels, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, and σ1 receptors, and voltage-gated Ca2+ and K+ channels. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the various effects of neurosteroids have not yet been sufficiently clarified. In the nervous system, inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels also play important roles in the control of resting membrane potential, cellular excitability and K+ homeostasis. Among constitutively active Kir2 channels in a major Kir subfamily, Kir2.3 channels are expressed predominantly in the forebrain, a brain area related to cognition, memory, emotion, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study examined the effects of various neurosteroids on Kir2.3 channels using the Xenopus oocyte expression assay. In oocytes injected with Kir2.3 mRNA, only pregnenolone sulfate (PREGS), among nine neurosteroids tested, reversibly potentiated Kir2.3 currents. The potentiation effect was concentration-dependent in the micromolar range, and the current-voltage relationship showed inward rectification. However, the potentiation effect of PREGS was not observed when PREGS was applied intracellularly and was not affected by extracellular pH conditions. Furthermore, although Kir1.1, Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir3 channels were insensitive to PREGS, in oocytes injected with Kir2.1/Kir2.3 or Kir2.2/Kir2.3 mRNA, but not Kir2.1/Kir2.2 mRNA, PREGS potentiated Kir currents. These potentiation properties in the concentration-response relationships were less potent than for Kir2.3 channels, suggesting action of PREGS on Kir2.3-containing Kir2 heteromeric channels. Conclusions/Significance The present results suggest that PREGS acts as a positive modulator of Kir2.3 channels. Kir2.3 channel potentiation may provide novel insights into the various effects of PREGS."

Although these acidic residues are assumed to bind polyamines, the functional role of the binding of polyamines and Mg2+ to the intracellular regions of Kirs remains unclear. Here, we report thermodynamic and structural studies of the interaction between polyamines and the cytoplasmic pore of mouse Kir3.1/GIRK1, which is gated by binding of G-protein βγ-subunit (Gβγ).

Small but significant chemical shift perturbations upon spermine binding were observed in the subunit-subunit interface of the tetramer, suggesting that spermine binding alters the relative orientations of the four subunits. Our ITC and NMR results postulated a spermine binding mode, where one spermine molecule bridges two Asp-260 side chains from adjacent subunits, with rearrangement of the subunit orientations.

Physiol. 2007; 130: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These acidic residues are assumed to be responsible for the electrostatic interaction with polyamines, in which the nitrogen atoms are positively charged at neutral pH (20Frassineti C. Alderighi L. Gans P. Sabatini A. Vacca A. Ghelli S. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 376: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In other members of the Kir family, some of the electronegative residues are replaced by neutral ones, such as Gly and Ser. Although the total number of acidic residues correlates with the strength of inward rectification, the correlation cannot be completely explained for the strong rectifiers (9Pegan S. Arrabit C. Zhou W. Kwiatkowski W. Collins A. Slesinger P.A. Choe S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In Kir3.1/GIRK1, which exhibits relatively strong inward rectification among the Kir family proteins, two of the four important acidic residues in Kir2.1 (Glu-224 and Asp-255) are replaced by Ser (Ser-225 and Ser-256 in Kir3.1, respectively). This suggests that the binding site(s) and stoichiometry of polyamine binding differ among the Kir proteins. Although the binding of polyamines to the cytoplasmic pore of Kirs is considered to be required for the blockade of the transmembrane pore to enable the inward rectification (16Guo D. Lu Z. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 485-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Kurata H.T. Cheng W.W. Arrabit C. Slesinger P.A. Nichols C.G. J. Gen.

Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 541-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the functional role of the polyamine binding to the cytoplasmic pore is still unclear. In particular, Kir3/GIRK is activated by the binding of G-protein βγ-subunits (Gβγ) to the cytoplasmic pore through the conformational rearrangement of the channel (22Riven I. Kalmanzon E. Segev L. Reuveny E. Neuron. 2003; 38: 225-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, the elucidation of the binding mode of Kir and polyamines based on the detection of their direct interaction as well as the effects of the binding on the protein conformation provides insights into the functional roles of the cytoplasmic pore in the gating and the inward rectifying property of the channel. Here, we report the thermodynamic and structural analyses of the interaction between spermine and the intracellular regions of Kir3.1/GIRK1. Our isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) results indicated that two spermine molecules bind to a tetramer of Kir3.1/GIRK1, with a dissociation constant (Kd) value of 26 μm. NMR analyses together with ITC results revealed the spermine binding mode, in which one spermine molecule bridges two Asp-260 side chains of two adjacent subunits, with the alteration of the relative orientations of the four subunits. The spermine binding mode revealed here suggests the functional roles of the spermine binding to the cytoplasmic pore: in the resting state of the channel, spermine stabilizes a certain channel conformation, and upon activation, spermine is dissociated from the cytoplasmic pore through the Gβγ-induced conformational rearrangement, leading to rapid translocation to the transmembrane pore to block the outward K+ current. The N- and C-terminal intracellular regions (residues 41–63 and 190–371) of mouse Kir3.1/GIRK1 were fused into a single polypeptide, which is hereafter referred to as GIRKCP (cytoplasmic pore). The sample preparation of GIRKCP is described elsewhere (23Yokogawa M. Muramatsu T. Takeuchi K. Osawa M. Shimada I. Biomol. NMR Assign. 2009; 3: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA encoding GIRKCP with ten N-terminal His residues, followed by the PreScission protease cleavage site, was inserted into the pET24d(+) plasmid, which was transformed into the Escherichia coli C41 strain. Mutations were introduced by the QuikChange® (Stratagene) method. GIRKCP and its mutants were overexpressed in the C41 strain and were purified to homogeneity by His-select Ni affinity chromatography, His tag cleavage by PreScission protease, and then gel filtration using Superdex 200 PG (GE Healthcare). The elution profile of the gel-filtration column indicated that GIRKCP forms a tetramer, which was confirmed by a calibration curve made by standard proteins for molecular mass as well as the SEC-MALS experiments (see supplemental Fig. S1 for details). We prepared uniformly 2H,15N-labeled GIRKCP, whose amide hydrogen atoms were fully exchanged to 1H by unfolding with 6 m guanidine and subsequent refolding. The binding of spermine and Mg2+ to GIRKCP and its mutants was measured by ITC (24Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar), using a MicroCal VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal Inc.). The protein samples were dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES·NaOH (pH 7.0), 0–150 mm KCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. 900 μm spermine and 1.4 mm MgCl2 in the dialysis buffer were prepared as the injection solutions. Experiments were performed at 15–30 °C. A 30–47 μm solution of GIRKCP tetramer or its mutants was titrated by the injection of a total of 290 μl of 900 μm spermine or 1.4 mm MgCl2 in 29 aliquots. Because essentially no heat of dilution was observed by titrating the spermine solution into the dialysis buffer, the raw titration data were analyzed using the MicroCal Origin software version 5.0, provided by the manufacturer. The heat of dilution of MgCl2 was subtracted from the data for the MgCl2 titration into GIRKCP. The thermodynamic parameters are listed in TABLE 1, TABLE 2. All NMR experiments were performed at 35 °C on a Bruker Avance-800 or Avance-600 spectrometers equipped with cryogenic probes. The sample concentrations of GIRKCP and its mutants were 100–200 μm as the tetramer. To observe intermolecular NOE signals between spermine and GIRKCP, 15N-edited NOESY HSQC spectra were observed for uniformly 2H,15N-labeled GIRKCP, and the mutants Q271A, Q261A, and Q227A/Q261A, in 50 mm HEPES·NaOH buffer (pH 7.0), containing 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 8%(v/v) D2O. A two-dimensional NOESY spectrum was observed for the uniformly 2H-labeled GIRKCP, in which only isoleucine, methionine, or phenylalanine residues were selectively 1H,15N-labeled. The F255A mutant was also phenylalanine-selectively 1H,15N-labeled in a 2H-background, to confirm the assignments of the intermolecular NOE signals between Phe-255 and spermine. Each sample contained spermine at a 5 equiv. amount relative to the protein. The NOE mixing time was set at 300 ms. An aliquot of 700 μm spermine solution dissolved in the NMR sample buffer was used for the titration experiments, in which 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 equivalents of a tetramer of uniformly 2H,15N-labeled GIRKCP was added. After the addition of each aliquot of spermine, one-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H-15N TROSY spectra were acquired. The titration was performed up to a maximum spermine:tetramer of GIRKCP molar ratio of 5:1. It should be noted that GIRKCP exhibits no chemical shift change at the concentration range from 20 to 300 μm as a tetramer, and thus, the chemical shift changes through the spermine titration is not due to the sample dilution but the effects arisen from the interaction with spermine. The assignments of the backbone NMR signals from GIRKCP were reported (BioMagResBank accession number: 11067 (23Yokogawa M. Muramatsu T. Takeuchi K. Osawa M. Shimada I. Biomol. NMR Assign. 2009; 3: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar)). The assignments for the spermine-bound form of GIRKCP were transferred from those in the absence of spermine by tracing the chemical shift perturbation (CSP) upon spermine addition. The assignments for the spermine-bound form were confirmed by 15N-edited NOESY TROSY of the partially protonated GIRKCP, which was expressed in D2O-based M9 medium containing 1 g/liter 1H-glucose. The normalized CSP values (Δδ) were obtained using the formula, Δδ = {(Δδ1H)2+(Δδ15N/6.5)2}0.5 (25Mulder F.A. Schipper D. Bott R. Boelens R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The error values were calculated by the formula, 2 ·( Δδ1H ·R1H + Δδ15N ·R15N/6.52)/Δδ, where R1H and R15N are the digital resolutions in ppm in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively. 1H-15N TROSY spectra were observed for the E250N, D260N, D275N, and E300N mutants, and were compared with the spectrum of GIRKCP, to ascertain the structural effects of the mutations. In this study, we used the cytoplasmic pore of mouse Kir3.1/GIRK1, referred to as GIRKCP, which consists of residues 41–63 and 190–371 as a single polypeptide. The validity of this construct was indicated by its crystal structure (7Nishida M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 957-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 9Pegan S. Arrabit C. Zhou W. Kwiatkowski W. Collins A. Slesinger P.A. Choe S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), which was essentially identical to the structures of the cytoplasmic pores in the full-length Kir channels, such as KirBac1.1 and a chimera of KirBac1.3 and Kir3.1 (8Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 10Nishida M. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). GIRKCP was expressed in E. coli, and was purified to homogeneity. Size exclusion chromatography analyses in combination with multiple-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) indicated that the average molecular mass was 92 K (supplemental Fig. S1), corresponding to a tetramer of the theoretical mass of 24 K protein. ITC experiments were carried out to compare the binding properties of GIRKCP with spermine, spermidine, putrescine, and Mg2+. Fig. 1A shows the isotherms upon the titration of spermine into the GIRKCP solution. The best fit of the integrated isotherms using a single-site model indicated that two spermine molecules bind to a GIRKCP tetramer with a dissociation constant (Kd) value of 500 nm, in 50 mm KCl at 303 K. Spermidine and Mg2+ exhibited significantly lower affinities to GIRKCP (Fig. 1B and Table 1), which was 30- and 120-fold lower than spermine, respectively. A titration curve was not obtained for putrescine, although a certain amount of heat exchange was observed, suggesting that the binding is weak (Kd > 1 mm). Because the intracellular concentrations of spermine and spermidine are 0.1–1.0 mm, and 1.0–10 mm for Mg2+, spermine is the major binder to the intracellular regions of Kir3.1/GIRK. Therefore, our further analyses were focused on spermine as a Kir blocker.TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters for the interaction of GIRKCP with polyamines and MgCl2InjectantTemperatureKClModelStoichiometry per tetramerKdΔHΔSKmmμmkcal/molkcal/mol KSpermine3030Two sitesaA two-site model was applied, in which the stoichiometry and the ΔH value for the first binding site are fixed as one and the value of the y-section of the isotherm, respectively.First site 1 (fixed)0.06 ± 0.01−6.00 (fixed)0.013Second site 0.99 ± 0.010.22 ± 0.04−2.33 ± 0.060.2330350Single sites1.835 ± 0.0070.49 ± 0.04−2.54 ± 0.020.020303100Single sites1.784 ± 0.0076.8 ± 0.4−2.10 ± 0.010.017303150Single sites1.772 ± 0.00425.9 ± 0.04−1.809 ± 0.0060.01528350Single sites1.82 ± 0.010.34 ± 0.040.839 ± 0.0070.03328850Single sites1.2 ± 0.23 ± 30.23 ± 0.040.02629350Single sites1.60 ± 0.010.66 ± 0.09−0.97 ± 0.010.02529850Single sites1.54 ± 0.010.82 ± 0.09−1.93 ± 0.020.021Spermidine30350Single sites1.57 ± 0.0816 ± 3−2.0 ± 0.10.015Putrescine30350N/AMgCl229850Single sites2.4 ± 0.2101 ± 17−0.7 ± 0.10.016a A two-site model was applied, in which the stoichiometry and the ΔH value for the first binding site are fixed as one and the value of the y-section of the isotherm, respectively. Open table in a new tab To estimate the electrostatic contribution to the spermine binding, ITC experiments were performed at various KCl concentrations, from 0 to 150 mm. While the binding stoichiometry was unchanged, the Kd values increased as the KCl concentration increased (Fig. 2 and Table 1). At the nearly physiological KCl concentration of 150 mm, the Kd value was 26 μm. In addition, the heat capacity change upon binding (ΔCp), i.e. the temperature dependence of the enthalpy change (ΔH), was evaluated by performing the ITC experiment at various temperatures (Fig. 3). At the KCl concentration of 50 mm, ΔCp was −0.19 kcal/mol K. The negative ΔCp value suggests that desolvation from the surface of GIRKCP and/or spermine occurs upon binding. The recently reported crystal structure of the cytoplasmic pore of Kir2.1 as well as the site-directed mutagenesis identified four acidic residues (Glu-224, Asp-255, Asp-259, and Glu-299) in the intracellular region that influence inward rectification (9Pegan S. Arrabit C. Zhou W. Kwiatkowski W. Collins A. Slesinger P.A. Choe S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Two of the corresponding residues are conserved in Kir3.1/GIRK1 (Asp-260 and Glu-300). Although the mutations of these residues impaired the inward rectification in Kir2.1 (9Pegan S. Arrabit C. Zhou W. Kwiatkowski W. Collins A. Slesinger P.A. Choe S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 13Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 14Kubo Y. Murata Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the residues that directly bind remained unknown. To identify the spermine-interacting residues in Kir3.1/GIRK1, we obtained intermolecular NOEs between GIRKCP and spermine, which in principle are observed between two protons existing within 5 Å. The proton resonances from spermine were assigned by the combination of NOESY and DQF-COSY experiments. The protons at positions 2 and 6 resonate at 2.1 and 1.7 ppm, respectively, and the signals from positions 1, 3, and 5 are overlapped at 3.1 ppm (Fig. 4A). Only one set of NMR signals for spermine was observed. When the spermine concentration was successively increased in the presence of a constant amount of GIRKCP, the chemical shift values for the spermine NMR signals gradually shifted up to those in the free-state, indicating that spermine undergoes fast exchange on the NMR time scale between the protein-bound state and the free state. Therefore, we observed the transferred NOE signals as follows, using a sample containing 5 equivalent amount of spermine per GIRKCP tetramer, in which the molar ratio of the bound spermine and free spermine is 2:3. The 15N-edited NOESY HSQC spectrum for uniformly 2H,15N-labeled GIRKCP mixed with a saturating amount of spermine exhibited only a few NOE signals between the spermine protons at positions 1/3/5 and 6 and the side chain amide protons of two of the Asn and/or Gln residues (Fig. 4B, black). The absence of an NOE at position 2 strongly suggests that the NOE signals at 3.1 ppm are probably from position 5, and not from 1 or 3. A closer look at the crystal structure of GIRKCP revealed that there are only two Gln residues (Gln-227 and Gln-261) and no Asn residue among the residues exposed to the cytoplasmic pore. We prepared three mutants (Q227A, Q261A, and Q227A/Q261A), and confirmed their binding affinities for GIRKCP by ITC (Table 2). We then performed 15N-edited NOESY HSQC experiments under the same conditions as those for the wild-type GIRKCP. The intermolecular NOE signals for only one Gln residue were observed for the mutants, Q227A and Q261A (supplemental Fig. S2), while no intermolecular NOE signal was observed for the Q227A/Q261A mutant (Fig. 4B, red). Meanwhile, the ITC experiment indicated that the spermine binding affinity was essentially unchanged by the mutation of Q227A/Q261A (Table 2). Thus, the intermolecular NOEs were assigned between the side chain amide protons of Gln-227 and Gln-261 and the spermine protons at positions 5 and 6. No other NOE signals between the amide protons of the protein and spermine were observed.TABLE 2Thermodynamic parameters for the interactions of GIRKCP mutants with spermineMutantModelStoichiometry per tetramerKdΔHΔSμmkcal/molkcal/mol KWild typeaData for the wild type GIRKCP are presented for reference.Single sites1.54 ± 0.010.82 ± 0.09−1.93 ± 0.020.021E250NN/AD260NN/AD275NSingle sites1.74 ± 0.011.4 ± 0.1−2.09 ± 0.020.02E300NN/AQ227A/Q261ASingle sites1.656 ± 0.0030.29 ± 0.01−6.75 ± 0.020.0073F255ASingle sites1.194 ± 0.0053.0 ± 0.2−0.845 ± 0.050.022a Data for the wild type GIRKCP are presented for reference. Open table in a new tab Furthermore, we explored the intermolecular NOEs with hydrophobic residues in the vicinity of Gln-227 and Gln-261, which are located between Asp-260 and Glu-300. We prepared the protein samples with Phe, Ile, or Met-selective 1H,15N-labeling in a 2H-background, since Phe-255 and Ile-302 are proximal to Asp-260 and Glu-300, respectively, and Met-308 exists at the exit of the cytoplasmic pore on the membrane side (see Fig. 4D). While no intermolecular NOEs were observed for Ile- or Met-selectively 1H-labeled GIRKCP, the Phe-selectively labeled protein showed NOE peaks between the aromatic protons of a phenylalanine residue and positions 1/3/5, 2 and 6 of spermine (Fig. 4C, black). These NOEs were assigned by the fact that the F255A mutant did not exhibit any intermolecular NOEs from the aromatic proton of the mutants (Fig. 4C, red), while the mutant retained the spermine binding affinity (Table 2). In summary, Gln-227, Gln-261, and Phe-255 were identified to exist in the proximity (within 5 Å) of the bound spermine molecules. The side chain amide protons of Gln-227 and Gln-261 are close to positions 5 and 6 of the spermine protons, while the aromatic protons of Phe-255 are close to all of the protons of the spermine methylene groups (Fig. 4D). The spermine binding effect on GIRKCP was also investigated by CSP, which reflects the direct spermine-binding as well as the conformational change of the protein. A number of the 1H-15N TROSY signals for the backbone amide groups of GIRKCP changed their chemical shifts upon spermine binding. Fig. 5A shows the spectral overlay of the TROSY spectra in the absence and presence of spermine, and a plot of the normalized CSP values (Δδ) against the residue numbers of GIRKCP. The residues with significant CSPs (Δδ ≥ 0.08 ppm) are Phe-46, Gly-58, Thr-193, Gln-227, Ser-235, Gln-248, Val-253, Ser-256, Gly-336, and Phe-337 (Fig. 5B). The mapping of these residues on the structures (Fig. 5, panels C and D) indicates that Gln-227, Val-253, and Ser-256 exist at the inner pore site, where the intermolecular NOEs were observed (residues Gln-227, Phe-255, and Gln-261), and that the rest of the perturbed residues are located at the subunit-subunit interface of the tetramer, which is distal to the spermine binding site (Fig. 5D). In particular, Phe-46 and Gln-248 form hydrogen bonds with the Glu-294 and Phe-263 of the adjacent subunit, respectively, in the crystal structure of the spermine-free form of the GIRKCP (PDB code: 1N9P). Therefore, the CSPs for the residues at the subunit-subunit interface should be interpreted as the rearrangement of the relative orientations of the subunits.FIGURE 5Chemical shift perturbation of the backbone NMR signals of GIRKCP upon spermine binding.

To evaluate the contribution of the two acidic residues, Asp-260 and Glu-300, to the spermine binding, the mutants that neutralize their negative charge (D260N and E300N) were characterized by ITC and NMR. In addition, we investigated two other acidic residues, Glu-250 and Asp-275, using the E250N and D275N mutants. ITC experiments revealed no heat exchange upon spermine injections to E250N, D260N, or E300N (data not shown). The affinity of D275N for spermine was essentially identical to that of the wild-type protein (Table 2). The chemical shift differences between these mutants and the wild type were then investigated by 1H-15N TROSY spectra. The Asn mutations of Glu-250 and Glu-300, which are located at the subunit-subunit interface, generated TROSY spectra different from that of the wild type. The spectral overlay between the E300N mutant and the wild type is shown in Fig. 6. Eleven signals were shifted by the E300N mutation to the extent that they are not overlapped with the corresponding signals from the wild type protein: Phe-46, Gly-58, Thr-193, Gly-216, Gln-227, Val-253, E300N, Val-303, Glu-304, Thr-306, and Gly-307 (Fig. 6). These residues are located in the region around Glu-300 to the subunit-subunit interface, and the upper part (membrane side) of the protein including G-loop (residues 303–307). The E250N mutant also showed a large spectral difference (data not shown). Because Glu-250 and Glu-300 are involved in direct contacts between two subunits, the wide distribution of the residues affected by the mutations indicates that the relative orientation of the subunits was altered by these mutations. On the other hand, the charge-neutralizing mutation of Asp-260, which does not contact any atom of the other subunit, introduced chemical shift changes to the NMR signals from the following residues: Gln-227, Val-253, Thr-257, D260N, and Gln-261 (Fig. 7). The five affected residues are all adjacent to Asp-260, indicating that the effect of the D260N mutation is local effect and does not lead to the relative orientation of the subunits. The spectral difference of the D275N mutant from the wild type was limited to Asp-275 and its neighborhood (data not shown). The CSP upon the addition of spermine to D275N was similar to that of the wild type. Considering the result that the spermine binding affinity of D275N is comparable to that of the wild type (Table 2), Asp-275 is involved in neither the direct binding to spermine nor the conformational rearrangement upon spermine binding. The ITC results indicated that two spermine molecules bind to a tetramer of GIRKCP, with a dissociation constant (Kd) value of 26 μm at the KCl concentration of 150 mm. The KCl concentration dependence of the Kd values (Fig. 2) shows the significant contribution of the electrostatic interaction to the binding between the positive charges of spermine and the negative charges of the acidic residues in GIRKCP. Small but significant CSPs induced by the binding of spermine were observed for the residues at the subunit-subunit interface of the GIRKCP tetramer (Fig. 5). It should be noted that the extent of CSP was relatively small, which might be accounted for by the small structural alteration, or by the averaging of the CSP for the corresponding residues of four subunits of the GIRKCP tetramer. The binding stoichiometry of two molecules of spermine per a tetramer of GIRKCP (Fig. 1 and Table 1) strongly suggests that the tetramer is formed by a dimer of the spermine-bound dimers, producing two distinct types of the subunit-subunit interface: interfaces within and between the spermine-bound dimer. Because the observed CSP is the average of the corresponding residues, which may have different CSPs, in the fast exchange regime on the NMR timescale, it tends to be smaller than the typical CSPs for the conformational change. The residues with the small but significant CSPs distribute widely at the subunit-subunit interfaces, strongly suggesting that spermine binding altered the relative subunit orientation of the tetramer. The change in the relative orientations of the subunits was also indicated by the NMR spectral differences introduced by the E300N mutation (Fig. 6). Because Glu-300 possesses the contacts with adjacent subunit, the E300N mutation might have caused the subunit rearrangement. These data consistently indicated that GIRKCP possesses the plasticity in the intersubunit orientation of the tetramer. The plasticity was also suggested by the crystal structures of a Kir3.1-KirBac1.3 chimera, where two channels in the same crystal adopt different conformations through rigid body displacements of the subunits (10Nishida M. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Their relative orientations also differ from those in the previous structures of the cytoplasmic pore of Kir3.1/GIRK1 (7Nishida M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 957-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 9Pegan S. Arrabit C. Zhou W. Kwiatkowski W. Collins A. Slesinger P.A. Choe S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). By focusing on Asp-260 in these structures, we noticed that the distances between the oxygen atoms of the Asp-260 carboxyl group from the adjacent subunit range from 9.3 Å (PDB code: 1N9P) to 11.3 Å (PDB code: 2QKS, molecule B). To date, the results of electrophysiological studies using mutants of Kir2.1 (9Pegan S. Arrabit C. Zhou W. Kwiatkowski W. Collins A. Slesinger P.A. Choe S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 13Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 14Kubo Y. Murata Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have suggested that the intracellular acidic residues in Kir3.1, Asp-260 and Glu-300, are critical residues for the inward rectification. Our ITC results also indicated that D260N and E300N do not bind to spermine. However, our NMR data consistently support that Asp-260, not Glu-300, interacts directly with spermine: (1Bichet D. Haass F.A. Jan L.Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) Intermolecular transferred NOE signals were observed for Gln-227, Gln-261, and Phe-255, which surround Asp-260 (Fig. 4), while no NOE signals with spermine were observed for the Ile or Met side chains, which are located in the proximity of Glu-300 (2Ficker E. Taglialatela M. Wible B.A. Henley C.M. Brown A.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1068-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). CSPs upon the addition of spermine were not observed for the site around Glu-300, but were found for the residues surrounding Asp-260 (Fig. 5D) (3Lopatin A.N. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). While the residues with remarkable chemical shift changes by the D260N mutation is limited to the proximity (Fig. 7), those by the E300N mutation are distributed widely at the subunit-subunit interface of the tetramer (Fig. 6). Therefore, the impaired spermine affinity of the E300N mutant might be due to the structural rearrangement of the four subunits. Based on these results, we conclude that Asp-260, not Glu-300, is the negatively charged residue that is critical for the direct binding of spermine. This is also consistent with the recent electrostatics calculation report, indicating that Asp-260 is the strongest negatively charged contributor to the electrostatics of the cytoplasmic regions of Kir3.1 (26Robertson J.L. Palmer L.G. Roux B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 613-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The aspartate residue corresponding to Asp-260 in Kir3.1/GIRK1 is highly conserved in other human Kirs except for Kir6; Kir2.1–2.4, 3.1–3.4, and 4.1, and is substituted by another acidic residue, glutamate, in Kir1.1 and 1.3 and 7.1. Therefore, the binding site identified here in Kir3.1/GIRK1 might exist in other Kirs. However, the numbers and positions of the acidic residues in the cytoplasmic pore differ among the Kirs, suggesting that alternative binding sites might be found in other Kirs. We have proposed the spermine binding mode to Kir3.1/GIRK1, based on the pattern of the intermolecular transferred NOEs, the binding stoichiometry, and the electrostatic interaction with Asp-260 (Fig. 8). It should be noted that the protein structure used for the schematic illustration in Fig. 8 represents the spermine-free state, which is different from the spermine-bound state. While all of the proton sites of spermine exhibited NOEs with the aromatic protons of Phe-255, only positions 5 and 6 of the spermine protons showed NOEs with the side chain amide protons of Gln-227 and Gln-261 (Fig. 4). Because the NOE signals from position 2 of spermine were observed only with Phe-255, and not with Gln-227/Gln-261, both termini of the spermine should be close to Phe-255 and away from Gln-227/Gln-261, while the central methylene groups at positions 5 and 6 (and the symmetrical positions 7 and 8) should point upward toward Gln-227/Gln-261. Because Asp-260 exists between Phe-255 and Gln-227/Gln-261, the positive charges on the nitrogen atoms of spermine at positions 4 and 9 interact with the negative charge of the Asp-260 side chain. The spermine binding stoichiometry of two per tetramer of GIRKCP, suggests that one spermine molecule bridges the two negative charges of the Asp-260 residues of adjacent subunits in the GIRK tetramer. As shown in Fig. 5, spermine binding changed the chemical shifts of the residues at the subunit-subunit interface, in addition to those of the direct binding site. This seems to be related to the spermine binding mode; a molecule of spermine bridges two Asp-260 side chains, stabilizing a certain orientation of the four subunits of the tetramer. Kir3/GIRK is activated by the binding of G-protein βγ subunits (Gβγ) to the intracellular regions. FRET microscopy indicated that the intracellular regions of the GIRK1/GIRK4 channel exhibit conformational rearrangements upon Gβγ binding (22Riven I. Kalmanzon E. Segev L. Reuveny E. Neuron. 2003; 38: 225-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our data revealed that spermine binding stabilizes a certain intersubunit orientation, which is probably different from that of the Gβγ-bound state. Therefore, the spermine binding to the cytoplasmic pore might contribute to the stabilization of the resting state of the channel. Conversely, the Gβγ-induced rearrangement of the four subunits of Kir3.1/GIRK1 upon its activation could disrupt the ability of spermine to bridge the two Asp-260 side chains, leading to impaired affinity for spermine. Therefore, the spermine binding mode revealed here suggests that spermine is dissociated from the cytoplasmic pore of the channel upon its activation. Because the spermine binding site is at the center of the cytoplasmic pore, the dissociation from the site would be beneficial for the access to the final binding site in the transmembrane region, to accomplish the blockade of the outward K+ current. We have described here the affinity, stoichiometry, sites, and mode of spermine binding to the intracellular regions of Kir3.1/GIRK1. The direct binding site of spermine on the Kir channel was first identified, based on the distance information of the intermolecular NOEs. Importantly, spermine bridges two Asp-260 side chains, inducing a change in the relative orientations of the four subunits of the tetramer. Thus, spermine could be dissociated from the cytoplasmic pore upon channel activation by the Gβγ-induced conformational rearrangement. Spermine exerts the voltage-dependent blockade of the outward current, presumably in the transmembrane pore. The activation-dependent dissociation of spermine from the cytoplasmic pore seems to play a role in the rapid and efficient blockade of the transmembrane pore."
https://openalex.org/W2104751094,"In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the protein phosphatase Sit4 and four associated proteins (Sap4, Sap155, Sap185, and Sap190) mediate G(1) to S cell cycle progression and a number of signaling events controlled by the target of rapamycin TOR signaling cascade. Sit4 and the Sap proteins are ubiquitously conserved and their human orthologs, PP6 and three PP6R proteins, share significant sequence identity with their yeast counterparts. However, relatively little is known about the functions of the PP6 and PP6R proteins in mammalian cells. Here we demonstrate that the human PP6R proteins physically interact with Sit4 when expressed in yeast cells. Remarkably, expression of PP6R2 and PP6R3 but not expression of PP6R1 rescues the growth defect and rapamycin hypersensitivity of yeast cells lacking all four Saps, and these effects require Sit4. Moreover, PP6R2 and PP6R3 enhance cyclin G(1) gene expression and DNA synthesis, and partially abrogate the G(1) cell cycle delay and the budding defect of the yeast quadruple sap mutant strain. In contrast, the human PP6R proteins only modestly support nitrogen catabolite gene expression and are unable to restore normal levels of eIF2alpha phosphorylation in the quadruple sap mutant strain. These results illustrate that the human PP6-associated proteins are capable of providing distinct rapamycin-sensitive and Sit4-dependent Sap functions in the heterologous context of the yeast cell. We hypothesize that the human Saps may play analogous roles in mTORC1-PP6 signaling events in metazoans."

LeuRS facilitates RNA splicing in concert with a bI4 maturase that is encoded within the bI4 intron. Genetic investigations showed that an inactivated bI4 maturase resulting in deficient splicing activity of the bI4 and aI4α group I introns can be rescued by a suppressor mutation of LeuRS to restore mitochondrial respiration (4Labouesse M.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, the splicing defect can be compensated by a mutant aI4α DNA endonuclease that is closely related to the bI4 maturase (7Goguel V. Delahodde A. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 696-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8Wenzlau J.M. Saldanha R.J. Butow R.A. Perlman P.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 421-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Previously, we used intracellular three-hybrid assays to demonstrate that LeuRS and bI4 maturase can independently bind to the bI4 intron and stimulate RNA splicing activity in the non-physiological yeast nucleus compartment (9Rho S.B. Martinis S.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 1882-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RNA-dependent two-hybrid assays also supported that the bI4 intron could simultaneously bind both the bI4 maturase and LeuRS. In this case, the RNA was co-expressed with LeuRS and bI4 maturase that was fused to either LexA or B42 to generate a two-hybrid response. This suggested that the bI4 intron was bridging these two protein splicing factors. In either the RNA-dependent two-hybrid or three-hybrid assays, bI4 intron splicing occurred only in the presence of LeuRS or bI4 maturase or both. We hypothesized that the bI4 maturase and LeuRS bind to distinct sites of the bI4 intron to form a ternary complex and promote efficient splicing activity. However, the functional basis of the collaboration between these two splicing cofactors or how either of them promotes RNA splicing remains unclear. We sought to characterize the respective splicing roles of the bI4 maturase and LeuRS via biochemical investigations. Previous attempts to develop an in vitro splicing assay for the bI4 intron or its closely related aI4α intron have failed (10Gampel A. Tzagoloff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2545-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Tanner N.K. Sargueil B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the long length of the bI4 intron (∼1600 nucleotides) and its highly A:U-rich content (∼80%) hindered RNA folding in vitro as well as stabilization of its competent structure. Efforts to produce an active form of the bI4 intron have relied on building chimeric group I introns by interchanging RNA domains with the more stable Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron (11Tanner N.K. Sargueil B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it was proposed that the catalytic core of the bI4 group I intron was inherently defective (11Tanner N.K. Sargueil B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In this case, the group I intron would be expected to be completely dependent on its protein splicing factors similar to the bI3 intron that relies on the bI3 maturase and Mrs1 for activity (12Bassi G.S. de Oliveira D.M. White M.F. Weeks K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, it was hypothesized that the bI4 maturase and/or LeuRS splicing factors aided the bI4 group I intron by targeting its core region to compensate for these deficiencies. We focused our efforts on re-designing the bI4 intron to develop a minimized molecule that might be competent for splicing. Because both the bI4 and aI4α group I introns rely on the bI4 maturase and LeuRS for their splicing activity, we compared their secondary structures to identify and eliminate peripheral regions outside of their catalytic cores. A small active derivative of the bI4 intron, comprised of just 380 nucleotides primarily from the canonical core, was generated. Thus, we show that, in and of itself, the canonical core of this group I intron is competent for splicing. Both the bI4 maturase and LeuRS enhance the splicing activity of the minimized bI4 intron. However, it is possible that protein-dependent splicing of the bI4 intron represents an intermediate evolutionary step in which the RNA activity is becoming increasingly dependent on its protein splicing factors.

The bI4 maturase was expressed with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag from pGEX2T-MAT2 (16Delahodde A. Goguel V. Becam A.M. Creusot F. Perea J. Banroques J. Jacq C.

The cells were suspended in 10 ml 1× PBS with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by sonication on ice for 3 min. The clear supernatant was incubated with 0.25 g of glutathione-agarose affinity resin (Sigma) (pre-equilibrated in 1× PBS) for 4 h and then washed with 1× PBS. The resin-bound bI4 maturase was cleaved from the GST fusion protein with 18 units of thrombin protease overnight at room temperature with slow mixing. The cleaved bI4 maturase protein was eluted with 1× PBS and stored in 50% glycerol. Nitrocellulose membranes were preincubated in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol) that contained 1 mg/ml ribosomal RNA. An aliquot of 100 nm [α-32P]UTP-labeled RNA was incubated with increasing concentrations (0 to 500 nm) of bI4 maturase or LeuRS in 250 μl of binding buffer for 1 h at 37 °C (17Chen X. Gutell R.R.

The KD was calculated by fitting the data in Equation 1, Y=(Kd+Bmax+X-((Kd+Bmax+X)2-4×Bmax×X))/2×Bmax(Eq. 1) where Bmax is maximal binding (GraphPad Prism 4, San Diego, CA). Each in vitro splicing reaction contained 1 μm radiolabeled bI4 intron RNA (0.13 μCi/μl) resuspended in binding buffer (above), 1 mm guanosine, and 1.0 μm bI4 maturase, and/or LeuRS. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C and 10-μl aliquots quenched with 30 μl of 5 m urea, 30 mm EDTA and mixed with 10 μl of RNA-loading dye. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 65 °C and then electrophoresed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel overnight at 10 mA current. The radiolabeled bands were visualized and integrated using a phosphorimager. Bands representing the precursor RNA, excised intron, and ligated exons were normalized for each time point by determining the fraction of each relative to the sum intensity of the three bands. In addition, background was subtracted based on the zero time point. Rates and extent of reaction (product/total bands in lane) were calculated using GraphPad Prism 4 via its single exponential function. The bI4 and aI4α introns are closely related group I introns that are dependent on LeuRS and bI4 maturase for excision in vivo (3Labouesse M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 224: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 4Labouesse M. Dujardin G. Slonimski P.P.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Previously, the secondary structures of the canonical cores for both of these group I introns were predicted (Fig. 1) and identified as a subclass called IB1 (19Michel F. Westhof E. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 585-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). The bI4 and aI4α group I introns also contain small and large RNA inserts. We investigated these inserts in more detail to determine if they might be important to the intron splicing activity or contribute to interactions with either of the protein splicing factors. Each of the group I introns contains a large insert (>700 nucleotides) at the end of the P8 helix (Fig. 1), which encodes in part, a conserved open reading frame. The bI4 maturase and aI4α DNA endonuclease are expressed respectively from the P8 insert of the bI4 and aI4α group I introns. However, a limited number of mutations can functionally interchange the activities of these closely related proteins (7Goguel V. Delahodde A. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 696-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8Wenzlau J.M. Saldanha R.J. Butow R.A. Perlman P.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 421-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A second shorter 31-nucleotide insert at the end of the bI4 intron P6 stem appears to have diverged compared with the smaller insert at this site in the aI4α intron. The bI4 intron P5 helix contains two inserts, which are missing in the aI4α intron structure. The smaller 21-nucleotide insert forms a short hairpin that we hypothesized is involved in a long-range “kissing interaction” (20Westhof E. Masquida B. Jaeger L. Fold. Des. 1996; 1: R78-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) with the loop at the end of the P9 helix (Fig. 1). This tertiary interaction that is specific to the bI4 intron might be compensated in the aI4α intron by a longer P9 stem that provides greater stability for this domain in close proximity to the splice site. The second 120-nucleotide insert called “hj” within the P5 helix can be folded into its own domain and appears to be stabilized independently by a self-contained long range interaction (Fig. 1). The 1627-nucleotide long bI4 intron contains the core features that are required for group I intron self-splicing activity (Fig. 1). Its peripheral regions could be important to RNA-protein interactions with the LeuRS or bI4 maturase splicing partners, RNA folding, or a combination of both. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used the comparative structure of the aI4α group I intron to systematically construct and characterize a series of bI4 intron mutations that deleted parts or all of these peripheral regions. Much of the large size of the bI4 intron is due to the 1016-nucleotide insert into the P8 loop, which encodes the bI4 maturase gene (Fig. 1). To begin mapping RNA-protein interactions we targeted this large maturase gene insert in the bI4 intron for reduction of the P8 peripheral domain by deletion analysis. The catalytic core of the bI4 intron sequence overlaps with 96 nucleotides of the 5′-end of the predicted gene that encodes the bI4 maturase. Thus, we constructed a series of downstream internal deletions that eliminated the remainder of the maturase open reading frame, which would encode the C-terminal end of the protein. These constructions included reducing the 1016 nucleotide insertion to 712 (bI4Δ304), 463 (bI4Δ553), and 214 (bI4Δ802) nucleotides (Fig. 2A). Each of the bI4 intron deletions were tested in three-hybrid assays as described previously (9Rho S.B. Martinis S.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 1882-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Rho S.B. Lincecum Jr., T.L. Martinis S.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6874-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and retained binding to either LeuRS or bI4 maturase that was fused to LexA (Fig. 2B). RT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from the yeast cells demonstrated that each of the bI4 intron deletion mutants retained protein-dependent RNA splicing activity (data not shown) as previously found for the full-length LeuRS (9Rho S.B. Martinis S.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 1882-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Rho S.B. Lincecum Jr., T.L. Martinis S.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6874-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The three P8 insert deletion mutants were also transcribed in vitro and RNA-protein interactions measured via nitrocellulose filter binding assays. Although the KD values for interactions with bI4 maturase were within 2-fold of the wild type bI4 intron (33 ± 15 nm, Table 1), only a small amount of the bI4 intron appeared to fold competently such that it could form an RNA-protein complex (Fig. 2C). In contrast, in the presence of LeuRS, a much larger fraction of the in vitro transcribed wild type and mutant bI4 intron RNA assembled into an RNA protein complex (Fig. 2D). It is possible that the LeuRS protein splicing factor interacts with or captures a region of the group I intron deletion mutants that is more prone to forming a native structure. The KD for each deletion mutant was similar to the wild type bI4 intron interactions with LeuRS (12 ± 4 nm, Table 1). In either the case of the bI4 maturase or the LeuRS, the P8 insert peripheral domain is dispensable to formation of the RNA-protein complex.TABLE 1RNA equilibrium binding constants for wild type and bI4 intron deletion mutantsbI4 IntronbI4 Maturase KDLeuRS KDnmnmWild type33 ± 1512 ± 4bI4-Δ30420 ± 1015 ± 6bI4-Δ55372 ± 2038 ± 13bI4-Δ80252 ± 197 ± 2bI4-Δ104862 ± 1219 ± 11bI4-Δ116891 ± 2812 ± 5 Open table in a new tab We used the bI4Δ802 construct to target two smaller peripheral domains for deletion. We hypothesized that a short 31-nucleotide extension of the P6b helix, which is not found in the aI4α group I intron (Fig. 1) was dispensable for protein-dependent splicing activity and replaced it with a GAAA tetraloop (bI4Δ1048; Fig. 3A). A larger 120-nucleotide insert (hj) into the P5 stem was predicted to fold into a co-axially stacked pair of helices as well as a small stem loop (Fig. 1) and is completely missing in the aI4α intron. This entire region was deleted along with the P6b extension and replaced with a GAAA tetraloop to yield the smallest bI4 intron construct (bI4Δ1168). The small loop that replaced the 1016 nucleotide insertion at the end of the P8 helix was also replaced by a GUAA tetraloop in each of these deletion mutants. Binding of bI4Δ1048 and bI4Δ1168 mutants to LeuRS was largely unaffected by the additional deletions yielding KD that were similar to the wild-type bI4 intron-LeuRS interaction (Table 1). Both of the smallest bI4 intron deletion mutants exhibited increased complex formation with the bI4 maturase (Fig. 3C) accompanied by small 2–3-fold increases in the KD (Table 1). We hypothesize that deletion of these peripheral domains aided folding of the canonical bI4 intron core into a competent more native-like structure for protein interactions. Previous attempts to develop an in vitro bI4 intron splicing assay that was dependent or independent of its protein splicing factors have been unsuccessful (10Gampel A. Tzagoloff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2545-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Tanner N.K. Sargueil B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this large group I intron failed to fold effectively into a competent structure that would confer splicing activity. We radiolabeled the smallest bI4Δ1168 deletion mutant during in vitro transcription and re-folded it by heating to 50 °C for 2 min followed by cooling to 32 °C for 10 min in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+. The re-folded bI4Δ1168 was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm guanosine and analyzed via gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). Multiple bands emerged over the bI4Δ1168 incubation time. To identify authentic group I intron splicing products, a customized RNA ladder (see supplemental information) was used to estimate the size of the expected RNA bands and identify products of the bI4 intron splicing reaction. Two bands were predicted to be the excised intron (234 bases) and ligated exons (146 bases). Both bands were probed by Northern analysis to confirm their identities (data not shown). The junction site of the ligated exons was also confirmed by amplifying the band at 150 bases via RT-PCR (see supplemental information). DNA sequencing showed that the exons were ligated accurately at the correct junction. It is possible that deletions of the bI4 intron resulted in some aberrant RNA splicing activity. However, the minimized bI4Δ1168 group I intron yielded major bands that accurately represented the expected ligated exons and excised intron. Based on precursor RNA disappearance, the bI4Δ1168 mutant was processed with a kobs of 6 ± 0.2 × 10−3 min−1 (Table 2) concomitant with production of the expected bands for excised bI4 intron and ligated B4-B5 exons at about 230 and 140 nucleotides, respectively. We used the splicing active bI4Δ1168 group I intron to determine if we could also probe for biochemical effects of its protein splicing partners. We introduced 1 μm bI4 maturase and 1 μm LeuRS into the splicing reaction for bI4Δ1168, which resulted in a clear 9-fold stimulation of splicing activity (Fig. 5). Under these in vitro conditions, the proteins promoted processing of the group I intron with a kobs of 54 ± 8 × 10−3 min−1 (Table 2). Significantly, the kobs for the production of ligated B4-B5 exons (50 ± 5 × 10−3 min−1) and excised introns (52 ± 4 × 10−3 min−1) was similar to processing of the bI4Δ1168. This correlates to previous results with the full-length bI4 intron, which showed that LeuRS and bI4 maturase stimulated splicing activity of the bI4 intron in RNA-dependent two-hybrid assays (9Rho S.B. Martinis S.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 1882-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).TABLE 2Observed (kobs) values for bI4Δintron splicingPre-RNAB4-B5bI4 Intronkobs × 10−3 min−1kobs × 10−3 min−1kobs × 10−3 min−1No proteins6 ± 0.2NDaNot determined because of low activity.NDLeuRS29 ± 725 ± 851 ± 7bI4 Maturase97 ± 1540 ± 547 ± 8LeuRS + bI4 maturase54 ± 850 ± 552 ± 4a Not determined because of low activity. Open table in a new tab The precursor RNA decayed nearly to completion (93%). However, as found for the protein-independent bI4Δ1168 splicing reaction, gel analysis (Fig. 5 and supplemental information) indicated that in addition to formation of the expected spliced RNA products, other bands were produced during protein-dependent RNA processing. To probe for nonspecific decay or nuclease activity of the protein preparations, LeuRS and bI4 maturase were incubated with other RNAs such as 5S rRNA (supplemental information) and tRNA (data not shown), which resulted in no visible RNA degradation. We hypothesized that the bI4Δ1168 deletion mutants might be prone to aberrant RNA splicing in the absence of certain RNA peripheral domains. Because we had previously shown in three-hybrid experiments that either LeuRS or bI4 maturase could independently promote RNA splicing (9Rho S.B. Martinis S.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 1882-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Rho S.B. Lincecum Jr., T.L. Martinis S.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6874-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we tested these proteins individually using in vitro assays with the active minimized bI4 intron. Protein-dependent splicing of the bI4-Δ1168 group I intron was stimulated by either LeuRS or bI4 maturase, although more significantly by the latter (Fig. 6). However, the addition of both proteins indicated that LeuRS also plays a role in the bI4 maturase-dependent splicing reaction. This suggests that the two protein splicing partners play distinct roles. Bovine serum albumin and also isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), which is closely related to LeuRS, were incorporated into bI4Δ1168 splicing assays, but failed to stimulate RNA splicing activity (Fig. 6B and supplemental information). Thus, even though IleRS has a similar domain architecture including a CP1-editing domain that was shown for LeuRS to be critical to RNA splicing (21Rho S.B. Lincecum Jr., T.L. Martinis S.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6874-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), specific features of the LeuRS are required to promote protein-dependent bI4 intron splicing. We also tested the Mss116p helicase, which has been reported to be important to splicing multiple yeast mitochondrial group I and II introns in vivo (22Huang H.R. Rowe C.E. Mohr S. Jiang Y. Lambowitz A.M. Perlman P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, Mss116p did not simulate intron activity (supplemental information), either in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP, supporting that the bI4 intron splicing activity is cognate to the bI4 maturase and LeuRS. We calculated the extent of the reaction. The bI4 introns were excised at similar yields whether bI4 maturase, LeuRS, or both protein splicing factors were present (Fig. 7). Exon ligation appeared to be somewhat more efficient if bI4 maturase was present. As indicated above for protein-independent splicing of the bI4Δ1168 group I intron, processing of the precursor RNA also yielded alternate bands, which have not been identified. The kobs for precursor processing by LeuRS was only 29 ± 7 × 10−3 min−1 compared with a faster processing rate of 97 ± 15 × 10−3 min−1 for the bI4 maturase (Table 2). Likewise, the LeuRS appeared to impede the rate of bI4 maturase-dependent splicing, but over time similar yields of ligated exons and excised introns were obtained for maturase-dependent splicing in the presence or the absence of LeuRS. It is possible that these idiosyncrasies may in part be due to one of the missing bI4 intron peripheral domains in the bI4Δ1168 construct. However, it is also possible that the two protein splicing partners play distinct roles to enable bI4 intron splicing activity. Cations, especially Mg2+, are typically incorporated into in vitro reactions to shield the negatively charged phosphate backbone and promote folding of RNA. We tested a range of concentrations of Mg2+ to determine if it would enhance splicing activity of the bI4Δ1168. Although Mg2+ is required for group I intron splicing, concentrations that were higher than 5 mm began to impede activity of the bI4Δ1168 (Fig. 8). Mg2+-dependent inhibition also occurred for protein-dependent splicing activity of the minimized bI4Δ1168 intron in the presence of the bI4 maturase and LeuRS (Fig. 8). At 100 mm Mg2+, protein-dependent splicing was inhibited (data not shown). These results parallel analysis of the CYT-18 splicing factor, which is also inhibited by increasing Mg2+ concentrations (23Caprara M.G. Myers C.A. Lambowitz A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 165-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Guo Q.B. Akins R.A. Garriga G. Lambowitz A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1809-1819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aaRSs are an ancient family of enzymes that would be expected to have emerged at the origins of protein synthesis (1Martinis S.A. Plateau P. Cavarelli J. Florentz C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This revolution in biology has been hypothesized to serve as a critical transition from an early RNA world to a contemporary cell that is governed by both proteins and RNA molecules (25Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). It is likely that this evolutionary period capitalized on molecules that were already available. As a result, structural and functional remnants of aaRSs can be found throughout many diverse biochemical pathways (26Schimmel P. Ribas De Pouplana L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 207-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). More recently, the broad impact of the aaRSs in unusual functions has been highlighted by their connection to heritable diseases (27Martinis S.A. Joy Pang Y.L. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 1307-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 28Park S.G. Schimmel P. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11043-11049Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The dependence of some mitochondrial group I intron splicing reactions on LeuRS and TyrRS may reflect this biological transition that encompassed significant evolutionary change and adaptation. For example, TyrRS is an important splicing factor to group I introns that are missing or have lost their P5abc domain (29Mohr G. Caprara M.G. Guo Q. Lambowitz A.M. Nature. 1994; 370: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This nuclear-encoded housekeeping protein in Neurospora crassa has acquired short novel peptides that are critical to its splicing activity (30Mohr G. Rennard R. Cherniack A.D. Stryker J.

The idiosyncratic peptides provide a new RNA binding face for TyrRS that is independent of interactions with tRNA and specifically targets the group I intron (34Paukstelis P.J. Chen J.H. Chase E. Lambowitz A.M. Golden B.L. Nature. 2008; 451: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). TyrRS is a dimer, and the intron binds across both subunits. As predicted by extensive footprinting analysis in previous experiments (35Caprara M.G. Lehnert V. Lambowitz A.M. Westhof E. Cell. 1996; 87: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 36Caprara M.G. Mohr G. Lambowitz A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 512-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the x-ray co-crystal structure of TyrRS with the bacteriophage Twort orf142-I2 group I intron, shows that the protein interacts with the catalytic core of the intron that is comprised of the P4-P6 and P3-P9 helical domains (34Paukstelis P.J. Chen J.H. Chase E. Lambowitz A.M. Golden B.L. Nature. 2008; 451: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It does not interact with any RNA peripheral domains outside of the catalytic core. The peripheral regions of the bI4 intron could also be deleted without sacrificing significant binding by its LeuRS and bI4 maturase splicing partners. While its not yet clear how LeuRS aids in RNA structure formation, it has been shown that TyrRS binds to a transient P4-P6 structure to stabilize an early step in the group I intron folding process (17Chen X. Gutell R.R. Lambowitz A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 265-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 35Caprara M.G. Lehnert V. Lambowitz A.M. Westhof E.

Biol. 1996; 257: 512-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is possible that LeuRS plays a similar role. However, since the monomeric LeuRS and dimeric TyrRS have very different architectures, it is likely that the protein-dependent mechanism that they each rely upon to promote RNA splicing is distinct. As one example, LeuRSs do not require idiosyncratic features to promote RNA splicing. Rather, an ancient adaptation of LeuRS for tRNA aminoacylation is sufficient for RNA splicing (37Houman F. Rho S.B. Zhang J. Shen X. Wang C.C. Schimmel P. Martinis S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 13743-13748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Significantly, LeuRSs that originate from organisms, which are devoid of group I introns, can stimulate splicing activity. LeuRS splicing activity is associated with the CP1 domain that is required for amino acid editing (21Rho S.B. Lincecum Jr., T.L. Martinis S.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6874-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although other domains of LeuRS appear to contribute to the RNA-processing role (14Hsu J.L. Rho S.B. Vannella K.M.

In contrast, TyrRS does not have an editing domain. As discussed above, TyrRS enzymes that stimulate intron activity rely on small peptide insertions (30Mohr G. Rennard R. Cherniack A.D. Stryker J.

These novel insertions form a new RNA binding surface for interactions with the final, folded form of the group I intron that are distinct from the tRNA binding site of TyrRS (34Paukstelis P.J. Chen J.H. Chase E. Lambowitz A.M. Golden B.L. Nature. 2008; 451: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated herein that the canonical core of the bI4 intron is inherently active similar to many other group I introns. This contrasts previous hypotheses that the bI4 intron core is defective for catalysis (11Tanner N.K. Sargueil B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). There have been reports of introns, such as the Saccharomyces cerevisiae bI3 group I intron, that have become completely dependent on proteins for splicing activity (12Bassi G.S. de Oliveira D.M. White M.F. Weeks K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similar to the bI4 intron (9Rho S.B. Martinis S.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 1882-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the bI3 intron relies on an intron-encoded protein (bI3 maturase). It also requires a nuclear-encoded protein called Mrs1 (12Bassi G.S. de Oliveira D.M. White M.F. Weeks K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, in the case of the bI4 intron, at least in vitro, it can carry out splicing activity at detectable levels that are enhanced by one or both of its protein splicing factors. Based on rate and extent of reactions, it is clear that the bI4 maturase and LeuRS influence and enhance the splicing activity of the bI4 introns in different ways. This would be expected from these two completely different splicing partners, which appear to work collaboratively. It remains possible that the bI4 intron is becoming increasingly dependent on LeuRS and bI4 maturase and thus would represent an intermediate step in the transition from the RNA world. We thank Drs.

However, the use of rodent primary cells for clinical applications may be hampered by limited supply and risk of contamination with xeno-proteins. Methodology/Principal Findings We have developed an alternative method for unimpeded production of human neurons under xeno-free conditions. Initially, neural stem cells in sphere-like clusters were induced from human ES (hES) cells after being cultured in P-ACM under free-floating conditions. The resultant neural stem cells could circumferentially proliferate under subsequent adhesive culture, and selectively differentiate into neurons or astrocytes by changing the medium to P-ACM or G5, respectively. These hES cell-derived neurons and astrocytes could procure functions similar to those of primary cells. Interestingly, a conditioned medium obtained from the hES cell-derived astrocytes (ES-ACM) could successfully be used to substitute P-ACM for induction of neurons. Neurons made by this method could survive in mice brain after xeno-transplantation. Conclusion/Significance By inducing astrocytes from hES cells in a chemically defined medium, we could produce human neurons without the use of P-ACM. This self-serving method provides an unlimited source of human neural cells and may facilitate clinical applications of hES cells for neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2145674266,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is most frequently associated with deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (DeltaF508) in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The DeltaF508-CFTR mutant protein exhibits a folding defect that affects its processing and impairs chloride-channel function. This study aimed to determine whether CFTR fragments approximately half the size of wild-type CFTR and complementary to the portion of CFTR bearing the mutation can specifically rescue the processing of endogenous DeltaF508-CFTR in vivo. cDNA encoding CFTR fragments were delivered to human airway epithelial cells and mice harboring endogenous DeltaF508-CFTR. Delivery of small CFTR fragments, which do not act as chloride channels by themselves, rescue DeltaF508-CFTR. Therefore, we can speculate that the presence of the CFTR fragment, which does not harbor a mutation, might facilitate intermolecular interactions. The rescue of CFTR was evident by the restoration of chloride transport in human CFBE41o- bronchial epithelial cells expressing DeltaF508-CFTR in vitro. More important, nasal administration of an adenovirus expressing a complementary CFTR fragment restored some degree of CFTR activity in the nasal airways of DeltaF508 homozygous mice in vivo. These findings identify complementary protein fragments as a viable in vivo approach for correcting disease-causing misfolding of plasma membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2089406234,"Background Wild type Staphylococcal α-hemolysin (α-HL) assembly on target mammalian cells usually results in necrotic form of cell death; however, caspase activation also occurs. The pathways of caspase activation due to binding/partial assembly by α-HL are unknown till date. Results Cells treated with H35N (a mutant of α-HL that remains as membrane bound monomer), have been shown to accumulate hypodiploid nuclei, activate caspases and induce intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. We have earlier shown that the binding and assembly of α-HL requires functional form of Caveolin-1 which is an integral part of caveolae. In this report, we show that the caveolae of mammalian cells, which undergo a continuous cycle of ‘kiss and run’ dynamics with the plasma membrane, have become immobile upon the binding of the monomer. The cells treated with H35N were unable to recover despite activation of membrane repair mechanism involving caspase-1 dependent activation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1. Conclusions This is for the first time we show the range of cellular changes and responses that take place immediately after the binding of the monomeric form of staphylococcal α-hemolysin."

The crystal structure of the related RB69 DNA polymerase (gp43) is often used as a model system to explain mechanisms of inhibition of DNA synthesis and drug resistance. However, here we demonstrate that gp43 is ∼400-fold less sensitive to the pyrophosphate analog foscarnet, when compared with UL54. The RB69 enzyme is also able to discriminate against the nucleotide analog inhibitor acyclovir. In contrast, the HCMV polymerase is able to incorporate this compound with similar efficiency as observed with its natural counterpart. In an attempt to identify major determinants for drug activity, we replaced critical regions of the nucleotide-binding site of gp43 with equivalent regions of the HCMV enzyme. We show that chimeric gp43-UL54 enzymes that contain residues of helix N and helix P of UL54 are resensitized against foscarnet and acyclovir. Changing a region of three amino acids of helix N showed the strongest effects, and changes of two segments of three amino acids in helix P further contributed to the reversal of the phenotype.

Site-specific footprinting experiments revealed that the enzyme can oscillate between two conformations, referred to as pre- and post-translocation (32Marchand B. Götte M. J. Biol.

The 3′ end of the primer still occupies the nucleotide-binding site in the pre-translocated complex (33Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J.

The mechanism of action might be similar with the HCMV enzyme; however, the limited solubility of UL54 makes it difficult to produce the purified enzyme in sufficient amounts required for detailed biochemical and structural studies (36Ducancelle A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 787-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The RB69 polymerase can be expressed in its soluble form in Escherichia coli, which facilitates protein production at high yields (47Hogg M. Wallace S.S. Doublié S.

This enzyme has also been crystallized in various forms, with and without the bound primer-template and the nucleotide substrate (48Wang J. Sattar A.K. Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H.

The ternary complex serves as a model system that is often used to explain mechanisms of drug action and resistance associated with UL54 (45Shi R. Azzi A. Gilbert C. Boivin G. Lin S.X. Proteins. 2006; 64: 301-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the ternary complex shows that helix N and helix P provide important contacts that help to trap the incoming nucleotide (49Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Enzyme kinetic data confirmed the roles played by conserved amino acids in nucleotide binding and catalysis (51Yang G. Lin T. Karam J. Konigsberg W.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8094-8101Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 52Yang G. Franklin M. Li J. Lin T.C. Konigsberg W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2526-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Phenotypic drug susceptibility assays suggest that the equivalent regions in UL54 can affect susceptibility to GCV, CDV, and also to PFA (7Gilbert C. Boivin G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 873-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 53Baldanti F. Lurain N. Gerna G. Hum. Immunol. 2004; 65: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our recent biochemical data have shown that changes at residues of helix P implicated in PFA resistance or hypersusceptibility can either increase or decrease the inhibitory effects of this compound (42Tchesnokov E.P. Gilbert C. Boivin G. Götte M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A comparison with the crystal structure of gp43 suggests that the binding sites for PFA and the γ-phosphate of the bound nucleotide might overlap. However, although the existence of conserved residues within helix P points to a similar functional role in both enzymes, several residues in this region are different in nature, which may in turn affect sensitivity to PFA (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the contribution of helix N in PFA binding remains to be determined. In light of the limitations with respect to the expression of UL54, and the general shortcomings of surrogate systems such as the RB69 or UL30 enzymes, we engineered a chimeric RB69 DNA polymerase in which critical components of helix N and helix P were replaced by equivalent regions of the related HCMV enzyme (Table 1 and Fig. 2B). The aim of this study was to characterize the roles of the two helices in drug susceptibility to PFA and ACV and, in turn, to improve model systems for more detailed biochemical and structural analyses of UL54 and its interaction with antiviral drugs. The chimeric enzyme retained properties that facilitate expression and purification, and at the same time, the enzyme facilitates the study of mechanisms involved in drug action and drug resistance associated with the clinically relevant HCMV system. Most importantly, we show that gp43 is resistant to PFA and ACV, whereas the chimeric gp43-UL54 enzyme is almost as sensitive to both drugs as seen with UL54.TABLE 1RB69-HCMV DNA polymerase chimeraNomenclature for chimera (block)RegionRB69 residuesHCMV residuesCommentsAHelix NVal-478Trp-780NonePhe-479Val-781Asn-480Ser-782A/V781IHelixChimera A V479IChimera A V781IFoscarnet resistance conferring mutationaA 5.2-fold increase in foscarnet resistance is indicated (62).BHelix PIle-557Met-808NoneAsn-558Ala-809Arg-559Leu-810CHelix PLeu-601Val-812NoneLeu-602Thr-813Ile-603Cys-814ABC/R784AHelix NChimera AChimera AR482AR784AConserved residueHelix PChimera BCChimera BCABC/Q807AHelix NChimera AChimera AHelix PChimera BCChimera BCQ556AQ807AConserved residue conferring resistance to foscarnetbA 6-fold increase in foscarnet resistance is shown (42).a A 5.2-fold increase in foscarnet resistance is indicated (62Baldanti F.

Virol. 1998; 72: 5927-5936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The UL54 coding sequence was kindly provided by Dr. Guy Boivin (Laval University). The UL54 coding sequence was cloned into pCITE4b (Novagen) by use of the EcoRI and HindIII sites to generate pCITE4b/UL54. We also generated a 3′–5′-exonuclease negative construct that contains the D542A substitution. The RB69 DNA polymerase (gp43) coding sequence was kindly provided by Dr. Sylvie Doublié (University of Vermont) and Dr. Jim Karam (Tulane University). The gp43 coding sequence was cloned into pPR-IBA1 (IBA) using the BsaI site to generate pPR-IBA1/gp43. This construct facilitates protein purification through Strep-tag affinity chromatography (IBA). D222A and D327A substitutions were introduced to remove the 3′–5′-exonuclease activity. Constructs for the production of mutant enzymes were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The amino acid substitutions were introduced with PfuUltra DNA polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The HCMV polymerase UL54 was expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate with a coupled in vitro transcription-translation system (Promega). Reactions were conducted essentially as described previously (41Cihlar T. Fuller M.D. Mulato A.S. Cherrington J.M. Virology. 1998; 248: 382-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 42Tchesnokov E.P. Gilbert C. Boivin G. Götte M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The RB69 DNA polymerase and chimeric RB69/HCMV enzymes were expressed as described previously (47Hogg M. Wallace S.S. Doublié S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). All enzymes were purified using Strep-tag affinity chromatography (IBA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Heterodimeric reverse transcriptase p66/p51 was expressed and purified as described (54Le Grice S.F. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Oligodeoxynucleotides used in this study were chemically synthesized and purchased from Invitrogen. The following sequences were used as templates: T1, 5′GTAACTAGAGATCCCTCAGACCCTTTTAGTCAGAAT, and T2, 5′CCAATATTCACCATCAAGGCTTGATGAAACTTCACTCCACTATACCACTC. The underlined nucleotides are the portion of the templates annealed to the primer. The following primers were used in this study: P1, 5′TTCTGACTAAAAGGGTCTGAGGGAT, and P2, 5′GAGTGGTATAGTGGAGTGAA. Deoxynucleotides were purchased from Fermentas Life Sciences, and PFA was purchased from Sigma. ACV (1.5 mmol) was dissolved in 200 μl of dry 1,3-dimethyl-2-oxohexahydropyrimidine, N,N′-dimethylpropylene urea with 12–15 molecular sieves under nitrogen and stirred for 24 h. The mixture was chilled with an ice-water bath and stirred for 1 h, followed by slow addition of phosphorus oxychloride (3 eq) and stirred for an additional 25 min. A solution of tributylammonium pyrophosphate (4 eq) in 200 μl of N,N′-dimethylpropylene and tributyl amine (15 eq) was simultaneously added to the reaction. After 45 min the reaction was quenched with ice-cold water. The reaction was washed with chloroform, and the aqueous layer was collected and co-evaporated with deionized water three times. The residue was resuspended in 100 μl of deionized water and purified on ion-exchange column by high performance liquid chromatography λmax = 253 nm. The final product was co-evaporated with water five times, giving a total yield of ACV-TP (NH3)4 of 18% with purity ≥95%. The molecular weight of the ACV-TP was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/tandem mass spectrometry m/z (M + 1) 466 → 152 (55Burgess K. Cook D. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 2047-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). 100 nm DNA/DNA primer-template hybrid T1/P1 (100 nm) was preincubated for 5–10 min at 37 °C with a given DNA polymerase in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol. To compare different enzymes in single nucleotide incorporation assays, we adjusted the enzyme concentration and the time point of the reaction such that ∼40% of the primer was used at the saturating concentration of dNTP (Fig. 3A). For Km and Ki measurements, the range of the dNTP substrate and/or inhibitor was chosen such that the values were in the middle of the chosen concentration range. Nucleotide incorporation was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the reactions were allowed to proceed for 5 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of three reaction volumes of formamide containing traces of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. Samples were then subjected to 15% denaturing PAGE followed by phosphorimaging. The incorporation of single nucleotides was quantified as the fraction of the DNA substrate (primer n) converted to product (primer n + 1). The rate of the reaction was plotted versus the concentration of nucleotide substrate. The data points of a 42-data point Km/Ki experiment were fit to the general mixed model of inhibition using GraphPad Prism (version 5.0) to calculate kcat, Km, and Ki values. kcat is defined as the enzyme turnover number that is calculated by normalizing the maximum rate of the single nucleotide incorporation reaction to the enzyme concentration. Km is defined as the dNTP substrate concentration at half-maximum rate of the reaction. Ki is the inhibitor dissociation constant (56Copeland R.A. Evaluation of Enzyme Inhibitors in Drug Discovery: A Primer for Medicinal Chemists and Pharmacologists. John Wiley & Sons Inc., Hoboken, NJ2005: 34-37Google Scholar, 57Copeland R.A. Enzymes. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York2000: 109-145Crossref Google Scholar). Significant figures for the fitted data of all experiments are as reported by the software. Standard deviations for all experiments were determined on the basis of at least three independent replicates. The incorporation of dCTP was determined by plotting the percentage of incorporation against the concentration of PFA (Fig. 3). IC50 values were calculated by fitting at least 10 data points to a sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) equation using GraphPad Prism (version 5.0). Significant figures for the fitted data of all experiments are as reported by the software. Standard deviations for all experiments were determined on the basis of at least three independent replicates. The secondary structure prediction-based alignment between UL54 and UL30 (PDB code 2GV9) was generated through ESyPred3D Web Server 1.0 (58Lambert C. Léonard N. De Bolle X. Depiereux E. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1250-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The result was uploaded into the crystal structure-based alignment between UL30 (PDB code 2GV9) and gp43 (PDB code 1IG9 (49Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar)) using the chimera package from the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco (59Pettersen E.F.

Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (29006) Google Scholar) The sequence alignment output was graphically prepared with ESPRIPT software (60Gouet P. Robert X. Courcelle E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3320-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Conserved residues are highlighted in black, and similar residues are boxed (61Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Métoz F. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2540) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to engineer and to characterize a chimeric RB69/UL54 enzyme that facilitates the study of PFA-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis and drug resistance. We focused on segments of helix N and helix P that are located in close proximity to the phosphates of the bound dNTP substrate in the ternary complex with gp43 (Table 1 and Fig. 2) (49Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Several amino acids in these regions are likewise implicated in binding of PFA by UL54. Phenotypic susceptibility assays, and our previous biochemical data suggest that the region between 807 and 815 in helix P (556–564 in gp43) plays an important role in this regard (7Gilbert C. Boivin G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 873-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 42Tchesnokov E.P. Gilbert C. Boivin G. Götte M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Some of the amino acids of this segment can interact with the bound nucleotide, whereas others appear to be involved in interhelical interaction with residues 779–784 (477–482 in gp43) of helix N (49Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 50Shamoo Y. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 155-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). In an attempt to closely mimic the structure of UL54, we replaced amino acids that differ at equivalent positions in gp43 according to the sequence alignment shown in Fig. 2A. These changes involve the block of three amino acids between the conserved residues Lys-477 and Gln-481/Lys-482 of helix N, referred to as block A, and two blocks of three amino acids between conserved residues Gln-556 and Asn-564 of helix P, referred to as block B and block C, respectively. Of note, the alignment also points to several amino acid changes in equivalent blocks A, B, and C of UL54 and UL30, respectively. All enzymes designed and characterized in this study are listed in Table 1. We generated chimeric gp43-based enzymes in which block A of helix N and blocks B/C of helix P have been replaced by equivalent regions of UL54. Several conserved amino acids within these regions interact with the phosphates of the nucleotide (Fig. 2B). Arg-482 of helix N as well as Gln-556 of helix P appear to contact the γ-phosphate of the bound nucleotide. The same region is also implicated in PFA binding. The Q807A mutation in helix P in UL54 increases the IC50 value for PFA (42Tchesnokov E.P. Gilbert C. Boivin G. Götte M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, a potential role of helix N in PFA resistance remains to be defined. Of note, Phe-479 of helix N in gp43 is equivalent to Val-781 in UL54, and the V781I substitution in the HCMV enzyme shows decreased phenotypic susceptibility to PFA (62Baldanti F. Sarasini A. Silini E. Barbi M. Lazzarin A. Biron K.K. Gerna G. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. Suppl. 1995; 99: 103-104PubMed Google Scholar). This residue is likewise located in the vicinity of the γ-phosphate, and this region appears to be important for PFA binding. Thus, to test how close the chimeric enzyme may mimic the natural HCMV polymerase, we introduced V781I and alanine substitutions at conserved residues Arg-784 (helix N) and Gln-807 (helix P), respectively, against the background of the chimera. We initially determined steady-state kinetic parameters for single nucleotide incorporation events, and we compared several chimeric enzymes with WT gp43 (Table 2). Throughout this study, we used 3′–5′-exonuclease negative mutants to prevent potentially confounding effects through the editing activity. Replacing block A (helix N) with the equivalent UL54 region caused ∼2–3-fold reductions in the efficiency of single nucleotide in"

All members of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC)/Degenerin (Deg) channel superfamily contain an absolutely conserved Trp at the base of their first transmembrane domain. Here, we test the importance of this conserved Trp to ENaC/Deg function. Targeted substitution of this Trp in mouse ENaC and rat ASIC subunits decrease channel activity. Differential substitution with distinct amino acids in α-mENaC shows that it is loss of this critical Trp rather than introduction of residues having novel properties that changes channel activity. Surprisingly, Trp substitution unmasks voltage sensitivity. Mutant ENaC has increased steady-state activity at hyperpolarizing compared with depolarizing potentials associated with transient activation and deactivation times, respectively. The times of activation and deactivation change 1 ms/mV in a linear manner with rising and decreasing slopes, respectively. Increases in macroscopic currents at hyperpolarizing potentials results from a voltage-dependent increase in open probability. Voltage sensitivity is not influenced by divalent cations; however, it is Na+-dependent with a 63-mV decrease in voltage required to reach half-maximal activity per log increase in [Na+]. Mutant channels are particularly sensitive to intracellular [Na+] for removing this sodium abolishes voltage dependence. We conclude that the conserved Trp at the base of TM1 in ENaC/Deg channels protects against voltage by masking an inhibitory allosteric or pore block mechanism, which decreases activity in response to intracellular Na+.

Members of this important ion channel family serve diverse functions and have a wide tissue distribution, including being in epithelial and neuronal tissues. Phenotypes resulting from ENaD/Deg gain and loss of function highlight the physiological importance of these ion channels. In C. elegans, diminished function of degenerins disrupts proprioception and mechanosensation; whereas, gain of function leads to neuronal degeneration (3Bianchi L. Driscoll M.

This channel was in a pseudo-inactive state possibly resembling a closed channel conformation. The cASIC1 crystal structure confirmed that ENaC/Deg channels are trimeric (6Jasti J. Furukawa H.

Others, such as ENaC, are obligatory heterotrimers (1Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 2Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol.

All ENaC/Deg subunits are thought to share a common tertiary structure having intracellular, cytosolic NH2 and COOH tails separated from a large extracellular domain by two transmembrane-spanning domains: transmembrane domain 1 (TM1) and 2 (TM2) (1Kellenberger S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15177-15182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). ENaC/Deg channels are Na+-selective, not overtly sensitive to voltage having no time-dependent activation or inactivation and have linear current-voltage relations at the single channel level with relatively low unitary conductances ranging between 4 and 10 pS (1Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 2Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Moreover, a hallmark of these channels, particularly ENaC, is slow gating kinetics with open and closed times in the range of seconds. The ENaC/Deg pore is defined primarily by the linear TM2 helices of the three constituent subunits and does not involve P-loops as do the pores of K+ channels (6Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B.

The selectivity filter, also attributable to residues in TM2, is approximately half between the extracellular and intracellular mouths of the pore. The selectivity filter forms the narrowest part of the pore, which can be represented as two funnels closing toward the middle of the membrane (6Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). At the extracellular mouth of the pore, TM1 juxtaposes TM2 being a little outside the circumference of the pore as defined by TM2. At the intracellular mouth, TM1 and TM2 lie along the same circumference and are solvent-accessible, suggesting both transmembrane domains contribute to the intracellular vestibule of the pore (6Jasti J.

Every ENaC/Deg protein contains a conserved tryptophan residue at the intracellular base of TM1: these Trp residues reside at the first cytosolic-plasma membrane interface of all ENaC/Deg polypeptides. Little is known about the possible importance of the conserved Trp in ENaC/Deg channels. One study finds that mutation of the Trp in TM1 of α-mENaC reduces activity (13Kashlan O.B. Maarouf A.B.

A re-occurring feature common to many intrinsic membrane proteins, including ion channels, is that critical Trp residues often reside at lipid-water interfaces in helical transmembrane domains (16Tang P.

Here they insert into the lipid membrane acting either as interfacial anchoring points setting the tilt of the transmembrane domain as it spans the membrane or hinge points providing allosteric linkage for gating. We hypothesize that the conserved transmembrane domain Trp in ENaC/Deg channels serves a critical role with respect to channel function. To better understand the importance of this Trp, we quantified the effects of substituting it in mENaC. Targeted substitution of the critical Trp in α- and β-mENaC decreased channel activity and unmasked marked voltage sensitivity. Voltage sensitivity reflected voltage-dependent changes in open probability. Voltage sensitivity was Na+-dependent with intracellular [Na+] playing a particularly important role in setting the voltage at which mutant ENaC had half-maximal activity. We conclude that stabilization of the pore by Trp at the base of TM1 lessens Na+-dependent modulation of wild-type channels likely by interfering with an intrinsic allosteric or pore block mechanism. This is the first description of a mutation in ENaC/Deg channels that results in voltage sensitivity. All chemicals were from Sigma unless noted otherwise.

For electrophysiology studies, 0.3 μg/subunit/9.6 cm2 plasmid cDNA was used. For membrane-labeling studies, 1.0 μg/subunit/78.5 cm2 plasmid cDNA was used.

The subunit of interest contained the Myc tag and was followed with anti-Myc antibody. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 8.0) and subsequently incubated with 3 mm sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (in PBS, pH 8.0) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were washed again three times with ice-cold PBS plus 100 mm glycine to quench the reaction and then, extracted in gentle lysis buffer (76 mm NaCl, 50 mm HCl-Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, plus 1% Nonidet P-40 and 10% glycerol; supplemented with the protease inhibitor, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extracts were cleared and normalized for total protein concentration. Pre-equilibrated streptavidin-agarose beads were agitated overnight at 4 °C with 400 μg of total protein. Agarose beads were then washed six times with gentle lysis buffer and subsequently resuspended in SDS sample buffer and 20 mm dithiothreitol, heated at 85 °C for 10 min, run on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS, transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with anti-Myc antibody in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 5% dried milk and 0.1% Tween-20. Band intensity in developed blots was quantified by scanning the blots and then using SigmaGel (Jandel Scientific) to analyze digital images. We used a flood-above-threshold protocol with threshold set to the highest practical level. Whole cell macroscopic current recordings of ENaC and ASIC reconstituted in CHO cells were made under voltage clamp conditions using standard methods (24Pochynyuk O. Staruschenko A. Tong Q. Medina J.

Current recordings were acquired with an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instr., Union City, CA) interfaced via a Digidata 1322A (Axon Instr.) to a PC running the pClamp 9.2 suite of software (Axon Instr.). All currents were filtered at 1 kHz. Whole cell capacitance was routinely compensated and was approximately ∼9 pF for CHO cells. Series resistances, on average 2–5 MΩ, were also compensated. Only recordings where access resistance and capacitance changed less than 10% over the course of the experiment were used. Currents were evoked with standard voltage ramp and voltage step protocols. The specific protocols used in each experiment are described in “Results.” (For experiments on ASIC, currents were evoked by rapid exchange of the standard bathing solution for one with acidic pH 5.0.) Current data were collected in standard salt solutions as detailed under supplemental Table S1. For symmetrical solutions, macroscopic current voltage (I-V) curves were normalized to instantaneous current at −100 mV. I-V curves in asymetrical solutions (150/5 versus 5/150) were normalized to instantaneous current 100 mV hyperpolarized from the reversal potential. Conductance-voltage (G-V) relations plotted as relative steady-state conductance (G/Gmax) as a function of test potential. Data were fitted with the Boltzmann function (G = Gmax{1/[1 + e −(V−V1/2)zF/RT]} normalizing to the maximum of the fit. Activation and deactivation time constants (τ) were obtained by fitting current traces to a single exponential function, I = Io e(−t/τ). For excised, outside-out patches made on CHO cells overexpressing wild-type and mutant ENaC, current recordings were made under voltage-clamp conditions using an Axopatch 200B. Currents were low-pass filtered at 100 Hz by an eight-pole Bessel filter (Warner Instr.) digitized at 500 Hz, and stored on a PC using the Digidata 1322A interface. For presentation, some currents were subsequently software-filtered at 40 Hz. Gap-free current recordings were made at pipette potentials (Vp) ranging from 100 to −100 mV with inward current downwards. Current data were analyzed using pClamp 9.2. Channel activity defined as NPo was equal to Σ(t1 + 2t2 +…iti), where ti is the fractional open time spent at each of the observed current levels. Po was determined by dividing NPo for the observed number of channels within a patch as established with all-point histograms. Po calculated over ∼30–120 s for each data point. Only patches containing five or fewer channels were used for analysis. Single channel current-voltage (i-V) relations were generated from unitary currents (i) defined by all-point histograms at different holding potentials from, at least, four independent experiments. All summarized data are reported as mean ± S.E. Membrane levels of ENaC were normalized to total cellular pools. Summarized data are compared with either the Student's t test or a one way analysis of variance in conjunction with the Dunnett post-test where appropriate. p ≤ 0.05 is considered significant. As shown by the sequence alignment in Fig. 1A, an absolutely conserved tryptophan is located at the first intracellular membrane interface of all ENaC/Deg subunits. To begin probing the importance of this conserved residue to channel function, we created mutant mouse ENaC subunits containing isoleucine substitutions of these tryptophans (αW112I, βW52I, γW56I). In addition, we created mutants containing isoleucine substitutions of the residues just preceding and following the conserved Trp in α-mENaC (αF111I, αA113I). Fig. 1B shows representative macroscopic current traces from voltage-clamped CHO cells expressing all wild-type (α-, β-, and γ-mENaC) subunits and channels containing one mutant subunit. Currents were evoked with a voltage ramp (60 to −100 mV from a holding potential of 40 mV) before and after (noted by arrow) application of 10 μm amiloride. As is clear in these representative experiments and summarized in Fig. 1C, isoleucine substitution of the conserved tryptophan and the residues just before and after were tolerated in α-mENaC. In contrast, tryptophan substitutions in β- and γ-mENaC were not tolerated resulting in non-active/functional channels. Notably, substitution of the critical tryptophan in α-mENaC, but not the residues just before and after, resulted in a significant reduction in ENaC activity. To test whether the effects of substitution resulted from improper expression of mutant subunits at the membrane, we quantified membrane expression using a standard membrane labeling strategy involving biotinylation of membrane proteins followed by streptavidin precipitation. Subunits of interest (mutants) were identified in Western blots of the membrane fraction and total cellular pools through an N-terminal Myc epitope tag. The results in the summary graph in Fig. 1D demonstrate that mutation has no effect on the relative membrane expression levels of mutant subunits versus wild-type subunits. Moreover, mutation also has no effect on total subunit expression levels. As shown by the supplemental data in Fig. S1, we extended observations to other members of the ENaC/Deg channel superfamily by performing similar experiments on mutant rat ASIC containing alanine substitutions of the critical tryptophans conserved at the base of TM1 (ASIC1aW46A, ASIC2bW45A, and ASIC3W46A). As demonstrated by the representative traces in supplemental Fig. S1A and summarized in supplemental Table S1B, substitution in rASIC resulted in loss of acid-evoked currents in voltage-clamped CHO cells expressing mutant homomeric channels. These results are consistent with the conserved transmembrane domain tryptophan serving an important functional role. Tolerance in α-ENaC at this site allowed further probing of the role played by this critical tryptophan. The results in Fig. 2 demonstrate that it is the loss of the critical Trp rather than introduction of a novel amino acid, such as isoleucine, having distinct properties, that decreases activity. Fig. 2A shows summary results from voltage-clamp experiments quantifying ENaC activity for channels containing Phe, Ile, Gly, Lys, Glu, and Cys substitutions of Trp-112 in the α-subunit. Any replacement of Trp-112 significantly decreased activity. Surprisingly, the conserved substitution where aromatic Trp is replaced with aromatic Phe results in a statistically identical decrease in activity as the more invasive substitutions replacing Trp with large (Ile) and small (Gly) aliphatic residues, and a residue having a sulfur-containing side chain (Cys). Substitution with a polar residue was intolerable resulting in loss of function. Results in Fig. 2B, as those in Fig. 1D, demonstrate that these substitutions have no effect on the relative and total membrane levels of mutant α-mENaC subunits. Thus, whereas replacing Trp-112 in α-mENaC with any residue decreases activity, it appears that it is the actual loss of the critical tryptophan that is important for function rather than the characteristics of the newly introduced residue, with the caveat that polar residues have a profound impact, being particularly intolerable at this site. We were surprised to observe that mutant channels containing α-subunits with Trp substitutions showed pronounced inward rectification compared with channels containing all wild-type subunits in macroscopic I-V curves generated in asymetrical solutions (raw currents shown in Fig. 1B, I-V curves not shown). Either a change in the single channel conductance or selectivity of mutant channels or a change in their (voltage dependence of) open probability could account for this response to voltage. To test this further, we next compared the voltage dependence of activity of wild-type and mutant ENaC in voltage-clamped CHO cells in symmetrical NaCl solutions. Fig. 3A shows families of representative macroscopic currents evoked by test pulses ranging from 100 to −100 mV for wild-type channels and channels containing the W112C mutation. As expected at all voltages between 100 and −100 mV, instantaneous and steady-state currents were similar for wild-type channels with no noticeable time dependence of activation or voltage sensitivity. This is further highlighted by the I-V plots of instantaneous and steady-state macroscopic currents in Fig. 3B for wild-type and mutant ENaC. In contrast, channels containing mutant α-subunits had linear instantaneous currents similar to wild-type channels but larger relative inward steady-state currents at hyperpolarizing potentials and smaller outward steady-state currents at depolarizing potentials. Moreover, activation at hyperpolarizing potentials and deactivation at depolarizing potentials had significant time-dependent components. The G-V curve for steady-state current in Fig. 3C for channels containing W112C α-subunits emphasizes the voltage sensitivity of mutant channels. In contrast, the inset in Fig. 3C emphasizes that wild-type mENaC is not sensitive to voltage over this range. These results excluded a change in selectivity as underpinning voltage sensitivity in mutant ENaC, pointing to either a change in unitary conductance or open probability. Fig. 4, A and B, respectively, show typical single channel current traces for wild-type channels and channels with W112C α-subunits in excised, outside-out patches in symmetrical 150 mm LiCl solutions at holding potentials ranging from 80 to −80 mV. As is clear in these representative traces and in the summary graph of Po versus voltage shown in Fig. 4C, wild-type channels showed no voltage dependence of Po over this voltage range. In contrast, there was a clear voltage-dependent change in Po in mutant channels with Po increasing as a function of hyperpolarization. Fig. 4D confirms that mutation has no effect on unitary current at any voltage: Unit"

Rejection rate however does not relate to reviewer age. These results indicate that the likelihood of getting a paper accepted for publication may depend upon factors in addition to scientific merit. Multiple reviewer selection for a given manuscript therefore should consider not only appropriate expertise, but also reviewers that have variable publication experience with a range of different journals to ensure balanced treatment. Interestingly since age did not relate to rejection rates, more senior scientists are not necessarily more jaded in reviewing practices."
https://openalex.org/W1991108256,"The myriad functions of complex carbohydrates include modulating interactions between bacteria and their eukaryotic hosts. In humans and other vertebrates, variations in the activity of glycosyltransferases of CAZy family 6 generate antigenic variation between individuals and species that facilitates resistance to pathogens. The well characterized vertebrate glycosyltransferases of this family are multidomain membrane proteins with C-terminal catalytic domains. Genes for proteins homologous with their catalytic domains are found in at least nine species of anaerobic commensal bacteria and a cyanophage. Although the bacterial proteins are strikingly similar in sequence to the catalytic domains of their eukaryotic relatives, a metal-binding Asp-X-Asp sequence, present in a wide array of metal ion-dependent glycosyltransferases, is replaced by Asn-X-Asn. We have cloned and expressed one of these proteins from Bacteroides ovatus, a bacterium that is linked to inflammatory bowel disease. Functional characterization shows it to be a metal-independent glycosyltransferase with a 200-fold preference for UDP-GalNAc as substrate relative to UDP-Gal. It efficiently catalyzes the synthesis of oligosaccharides similar to human blood group A and may participate in the synthesis of the bacterial O-antigen. The kinetics for GalNAc transfer to 2'-fucosyl lactose are characteristic of a sequential mechanism, as observed previously for this family. Mutational studies indicate that despite the lack of a metal cofactor, there are pronounced similarities in structure-function relationships between the bacterial and vertebrate family 6 glycosyltransferases. These two groups appear to provide an example of horizontal gene transfer involving vertebrates and prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1981133315,"The simplest and likeliest assumption concerning the cognitive bases of absolute pitch (AP) is that at its origin there is a particularly skilled function which matches the height of the perceived pitch to the verbal label of the musical tone. Since there is no difference in sound frequency resolution between AP and non-AP (NAP) musicians, the hypothesis of the present study is that the failure of NAP musicians in pitch identification relies mainly in an inability to retrieve the correct verbal label to be assigned to the perceived musical note. The primary hypothesis is that, when asked to identify tones, NAP musicians confuse the verbal labels to be attached to the stimulus on the basis of their phonetic content. Data from two AP tests are reported, in which subjects had to respond in the presence or in the absence of visually presented verbal note labels (fixed Do solmization). Results show that NAP musicians confuse more frequently notes having a similar vowel in the note label. They tend to confuse e.g. a 261 Hz tone (Do) more often with Sol than, e.g., with La. As a second goal, we wondered whether this effect is lateralized, i.e. whether one hemisphere is more responsible than the other in the confusion of notes with similar labels. This question was addressed by observing pitch identification during dichotic listening. Results showed that there is a right hemispheric disadvantage, in NAP but not AP musicians, in the retrieval of the verbal label to be assigned to the perceived pitch. The present results indicate that absolute pitch has strong verbal bases, at least from a cognitive point of view."
https://openalex.org/W2139187156,"Anthrax lethal toxin (LT) was previously shown to enhance transcriptional activity of NF-κB in tumor necrosis factor-α-activated primary human endothelial cells. Here we show that this LT-mediated increase in NF-κB activation is associated with the enhanced degradation of the inhibitory proteins IκBα and IκBβ but not IκBϵ. Moreover, this was accompanied by enhanced activation of the IκB kinase complex (IKK), which is responsible for targeting IκB proteins for degradation. Importantly, LT enhancement of IκBα degradation was completely blocked by a selective IKKβ inhibitor, whereas IκBβ degradation was attenuated, suggesting a mechanistic link. Consistent with the above data, LT-cotreated cells show elevated phosphorylation of two IKK substrates, IκBα and p65, both of which were blocked by incubation with the IKKβ inhibitor. Consistent with NF-κB activation, LT increased transcription of the NF-κB regulated gene <i>CD40</i>. Conversely, LT inhibited transcription of another NF-κB-regulated gene, <i>CCL2</i>. This inhibition was linked to the LT-mediated suppression of another <i>CCL2</i>-regulating transcription factor, AP-1 (activator protein-1). These data suggest that LT-mediated enhancement of NF-κB is IKK-dependent, but importantly, the net effect of LT on the transcription of proinflammatory genes is driven by the cumulative effect of LT on the particular set of transcription factors that regulate a given promoter. Together, these findings provide new mechanistic insight on how LT may disrupt the host response to anthrax."
https://openalex.org/W2168766568,"Control of gammaherpesvirus infections requires a complex, well orchestrated immune response regulated by positive and negative co-signaling molecules. While the impact of co-stimulatory molecules has been addressed in various studies, the role of co-inhibitory receptors has not been tested. The ITIM-bearing CEACAM1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed by a variety of immune cells, including B, T and NK cells. Using Ceacam1−/− mice, we analyzed the in vivo function of CEACAM1 during acute and latent murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) infection. During acute lytic replication, we observed lower virus titers in the lungs of Ceacam1−/− mice than in WT mice. In contrast, during latency amplification, Ceacam1−/− mice displayed increased splenomegaly and a higher latent viral load in the spleen. Analysis of the immune response revealed increased virus-specific antibody levels in Ceacam1−/− mice, while the magnitude of the T cell-mediated antiviral immune response was reduced. These findings suggest that inhibitory receptors can modulate the efficacy of immune responses against gammaherpesvirus infections."
