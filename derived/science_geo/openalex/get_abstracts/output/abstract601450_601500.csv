https://openalex.org/W2773637439,"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be directed to differentiate into skeletal muscle progenitor cells (SMPCs). However, the myogenicity of hPSC-SMPCs relative to human fetal or adult satellite cells remains unclear. We observed that hPSC-SMPCs derived by directed differentiation are less functional in vitro and in vivo compared to human satellite cells. Using RNA sequencing, we found that the cell surface receptors ERBB3 and NGFR demarcate myogenic populations, including PAX7 progenitors in human fetal development and hPSC-SMPCs. We demonstrated that hPSC skeletal muscle is immature, but inhibition of transforming growth factor-β signalling during differentiation improved fusion efficiency, ultrastructural organization and the expression of adult myosins. This enrichment and maturation strategy restored dystrophin in hundreds of dystrophin-deficient myofibres after engraftment of CRISPR–Cas9-corrected Duchenne muscular dystrophy human induced pluripotent stem cell-SMPCs. The work provides an in-depth characterization of human myogenesis, and identifies candidates that improve the in vivo myogenic potential of hPSC-SMPCs to levels that are equal to directly isolated human fetal muscle cells. Hicks et al. compare human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived muscle progenitors to fetal muscle cells, identify ERBB3/NGFR+ populations with improved myogenic potential in vivo and enhance cell maturation by inhibiting TGF-β signalling during directed differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2774408266,"The resolution of joint molecules that link recombining sister chromatids is essential for chromosome segregation. Here, we determine the fate of unresolved recombination intermediates arising in cells lacking two nucleases required for resolution (GEN1 –/– knockout cells depleted of MUS81). We find that intermediates persist until mitosis and form a distinct class of anaphase bridges, which we term homologous recombination ultra-fine bridges (HR-UFBs). HR-UFBs are distinct from replication stress-associated UFBs, which arise at common fragile sites, and from centromeric UFBs. HR-UFBs are processed by BLM helicase to generate single-stranded RPA-coated bridges that are broken during mitosis. In the next cell cycle, DNA breaks activate the DNA damage checkpoint response, and chromosome fusions arise by non-homologous end joining. Consequently, the cells undergo cell cycle delay and massive cell death. These results lead us to present a model detailing how unresolved recombination intermediates can promote DNA damage and chromosomal instability. Chan et al. show that unresolved recombination intermediates form a previously unappreciated type of ultra-fine bridge. These bridges are broken upon cell division, leading to chromosome breaks and instability."

Mutant p53 protein stabilization is a prerequisite for gain-of-function manifestation; however, it does not represent an intrinsic property of p53 mutants, but rather requires secondary events 2 . Moreover, mutant p53 protein levels are often heterogeneous even within the same tumour, raising questions on the mechanisms that control local mutant p53 accumulation in some tumour cells but not in their neighbours 2,3 . By investigating the cellular pathways that induce protection of mutant p53 from ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, we found that HDAC6/Hsp90-dependent mutant p53 accumulation is sustained by RhoA geranylgeranylation downstream of the mevalonate pathway, as well as by RhoA- and actin-dependent transduction of mechanical inputs, such as the stiffness of the extracellular environment. Our results provide evidence for an unpredicted layer of mutant p53 regulation that relies on metabolic and mechanical cues."
https://openalex.org/W2776278222,"Crotalicidin (Ctn), a cathelicidin-related peptide from the venom of a South American rattlesnake, possesses potent antimicrobial, antitumor, and antifungal properties. Previously, we have shown that its C-terminal fragment, Ctn(15–34), retains the antimicrobial and antitumor activities but is less toxic to healthy cells and has improved serum stability. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of action of Ctn and Ctn(15–34) against Gram-negative bacteria. Both peptides were bactericidal, killing ∼90% of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells within 90–120 and 5–30 min, respectively. Studies of ζ potential at the bacterial cell membrane suggested that both peptides accumulate at and neutralize negative charges on the bacterial surface. Flow cytometry experiments confirmed that both peptides permeabilize the bacterial cell membrane but suggested slightly different mechanisms of action. Ctn(15–34) permeabilized the membrane immediately upon addition to the cells, whereas Ctn had a lag phase before inducing membrane damage and exhibited more complex cell-killing activity, probably because of two different modes of membrane permeabilization. Using surface plasmon resonance and leakage assays with model vesicles, we confirmed that Ctn(15–34) binds to and disrupts lipid membranes and also observed that Ctn(15–34) has a preference for vesicles that mimic bacterial or tumor cell membranes. Atomic force microscopy visualized the effect of these peptides on bacterial cells, and confocal microscopy confirmed their localization on the bacterial surface. Our studies shed light onto the antimicrobial mechanisms of Ctn and Ctn(15–34), suggesting Ctn(15–34) as a promising lead for development as an antibacterial/antitumor agent.

New antimicrobial drugs are urgently needed to address the growing challenge of bacterial resistance to existing antibiotics. Misuse of classical antibiotics has increased the number of superbugs and created a critical situation whereby previously controlled pathogens could in the future cause major morbidity or mortality (1Thabit A.K.

Although they can act in several possible ways to accomplish microbial cell death (e.g. membrane disruption, apoptosis induction, and internal target inhibition) (7Yeaman M.R. Yount N.Y.

Accordingly, most AMPs display fairly conserved structural and physicochemical properties, such as positive net charge, high content of hydrophobic amino acid residues, or amphipathic structure, all favoring interaction with and insertion into membranes (11Marín-Medina N.

Cathelicidins are a large family of AMPs whose unifying feature is the presence of a conserved cathelin (cathepsin L inhibitor) domain at the N terminus. In contrast, their C-terminal domains contain a mature and active AMP and display high inter- and intraspecies diversity (13Tomasinsig L. Zanetti M. The cathelicidins: structure, function and evolution.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2005; 6 (15638766): 23-3410.2174/1389203053027520Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Cathelicidins have been shown to be active against a broad range of targets, including bacteria, enveloped viruses, and fungi (14Kościuczuk E.M. Lisowski P. Jarczak J. Strzałkowska N. Jóźwik A.

In addition to causing direct pathogen killing, cathelicidins can modulate the immune response by assisting with pathogen clearance (15Wong J.H. Ye X.J. Ng T.B.

We recently identified a new family of cathelicidin-like peptides named vipericidins in the venom glands of various South American pit viper snakes and experimentally validated them as AMPs (26Falcao C.B. de La Torre B.G.

Vipericidins: a novel family of cathelicidin-related peptides from the venom gland of South American pit vipers.Amino Acids. 2014; 46 (25100358): 2561-257110.1007/s00726-014-1801-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Crotalicidin (Ctn), the most active vipericidin, is a 34-residue helical peptide found in Crotalus durissus terrificus and was selected for further study. Ctn displays powerful antimicrobial, as well as antitumor and antifungal, activity. However, it is moderately hemolytic and unstable in serum (27Falcao C.B. Pérez-Peinado C. de la Torre B.G. Mayol X.

To overcome these limitations, a rational dissection of the Ctn sequence was undertaken, aimed at identifying active motifs with enhanced properties. The search produced as main lead Ctn(15–34), a structurally disordered 20-mer that spans the C terminus and replicates the antibacterial and antitumor activities of the parental peptide but is less toxic toward healthy cells and significantly more stable in human serum (27Falcao C.B. Pérez-Peinado C. de la Torre B.G. Mayol X. Zamora-Carreras H. Jiménez M.Á. Rádis-Baptista G. Andreu D.

Investigating the mechanism of action on bacteria of both Ctn and Ctn(15–34) is of considerable interest, particularly given the potential therapeutic applications of the latter peptide. In this study, the mode of action of Ctn and Ctn(15–34) toward two Gram-negative bacterial species was investigated in detail. We determined bactericidal concentrations and quantitative kinetics of cell death and measured peptide accumulation on bacterial cell surfaces. Combining flow cytometry and colony count procedures, we established that bacterial death is accomplished by membrane disruption. We also monitored peptide uptake and membrane permeabilization in real time to ascertain whether both effects are achieved simultaneously or peptide pre-accumulation precedes loss of viability. To visualize peptide localization and structural damage on bacteria surface, we carried out confocal and atomic force microscopy experiments. Furthermore, to gain insights into the cell selectivity and the ability to disrupt lipid bilayers of the fragment Ctn(15–34), we performed experiments with model vesicles mimicking healthy human and bacterial cell membranes. Altogether, our results provide strong evidence that Ctn and Ctn(15–34) act by inducing disruption of the bacterial cell; they also exemplify how a set of optimized methodologies can be combined to evaluate the action of AMPs at the membrane level. The amino acid sequences in Table 1 were prepared in C-terminal amide form by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase synthesis and purified to >95% purity (see Fig. S1 for HPLC and MS data). For the N-terminal rhodamine B (RhB)-labeled peptides, the two peaks observed in the chromatograms of purified compounds (Fig. S1a) are due to RhB atropisomerism. The overall hydrophobicity of unlabeled and RhB-labeled peptides can be compared by the percentage of acetonitrile (ACN) at which they elute in HPLC (Table 1). Values for unlabeled Ctn and Ctn(15–34) were 30.9 and 30.3% ACN, respectively, whereas RhB-labeled versions eluted at 34.7 and 34.2% ACN, respectively, underlining the increase in hydrophobicity brought about by RhB labeling.Table 1Peptides used in this studyPeptideAmino acid sequenceTheoretical massaTheoretical molecular mass was calculated using GPMAW version 8.10.Experimental massbExperimental molecular mass was determined from the MS spectra shown in Fig. S1b.PuritycPeptide purity was estimated by peak integration of the analytical HPLC chromatograms shown in Fig. S1a.ACN gradientdACN gradient over 15 min used to run the analytical HPLC.

Open table in a new tab We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of Ctn and Ctn(15–34) against two Gram-negative bacterial strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (P. aeruginosa). As shown in Table 2, Ctn has the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for E. coli as well as for P. aeruginosa (0.78 and 1.56 μm, respectively). Ctn(15–34) also has a low MIC for E. coli (3.13 μm), but the concentration required to prevent P. aeruginosa visible growth is higher (12.5 μm). To determine whether the peptides were bactericidal or bacteriostatic, the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were also determined (Table 2). The data show both Ctn and Ctn(15–34) to be bactericidal, as MBCs exceed MICs by <2-fold (29Levison M.E. Levison J.H. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antibacterial agents.Infect. Dis. Clin.

The MIC/MBC determinations reveal that more peptide is required for bacterial death when higher bacterial inocula are used. This difference is significant for E. coli, for which up to 3 times more peptide is needed. These results support previous observations suggesting that the therapeutic effect of AMPs depends on the peptide/cell ratio rather than directly on peptide concentration (30Roversi D. Luca V. Aureli S. Park Y. Mangoni M.L. Stella L. How many antimicrobial peptide molecules kill a bacterium? The case of PMAP-23.ACS Chem.

In tune with this suggestion, and to avoid the results being influenced by the use of different peptide/cell ratios, peptide concentrations for mechanism-of-action studies were adjusted to the bacterial inoculum used for each specific experiment.Table 2MIC and MBC of Ctn and Ctn(15–34) against two standard Gram-negative bacterial strainsPeptideE. coli ATCC 25922P. aeruginosa ATCC 278535 × 105 cfu/ml107 cfu/ml5 × 105 cfu/ml107 cfu/mlMIC (μm)Ctn0.786.251.563.13Ctn(15–34)3.135012.525MBC (μm)Ctn1.566.253.133.13Ctn(15–34)6.255025–5025 Open table in a new tab The killing kinetics of E. coli and P. aeruginosa by Ctn and Ctn(15–34) at their respective MBCs was evaluated using a time-kill assay. The results in Fig. 1a show that for both peptides, a bactericidal effect (99.9% reduction of bacterial viability) against E. coli is observed within 4 h. At 90 min, Ctn kills >90% of bacteria, whereas Ctn(15–34) needs 120 min for a similar effect. Ctn and Ctn(15–34) are faster at killing P. aeruginosa, requiring only 5 or 30 min for 90% cell death, respectively, with bactericidal effect observed at 15 and 90 min, respectively. This relatively fast effect against E. coli, even faster against P. aeruginosa, suggests that both peptides act by direct damage to the bacterial membrane rather than by inhibition of an internal target. To investigate whether surface charge can be neutralized by the accumulation of the peptides at the membrane of E. coli or P. aeruginosa, ζ potential measurements were carried out.

In the presence of increasing peptide concentrations, a shift to positive ζ potential values is observed. In E. coli, complete neutralization of the surface charge occurs at 0.78–3.13 μm Ctn and 1.56–3.13 μm Ctn(15–34), whereas for P. aeruginosa, total surface charge neutralization is reached at 0.78–3.13 μm Ctn and 3.13–6.25 μm Ctn(15–34). For both bacteria, membrane neutralization occurs at concentrations below the MIC/MBC of either peptide. To clarify whether E. coli and P. aeruginosa death induced by Ctn and Ctn(15–34) is due to direct membrane disruption, correlation between membrane permeabilization and bacterial viability was studied. To this end, a flow cytometry assay (FCA) with SYTOX® Green to examine membrane permeabilization and a plate colony count to quantify viable cells were performed. As a cell-impermeable nucleic acid stain that only labels bacteria with compromised plasma membrane, SYTOX® Green is a useful tool in bacterial viability studies. As shown in Fig. 2, an increased percentage of bacterial cells with SYTOX® Green-permeable membrane is accompanied by a decrease in cell viability by the colony count method. FCA histograms on the SYTOX® Green channel (Fig. 2a) shift to higher fluorescence intensities indicative of E. coli and P. aeruginosa membrane disruption with increasing peptide concentration. Negative and positive controls (live and dead bacteria; black and gray histograms, respectively) were used to define gates and calculate permeabilization percentages, shown in Fig. 2b along with the viability percentages obtained in the colony count assay. A direct correlation between both sets of data (Fig. 2b) confirms that antibacterial activity of Ctn and Ctn(15–34) is mediated by membrane permeabilization. To correlate the membrane permeabilization effect with peptide uptake (including both membrane-bound and intracellularly internalized), a parallel FCA experiment was performed with RhB-labeled versions of both peptides. From the SYTOX® Green and RhB channel readings (Fig. S2, a and b), the percentages of permeabilized and of peptide-internalizing cells, respectively, were determined (Fig. S2c). For both Ctn and Ctn(15–34), an increase in E. coli permeabilization coincides with increased peptide uptake, suggesting a direct correlation between the membrane damage observed and peptide entry/binding. The dose–response curve for RhB-Ctn (Fig. S2c, continuous red line) is similar to that for unlabeled Ctn (Fig. 2b, continuous red line), suggesting that RhB does not interfere with the peptide effect. In contrast, the profiles for RhB-labeled (Fig. S2c, continuous blue line) and unlabeled Ctn(15–34) (Fig. 2b, continuous blue line) are different. Whereas the latter induces 50% permeabilization in the 6.25–12.5 μm range, the percentage rises to 80% for the RhB-labeled analogue at similar concentrations. Moreover, at higher (25–100 μm) concentrations, a decrease in membrane permeabilization and uptake of RhB-Ctn(15–34) occurs, an effect not observed for unlabeled Ctn(15–34). This probably reflects a loss in integrity of the bacterial cell, no longer capable of retaining the labeled peptide within, and with its DNA (SYTOX® Green target) either damaged or leaking out. The observation of N-terminal RhB label interfering with the activity of Ctn(15–34) calls for caution in extrapolating results from labeled to unlabeled versions of this peptide. Changes in membrane permeabilization and peptide uptake were monitored by a time-resolved flow cytometry assay, which allows a more accurate study of the kinetics of peptide effect, compared with kinetic studies based on end-point sampling. We studied the membrane permeabilization of E. coli using SYTOX® Green dye right after Ctn or Ctn(15–34) addition, monitoring the changes from negative to positive gates for 90 min. Fig. 3 (a and b) shows time-course results and negative and positive controls (for the whole acquisition, see Movies S1a and S1b for Ctn and Ctn(15–34), respectively). As detailed under “Experimental procedures,” data from the FCA histograms were used to generate the kinetic curves on Fig. 3c. Data were fitted using the two-state kinetic model described previously for other AMPs (34Freire J.M. Gaspar D. de la Torre B.G. Veiga A.S. Andreu D. Castanho M.A. Monitoring antibacterial permeabilization in real time using time-resolved flow cytometry.Biochim. Biophys.

Although both peptides induce permeabilization of ∼90% of bacteria after 90 min (Fig. 3c), the process differs between peptides at the early stages; based on the tendency of the experimental data, Ctn(15–34) seems to start killing bacteria right after its addition, and the permeabilization takes place in a single process. In contrast, Ctn shows an initial lag phase. Fitting of the kinetic data to a two-state model results in statistically poor residuals for some time intervals (Fig. S3), suggesting that for both peptides, permeabilization is more complex than as assumed by the model. An additional slow event leading to permeabilization is suggested because the data deviate from the fit at longer times. In contrast, the fit is quite acceptable at shorter times. k0, the membrane attachment rate constant, is higher for Ctn(15–34) than for Ctn (2 × 10−2 s−1 versus 1 × 10−3 s−1) as well as the permeabilization rate constant (1 × 10−3 s−1 versus 9 × 10−4 s−1). Cooperativity is not observed in either case (f ∼ 0), contrary to other AMPs (34Freire J.M. Gaspar D. de la Torre B.G. Veiga A.S. Andreu D.

However, few therapeutic targets have been identified. The objective of this study was to identify novel targets for promotion of remyelination and characterize their activity in vitro and in vivo.A high-content screening assay with differentiation of primary rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells was used to screen GSK-proprietary annotated libraries for remyelination-promoting compounds. Compounds were further validated in vitro and in vivo models; clinical relevance of target was confirmed in human post-mortem brain sections from patients with MS.Of ~1000 compounds screened, 36 promoted oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner; seven were histamine receptor-3 (H3R) antagonists. Inverse agonists of H3R but not neutral antagonists promoted oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation. H3R was expressed throughout OPC differentiation; H3R expression was transiently upregulated on Days 3-5 and subsequently downregulated. H3R gene knockdown in OPCs increased the expression of differentiation markers and the number of mature oligodendrocytes. Overexpression of full-length H3R reduced differentiation marker expression and the number of mature cells. H3R inverse agonist GSK247246 reduced intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) and downstream cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Histone deacetylase (HDAC-1) and Hes-5 were identified as key downstream targets of H3R during OPC differentiation. In the mouse cuprizone/rapamycin model of demyelination, systemic administration of brain-penetrable GSK247246 enhanced remyelination and subsequently protected axons. Finally, we detected high H3R expression in oligodendroglial cells from demyelination lesions in human samples of patients with MS, and validated a genetic association between an exonic single nucleotide polymorphism in HRH3 and susceptibility to multiple sclerosis.From phenotypic screening to human genetics, we provide evidence for H3R as a novel therapeutic target to promote remyelination in patients with multiple sclerosis."

As such, there remains a strong need for novel therapeutic strategies. The janus kinase (JAK)2/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 pathway regulates many cellular processes in GBM, including survival, proliferation, invasion, anti-apoptosis, and immune evasion. Here, we evaluated the preclinical efficacy of pacritinib, a novel compound targeting JAK2, using a collection of diverse patient-derived brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs).The effects of pacritinib on BTIC viability and sphere forming capacity were evaluated in vitro using the alamarBlue and neurosphere assays, respectively. On-target inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling was investigated using western blotting. The efficacy of pacritinib was tested in vivo in pharmacokinetic analyses, liver microsome analyses, and Kaplan-Meier survival studies.In vitro, pacritinib decreased BTIC viability and sphere forming potential at low micromolar doses and demonstrated on-target inhibition of STAT3 signaling. Additionally, pacritinib was found to improve the response to temozolomide (TMZ) in TMZ-resistant BTICs. In vivo, systemic treatment with pacritinib demonstrated blood-brain barrier penetration and led to improved overall median survival in combination with TMZ, in mice orthotopically xenografted with an aggressive recurrent GBM BTIC culture.This preclinical study demonstrates the efficacy of pacritinib and supports the feasibility of testing pacritinib for the treatment of GBM, in combination with the standard of care TMZ."
https://openalex.org/W2777743591,"Radiation therapy has been long utilized as localized cancer treatment. Recent studies have also demonstrated that it has a distant effect by the enhanced immunity, but it rarely occurs. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether X-ray irradiation combined with anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies (P1C4) provides a higher probability of this distant effect as well as enhanced local antitumor efficacy for osteosarcoma. LM8 mouse osteosarcoma cells were inoculated into both legs of C3H mice assigned to one of four groups, namely no treatment (No Tx), P1C4, X-ray irradiation (RAD) to the leg of one side, and combination (COMB) groups. Survival and treatment-related immune molecular changes were analyzed. Administration of P1C4 produced a tumor growth delay on day 30 in 18% of the mice. In contrast, combination therapy produced the strongest tumor growth inhibition not only at the irradiated tumor but also at unirradiated tumor in 67% of the mice. Accordingly, lung metastasis in the COMB group was strongly reduced by 98%, with a significant survival benefit. Unirradiated tumor in mice in the COMB group significantly recruited CD8 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with a moderate reduction of Treg, producing a significant increase in the CD8/Treg ratio. These results suggest that radiation enhances the efficacy of P1C4 treatment against distant metastasis as well as local control in osteosarcoma. Our data suggest that radiation therapy combined with dual checkpoint blockade may be a promising therapeutic option for osteosarcoma."

However, although the development of Hsp90 inhibitors has benefited from the identification of clients, such as Raf-1 proto-oncogene, Ser/Thr kinase (RAF1), that are particularly dependent on this chaperone, no equivalent clients for Hsp70 have been reported. Using chemical probes and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, we found here that the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins, including c-IAP1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), are obligate Hsp70 clients that are rapidly (within ˜3–12 h) lost after inhibition of Hsp70 but not of Hsp90. Mutagenesis and pulldown experiments revealed multiple Hsp70-binding sites on XIAP, suggesting that it is a direct, physical Hsp70 client. Interestingly, this interaction was unusually tight (˜260 nm) for an Hsp70–client interaction and involved non-canonical regions of the chaperone. Finally, we also found that Hsp70 inhibitor treatments caused loss of c-IAP1 and XIAP in multiple cancer cell lines and in tumor xenografts, but not in healthy cells. These results are expected to significantly accelerate Hsp70 drug discovery by providing XIAP as a pharmacodynamic biomarker.

Hsp90 is an obligate dimer that uses its N-terminal and middle domains to interact with partially folded and near-native states (30Li J. Soroka J. Buchner J.

Hsp90 has been reported to bind a more restricted set of ˜200 kinases and transcription factors (5Taipale M. Krykbaeva I. Koeva M. Kayatekin C. Westover K.D. Karras G.I. Lindquist S.

Much of what we know about how Hsp70 and Hsp90 bind to clients comes from pioneering work on glucocorticoid receptor (29Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Regulation of signaling protein function and trafficking by the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery.Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228 (12563018): 111-13310.1177/153537020322800201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). In that system, Hsp70 uses its SBD to bind to newly synthesized glucocorticoid receptor during primary folding, whereas Hsp90 is recruited to bind the later, partially folded states. Because of these differences in chaperone structure and binding preference, it seems possible that some clients might be more dependent on one chaperone than the other for stability. Recent work has yielded first-generation Hsp70 inhibitors, which have proven to be useful chemical probes (16Assimon V.A. Gillies A.T. Rauch J.N. Gestwicki J.E. Hsp70 protein complexes as drug targets.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2013; 19 (22920901): 404-41710.2174/1381612811306030404Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For example, analogs of MKT-077 (including JG-98) stabilize the ADP-bound state of Hsc70 and Hsp70 (33Rousaki A. Miyata Y. Jinwal U.K. Dickey C.A. Gestwicki J.E. Zuiderweg E.R.

Likewise, pifithrin-μ (PES) and its analogs bind to the SBD of Hsp70 and have anti-proliferative activity in multiple cancer cells (36Kaiser M. Kühnl A. Reins J. Fischer S. Ortiz-Tanchez J. Schlee C.

Moreover, both JG-98 and PES are less toxic to normal, non-transformed cells, consistent with the “addiction” of cancer cells to Hsp70. Together, these experiments have helped solidify the proposed role of Hsp70 in tumorigenesis (4Powers M.V. Clarke P.A. Workman P. Death by chaperone: HSP90, HSP70 or both?.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8 (19197160): 518-52610.4161/cc.8.4.7583Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, further development of Hsp70 inhibitors has been limited by a lack of pharmacodynamic biomarkers. In particular, the reported Hsp70 clients, such as Raf-1 (34Li X. Srinivasan S.R. Connarn J. Ahmad A. Young Z.T. Kabza A.M. Zuiderweg E.R. Sun D. Gestwicki J.E. Analogs of the allosteric heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) inhibitor, MKT-077, as anti-cancer agents.ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2013; 4 (24312699)10.1021/ml400204nCrossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar), are also Hsp90 clients, so it is not clear whether their degradation is due to inhibition of just Hsp70 or a combination of the chaperones. The availability of Hsp90 inhibitors, such as 17-DMAG, was essential in discovering the clients of Hsp90 (5Taipale M. Krykbaeva I. Koeva M. Kayatekin C. Westover K.D. Karras G.I. Lindquist S. Quantitative analysis of HSP90-client interactions reveals principles of substrate recognition.Cell. 2012; 150 (22939624): 987-100110.1016/j.cell.2012.06.047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 41Mimnaugh E.G.

In that work, the inhibitors were identified first and then used to reveal that many kinases and transcription factors rely on that chaperone. Inspired by this history, we wanted to take advantage of the new Hsp70 inhibitors to learn whether any reported chaperone clients might be relatively more sensitive to Hsp70 versus Hsp90. Based on recent reports (35Colvin T.A. Gabai V.L. Gong J. Calderwood S.K. Li H. Gummuluru S. Matchuk O.N. Smirnova S.G. Orlova N.V. Zamulaeva I.A. Garcia-Marcos M. Li X. Young Z.T. Rauch J.N. Gestwicki J.E. et al.Hsp70-Bag3 interactions regulate cancer-related signaling networks.Cancer Res. 2014; 74 (24994713): 4731-474010.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-0747, 10.1158/1538-7445.AM2014-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we selected a handful of candidate clients and found that the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), such as c-IAP1 and XIAP, appear to be obligate clients of Hsp70 that are less reliant on Hsp90. This was a particularly interesting result because IAPs are important mediators of cell survival signaling and are overexpressed in many cancers (42Arnaud L.T. Myeku N. Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Proteasome-caspase-cathepsin sequence leading to tau pathology induced by prostaglandin J2 in neuronal cells.J. Neurochem. 2009; 110 (19457109): 328-34210.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06142.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The IAP family includes c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and XIAP, and it is defined by the inclusion of one or more baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domain (43Birnbaum M.J. Clem R.J. Miller L.K.

Norton R.S. Vaux D.L. Day C.L. Solution structure of a baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) repeat.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6 (10404221): 648-65110.1038/10701Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The BIR domains bind to caspases and prevent apoptotic signaling (45Eckelman B.P. Salvesen G.S. Scott F.L. Human inhibitor of apoptosis proteins: why XIAP is the black sheep of the family.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7 (17016456): 988-99410.1038/sj.embor.7400795Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and are bona fide drug targets in their own right. Here, we show that treatment with Hsp70 inhibitors leads to rapid and dramatic loss of the IAPs in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. To understand this relationship in more detail, we explored the interaction between XIAP and Hsp70 in vitro and found that the chaperone binds to multiple sites within the BIR2 and BIR3 domains. Mutagenesis and NMR studies suggested that the interaction is tight and not canonical; it seemed to involve regions outside of Hsp70's expected binding cleft. Together, these results suggest that IAPs are direct clients of Hsp70, and they might be candidate biomarkers of Hsp70. Moreover, these results illuminate surprising differences between how cancer cells rely on Hsp70 and Hsp90. Chemical inhibitors of Hsp70 have been reported to enhance turnover of a number of proteins, including IAP-1, XIAP, Raf-1, tau, androgen receptor and others (35Colvin T.A. Gabai V.L. Gong J.

However, it is not clear whether any of them might be relatively selective for Hsp70 compared with Hsp90. To address this question, we first examined the levels of XIAP, c-IAP1, and Raf-1 after treatment with either Hsp70 or Hsp90 inhibitors. These studies employed MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells because growth of these cells had previously been shown to be sensitive to both Hsp70 and Hsp90 inhibitors (34Li X. Srinivasan S.R. Connarn J. Ahmad A. Young Z.T. Kabza A.M. Zuiderweg E.R. Sun D. Gestwicki J.E. Analogs of the allosteric heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) inhibitor, MKT-077, as anti-cancer agents.ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2013; 4 (24312699)10.1021/ml400204nCrossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Moreover, we initially focused on XIAP and c-IAP1, rather than other putative clients, based on serendipitous observations made during recent studies of necroptosis (59Srinivasan S.R. Cesa L.C. Li X. Julien O. Zhuang M. Shao H. Chung J. Maillard I. Wells J.A. Duckett C.S. Gestwicki J.E. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) suppresses RIP1-dependent apoptotic and necroptotic cascades.Mol. Cancer Res. 2017; 16 (28970360): 58-6810.1186/s12943-017-0630-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Finally, to provide greater confidence in the results, we used two structurally distinct inhibitors of each chaperone. For Hsp70, we used PES and JG-98, and we used AUY-922 and 17-DMAG as Hsp90 inhibitors (see Fig. 1A). In the first experiments, MTT assays were used to confirm that all of the inhibitors have anti-proliferative activity at the expected EC50 values (Fig. 1B). These experiments allowed us to use each of the compounds at a concentration that ensured maximal activity (10 μm for JG-98, AUY-922, and 17-DMAG and 30 μm for PES). Next, we characterized the kinetics of cell death by performing MTT assays at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment. We found that both JG-98 and PES caused relatively rapid responses, with 50% cell proliferation lost by ˜10 h and more than 80% by 24 h (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the response to AUY-922 and 17-DMAG took a longer period of time, with 72+ h required to reduce growth by 80%. The results of these kinetic experiments were important in our search for Hsp70 clients because we were most interested in those clients that are degraded prior to extensive loss of cell viability. More explicitly, we considered it likely that non-specific client degradation, triggered by downstream caspase activation and/or other proteolytic events, might be confounding at later times; whereas the bona fide clients should be direct physical interaction partners. With these criteria in mind, we performed Western blottings of the candidate proteins at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after treatment. From these experiments, we confirmed (47Tillotson B. Slocum K. Coco J. Whitebread N. Thomas B. West K.A. MacDougall J. Ge J. Ali J.A. Palombella V.J. Normant E. Adams J. Fritz C.C. Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) inhibitor occupancy is a direct determinant of client protein degradation and tumor growth arrest in vivo.J. Biol.

Specifically, the levels of Raf-1 were significantly (>95%) decreased by 12 h after treatment with either 17-DMAG or AUY-922. In contrast, treatment with these inhibitors tended to have a less pronounced effect on cIAP-1 and XIAP levels. In contrast, treatment with either of the Hsp70 inhibitors JG-98 or PES caused a dramatic loss of cIAP-1 and XIAP at relatively early time points, although Raf-1 was largely spared (Fig. 1D). This effect was particularly strong in the first 6 h after treatment, when c-IAP1 and XIAP levels were reduced ˜75% and Raf-1 levels were only reduced ˜20%. Thus, XIAP and c-IAP1 seemed to be relatively selective clients of Hsp70 but not Hsp90. To better understand the mechanism of IAP loss in response to Hsp70 inhibitors, we first tested whether activation of caspase activity might be involved by blotting the JG-98-treated MDA-MB-231 cell lysates for cleaved caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Interestingly, cleaved caspase-3 and PARP only emerged 12–24 h after treatment (Fig. 1D), which is substantially after the levels of XIAP and c-IAP1 were reduced. This finding is consistent with a recent result, in which removal of the RING domain of XIAP was found to block turnover by JG-98 (59Srinivasan S.R. Cesa L.C. Li X. Julien O. Zhuang M. Shao H.

Thus, inhibition of Hsp70 seems to initiate the normal turnover of IAPs rather than triggering loss through caspase activation. We next wanted to determine whether Hsp70 physic"

EGFR endocytosed via the non-canonical pathway is largely recycled back to the plasma membrane as functional receptors, whereas p38-independent populations are mainly sorted for lysosomal degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2774210001,"Treatment failure in solid tumors occurs due to the survival of specific subpopulations of cells that possess tumor-initiating (TIC) phenotypes. Studies have implicated G protein-coupled-receptors (GPCRs) in cancer progression and the acquisition of TIC phenotypes. Many of the implicated GPCRs signal through the G protein GNA13. In this study, we demonstrate that GNA13 is upregulated in many solid tumors and impacts survival and metastases in patients. GNA13 levels modulate drug resistance and TIC-like phenotypes in patient-derived head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells in vitro and in vivo. Blockade of GNA13 expression, or of select downstream pathways, using small-molecule inhibitors abrogates GNA13-induced TIC phenotypes, rendering cells vulnerable to standard-of-care cytotoxic therapies. Taken together, these data indicate that GNA13 expression is a potential prognostic biomarker for tumor progression, and that interfering with GNA13-induced signaling provides a novel strategy to block TICs and drug resistance in HNSCCs."

Of these 27 (51%) were classified as likely pathogenic or pathogenic in the MYH7, MYL2, MYL3, NEXN, TNNC1, TNNI3, DES, LMNA, PKP2, PLN, RBM20, TTN, and CRYAB genes. Fifty-six percent (n = 24) of index-patients carried a likely pathogenic or pathogenic mutation. Of these 75% (n = 18) were familial and 25% (n = 6) sporadic cases. However, severe cardiomyopathy seemed to be not characterized by a specific mutation profile. Remarkably, we identified a novel homozygous PKP2-missense variant in a large consanguineous family with sudden death in early childhood and several members with heart transplantation in adolescent age."
https://openalex.org/W2777724025,"CD147 is an activation induced glycoprotein that promotes the secretion and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and is upregulated during the differentiation of macrophages. Interestingly, some of the molecular functions of CD147 rely on its glycosylation status: the highly glycosylated forms of CD147 induce MMPs whereas the lowly glycosylated forms inhibit MMP activation. Statins are hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors that block the synthesis of mevalonate, thereby inhibiting all mevalonate-dependent pathways, including isoprenylation, N-glycosylation and cholesterol synthesis. In this study, we investigated the role of statins in the inhibition of macrophage differentiation and the associated process of MMP secretion through modulation of CD147. We observed that differentiation of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 to a macrophage phenotype led to upregulation of CD147 and CD14 and that this effect was inhibited by statins. At the molecular level, statins altered CD147 expression, structure and function by inhibiting isoprenylation and N-glycosylation. In addition, statins induced a shift of CD147 from its highly glycosylated form to its lowly glycosylated form. This shift in N-glycosylation status was accompanied by a decrease in the production and functional activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9. In conclusion, these findings describe a novel molecular mechanism of immune regulation by statins, making them interesting candidates for autoimmune disease therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2780347547,"Biodiversity is a multifaceted concept, yet most biodiversity studies have taken a taxonomic approach, implying that all species are equally important. However, species do not contribute equally to ecosystem processes and differ markedly in their responses to changing environments. This recognition has led to the exploration of other components of biodiversity, notably the diversity of ecologically important traits. Recent studies taking into account both taxonomic and trait diversity have revealed that the two biodiversity components may exhibit pronounced temporal and spatial differences. These apparent incongruences indicate that the two components may respond differently to environmental drivers and that changes in one component might not affect the other. Such incongruences may provide insight into the structuring of communities through community assembly processes, and the resilience of ecosystems to change. Here we examine temporal and spatial patterns and drivers of multiple marine biodiversity indicators using the North Sea fish community as a case study. Based on long-term spatially resolved survey data on fish species occurrences and biomasses from 1983 to 2014 and an extensive trait dataset we: (i) investigate temporal and spatial incongruences between taxonomy and trait-based indicators of both richness and evenness; (ii) examine the underlying environmental drivers and, (iii) interpret the results in the context of assembly rules acting on community composition. Our study shows that taxonomy and trait-based biodiversity indicators differ in time and space and that these differences are correlated to natural and anthropogenic drivers, notably temperature, depth and substrate richness. Our findings show that trait-based biodiversity indicators add information regarding community composition and ecosystem structure compared to and in conjunction with taxonomy-based indicators. These results emphasize the importance of examining and monitoring multiple indicators of biodiversity in ecological studies as well as for conservation and ecosystem-based management purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2779245958,"Tomato late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary, also known as the Irish famine pathogen, is one of the most destructive plant diseases. Wild relatives of tomato possess useful resistance genes against this disease, and could therefore be used in breeding to improve cultivated varieties. In the genome of a wild relative of tomato, Solanum habrochaites accession LA1777, we identified a new quantitative trait locus for resistance against blight caused by an aggressive Egyptian isolate of P. infestans. Using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-Seq) technology, we determined 6,514 genome-wide SNP genotypes of an F2 population derived from an interspecific cross. Subsequent association analysis of genotypes and phenotypes of the mapping population revealed that a 6.8 Mb genome region on chromosome 6 was a candidate locus for disease resistance. Whole-genome resequencing analysis revealed that 298 genes in this region potentially had functional differences between the parental lines. Among of them, two genes with missense mutations, Solyc06g071810.1 and Solyc06g083640.3, were considered to be potential candidates for disease resistance. SNP and SSR markers linking to this region can be used in marker-assisted selection in future breeding programs for late blight disease, including introgression of new genetic loci from wild species. In addition, the approach developed in this study provides a model for identification of other genes for attractive agronomical traits."
https://openalex.org/W2779520800,"CyDisCo is a system facilitating disulfide bond formation in recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. Previously we screened for soluble expression of single chain antibody fragments (scFv) in the cytoplasm of E. coli in the presence and absence of CyDisCo, with >90% being solubly expressed. Two scFv, those derived from natalizumab and trastuzumab, were solubly produced in high amounts even in the absence of folding catalysts i.e. disulfide bond formation is not critical for their folding. Here we investigate the contribution of the framework and the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of scFv to the disulfide-independence of folding. We swapped CDRs between four scFv that have different properties, including two scFv that can efficiently fold independently from disulfide bonds and two more disulfide-dependent scFv. To confirm disulfide-independence we generated cysteine to alanine mutants of the disulfide-independent scFv. All of the scFv were tested for soluble expression in the cytoplasm of E. coli in the presence and absence of the oxidative folding catalysts Erv1p and PDI. Eight of the hybrid scFv were solubly produced in the presence of CyDisCo, while seven were solubly produced in the absence of CyDisCo, though the yields were often much lower when CyDisCo was absent. Soluble expression was also observed for scFv natalizumab and trastuzumab containing no cysteines. We compared yields, thermal stability and secondary structure of solubly produced scFv and undertook binding studies by western blotting, dot blotting or surface plasmon resonance of those produced in good yields. Our results indicate that both the CDRs and the framework contribute to the disulfide-dependence of soluble production of scFv, with the CDRs having the largest effect. In addition, there was no correlation between thermal stability and disulfide-dependence of folding and only a weak correlation between the yield of protein and the thermal stability of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2776358006,"Background The pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is largely unknown. Previous studies have given valuable information about genetic variants associated with this disease but much is still unexplained. Our goal was to identify genetic markers and genes associated with susceptibility to chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps using a family-based genome-wide association study. Methods 427 patients (293 males and 134 females) with CRSwNP and 393 controls (175 males and 218 females) were recruited from several Swedish hospitals. SNP association values were generated using DFAM (implemented in PLINK) and Efficient Mixed Model Association eXpedited (EMMAX). Analyses of pathway enrichment, gene expression levels and expression quantitative trait loci were then performed in turn. Results None of the analysed SNPs reached genome wide significant association of 5.0 x 10−8. Pathway analyses using our top 1000 markers with the most significant association p-values resulted in 138 target genes. A comparison between our target genes and gene expression data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database showed significant overlap for 36 of these genes. Comparisons with data from expression quantitative trait loci showed the most skewed allelic distributions in cases with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps compared with controls for the genes HLCS, HLA-DRA, BICD2, VSIR and SLC5A1. Conclusion Our study indicates that HLCS, HLA-DRA, BICD2, VSIR and SLC5A1 could be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. HLA-DRA has been associated with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in previous studies and HLCS, BICD2, VSIR and SLC5A1 may be new targets for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2781321665,"Purpose To investigate the effect of anterior chamber depth (ACD) on the refractive outcomes of the SRK/T, Holladay 1, Hoffer Q and Haigis formulae in short, normal, long and extremely long eyes. Methods This retrospective study involved patients who had uncomplicated cataract surgery. Preoperative axial length (AL) was divided into four subgroups: short (< 22.00 mm), normal (22.00–24.49 mm), long (24.50–25.99 mm), extremely long (≥ 26.00 mm). Preoperative ACD was divided into three subgroups: < 2.5, 2.50–3.49, and ≥ 3.5 mm. Median absolute errors (MedAEs) predicted by the SRK/T, Holladay 1, Hoffer Q and Haigis formulae were compared with the Friedman test. Post-hoc analysis involved the Wilcoxon signed rank test with a Bonferroni adjustment. Correlations between ACD and the predictive refractive errors of the four formulas were analyzed. Results In short eyes with an ACD < 2.5 mm, the Haigis formula revealed the highest MedAE. The difference in MedAE with the Hoffer Q formula (which had the lowest MedAE) was statistically significant (P = 0.002). In normal eyes, the Haigis formula significantly differed from the Holladay 1 (P = 0.002) and Hoffer Q (P = 0.005) formulae in the ACD < 2.5 mm group. In long eyes and extremely long eyes with an ACD ≥ 3.5 mm, the differences in MedAEs were statistically significant (P = 0.018, P = 0.001, respectively) and the Haigis formula had the lowest MedAEs in both subgroups (0.29 D, 0.30 D, respectively). In the total of 1,123 eyes, refractive errors predicted by the Haigis formula showed a significant negative correlation with the ACD (R2 = 0.002, P = 0.047). Conclusions The Hoffer Q formula is preferred over other formulae in short eyes with an ACD shallower than 2.5 mm. In short and normal eyes with an ACD < 2.5 mm the Haigis formula might underestimate ELP. The Haigis formula is the preferred choice in eyes with an AL ≥ 24.5 mm and an ACD ≥ 3.5 mm."
https://openalex.org/W2780675646,"Avocado is an important tropical fruit with high commercial value, but has a relatively short storage life. In this study, the effects of cold shock treatment (CST) on shelf life of naturally ripened and ethylene-ripened avocado fruits were investigated. Fruits were immersed in ice water for 30 min, then subjected to natural or ethylene-induced ripening. Fruit color; firmness; respiration rate; ethylene production; and the activities of polygalacturonase (PG), pectin methylesterase (PME), and endo-β-1,4-glucanase were measured. Immersion in ice water for 30 min effectively delayed ripening-associated processes, including peel discoloration, pulp softening, respiration rate, and ethylene production during shelf life. The delay in fruit softening by CST was associated with decreased PG and endo-β-1,4-glucanase activities, but not PME activity. This method could potentially be a useful postharvest technology to extend shelf life of avocado fruits."
https://openalex.org/W2777140576,"Lysine acetylation has emerged as a global protein regulation system in all domains of life. Sirtuins, or Sir2-like enzymes, are a family of histone deacetylases characterized by their employing NAD+ as a co-substrate. Sirtuins can deacetylate several acetylated proteins, but a consensus substrate recognition sequence has not yet been established. Product inhibition of many eukaryotic sirtuins by nicotinamide and its analogues has been studied in vitro due to their potential role as anticancer agents. In this work, the kinetics of CobB, the main Escherichia coli deacetylase, have been characterized. To our knowledge, this is the first kinetic characterization of a sirtuin employing a fully acetylated and natively folded protein as a substrate. CobB deacetylated several acetyl-CoA synthetase acetylated lysines with a single kinetic rate. In addition, in vitro nicotinamide inhibition of CobB has been characterized, and the intracellular nicotinamide concentrations have been determined under different growth conditions. The results suggest that nicotinamide can act as a CobB regulator in vivo. A nicotinamidase deletion strain was thus phenotypically characterized, and it behaved similarly to the ΔcobB strain. The results of this work demonstrate the potential regulatory role of the nicotinamide metabolite in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2776963100,"Extremophilic xylanases have attracted great scientific and industrial interest. In this study, a GH10 xylanase-encoding gene, Xyl10E, was cloned from Bispora sp. MEY-1 and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Deduced Xyl10E shares the highest identities of 62% and 57% with characterized family GH10 xylanases from Talaromyces leycettanus and Penicillium canescens (structure 4F8X), respectively. Xyl10E was most active at 93 to 95°C and pH 4.0, retained more than 75% or 48% of the initial activity when heated at 80°C or 90°C for 30 min, respectively, and hardly lost activity at pH 1.0 to 7.0, but was completely inhibited by SDS. Two residues, A160 and A161, located on loop 4, were identified to play roles in catalysis. Mutants A160D/E demonstrated higher affinity to substrate with lower Km values, while mutants A161D/E mainly displayed elevated Vmax values. All of these mutants had significantly improved catalytic efficiency. According to the molecular dynamics simulation, the mutation of A160E was able to affect the important substrate binding site Y204 and then improve the substrate affinity, and the mutation of A161D was capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the substrate to promote the substrate binding or accelerate the product release. This study introduces a highly thermophilic fungal xylanase and reveals the importance of loop 4 for catalytic efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2780791946,"Objectives Sleep-wake disturbances (SWD) are frequent in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on SWD is poorly known. In this study we examined the subjective and objective sleep-wake profile and the quality of life (QoL) of PD patients in the context of subthalamic DBS. Patients and methods We retrospectively analyzed data from PD patients and candidates for DBS in the nucleus suthalamicus (STN). Pre-DBS, sleep-wake assessments included subjective and objective (polysomnography, vigilance tests and actigraphy) measures. Post-DBS, subjective measures were collected. QoL was assessed using the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and the RAND SF-36-item Health Survey (RAND SF-36). Results Data from 74 PD patients (62% male, mean age 62.2 years, SD = 8.9) with a mean UPDRS-III (OFF) of 34.2 (SD = 14.8) and 11.8 (SD = 4.5) years under PD treatment were analyzed. Pre-DBS, daytime sleepiness, apathy, fatigue and depressive symptoms were present in 49%, 34%, 38% and 25% of patients respectively but not always as co-occurring symptoms. Sleep-wake disturbances were significantly correlated with QoL scores. One year after STN DBS, motor signs, QoL and sleepiness improved but apathy worsened. Changes in QoL were associated with changes in sleepiness and apathy but baseline sleep-wake functions were not predictive of STN DBS outcome. Conclusion In PD patients presenting for STN DBS, subjective and objective sleep-wake disturbances are common and have a negative impact on QoL before and after neurosurgery. Given the current preliminary evidence, prospective observational studies assessing subjective and objective sleep-wake variables prior to and after DBS are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2776705784,"Background Ultrafiltration decline is a progressive issue for patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) and can be caused by peritoneal angiogenesis induced by PD fluids. A recent pediatric trial suggests better preservation of ultrafiltration with bicarbonate versus lactate buffered fluid; underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Methods Angiogenic cytokine profile, tube formation capacity and Receptor Tyrosine Kinase translocation were assessed in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells following incubation with bicarbonate (BPDF) and lactate buffered (LPDF), pH neutral PD fluid with low glucose degradation product content and lactate buffered, acidic PD fluid with high glucose degradation product content (CPDF). Peritoneal biopsies from age-, PD-vintage- and dialytic glucose exposure matched, peritonitis-free children on chronic PD underwent automated histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry. Results In endothelial cells angiopoietin-1 mRNA and protein abundance increased 200% upon incubation with BPDF, but decreased by 70% with LPDF as compared to medium control; angiopoietin-2 remained unchanged. Angiopoietin-1/Angiopoietin-2 protein ratio was 15 and 3-fold increased with BPDF compared to LPDF and medium. Time-lapse microscopy with automated network analysis demonstrated less endothelial cell tube formation with BPDF compared to LPDF and CPDF incubation. Receptor Tyrosine Kinase translocated to the cell membrane in BPDF but not in LPDF or CPDF incubated endothelial cells. In children dialyzed with BPDF peritoneal vessels were larger and angiopoietin-1 abundance in CD31 positive endothelium higher compared to children treated with LPDF. Conclusion Bicarbonate buffered PD fluid promotes vessel maturation via upregulation of angiopoietin-1 in vitro and in children on dialysis. Our findings suggest a molecular mechanism for the observed superior preservation of ultrafiltration capacity with bicarbonate buffered PD fluid with low glucose degradation product content."
https://openalex.org/W2781271378,"Responsiveness entails the social actions by health providers to meet the legitimate expectations of patients. It plays a critical role in ensuring continuity and effectiveness of care within people centered health systems. Given the lack of contextualized research on responsiveness, we qualitatively explored the perceptions of outpatient users and providers regarding what constitute responsiveness in rural Bangladesh. An exploratory study was undertaken in Chuadanga, a southwestern Bangladeshi District, involving in-depth interviews of physicians (n = 17) and users (n = 7), focus group discussions with users (n = 4), and observations of patient provider interactions (three weeks). Analysis was guided by a conceptual framework of responsiveness, which includes friendliness, respecting, informing and guiding, gaining trust and optimizing benefits. In terms of friendliness, patients expected physicians to greet them before starting consultations; even though physicians considered this unusual. Patients also expected physicians to hold social talks during consultations, which was uncommon. With regards to respect patients expected physicians to refrain from disrespecting them in various ways; but also by showing respect explicitly. Patients also had expectations related to informing and guiding: they desired explanation on at least the diagnosis, seriousness of illness, treatment and preventive steps. In gaining trust, patients expected that physicians would refrain from illegal or unethical activities related to patients, e.g., demanding money against free services, bringing patients in own private clinics by brokers (dalals), colluding with diagnostic centers, accepting gifts from pharmaceutical representatives. In terms of optimizing benefits: patients expected that physicians should be financially sensitive and consider individual need of patients. There were multiple dimensions of responsiveness- for some, stakeholders had a consensus; context was an important factor to understand them. This being an exploratory study, further research is recommended to validate the nuances of the findings. It can be a guideline for responsiveness practices, and a tipping point for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2781354383,"This study aimed to evaluate the association between sodium intake and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Korean boys.A total of 1,738 boys aged 10-18 years were included in this study from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) during the years 2010-2013. Sodium intake was assessed using the urinary sodium excretion to urinary specific gravity ratio (U-Na to U-SG ratio).The median U-Na to U-SG ratio was 133.27 mmol/L (interquartile range: 95.66-178.50 mmol/L). Significant positive associations were found between the U-Na to U-SG ratio and the TG (P = 0.001 for trend) and TG concentrations, and these concentrations were significantly higher in boys with a U-Na to U-SG ratio in the highest quartile compared with those with a ratio in the lowest (P = 0.001) and second (P = 0.033) quartiles, as demonstrated through analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) after adjustment for possible confounders, including age, BMI standard deviation score, ferritin, vitamin D, house income, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, season, total intake, total energy intake, protein intake, fat intake, carbohydrate intake, and water intake. Significant inverse associations were found for the U-Na to U-SG ratio with the HDL-C (P = 0.033 for trend) and HDL-C levels, and these values were significantly lower in boys with a ratio in the highest quartile compared with those with a ratio in the second quartile (P = 0.020), as demonstrated through an ANCOVA. Although the trends did not reach statistical significance, a higher U-Na to U-SG ratio tended to be associated with higher SBP (P = 0.086 for trend), DBP (P = 0.063 for trend), and glucose levels (P = 0.099 for trend), as illustrated through ANCOVA. Boys with a ratio in the highest quartile exhibited a 1.73-fold increased risk for elevated TG (95% CI, 1.19-2.51) and a 2.66-fold increased risk for MetS (95% CI, 1.11-6.35) compared with those with a ratio in the lowest quartile, as demonstrated through multivariate logistic regression analyses after adjusting for confounders.Our results suggest that high sodium intake may be significantly independently associated with MetS in Korean boys aged 10-18 years."
https://openalex.org/W2778335785,"The ryanodine receptor ion channel RyR1 is present in skeletal muscle and has a large cytoplasmic N-terminal domain and smaller C-terminal pore-forming domain comprising six transmembrane helices, a pore helix, and a selectivity filter. The RyR1 S6 pore-lining helix has two conserved glycines, Gly-4934 and Gly-4941, that facilitate RyR1 channel gating by providing S6 flexibility and minimizing amino acid clashes. Here, we report that substitution of Gly-4941 with Asp or Lys results in functional channels as indicated by caffeine-induced Ca2+ release response in HEK293 cells, whereas a low response of the corresponding Gly-4934 variants suggested loss of function. Following purification, the RyR1 mutants G4934D, G4934K, and G4941D did not noticeably conduct Ca2+ in single-channel measurements. Gly-4941 replacement with Lys resulted in channels having reduced K+ conductance and reduced selectivity for Ca2+ compared with wildtype. RyR1-G4941K did not fully close at nanomolar cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations and nearly fully opened at 2 μm cytosolic or sarcoplasmic reticulum luminal Ca2+, and Ca2+- and voltage-dependent regulation of RyR1-G4941K mutant channels was demonstrated. Computational methods and single-channel recordings indicated that the open G4941K variant results in the formation of a salt bridge to Asp-4938. In contrast, wildtype RyR1 was closed and not activated by luminal Ca2+ at low cytosolic Ca2+ levels. A model suggested that luminal Ca2+ activates RyR1 by accessing a recently identified cytosolic Ca2+-binding site in the open channel as the Ca2+ ions pass through the pore."
https://openalex.org/W2779307554,"Soluble forms of oligomeric beta-amyloid (Aβ) are thought to play a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Transgenic manipulation of methylation of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase, PP2A, was recently shown to alter the sensitivity of mice to AD-related impairments resulting from acute exposure to elevated levels of Aβ. In addition, eicosanoyl-5-hydroxytryptamide (EHT), a naturally occurring component from coffee beans that modulates PP2A methylation, was shown to confer therapeutic benefits in rodent models of AD and Parkinson's disease. Here, we tested the hypothesis that EHT protects animals from the pathological effects of exposure to elevated levels of soluble oligomeric Aβ. We treated mice with EHT-containing food at two different doses and assessed the sensitivity of these animals to Aβ-induced behavioral and electrophysiological impairments. We found that EHT administration protected animals from Aβ-induced cognitive impairments in both a radial-arm water maze and contextual fear conditioning task. We also found that both chronic and acute EHT administration prevented Aβ-induced impairments in long-term potentiation. These data add to the accumulating evidence suggesting that interventions with pharmacological agents, such as EHT, that target PP2A activity may be therapeutically beneficial for AD and other neurological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2781209113,"Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) TAV protein (TransActivator/Viroplasmin) plays a pivotal role during the infection cycle since it activates translation reinitiation of viral polycistronic RNAs and suppresses RNA silencing. It is also the major component of cytoplasmic electron-dense inclusion bodies (EDIBs) called viroplasms that are particularly evident in cells infected by the virulent CaMV Cabb B-JI isolate. These EDIBs are considered as virion factories, vehicles for CaMV intracellular movement and reservoirs for CaMV transmission by aphids. In this study, focused on different TAV mutants in vivo, we demonstrate that three physically separated domains collectively participate to the formation of large EDIBs: the N-terminal EKI motif, a sequence of the MAV domain involved in translation reinitiation and a C-terminal region encompassing the zinc finger. Surprisingly, EKI mutant TAVm3, corresponding to a substitution of the EKI motif at amino acids 11–13 by three alanines (AAA), which completely abolished the formation of large viroplasms, was not lethal for CaMV but highly reduced its virulence without affecting the rate of systemic infection. Expression of TAVm3 in a viral context led to formation of small irregularly shaped inclusion bodies, mild symptoms and low levels of viral DNA and particles accumulation, despite the production of significant amounts of mature capsid proteins. Unexpectedly, for CaMV-TAVm3 the formation of viral P2-containing electron-light inclusion body (ELIB), which is essential for CaMV aphid transmission, was also altered, thus suggesting an indirect role of the EKI tripeptide in CaMV plant-to-plant propagation. This important functional contribution of the EKI motif in CaMV biology can explain the strict conservation of this motif in the TAV sequences of all CaMV isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2779743786,"Shiga toxin-producing (Stx) Escherichia coli (STEC) O113:H21 strains are associated with human diarrhea and some of these strains may cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The molecular mechanism underlying this capacity and the differential host cell response to HUS-causing strains are not yet completely understood. In Brazil O113:H21 strains are commonly found in cattle but, so far, were not isolated from HUS patients. Here we conducted comparative gene co-expression network (GCN) analyses of two O113:H21 STEC strains: EH41, reference strain, isolated from HUS patient in Australia, and Ec472/01, isolated from cattle feces in Brazil. These strains were cultured in fresh or in Caco-2 cell conditioned media. GCN analyses were also accomplished for cultured Caco-2 cells exposed to EH41 or Ec472/01. Differential transcriptome profiles for EH41 and Ec472/01 were not significantly changed by exposure to fresh or Caco-2 conditioned media. Conversely, global gene expression comparison of both strains cultured in conditioned medium revealed a gene set exclusively expressed in EH41, which includes the dicA putative virulence factor regulator. Network analysis showed that this set of genes constitutes an EH41 specific transcriptional module. PCR analysis in Ec472/01 and in other 10 Brazilian cattle-isolated STEC strains revealed absence of dicA in all these strains. The GCNs of Caco-2 cells exposed to EH41 or to Ec472/01 presented a major transcriptional module containing many hubs related to inflammatory response that was not found in the GCN of control cells. Moreover, EH41 seems to cause gene network dysregulation in Caco-2 as evidenced by the large number of genes with high positive and negative covariance interactions. EH41 grows slowly than Ec472/01 when cultured in Caco-2 conditioned medium and fitness-related genes are hypoexpressed in that strain. Therefore, EH41 virulence may be derived from its capacity for dysregulating enterocyte genome functioning and its enhanced enteric survival due to slow growth."

In the present study we analyze whether the geographical distance, the host species or the host secondary metabolites determine the genetic structure of this parasite. To address the question, populations mainly from the Southern Europe, Southern Finland and the Azores were sampled. The specimens were collected from 20 different host species representing ten chemotypes. Three loci, ITS rDNA, LSU rDNA and mtSSU, were sequenced. The genetic structure was assessed by AMOVA, redundance analyses and Bayesian clustering methods. The results indicated that the host species and the host secondary metabolites are the most influential factors over the genetic structure of this lichenicolous fungus. In addition, the genetic structure of H. bachmannii was compared with that of one of its hosts, Cladonia rangiformis. The population structure of parasite and host were discordant. The contents in phenolic compounds and fatty acids of C. rangiformis were quantified in order to test whether it had some influence on the genetic structure of the species. But no correlation was found with the genetic clusters of H. bachmannii."

https://openalex.org/W2779038362,"Introduction Adolescents are a population with unique lifestyle challenges, including physical inactivity, inadequate nutrition, and obesity, all of which increase the risk of developing hypertension (HTN). The objective of this study has been to estimate the prevalence of factors associated with hypertension in adolescents in the city of Goiânia City, Central Brazil. Methods Between 2013and2014, a cross-sectional population study on cardiovascular risk in adolescents, was conducted with the participation of 1,586 adolescents in 108 classes at 36 schools (public and private) in Goiânia city. All of the adolescents were interviewed to establish their sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics related to hypertension and nutritional status. Anthropometric and blood pressure data were collected following a protocol. A Poisson regression, stratified by gender, was used to verify the factors associated with HTN. Results In this mixed-gender group of 1,586 students, the prevalence of HTN was 6.2% (95% CI: 4.6–8.2%) in girls and 14.0% (95% CI: 10.2–18.8%) in boys—about twice as high in boys as in girls (p <0.001). Obesity was independently associated with HTN in both genders. Being overweight was a risk factor for HTN. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the SBP/SBP percentile and the BMI Z-score/Nutritional status (NS)in both genders. A high prevalence of physical inactivity was also observed in the adolescents investigated, especially in the girls. On the other hand, more boys than girls were found to be obese. Conclusion The results of this investigation revealed the need for strategies to prevent and control HTN and its risk factors, especially in Brazil's schools. In addition to the constant surveillance of HTN prevalence and risk factors (in particular, being overweight or obese), information should be distributed to promote beneficial health behaviors among adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2779656045,"Critical transitions of complex systems can often be predicted by so-called early-warning signals (EWS). In some cases, however, such signals cannot be detected although a critical transition is imminent. Observing a relation of EWS-detectability and the network topology in which the system is implemented, we simulate and investigate scale-free networks and identify which networks show, and which do not show EWS in the framework of a two state system that exhibits critical transitions. Additionally, we adapt our approach by examining the effective state of the system, rather than its natural state, and conclude that this transformation can reveal hidden EWS in networks where those signals are otherwise obscured by a complex topology."
https://openalex.org/W2777908333,"The GABACR antagonist TPMPA and the mGluR1 antagonist JNJ16259685 have been shown previously to alter the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat and P23H rat (animal model of retinitis pigmentosa) to brief flashes of light. In order to better understand the effects of these antagonists on the visual responses of SD and P23H rat RGCs, I examined the responses of RGCs to a drifting sinusoidal grating of various contrasts. Multielectrode array recordings were made from RGCs to a drifting sinusoidal grating of a spatial frequency of 1 cycle/mm and a temporal frequency of 2 cycles/s. In both SD and P23H rat retinas, contrast response functions were found to have a variable shape across cells. Some cells showed saturation of responses at high contrast levels while others did not. Whereas 49% of SD rat RGCs exhibited response saturation, only 14% of P23H rat RGCs showed response saturation. TPMPA decreased the responses of saturating SD rat RGCs to low (6% to 13%) grating contrasts but increased the response to the highest contrast (83%) tested. JNJ16259685 did not significantly affect the contrast response functions of either saturating or non-saturating SD rat RGCs. In contrast, both TPMPA and JNJ16259685 increased the responses of saturating and non-saturating P23H rat RGCs to all grating contrasts. Neither TPMPA nor JNJ16259685 affected the contrast thresholds of SD rat RGCs, but both antagonists lowered the contrast thresholds of P23H rat RGCs. Overall, the findings show that GABACR and mGluR1 antagonists have differential effects on the contrast response functions of SD and P23H rat RGCs. Notably, these receptor antagonists increase the responsiveness of P23H rat RGCs to both low and high contrast visual stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2778169779,"Aims Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia type-1 (HHT1) is a genetic vascular disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of the TGFβ co-receptor endoglin. Dysfunctional homing of HHT1 mononuclear cells (MNCs) towards the infarcted myocardium hampers cardiac recovery. HHT1-MNCs have elevated expression of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4/CD26), which inhibits recruitment of CXCR4-expressing MNCs by inactivation of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1). We hypothesize that inhibiting DPP4 will restore homing of HHT1-MNCs to the infarcted heart and improve cardiac recovery. Methods and results After inducing myocardial infarction (MI), wild type (WT) and endoglin heterozygous (Eng+/-) mice were treated for 5 days with the DPP4 inhibitor Diprotin A (DipA). DipA increased the number of CXCR4+ MNCs residing in the infarcted Eng+/- hearts (Eng+/- 73.17±12.67 vs. Eng+/- treated 157.00±11.61, P = 0.0003) and significantly reduced infarct size (Eng+/- 46.60±9.33% vs. Eng+/- treated 27.02±3.04%, P = 0.03). Echocardiography demonstrated that DipA treatment slightly deteriorated heart function in Eng+/- mice. An increased number of capillaries (Eng+/- 61.63±1.43 vs. Eng+/- treated 74.30±1.74, P = 0.001) were detected in the infarct border zone whereas the number of arteries was reduced (Eng+/- 11.88±0.63 vs. Eng+/- treated 6.38±0.97, P = 0.003). Interestingly, while less M2 regenerative macrophages were present in Eng+/- hearts prior to DipA treatment, (WT 29.88±1.52% vs. Eng+/- 12.34±1.64%, P<0.0001), DPP4 inhibition restored the number of M2 macrophages to wild type levels. Conclusions In this study, we demonstrate that systemic DPP4 inhibition restores the impaired MNC homing in Eng+/- animals post-MI, and enhances cardiac repair, which might be explained by restoring the balance between the inflammatory and regenerative macrophages present in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2778193714,"This study examined gender-specific factors associated with the use of mental health services (MHS) for suicidal ideation (SI). We included data on 6,768 males and 12,475 females who had experienced SI over the past year from the nationwide 2013 Korean Community Health Survey. These individuals were grouped as MHS users for SI if they had received professional counseling at medical institutions, professional counseling agencies, or community health centers for SI-related problems. Their information on sociodemographic factors, socio-familial relationships, health behaviors, and health status were included as exposures in a logistic regression analysis. Of the 19,243 individuals, 7.0% of the males and 10.5% of the females used MHS for SI treatment. For males with SI, living in an urban area, being a widower, and having unhealthy behaviors (frequent alcohol consumption and infrequent walking) were associated with underuse of MHS. For females with SI, frequent contact with friends, low level of religious activity, and good self-rated health were associated with underuse of MHS. For both males and females, those who were younger, completed higher education, and experienced depression/suicide attempts in the past year were more likely to use MHS for SI. These findings suggest that gender-specific factors should be used to inform suicide prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2775981162,"Intervention Few studies have documented the interruption of onchocerciasis and Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) by integrated chemotherapy in Uganda. The study describes the interruption of transmission of the two diseases co-endemic in Obongi focus, north western Uganda. Base line data for Onchocerciasis and LF were collected in 1994 and 2006, respectively. Annual mass drug administration for onchocerciasis (Ivermectin) and Lymphatic Filariasis (Ivermectin + albendazole) was conducted for 20 and 6 years, respectively. Thereafter, assessments by skin snip, larval searches in rivers and human landing catches were performed. Children <10 years were screened for IgG4 antibodies using Ov16 ELISA technique in 2013. LF Pre-TAS and TAS1 were conducted in sentinel sites. ITN coverage and utilization for the implementation unit was also reported. Intervention coverage Onchocerciasis treatment coverage was <80% but improved with the introduction of CDTI in 1999. While for LF, effective coverage of >65% was achieved in the six treatment rounds. Household ownership of ITN’s and utilization was 96% and 72.4%., respectively. Impact Parasitological examinations conducted for onchocerciasis among 807 adults and children, revealed a reduction in mf prevalence from 58% in 1994 to 0% in 2012. Entomological monitoring conducted at the two sites had no single Simulium damnosum fly caught. Serological analysis using Ov16 ELISA for onchocerciasis revealed that out of the 3,308 children <10 years old screened in 2013, only 3/3308 (0.091%) positive cases were detected. All Ov16 positive children were negative when tested for patent infection by skin snip PCR. A reduction in LF microfilaria prevalence from 2.5% (n = 13/522) in 2006 to 0.0% (n = 602) in 2014 was observed. LF TAS1 conducted in 2015 among 1,532 children 6–7 years, all were negative for antigens of W. bancrofti. Conclusion The results concluded that interruption of onchocerciasis and LF has been achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2780160897,This paper proposes the correction of faulty sensors using a synthesis of the greedy sparse constrained optimization GSCO) technique. The failure of sensors can damage the radiation power pattern in terms of sidelobes and nulls. The synthesis problem can recover the wanted power pattern with reduced number of sensors into the background of greedy algorithm and solved with orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) technique. Numerical simulation examples of linear arrays are offered to demonstrate the effectiveness of getting the wanted power pattern with a reduced number of antenna sensors which is compared with the available techniques in terms of sidelobes level and number of nulls.
https://openalex.org/W2780438235,"High-throughput sequencing technology has helped microbial community ecologists explore ecological and evolutionary patterns at unprecedented scales. The benefits of a large sample size still typically outweigh that of greater sequencing depths per sample for accurate estimations of ecological inferences. However, excluding or not sequencing rare taxa may mislead the answers to the questions 'how and why are communities different?' This study evaluates the confidence intervals of ecological inferences from high-throughput sequencing data of foliar fungal endophytes as case studies through a range of sampling efforts, sequencing depths, and taxonomic resolutions to understand how technical and analytical practices may affect our interpretations. Increasing sampling size reliably decreased confidence intervals across multiple community comparisons. However, the effects of sequencing depths on confidence intervals depended on how rare taxa influenced the dissimilarity estimates among communities and did not significantly decrease confidence intervals for all community comparisons. A comparison of simulated communities under random drift suggests that sequencing depths are important in estimating dissimilarities between microbial communities under neutral selective processes. Confidence interval analyses reveal important biases as well as biological trends in microbial community studies that otherwise may be ignored when communities are only compared for statistically significant differences."
https://openalex.org/W2963892812,"Thomson, D. J. & Devenish, B. J. [J. Fluid Mech. 526, 277 (2005)] and others have suggested that sweeping effects make Lagrangian properties in Kinematic Simulations (KS), Fung et al [Fung J. C. H., Hunt J. C. R., Malik N. A. & Perkins R. J. J. Fluid Mech. 236, 281 (1992)], unreliable. However, such a conclusion can only be drawn under the assumption of locality. The major aim here is to quantify the sweeping errors in KS without assuming locality. Through a novel analysis based upon analysing pairs of particle trajectories in a frame of reference moving with the large energy containing scales of motion it is shown that the normalized integrated error in the turbulent pair diffusivity (K) due to the sweeping effect decreases with increasing pair separation (σl), such that as σl/η → ∞; and as σl/η → 0. η is the Kolmogorov turbulence microscale. There is an intermediate range of separations 1 < σl/η < ∞ in which the error remains negligible. Simulations using KS shows that in the swept frame of reference, this intermediate range is large covering almost the entire inertial subrange simulated, 1 < σl/η < 105, implying that the deviation from locality observed in KS cannot be atributed to sweeping errors. This is important for pair diffusion theory and modeling. PACS numbers: 47.27.E?, 47.27.Gs, 47.27.jv, 47.27.Ak, 47.27.tb, 47.27.eb, 47.11.-j."
https://openalex.org/W2529202677,"In the context of the global obesity epidemic, it is important to know who becomes obese and why. However, the processes that determine the changing shape of Body Mass Index (BMI) distributions in high-income societies are not well-understood. Here we establish the statistical mechanics of human weight change, providing a fundamental new understanding of human weight distributions. By compiling and analysing the largest data set so far of year-over-year BMI changes, we find, strikingly, that heavy people on average strongly decrease their weight year-over-year, and light people increase their weight. This drift towards the centre of the BMI distribution is balanced by diffusion resulting from random fluctuations in diet and physical activity that are, notably, proportional in size to BMI. We formulate a stochastic mathematical model for BMI dynamics, deriving a theoretical shape for the BMI distribution and offering a mechanism to explain the ongoing right-skewed broadening of BMI distributions over time. The model also provides new quantitative support for the hypothesis that peer-to-peer social influence plays a measurable role in BMI dynamics. More broadly, our results demonstrate a remarkable analogy with drift-diffusion mechanisms that are well-known from the physical sciences and finance."
https://openalex.org/W2780880601,"Familial episodic ataxia of lambs is a congenital transient autosomal dominant disorder of newborn lambs, with varying expressivity. Affected lambs show episodes of an asymmetric ataxic gait, base-wide extensor hypertonia of the thoracic limbs and flexor hypertonia of the pelvic limbs. The aim of the study was to determine the genetic variant causing familial episodic ataxia in lambs. Using whole genome sequencing of two half-sib affected lambs, their sire, and their two normal dams, a heterozygous C>T transition at OAR10:77593415 (Oar_v3.1) in exon 1 of the fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) gene (c.46C>T) was identified. The c.46C>T transition resulted in a premature stop codon at position 16 of the 247 amino acid FGF14 protein (p.Q16*). PCR and Sanger sequencing was used to genotype an additional 20 clinically affected animals, demonstrating all lambs carried the c.46C>T variant but 1 clinically more severely affected inbred lamb was homozygous (TT). A further 11 unrelated normal ewes were positionally sequenced, none of which had the variant, while in 18 lambs of unknown status born over 2 years of breeding trials six lambs were found to have the c.46C>T variant, likely clinically unidentified heterozygotes due to the variable expressivity, while 12 did not. In conclusion, familial episodic ataxia of lambs is potentially associated with a c.46C>T variant in the FGF14 gene. Further research is required into the mechanism behind the apparent recovery of lambs."
https://openalex.org/W2776070184,"Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive foodborne pathogen and the causative agent of listeriosis. L. monocytogenes lapB gene encodes a cell wall surface anchor protein, and mutation of this gene causes Listeria attenuation in mice. In this work, the potential role of Listeria LapB protein in catfish fillet attachment was investigated. To achieve this, boron-based small molecules designed to interfere with the active site of the L. monocytogenes LapB protein were developed, and their ability to prevent L. monocytogenes attachment to fish fillet was tested. Results indicated that seven out of nine different small molecules were effective in reducing the Listeria attachment to catfish fillets. Of these, three small molecules (SM3, SM5, and SM7) were highly effective in blocking Listeria attachment to catfish fillets. This study suggests an alternative strategy for reduction of L. monocytogenes contamination in fresh and frozen fish products."

We aimed to analyze the prevalence of forced sexual intercourse (FSI) among people receiving HIV Voluntary Counseling and Testing in a hospital in Kinshasa, and its association with socio-demographics, behaviors and HIV status.Case-control study (2010-2012). Two-hundred and seventy-four cases with a new HIV+ test and 1,340 controls with an HIV- test were interviewed about HIV-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, including FSI.Thirty-four percent of the participants declared having had FSI (38% of women and 32% of men). Being a woman, aged 25-49 and reporting multiple sexual partners were associated with reporting FSI. For men, being single was protective against FSI; and cohabiting, having a high socioeconomic status, and alcohol consumption increased the odds. For women, being single, divorced/separated and widow was associated with reporting FSI. A significant positive association was found between FSI and an HIV positive test.Among our Congolese population, FSI was strongly associated with HIV infection and it was also associated with alcohol consumption and multiple sexual partnerships, other key HIV determinants. These behaviors need to be identified as potential risk factors of FSI during counseling interventions. Researchers, practitioners and decision-makers should work together to get violence prevention integrated into health, social and educational policies."
https://openalex.org/W2781064648,"Burkholderia spp. are genetically and physiologically diverse. Some strains are naturally transformable and capable of DNA catabolism. Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp) strains 1026b and K96243 and B. thailandensis strain E264 are able to utilize DNA as a sole carbon source for growth, while only strains 1026b and E264 are naturally transformable. In this study, we constructed low-copy broad-host-range fosmid library, containing Bp strain 1026b chromosomal DNA fragments, and employed a novel positive selection approach to identify genes responsible for DNA uptake and DNA catabolism. The library was transferred to non-competent Bp K96243 and B. cenocepacia (Bc) K56-2, harboring chromosomally-inserted FRT-flanked sacB and pheS counter-selection markers. The library was incubated with DNA encoding Flp recombinase, followed by counter-selection on sucrose and chlorinated phenylalanine, to select for clones that took up flp-DNA, transiently expressed Flp, and excised the sacB-pheS cassette. Putative clones that survived the counter-selection were subsequently incubated with gfp-DNA and bacteria were visualized via fluorescent microscopy to confirm natural competency. Fosmid sequencing identified several 1026b genes implicated in DNA uptake, which were validated using chromosomal mutants. One of the naturally competent clones selected in Bc K56-2 enabled Bc, Bp and B. mallei to utilize DNA as a sole carbon source, and all fosmids were used to successfully create mutations in non-naturally-competent B. mallei and Bp strains."
https://openalex.org/W2776926488,"Drawing on the theory of social action in organizational and institutional sociology, this paper examines the behavioral consequences of plural logics of action. It addresses the question based on the empirical case of plural medical systems that are composed of both biomedicine and alternative medicine. Applying mixed methods of a cross-national panel data analysis and a content analysis of medical journal articles, it finds that plural systems affect health outcomes negatively when tensions between biomedicine and alternative medicine are unaddressed. In contrast, plural systems produce tangible health benefits when biomedicine and alternative medicine are coordinated through government policies or by health care organizations/professionals. This paper proposes plurality coordination as an important mechanism that modifies the behavioral consequences of plural logics. This proposition contributes to providing theoretical answers to the sociological puzzle that plural logics of action produce inconsistent behavioral consequences."
