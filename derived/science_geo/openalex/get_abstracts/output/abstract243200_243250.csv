https://openalex.org/W2069608343,"Most Staphylococcus aureus strains produce the orange carotenoid staphyloxanthin. The staphyloxanthin biosynthesis genes are organized in an operon, crtOPQMN, with a sigma(B)-dependent promoter upstream of crtO and a termination region downstream of crtN. The functions of the five encoded enzymes were predicted on the basis of their sequence similarity to known enzymes and by product analysis of gene deletion mutants. The first step in staphyloxanthin biosynthesis is the head-to-head condensation of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate to form dehydrosqualene (4,4'-diapophytoene), catalyzed by the dehydrosqualene synthase CrtM. The dehydrosqualene desaturase CrtN dehydrogenates dehydrosqualene to form the yellow, main intermediate 4,4'-diaponeurosporene. CrtP, very likely a mixed function oxidase, oxidizes the terminal methyl group of 4,4'-diaponeurosporene to form 4,4'-diaponeurosporenic acid. CrtQ, a glycosyltransferase, esterifies glucose at the C(1)'' position with the carboxyl group of 4,4'-diaponeurosporenic acid to yield glycosyl 4,4'-diaponeurosporenoate; this compound was the major product in the clone expressing crtPQMN. In the final step, the acyltransferase CrtO esterifies glucose at the C(6)'' position with the carboxyl group of 12-methyltetradecanoic acid to yield staphyloxanthin. Staphyloxanthin overexpressed in Staphylococcus carnosus (pTX-crtOPQMN) and purified was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy. Staphyloxanthin was identified as beta-D-glucopyranosyl 1-O-(4,4'-diaponeurosporen-4-oate)-6-O-(12-methyltetradecanoate)."

Here we use information collected from five raptor species that differ widely in their diet and habitat associations to show that sites occupied by these predators are consistently associated with high biodiversity. The biodiversity at these sites is more extensive than it is at sites selected at random, or at sites occupied by species from lower down the trophic pyramid (insectivorous or herbivorous species, for example). Our results indicate that conservation focusing on top predators can be ecologically justified because it delivers broader biodiversity benefits."

https://openalex.org/W2074085543,"Considerable genetic and pathological evidence has implicated the small, soluble protein α-synuclein in the pathogenesis of familial and sporadic forms of Parkinsons disease (PD). However, the precise role of α-synuclein in the disease process as well as its normal function remain poorly understood. We recently found that an interaction with lipid rafts is crucial for the normal, pre-synaptic localization of α-synuclein. To understand how α-synuclein interacts with lipid rafts, we have now developed an in vitro binding assay to rafts purified from native membranes. Recapitulating the specificity observed in vivo, recombinant wild type but not PD-associated A30P mutant α-synuclein binds to lipid rafts isolated from cultured cells and purified synaptic vesicles. Proteolytic digestion of the rafts does not disrupt the binding of α-synuclein, indicating an interaction with lipid rather than protein components of these membranes. We have also found that α-synuclein binds directly to artificial membranes whose lipid composition mimics that of lipid rafts. The binding of α-synuclein to these raft-like liposomes requires acidic phospholipids, with a preference for phosphatidylserine (PS). Interestingly, a variety of synthetic PS with defined acyl chains do not support binding when used individually. Rather, the interaction with α-synuclein requires a combination of PS with oleic (18:1) and polyunsaturated (either 20:4 or 22:6) fatty acyl chains, suggesting a role for phase separation within the membrane. Furthermore, α-synuclein binds with higher affinity to artificial membranes with the PS head group on the polyunsaturated fatty acyl chain rather than on the oleoyl side chain, indicating a stringent combinatorial code for the interaction of α-synuclein with membranes.

Although mutations in α-synuclein do not contribute to idiopathic PD, the brains of most patients contain abundant α-synuclein in the form of Lewy bodies and dystrophic neurites (5Spillantini M.G.

However, the mechanism by which α-synuclein contributes to neural degeneration remains poorly understood. Originally identified as a synaptic vesicle-associated protein, α-synuclein has been implicated in synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitter release, and more specifically, synaptic vesicle recycling (8Maroteaux L.

Despite its specific localization to the nerve terminal, α-synuclein does not co-fractionate with native membranes in brain extracts, but behaves as a soluble protein (13Ueda K. Fukushima H.

The molecular determinants that localize α-synuclein to the synapse thus remain unknown. However, α-synuclein can associate with native membranes such as axonal transport vesicles, lipid droplets produced in HeLa cells by the administration of oleic acid, and the membranes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (17Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 18Cole N.B. Murphy D.D. Grider T. Rueter S.

Science. 2003; 302: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Importantly, the A30P mutation associated with familial PD disrupts these interactions. In vitro, α-synuclein binds directly to artificial membranes containing acidic phospholipids in a manner that is not sensitive to the A30P mutation (20Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 21Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15313-15318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The relationship of these observations to the pre-synaptic localization of α-synuclein has remained unclear. Recently, we found that α-synuclein associates specifically with membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts (24Fortin D.L. Troyer M.D. Nakamura K. Kubo S. Anthony M.D. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6715-6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are enriched in cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and phospholipids with saturated long chain fatty acids as well as particular proteins. Biochemically, they are defined by their insolubility in cold Triton X-100 and their low buoyant density (25Edidin M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein expressed in cultured cells and in brain co-fractionates with detergent-resistant membranes, consistent with its raft association. Pharmacologic disruption of lipid rafts eliminates the synaptic enrichment of α-synuclein. The A30P mutation associated with familial PD also disrupts the raft association of α-synuclein, and redistributes the protein from synapses into the axon (24Fortin D.L. Troyer M.D. Nakamura K. Kubo S. Anthony M.D. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6715-6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Binding to lipid rafts thus contributes to the normal function of α-synuclein by localizing the protein to the nerve terminal, and may also influence its role in the pathogenesis of PD. To define the interaction of α-synuclein with lipid rafts, we have developed an in vitro assay for binding to membranes prepared from native tissue. Using this assay, recombinant wild type α-synuclein binds saturably and with high affinity to lipid rafts isolated from HeLa cells and rat brain, and the A30P mutation disrupts the interaction. The assay thus faithfully recapitulates the specificity of raft association observed in cells (24Fortin D.L. Troyer M.D. Nakamura K. Kubo S. Anthony M.D. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6715-6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Proteolytic digestion of the raft fraction does not reduce raft association in vitro, indicating a direct interaction of α-synuclein with the membrane. Confirming a direct lipid interaction, α-synuclein binds to artificial membranes mimicking the composition of lipid rafts (25Edidin M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports (20Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 26Jo E. McLaurin J. Yip C.M. St. George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9927-9934Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the interaction of α-synuclein with raft-like liposomes requires phospholipids with an acidic head group, with a strong preference for phosphatidylserine (PS). In contrast to previous studies, however, our assay reveals specific requirements for the acyl chain composition of PS. A variety of synthetic PS with single defined acyl chains do not support binding of α-synuclein. Rather, binding requires a combination of PS with oleic (18:1) and polyunsaturated (20:4 and 22:6) fatty acyl chains, suggesting that a phase transition contributes to the association with lipid rafts. Furthermore, α-synuclein binds preferentially to membranes with PS on the polyunsaturated acyl chain, indicating the coordinate recognition of head group in the context of a specific side chain. Materials—Antibodies to human α-synuclein (15G7), rat α-synuclein (Syn1), VGLUT1, GST, and CD55 were obtained from, respectively, Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA), BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA), Chemicon (Temecula, CA), Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy3 and Alexa 647-conjugated Annexin V were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA) and Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), respectively. Cholesterol, brain sphingomyelin (SM), brain PS, egg phosphatidic acid, brain phosphatidylcholine (PC), brain phosphatidylethanolamine, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (18:0 PS), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (18:1 PS), 1,2-diarachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (20:4 PS), and 1,2-didocosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (22:6 PS) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Molecular Biology and Cell Culture—The construction of α-synuclein cDNAs and purification of bacterial fusion proteins has been described previously (24Fortin D.L. Troyer M.D. Nakamura K. Kubo S. Anthony M.D. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6715-6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% cosmic calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Dissociated hippocampal cultures containing glia were prepared from embryonic (E18.5) rats and maintained in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for 2–3 weeks (28Higgins D. Banker G.A. Banker G.A. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. 2nd. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 37-78Google Scholar). Preparation of Synaptic Vesicles from Rat Brain—Synaptic vesicles were prepared as previously described (29Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 30Hell J.W. Jahn R. Celis J.E. Cell Biology, A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 567-574Google Scholar). Briefly, the cortices of 200-g male Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized in 0.32 m sucrose, 4 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, containing phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) (HB). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1,350 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and crude synaptosomes were sedimented at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The synaptosomal pellet was washed in HB, sedimented at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting pellet lysed by hypo-osmotic shock in ice-cold water containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysed synaptosomes were adjusted to 9.3 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and synaptic plasma membrane removed by centrifugation at 33,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was further sedimented at 260,000 × g for 2 h to pellet synaptic vesicles, which were resuspended in 25 mm MES, 80 mm NaCl (binding buffer, BB) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above. Isolation of Detergent-resistant Membranes (DRMs)—DRMs were isolated from HeLa cells and synaptic vesicles as previously described (24Fortin D.L. Troyer M.D. Nakamura K. Kubo S. Anthony M.D. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6715-6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 31Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells (1 × 107) or synaptic vesicles (200 μg of protein) were resuspended in 1 ml of BB containing 1% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 30 min with Dounce homogenization every 10 min. The resulting extract was adjusted to 42.5% sucrose, overlaid with 5 ml each of 35 and 5% sucrose in BB, and sedimented at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 275,000 × g for 18 h. Lipid rafts (250 μl) were collected at the interface between 5 and 35% sucrose, and stored at 4 °C until use. Proteinase K (PK) Digestion—100 μl of isolated DRMs were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and incubated with 10 μl of PK-agarose (Sigma) at 30 °C with rotation for the times indicated. The reaction was terminated by sedimentation of the PK-agarose. PK-treated rafts were subjected to electrophoresis through Criterion Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) followed by staining with the GelCode SilverSNAP Stain Kit (Pierce). Preparation of Liposomes—Lipids of interest were mixed in chloroform, and the solvent evaporated under nitrogen. The resulting lipid film was dried under vacuum for 20 min and re-hydrated at a concentration of 2.5 mm in BB followed by vortexing. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by five 1-min sonication and freeze/thawing cycles, stored in the dark at 4 °C under nitrogen, and used within 1 week of production. In Vitro Binding Assay—Recombinant α-synuclein, fused at its N terminus to the 41-residue calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP), was combined with 100 μl of DRMs or 5 μl of liposomes in BB containing 1% bovine serum albumin as nonspecific competitor, and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Sucrose was then added to a final concentration of 42.5%, the mixture was overlaid with 2 ml of 35% and 2 ml of 5% sucrose in BB, and sedimented at 4 °C in a Beckman SW55 rotor at 275,000 × g for 18 h. Ten 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and either used immediately or stored at -80 °C until use, with no differences observed between unfrozen and frozen material (data not shown). Equal volumes of each fraction were separated by electrophoresis as above, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, immunostained with appropriate antibodies, and detected using West Pico SuperSignal (Pierce). For quantitative Western blotting, protein bands were quantified using the ChemiImager System (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Every experiment was performed independently at least twice. Unless indicated otherwise, all experiments involved the CBP fusion to α-synuclein. Purification of Bound α-Synuclein for Mass Spectrometry—Binding was performed as above using a final concentration of 1 mm liposomes and 8 μm α-synuclein. Membrane-associated α-synuclein was collected from the 5/35% sucrose interface, solubilized in 20 mm CHAPS, the micelles were removed by centrifugation through a 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff Amicon Ultra filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the buffer exchanged to 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. For further purification, concentrated α-synuclein was separated by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Fractions containing α-synuclein were identified by Western blotting and dried under vacuum centrifugation. Each sample was then digested overnight with 100 ng of trypsin (sequencing grade modified, Promega, Madison, WI) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using a nano-LC system (Eksigent, Livermore, CA) to separate samples for on-line analysis using a QSTAR mass spectrometer (Sciex, Concord, Ontario, Canada). The resulting data were analyzed using a combination of manual analysis and automated analysis with the locally developed Protein Prospector suite of proteomic tools (www.prospector.ucsf.edu). Immunofluorescence—Hippocampal neurons were grown for 15–20 days in vitro, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and immunostained for α-synuclein and VGLUT1. When indicated, Alexa 647-conjugated Annexin V was added in 2.5 mm CaCl2 during the last 15 min of incubation with secondary antibodies. Fluorescent images were acquired on a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) LSM 510 confocal microscope. Annexin V was pre-adsorbed by incubation with liposomes overnight at 4 °C, the bound material was removed by sedimentation at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant used for immunofluorescence. To allow direct comparison of Annexin V staining, images were collected using fixed laser strength, pinhole size, and detector gain. α-Synuclein Binds to Purified Lipid Rafts—To understand how α-synuclein interacts with lipid rafts, we have developed an in vitro binding assay using recombinant α-synuclein and DRMs prepared from HeLa cells by flotation gradient (24Fortin D.L.

The DRMs were incubated with recombinant α-synuclein for 30 min at 30 °C, and bound protein was separated by flotation through a second density gradient. Initially, we observed binding of both wild type and A30P α-synuclein to purified DRMs (data not shown), very similar to the results of other in vitro binding studies (20Davidson W.S. Jonas A.

Supporting the possibility that A30P α-synuclein might interact nonspecifically with rafts under these conditions, we have observed substantial adsorption of α-synuclein to a variety of surfaces including plastic as well as membranes (data not shown). However, the high protein concentrations present in the cytoplasm of cells presumably reduce these nonspecific interactions in vivo. To test this possibility, we added BSA to the in vitro binding assay. Under these conditions, a substantial proportion of wild type α-synuclein (15% at 250 nm and ∼25% at 500 nm) co-migrates in light fractions with CD55, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of lipid rafts, indicating association with DRMs (Fig. 1). In contrast, A30P-α-synuclein does not bind to DRMs in the presence of BSA, even at the highest concentration of recombinant protein used in this study (Fig. 1). The association of wild type α-synuclein with DRMs is dose-dependent, with binding detectable in the mid-nanomolar range. We also found that varying the salt (NaCl or KCl), salt concentration (from 50 to 110 mm), or pH (from 6.5 to 8) has no detectable effect on the binding of α-synuclein to DRMs (data not shown). Because α-synuclein depends on lipid rafts for its specific localization to the nerve terminal, we examined binding to DRMs prepared from synaptic vesicles, and observed similar high affinity binding and sensitivity to the A30P mutation (data not shown). Because the recombinant protein used for these studies contains a 41-residue CBP fused to the N terminus of α-synuclein, we also removed the CBP tag by proteolytic cleavage with enterokinase (leaving no additional amino acids), and observed the same high affinity, specific binding to DRMs from HeLa cells and synaptic vesicles (data not shown). α-Synuclein bound to DRMs in vitro migrates more slowly by gel electrophoresis than soluble α-synuclein at the bottom of the flotation gradient (Fig. 1), indicating the acquisition in vitro of a raft-associated modification very similar to that observed in vivo (24Fortin D.L. Troyer M.D. Nakamura K. Kubo S. Anthony M.D. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6715-6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The in vitro binding assay therefore recapitulates many features observed for the interaction of α-synuclein with rafts in cells. We used a competition assay to characterize further the association of α-synuclein with rafts. In particular, we assessed the ability of CBP-α-synuclein to compete with GST-α-synuclein for binding to DRMs. Fig. 2A shows that increasing amounts of wild type CBP-α-synuclein inhibit binding of 100 nm wild type GST-α-synuclein, indicating that the interaction with membranes is saturable. Quantification of multiple experiments reveals that concentrations of CBP-α-synuclein, ∼0.5 μm, essentially eliminate binding of GST-α-synuclein (Fig. 2B), indicating an affinity that is at least in the mid-nanomolar range. Importantly, 2 μm A30P-CBP-α-synuclein fails to eliminate binding of wild type GST-α-synuclein (Fig. 2), confirming that this PD-associated mutant binds to DRMs with lower affinity than wild type (24Fortin D.L. Troyer M.D. Nakamura K. Kubo S. Anthony M.D. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6715-6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Requirement for the Lipid Component of DRMs—To determine whether α-synuclein interacts with the protein or lipid component of rafts, we treated DRMs isolated from HeLa cells with proteinase K (PK) immobilized on agarose beads. After digestion for 5–60 min, PK-agarose was removed by sedimentation before adding recombinant α-synuclein. Strikingly, proteolytic digestion with PK did not reduce the interaction of α-synuclein with DRMs (Fig. 3A). However, a substantial proportion of CD55 remains intact even after prolonged incubation in proteinase K (Fig. 3A), raising questions about the extent of digestion. Resistance to proteolysis could simply reflect the presence of CD55 on the lumenal face of isolated DRMs, inaccessible to PK. Lumenal proteins presumably do not participate in the interaction with recombinant α-synuclein. We further confirmed that digestion in PK for 60 min largely eliminates DRM protein as detected by silver staining (Fig. 3B). In similar experiments using DRMs isolated from synaptic vesicles, treatment with PK also fails to inhibit binding of α-synuclein (data not shown). Remarkably, the α-synuclein bound to PK-digested DRMs still shows retarded electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 3A), indicating that this modification is unlikely to require proteins such as the raft-enriched kinases known to phosphorylate α-synuclein (32Pronin A.N.

Specifically, we used the “canonical” raft mixture composed of cholesterol, brain sphingomyelin (SM), and brain phospholipid (1:1:1 molar ratio), which mimics the enrichment of cholesterol and SM observed in native rafts (25Edidin M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein binds to these liposomes and exhibits the same gel mobility shift observed when α-synuclein associates with native lipid rafts (Fig.4A). Consistent with the results obtained from PK-digested DRMs, lipids alone thus support the binding of α-synuclein. We varied the composition of the artificial membranes to identify the components of lipid rafts recognized by α-synuclein. Removal of cholesterol or SM (with r"

https://openalex.org/W2145585333,"The effect of thyroid hormones on metabolism has long supported their potential as drugs to stimulate fat reduction, but the concomitant induction of a thyrotoxic state has greatly limited their use. Recent evidence suggests that 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine (T2), a naturally occurring iodothyronine, stimulates metabolic rate via mechanisms involving the mitochondrial apparatus. We examined whether this effect would result in reduced energy storage. Here, we show that T2 administration to rats receiving a high-fat diet (HFD) reduces both adiposity and body weight gain without inducing thyrotoxicity. Rats receiving HFD + T2 showed (when compared with rats receiving HFD alone) a 13% lower body weight, a 42% higher liver fatty acid oxidation rate, appoximately 50% less fat mass, a complete disappearance of fat from the liver, and significant reductions in the serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels (-52% and -18%, respectively). Thyroid hormones and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) serum levels were not influenced by T2 administration. The biochemical mechanism underlying the effects of T2 on liver metabolism involves the carnitine palmitoyl-transferase system and mitochondrial uncoupling. If the results hold true for humans, pharmacological administration of T2 might serve to counteract the problems associated with overweight, such as accumulation of lipids in liver and serum, without inducing thyrotoxicity. However, the results reported here do not exclude deleterious effects of T2 on a longer time scale as well as do not show that T2 acts in the same way in humans."

https://openalex.org/W2160233674,"To examine the ontogeny of the wound fibroblast, bone marrow transplantation was performed to wild-type recipients from transgenic donors that express both the luciferase and beta-galactosidase reporter genes under transcriptional control of the promoter/enhancer for the alpha2 chain of type I collagen. Polyvinyl alcohol sponges were implanted to elicit a naïve granulation tissue response, removed at defined time points, and processed for nucleic acids and histochemistry. Quantitative PCR for the luciferase transgene demonstrated that donor-derived cells were present during inflammation, declined, and rebounded during later stages of tissue remodeling. Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR revealed that bone marrow-derived collagen transcripts contributed significantly to the total collagen I alpha2 promoter activation during later stages of repair. beta-galactosidase staining revealed that indeed those cells which expressed the transgene exhibited a fibroblastic phenotype, co-localized with sites of active collagen deposition, and expressed fibroblast specific protein-1. These data strongly support the concept that the adult bone marrow compartment houses progenitors with the potential to migrate to sites of tissue damage, and participate in repair beyond inflammation as fibroblasts. Moreover, that bone marrow-derived fibroblasts make a substantial contribution to the formation of new connective tissue, including type I collagen, during wound repair."

https://openalex.org/W2078097984,"Galaxy formation is thought to involve the cooling of gas in dark-matter haloes collapsing under the influence of gravity and the expansion of the Universe. Cosmologists have a problem with this model though: it produces too many bright galaxies. Unless, that is, young galaxies eject large amounts of gas in the form of high-speed outflows. A new technique, integral field spectroscopy has now been used to gather the best evidence yet that such processes actually occur. High-velocity galactic outflows, driven by intense bursts of star formation and black hole accretion, are processes invoked by current theories of galaxy formation1 to terminate star formation in the most massive galaxies and to deposit heavy elements in the intergalactic medium. From existing observational evidence2,3 (for high-redshift galaxies) it is unclear whether such outflows are localized to regions of intense star formation just a few kiloparsecs in extent, or whether they instead have a significant impact on the entire galaxy and its surroundings. Here we present two-dimensional spectroscopy of a star-forming galaxy4 at redshift z = 3.09 (seen 11.5 gigayears ago, when the Universe was 20 per cent of its current age): its spatially extended Lyα line emission appears to be absorbed by H i in a foreground screen covering the entire galaxy, with a lateral extent of at least 100 kpc and remarkable velocity coherence. This screen was ejected from the galaxy during a starburst several 108 years earlier and has subsequently swept up gas from the surrounding intergalactic medium and cooled. This demonstrates the galaxy-wide impact of high-redshift superwinds."

In addition, it has been documented that PS1 positively regulates, whereas PS1 familial Alzheimer disease mutations suppress, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation, a pathway known to inactivate glycogen synthase kinase-3 and reduce tau phosphorylation. In this study, we show that the loss of presenilins not only inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling and increases tau phosphorylation but also suppresses the MEK/ERK pathway. The deficits in Akt and ERK activation in cells deficient in both PS1 and PS2 (PS–/–) are evident after serum withdrawal and stimulation with fetal bovine serum or ligands of select receptor tyrosine kinases, platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) and PDGFRα, but not insulin-like growth factor-1R and epidermal growth factor receptor. The defects in PDGF signaling in PS–/– cells are due to reduced expression of PDGF receptors. Whereas fetal bovine serum-induced Akt activation is reconstituted by both PS1 and PS2 in PS–/– cells, PDGF signaling is selectively restored by PS2 but not PS1 and is dependent on the N-terminal fragment of PS2 but not γ-secretase activity or the hydrophilic loop of PS2. The rescue of PDGF receptor expression and activation by PS2 is facilitated by FHL2, a PS2-interacting transcriptional co-activator.

The presenilins are polytopic proteins with 6–8 transmembrane domains that are found in high molecular weight complexes together with nicastrin, pen-2, and aph-1. These four proteins are required for the regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP or γ-secretase activity) of various substrates, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch (3Periz G. Fortini M.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Accordingly, null mice for any one of these components display embryonic lethality associated with severe malformations of the axial skeleton and cerebral hemorrhage, resembling that of Notch deficiency (3Periz G. Fortini M.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As expected, this activity is conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, where the presenilin complex functions to facilitate Notch signaling (4Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 5Ye Y. Lukinova N. Fortini M.E.

Although the amyloid hypothesis is the leading model for AD pathogenesis, a number of concerns with this hypothesis have led many to suggest that non-amyloid-related cellular perturbations of presenilin mutations contribute to the disease phenotype. This is especially plausible in light of the recent observations that three separate PS1 mutations are associated with frontotemporal dementia, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tauopathy and without Aβ/amyloid pathology (6Dermaut B. Kumar-Singh S. Engelborghs S. Theuns J. Rademakers R. Saerens J. Pickut B.A. Peeters K. Van den B.M. Vennekens K. Claes S. Cruts M. Cras P. Martin J.J. Van Broeckhoven C. De Deyn P.P. Ann.

For example, conditional ablation of both PS1 and PS2, but not either gene alone, in adult brain resulted in prominent hyperphosphorylation of tau that was associated with neuronal degeneration and severe learning and memory deficits (9Feng R.

In sum, these observations strongly suggest that presenilin dysfunctions can contribute to tau pathology and neurodegeneration independent of its effects on Aβ/amyloid pathology.The manner in which presenilins could directly contribute to tauopathy and neurodegeneration is unknown. However, presenilins are multifunctional proteins. In addition to their roles in Aβ production and Notch proteolysis, presenilins have been shown to mediate other physiological activities in vitro and in vivo. First, a role for presenilins in the trafficking and maturation of select membrane proteins and/or intracellular vesicles has been shown, although the mechanisms of this activity are unclear (11Cai D.

Second, the turnover of other membrane proteins, such as α-synuclein and telencephalin, is delayed by PS1 deficiency, and the molecules accumulate in large vacuolar structures resembling autophagosomes (12Esselens C. Oorschot V. Baert V. Raemaekers T. Spittaels K. Serneels L. Zheng H. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Klumperman J. Annaert W. J.

Third, we previously demonstrated that presenilin negatively regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway through facilitating the paired phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin by acting as a scaffold upon which a priming kinase, GSK-3, and β-catenin are assembled (15Kang D.E.

In a different modality, several studies reported that PS1 and PS1 FAD mutations can also differentially modulate GSK-3 activity via PI3K/Akt signaling, a pathway that leads to GSK-3 inactivation and reduced tau phosphorylation (17Baki L.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5360-5369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the mechanistic framework by which presenilins could modulate the phosphorylation of tau via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Specifically, we tested the well established model in which the PI3K/Akt pathway is typically activated by extracellular signaling ligands (20Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). In this model, we hypothesized that select upstream cell surface signaling receptors are affected by presenilin activity rather than downstream signaling components.The RTK family of cell surface receptors activates not only PI3K/Akt but also the MEK/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. This broad family includes the Trk neurotrophin receptors, fibroblast growth factor receptors, IGF-1 receptor, EGF receptor, and PDGF receptors, which are well known for their neurotrophic and/or neuroprotective properties (20Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar, 21Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Upon binding to their respective ligands, RTKs undergo dimerization and autophosphorylation of their cytoplasmic tails at multiple tyrosine residues. This leads to the recruitment and activation of a number of signaling molecules, including PI3K and Grb2/Sos. In one arm of RTK signaling, PI3K activates Akt, which then inactivates the tau kinase GSK-3, but also influences a number of important cellular pathways, including pro- and antiapoptotic pathways such as BAD, caspase 9, the FOXO family of transcription factors, and NF-κB. In another arm of RTK signaling, Grb3/Sos activates Ras/Raf-1, which then activates the MEK/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Among many downstream events, ERK is known to mediate molecular processes important for learning and memory, in particular in the activation of CREB (22Sweatt J.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the loss of presenilins results in elevated tau phosphorylation and defects in not only PI3K/Akt signaling but also MEK/ERK activation via select cell surface signaling receptors. We further detail the role of both PS1 and PS2 in Akt/ERK signaling induced by serum components and known ligands that activate their corresponding receptors.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and Reagents—The monoclonal antibody PSN2 (against residues 31–56 of human PS1) and polyclonal APP antibody CT15 (against C-terminal 15 residues of APP) have previously been described (23Zhang J.

PS+/+ and PS–/– (genetically deficient in PS1 and PS2) have been described previously (16Kang D.E. Soriano S. Xia X. Eberhart C.G. De Strooper B. Zheng H. Koo E.H.

To introduce PS1, PS2, or PS2MV into PS–/– cells, corresponding retroviral supernatants from 293GP cells were added in the presence of 10 μg/ml polybrene and selected with 3 μg/ml puromycin. Resistant cells were pooled and maintained in the presence of 3 μg/ml puromycin without clonal selection. To transfect PS2 D366A, PS2Δloop, PS1, PS1 E280G, PS1 M146L, PS1ΔX9, PS1N-PS2C, or Tau383, corresponding retroviral supernatants were added to PS–/–, PS–/– (hPS2), or PS+/+ cells in the presence of 10 μg/ml polybrene and selected with 100 μg/ml bleocin. Resistant cells were pooled and maintained in the presence of appropriate antibiotic(s). siRNA targeted for exon 3 of mouse FHL2 (sense, 5′-GGAUCGGCACUGGCAUGAAtt-3′) was purchased from Ambion (catalog number 16708). For RNA interference experiments, 25% confluent PS+/+ cells were transfected with a final concentration of 60 nm FHL2 siRNA twice using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) over a 56-h period.Cell Lysis and Signaling Assays—Cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% CHAPS, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.002% sodium azide, 400 nm Microcystin-LR, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, and 1× protease complete inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). For FHL2 detection, cells were gently lysed in 1% Triton X-100 buffer (identical to CHAPS buffer with the exception of detergent) on ice for 10 min without scraping cells off of culture dishes. Triton X-100-insoluble materials (mostly nuclei) still remaining on culture plates were then solubilized with radioimmune precipitation buffer (containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and sonicated to shear genomic DNA. For signaling assays, overnight confluent cultures were serum-starved in DMEM for 4 h, and ligands (PDGF-AA (25 ng/ml), PDGF-BB (25 ng/ml), EGF (25 ng/ml), and IGF-1 (50 nm)) were added for the indicated times, or 20% FBS was added for 2 h. Protein quantitations from cell lysates were performed by the micro-BCA method (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein were then subjected to either direct immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies or immunoprecipitated with PDGFRβ antibody and immunoblotted with phosphotyrosine antibody. All experiments were performed at least three times, and representative experiments and/or quantitations are shown.Reverse Transcriptase PCR Analysis—PS+/+, PS–/–, PS–/– (hPS1), and PS–/– (hPS2) cells were grown to confluence, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit from Qiagen. Two micrograms of total RNA were subjected to reverse transcriptase (RT) first strand synthesis using the Superscript kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of the RT product were then used for PCR of PDGFRα or PDGFRβ within a linear range of amplification, empirically determined to be between 16 and 22 cycles. Quantitations were performed using a digital camera-based imaging system. All experiments were performed at least three times, and results were normalized to PS+/+ cells.Cell Surface 125I-PDGF-BB Binding Assays—Overnight confluent cultures of PS+/+, PS–/–, PS–/– (hPS1), and PS–/– (hPS2) were placed on ice and washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. 125I-PDGF (0.625 nm) in 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline was added to cells in the presence or absence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled PDGF-BB for 30 min. Unbound material was washed five times with 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline on ice, cells were lysed in 0.2 n NaOH, and bound radioactivity was then quantitated by scintillation counting. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the values from internal controls subjected to a 100-fold excess of unlabeled PDGF-BB. Experiments were conducted three times, and results normalized to PS+/+ cells are shown (means + S.E.).RESULTSLoss of Presenilins Impairs PI3K/Akt and ERK Signaling, Elevates GSK-3 Activity, and Increases Tau Phosphorylation—We previously demonstrated that presenilin plays an important role in promoting the degradation of β-catenin, a key signaling intermediate in the Wnt signaling pathway, by acting as a scaffold upon which GSK-3, β-catenin, and a priming kinase are brought together to facilitate the stepwise phosphorylation of β-catenin (16Kang D.E. Soriano S. Xia X. Eberhart C.G. De Strooper B. Zheng H. Koo E.H. Cell. 2002; 110: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A primary mechanism of modulating GSK-3 activity is through its phosphorylation by the PI3K/Akt pathway, resulting in GSK-3 inactivation (26Pearl L.H. Barford D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the phosphorylation status of GSK-3, indicative of general nonprimed GSK-3 activity, in PS–/– (lacking both PS1 and PS2) and PS+/+ control fibroblasts. Under basal cell culture conditions with 10% FBS, the phosphorylation of both GSK-3α (upper band) and GSK-3β (lower band), representing the inactive kinase, was substantially reduced in PS–/– fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). Because GSK-3 is a major tau kinase, we next expressed human four-repeat tau in PS+/+ and PS–/– fibroblasts to assess whether tau phosphorylation is differentially affected by this alteration in GSK phosphorylation. Indeed, phosphorylated tau on residues 202 and 396/404 (PHF1), two GSK-3 sites, was substantially elevated in PS–/– cells under basal conditions (Fig. 1A), consistent with recent observations in PS1-deficient cells and in forebrains of mice lacking both PS1 and PS2 (9Feng R. Wang H. Wang J. Shrom D. Zeng X. Tsien J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Saura C.A. Choi S.Y. Beglopoulos V. Malkani S. Zhang D.

Since GSK-3 can be inactivated by PI3K/Akt-mediated phosphorylation (26Pearl L.H. Barford D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we assessed the phosphorylation status of Akt in PS+/+ and PS–/– cells. As expected, the active phosphorylated species of Akt (P-Akt) was substantially reduced in presenilin-deficient cells (Fig. 1B) under basal conditions, consistent with the reduced phosphorylation of GSK-3 species. Further, because PI3K/Akt activation is principally generated by cell surface RTKs that also signal through the MEK/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, we next examined whether the activation of ERK is affected by the loss of presenilins. Indeed, the active phosphorylated ERK1 and -2 (P-ERK1/2) species were also substantially reduced in PS–/– cells under basal conditions (Fig. 1B), indicating that the perturbations in ERK and Akt phosphorylation may both be regulated by upstream RTK activity.Severe Impairment in Akt and ERK Activation via Select Receptor Tyrosine Kinases in Presenilin-deficient Cells and Effects on Tau Phosphorylation—The novel observation that both Akt and ERK signaling pathways were impaired by presenilin deficiency led us to hypothesize that select cell surface receptors themselves rather than downstream signaling factors are primarily affected by presenilins. Thus, as a first step, we examined the signaling events activated by several prototypic growth factors (PDGF-BB, PDGF-AA, IGF-1, and EGF). The addition of IGF-1 or EGF to serum-starved PS+/+ or PS–/– cells for varying time intervals demonstrated robust Akt and ERK phosphorylation in both genotypes, which did not markedly differ from each other (supplemental Fig. 1A). In contrast, PDGF-BB (25 ng/ml) or PDGF-AA (25 ng/ml) induced activation of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation after serum deprivation was severely reduced in PS–/– cells (Fig. 1C, supplemental Fig. 1B). In the same experiments, activation of Akt by PDGF had no effect on the GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin (P-33/37/41) in either PS+/+ or PS–/– cells (Fig. 1C), indicating that GSK-3 activity on β-catenin through priming and scaffolding mechanisms is independent of Akt-mediated control of GSK-3 activity. In dose-response experiments, we found that the response to PDGF-BB was saturated at 25 ng/ml and did not increase further at 50 ng/ml in both PS+/+ and PS–/– cells, although the magnitude of the response was much weaker in PS–/– at all concentrations tested (supplemental Fig. 1C). This suggested abnormalities in receptor activity and/or expression in PS–/– cells. Indeed, the level of PDGFRβ protein, especially the mature glycosylated product, was reduced by ∼3-fold in PS–/– cells (Fig. 2A). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis also consistently showed that both PDGFRβ and PDGFRα mRNAs were reduced by more than 2-fold in PS–/– cells (Fig. 2, B and C), closely mirroring the protein levels. Moreover, the number of specific 125I-PDGF-BB binding sites on the cell surface of PS–/– cells was similarly reduced by >2-fold (Fig. 2D). Finally, there was also a strong decrease in PDGF-induced activation and autophosphorylation of PDGFRβ in PS–/– cells (Fig. 2A), the magnitude of which closely reflected the level of Akt and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Upon ligand exposure and autophosphorylation, PDGFR is normally rapidly internalized and degraded in lysosomes (27Mori S. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 577-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In serum-starved PS+/+ cells, PDGF reliably induced the rapid loss of PDGFR (supplemental Fig. 2A). In contrast, ligand-induced degradation of PDGFR was completely absent in PS–/– cells up to 1 h, consistent with the considerable reduction in PDGFR activation and autophosphorylation from the cell surface (supplemental Fig. 2A).Fig. 2A, reduced PDGFRβ protein and PDGF-BB induced tyrosine autophosphorylation by the loss of presenilins. In the first panel, confluent cultures of PS+/+ and PS–/– cells serum-starved for 4 h in DMEM were treated with PDGF-BB (25 ng/ml) for 5 min, and equal protein amounts were immunoprecipitated for PDGFRβ and immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine (P-Y). In the second panel, equal protein amounts from confluent cultures of PS+/+ and PS–/– cells were directly immunoblotted for PDGFRβ without serum starvation or PDGF-BB treatment. B and C, presenilin deficiency lowers PDGFRα and PDGFRβ mRNA levels. Total RNA was isolated from over-night confluent cultures of PS+/+ and PS–/– cells, and equal amounts of RNA were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR within a linear range of amplification. Experiments were conducted three times, and graphs show means and S.E. values normalized to PS+/+ cells. D, reduced PDGF-BB cell surface binding in PS–/– cells. 125I-PDGF-BB (0.625 nm) binding to the cell surface of confluent PS+/+ and PS–/– cells was quantitated by scintillation counting. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the values from samples subjected to a 100-fold excess of unlabeled PDGF-BB. Experiments were conducted three times, and graphs show means and S.E. values normalized to PS+/+ cells and protein concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since GSK-3 inactivation was markedly reduced upon PDGF signaling in presenilin-deficient cells, we reexamined PS+/+ and PS–/– cells stably transfected with four-repeat tau for potential PDGF-induced changes in tau phosphorylation. Treatment of PDGF-BB suppressed the phosphorylation of tau in serum-deprived PS+/+ but not PS–/– cells, as evidenced by two well characterized antibodies, the dephospho-tau antibody Tau-1 (dephospho-202/205, lower band) and phospho-tau antibody PHF1 (phospho-396/404) (Fig. 3). The magnitude of reduction in PHF1 and increase in Tau-1 immunoreactivity upon PDGF treatment in PS+/+ cells was ∼40 and ∼250%, respectively. This reduction in tau phosphorylation was blocked by the specific PI3K inhibitor wortmannin but not the mitogen-activated protein kinase/MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 3), indica"
https://openalex.org/W1997180743,"Hyaluronan is a multifunctional glycosaminoglycan up to 107 Da molecular mass produced by the integral membrane glycosyltransferase, hyaluronan synthase (HAS).

A distinct enrichment of plasma membrane HAS was found in cell protrusions. The total turnover time of HAS3 was 4-5 h as judged by the green fluorescent protein signal decay and hyaluronan synthesis inhibition in cycloheximide-treated cells.

Constructs of HAS3 with 16- and 45-amino-acid C-terminal deletions mostly stayed within the ER, whereas a D216A missense mutant was localized within the Golgi complex but not the plasma membrane. Both types of mutations were almost or completely inactive, similar to the wild type enzyme that had its entry to the plasma membrane experimentally blocked by brefeldin A. Inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis by UDP-glucuronic acid starvation using 4-methyl-umbelliferone also prevented HAS access to the plasma membrane. The results demonstrate that 1) a latent pool of HAS exists within the ER-Golgi pathway; 2) this pool can be rapidly mobilized and activated by insertion into the plasma membrane; and 3) inhibition of HAS activity through mutation or substrate starvation results in exclusion of HAS from the plasma membrane.

Hyaluronan is a high molecular mass, unbranched acidic glycosaminoglycan found in the extracellular matrix of many vertebrate tissues. This glycosaminoglycan contributes to differentiation, development, and repair functions of several cell types and tissues, and its absence results in lethality during embryogenesis due to multiple developmental defects including the failure of endocardial cushion formation (1Camenisch T.D. Spicer A.P. Brehm-Gibson T. Biesterfeldt J. Augustine M.L. Calabro Jr., A. Kubalak S. Klewer S.E. McDonald J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan synthases (HASs) 1The abbreviations used are: HAS, hyaluronan synthase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; REK, rat epidermal keratinocyte; HABC, hyaluronan binding complex; bHABC, biotinylated HABC; ELSA, enzyme-linked sorbent assay; TR, Texas red; 4-MU, 4-methylumbelliferone. are unique enzymes that synthesize hyaluronan from UDP-activated N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid and coordinately translocate the growing chain through the plasma membrane (2Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Three different isoenzymes exist in mammals (3Spicer A.P.

Rec. 2002; 268: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Certain pathogenic strains of Streptococci and Pasteurella bacteria also possess hyaluronan synthases with some sequence homology to the vertebrate enzymes but utilize different enzymatic mechanisms. The vertebrate and Pasteurella enzymes add the alternating hexose moieties to the non-reducing end of the chain, whereas the streptococcal enzyme elongates hyaluronan from the reducing end (5Tlapak-Simmons V.L.

The enzyme from Pasteurella appears to have separate domains for the transfer of the two precursors, whereas the transfer functions of the streptococcal and vertebrate enzymes appear more integrated. At least one vertebrate hyaluronan synthase (HAS1) can, however, also synthesize short homo-oligomers of N-acetylglucosamine (chitin) in vitro (7Semino C.E. Specht C.A. Raimondi A. Robbins P.W. Proc.

The relative enzymatic rates and the ultimate hyaluronan size may also differ between the isoenzymes (9Brinck J. Heldin P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 10Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S.

Dev. 2000; 90: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan synthases are integral membrane proteins with an active site located in the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (2Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In this respect, hyaluronan differs from other complex carbohydrates, the synthesis of which begins in the endoplasmic reticulum and is completed in the Golgi apparatus. Hyaluronan synthases do not have a typical signal sequence at their N terminus, suggesting that they may not be processed via the usual secretory pathway through the Golgi complex. Also, HAS enzymes have not been found to undergo any post-translational modifications that often take place in the Golgi. Furthermore, brefeldin A, which blocks the Golgiplasma membrane traffic, had no effect on hyaluronan secretion in chondrocytes even after a prolonged incubation (12Wong-Palms S. Plaas A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13Calabro A. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22764-22770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting either that the HASs have a long half-life or that they are not processed through the Golgi pathway. However, it was recently shown that green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Xenopus Has1 became co-translationally inserted into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traveled through the Golgi on its way to the plasma membrane (14Müllegger J. Rustom A. Kreil G. Gerdes H.H. Lepperdinger G. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the route to the plasma membrane, no data are currently available to indicate that any HAS synthesizes hyaluronan before reaching the cell surface. The low expression level of HASs in normal keratinocytes, and in many other cell types, has impeded microscopic studies of their localization and interactions with other molecules. Development of antibodies suitable for specific immunocytochemical detection of the relatively scarce HAS proteins has not succeeded so far. Therefore, expression of enzymatically active HASs as GFP-tagged fusion proteins provides an opportunity to 1) localize the enzymes directly in living cells, 2) follow their movements subcellularly, 3) examine possible regulatory points in their ability to synthesize hyaluronan, and 4) detect the influence of elevated hyaluronan synthesis rate on important cellular functions, such as those described previously in keratinocytes (15Pienimäki J.P. Rilla K. Fülöp C. Sironen R.K. Karvinen S. Pasonen S. Lammi M.J. Tammi R. Hascall V.C. Tammi M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20428-20435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the present study, we performed high resolution confocal microscopy on epidermal keratinocytes expressing GFP-labeled mouse HAS polypeptides. Colocalization experiments showed strong labeling in the Golgi and trans-Golgi network, in addition to the plasma membrane and endocytic vesicles. Experimental inhibition of vesicular traffic through the Golgi to the plasma membrane reduced the residence of GFP-HAS on the plasma membrane and inhibited hyaluronan synthesis, suggesting that HAS trafficking proceeds through this organelle. Furthermore, an enzymatically inactive, missense mutant and C-terminally truncated GFP-HAS3 fusion proteins were not detected on the plasma membrane. Likewise, depletion of the UDP-hexose precursor pools prevented the localization of intact HAS on the plasma membrane. It thus seems that ongoing hyaluronan synthesis is required for HAS residence on the plasma membrane. Keratinocyte Cultures—A newborn rat epidermal keratinocyte cell line (REK) (16Baden H.P. Kubilus J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1983; 80: 124-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was cultured in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 4 mm glutamine (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and 50 units/ml penicillin (Sigma). Keratinocytes were passaged twice a week at a 1:10 split ratio using 0.05% trypsin (w/v) and 0.02% EDTA (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline (Reagena Ltd., Kuopio, Finland). In some experiments, the synthesis and secretory pathways were manipulated by adding brefeldin A (5 μg/ml, Sigma), cycloheximide (50 μg/ml), or nocodazole (25 μm, Sigma) in the culture medium for the times indicated in the figure legends. To localize endocytosed material, Alexa Fluor® 594 Hydrazide (0.8 mm, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to the culture medium. Transfections—Cells were routinely plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well on collagen-coated 8-well chambered cover glasses (Nalge Nunc, Naperwille, IL). When subconfluent, the cells were transiently transfected with mammalian expression vectors encoding mouse Has2 or Has3 open reading frames that had been fused in-frame at their N termini with the enhanced GFP sequence (17Spicer A.P. Nguyen T.K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). In some experiments, GFP-Has3 containing an inactivating missense mutation (D216A) or C-terminal truncations (R539stop and E510stop, respectively) were used. These constructs were generated through site-directed mutagenesis of the GFP-Has3 plasmid DNA. Images of transfected cells were captured 24-48 h after transfection, either from fixed cells or from live cultures maintained in a CSMI microincubator (Harvard Apparatus Inc., Holliston, MA) on the microscopic stage. Immunofluorescence—The cells were fixed with 2 or 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 20 min or 1 h, washed with phosphate buffer, permeabilized for 20 min at room temperature with 0.1% Triton-X-100 in 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies or bHABC (biotinylated hyaluronan binding complex)(1.25 μg/ml) (18Wang C. Tammi M. Tammi R. Histochemistry. 1992; 98: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) in 1% bovine serum albumin. To remove the pericellular hyaluronan, fixed cells were treated with Streptomyces hyaluronidase (1 turbidity reducing unit/ml, Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan) before permeabilization. An anti-58K antibody (mouse ascites fluid, 1:100, Sigma), trans-Golgi-network marker (diluted ascites, 1:200, Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), anti-calnexin antibody (whole rabbit serum, 1:100, StressGen Biotechnologies Corp, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), and anti-CD44, (clone OX50, 0.25 μg/ml, BioSource International, Inc., Camarillo, CA) were used to visualize the Golgi complex, ER, and plasma membrane, respectively. After washing, the cells were incubated for 1 h either with Texas red (TR)-labeled secondary anti mouse antibodies (l:1000) or with TR-labeled streptavidin (1:1000) (Vector) for bHABC staining. Confocal Microscopy—Micrographs of living or fixed cells were obtained with an Ultraview® confocal scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope with a ×100 NA 1.3 oil immersion objective. Figures were further modified with PhotoShop 6.0 software (Adobe, Mountain View, CA). For the three-dimensional imaging, a series of horizontal optical sections was captured through the cell at 200-nm steps. The three-dimensional images were created and further modified using ImageJ 1.32 software. ELSA Assay of Hyaluronan—Approximately 8 × 104 REK cells were plated on 24-well plates (CELL STAR®, Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmünster, Austria) and transfected 4-6 h later either with one of the GFP-Has fusion plasmids or with the same GFP-vector lacking a Has cDNA construct. Medium was replaced the next day with fresh medium (containing 5% fetal bovine serum), and the culture was maintained for 24 h prior to harvesting for hyaluronan assays and cell counting. To study the effect of brefeldin A on hyaluronan secretion, the cell cultures were pretreated with brefeldin A (5 μg/ml) for 2 h. After washing with Hanks' buffered saline solution, a fresh medium with or without brefeldin A was added, and after a 4-h incubation, the culture medium (containing serum) were collected for ELSA assay. Hyaluronan ELSA assays were performed as described previously (19Hiltunen E.L. Anttila M. Kultti A. Ropponen K. Penttinen J. Yliskoski M. Kuronen A.T. Juhola M. Tammi R. Tammi M. Kosma V.M.

Maxisorp 96-well plates (Nunc) were precoated with HABC (hyaluronan binding complex, 1 μg/ml in 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.5), washed with 0.5% Tween-phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin-phosphate-buffered saline. The medium samples, diluted 1:40 or 1:50, and the hyaluronan standards (0-50 ng/ml, Provisc®, Algon, Fort-worth, TX) were added into individual wells on the plates and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, the plates were sequentially incubated with bHABC (1.0 μg/ml) and with horseradish peroxidase streptavidin (1:20,000 in phosphate-buffered saline, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at 37°C and for 10 min at room temperature in the substrate-chromagen solution (containing 0.01% of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethybenzidine and 0.005% H2O2 in 0.1 m sodium acetate, 1.5 mm citric acid buffer). Then 50 μl of 2 m H2SO4 was added, and the absorbances were measured at 450 nm.

Both videos play at 15-20 frames/s and show GFP fluorescence signal in a single focal plane in living REKs during 5-10 min. The frames were collected in every 5 s. Video 1 shows GFP-HAS3 localization in numerous filopodia and plasma membrane of a migrating keratinocyte with membrane ruffling at the leading edge. Video 2 represents a GFP-HAS3-expressing cell with numerous filopodia. Note the GFP-HAS3 signal at the tips of the filopodia. Transfection of Functional GFP-HAS2 and -HAS3 Constructs in REK Cells—Expression plasmids containing mouse Has2 and Has3 open reading frames with N-terminally fused GFP were expressed in rat epidermal keratinocytes. To show that the transfected GFP-HASs were functional in the REK cells, the amount of hyaluronan released into growth medium was measured using an ELSA assay (Fig. 1). The content of hyaluronan in the medium was clearly higher in the cultures transfected with GFP-Has2 and GFP-Has3 constructs than in those transfected with the empty GFP vector (Fig. 1). The proportion of transfected cells varied from 10 to 50% between different experiments (visual evaluation and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, data not shown), indicating that the synthesis of hyaluronan in the cells transfected was 10-30 times elevated as compared with non-transfected cells. There were no consistent differences in the expression rate or hyaluronan synthesis between GFP-HAS2 and GFP-HAS3. We also transfected a GFP-Has3 construct with a missense mutation in the enzyme active site (D216A), and we transfected two truncated forms, lacking 16 and 45 amino acids from the C terminus (R539stop and E510stop, respectively). In cultures transfected with these mutated GFP-Has3-forms, the amount of secreted hyaluronan was close to the level of control cultures transfected with GFP only (Fig. 1). Distribution of GFP-HAS2 and HAS3 in REKs—Both GFP-HAS2 and GFP-HAS3 were abundant inside the cells, forming vesicular structures often grouped around the nucleus and morphologically resembling the ER-Golgi complex (Fig. 2, A-E, arrowheads) (videos 1 and 2, supplemental material). The GFP-HAS2 and GFP-HAS3 were found on the plasma membranes (Fig. 2, B and C, small arrows), although GFP-HAS3 showed more intense and widely spread cell surface signal than GFP-HAS2. GFP-HAS2, and particularly GFP-HAS3, were abundant on filopodial extensions and especially enriched in their tips (Fig. 2, A-C, and inset, small arrows) (videos 1 and 2, supplemental material). The GFP-HAS3 decoration on the small dorsal plasma membrane projections was particularly obvious in the three-dimensional reconstruction (Fig. 2D). The empty GFP control showed a diffuse cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 2F). There were often small, labeled vesicles in the peripheral cytoplasm (Fig. 2, B-E), and some GFP-Has3-transfected cells also contained larger vesicles, structures resembling endocytic vesicles, with a circular, GFP-positive signal (Fig. 2B, large arrows) (video 1, supplemental material). The GFP-labeled HAS proteins thus appeared to exist throughout the secretory route, including ER, Golgi complex, plasma membrane, and endocytic vesicles, with selective enrichment in membrane projections on the dorsal cell surface. GFP-HAS Colocalization with Subcellular Markers—Anti-CD44 immunostaining did not label any intracellular structures but decorated the cell surface, co-localizing with GFP-HAS3 and confirming its plasma membrane localization (Fig. 3A). The perinuclear GFP-HAS3 showed partial colocalization with the 58K Golgi marker (Fig. 3B) and a trans-Golgi marker (data not shown). The ER marker calnexin also shared partial colocalization with GFP-HAS3 in vesicles close to the nucleus, although most of the ER marker resided more peripherally in the cytoplasm and displayed little colocalization with GFP-HAS3 (Fig. 3C). These colocalization experiments were also performed using GFP-Has2-transfected cells, which showed patterns essentially equivalent to those of GFP-Has3 (data not shown). The association of the GFP-HASs with the Golgi elements of REKs was also studied by treating the cells with nocodazole, an agent known to disrupt the normal morphology of the Golgi complex (Fig. 3D). The morphology of the GFP-HAS3 structures was lost along with that of the Golgi apparatus, whereas many of the small vesicles resulting from Golgi dispersion retained the colocalization of 58K and GFP-HAS3 (Fig. 3D), supporting the idea that a significant proportion of GFP-HAS3 resided in the Golgi complex. The morphology of some of the GFP-HAS3-positive vesicular structures suggested that they were derived from the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B), and time-lapse imaging showed trafficking of GFP-Has3 from cell surface to endosomes (video 1, supplemental material). A fluid phase marker added into growth medium (Fig. 3E) was rapidly taken up in a part of the smaller vesicles and most of the larger, circular GFP-HAS3-positive vesicles (Fig. 3E, arrowheads), suggesting that this GFP-HAS3 was derived through endocytosis from plasma membrane. Colocalization Analysis of Intracellular Hyaluronan and GFP-HAS3—Despite the endogenous hyaluronan background, REKs transfected with GFP-Has3 and GFP-Has2 showed distinctively elevated levels of cell surface hyaluronan close to GFP-HASs (Fig. 3F), especially around the filopodia-like projections (Fig. 3F, inset). A portion of the hyaluronan resided within the cells, ascertained by removing pericellular hyaluronan with Streptomyces hyaluronidase digestion (Fig. 3, G-I). Fig. 3G shows the total amount of intracellular hyaluronan (a compressed stack of confocal images). A single optical section from the same cell is presented in Fig. 3H to reveal the actual, relatively minor colocalization of intracellular hyaluronan with GFP-HAS3. However, the extent of colocalization varied, as shown in an optical section from another cell with more substantial colocalization (Fig. 3I). In this cell, colocalization existed both in a portion of the small vesicles and in the large vesicles, resembling those positive for the tracer of endocytosis in Fig. 3E. The result indicates that hyaluronan and HAS3 can be co-endocytosed but does not exclude the possibility that a part of the vesicles are on their way from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. The origin of the intracellular hyaluronan was studied by digesting extracellular hyaluronan with Streptomyces hyaluronidase in live cell cultures for up to 4 h prior to fixation and staining for hyaluronan (Fig. 3, J-L). As expected, pericellular hyaluronan was almost totally removed by the enzyme in 30 min (data not shown). After a 30-min digestion, the cells contained about equal, sometimes even enhanced, signal for intracellular hyaluronan, as compared with non-digested cells (Fig. 3J). However, a longer digestion (1-4 h) led to almost complete disappearance of the intracellular hyaluronan (Fig. 3, K and L), and the remaining hyaluronan showed no colocalization with intracellular GFP-HAS3. The data suggest that, initially, the partial degradation of cell surface hyaluronan enhanced its endocytosis and thus intracellular accumulation, whereas later on, the depleted hyaluronan pool on the cell surface reduced the flux into the cell, which, together with a constant decay of the endocytosed material, resulted in the disappearance of intracellular hyaluronan. Subcellular Localizations of Mutated HAS3—Confocal analysis of REKs transfected with the point-mutated D216A and truncated R539stop and E510stop GFP-Has3 constructs showed that although the constructs were well expressed, their localizations markedly differed from those of the intact forms and also from each other. The truncated form R539stop (like E510stop, not shown) was mainly found in the peripheral cytoplasm, forming a reticular pattern (Fig. 4, A-C), with considerable colocalization with an ER marker (Fig. 4B), and to a lesser extent, with the Golgi marker (Fig. 4C). The point-mutated D216A, instead, was mainly localized in large vesicles adjacent to the nucleus, whereas a smaller proportion formed a reticular ER-like pattern (Fig. 4D). The D216A partially colocalized with the Golgi marker (Fig. 4F) and less with an ER marker (Fig. 4E). None of these modified GFP-HAS3 forms was clearly detectable on the plasma membrane, as confirmed by the absence of colocalization with CD44 (Fig. 4, G and H). The amount of cell-associated hyaluronan varied in these cells from low to moderate, being comparable with untransfected cells (data not shown). Hyaluronan did not show any colocalization with the mutated GFP-HASs (Fig. 4I). The results indicated that the C-terminally truncated HASs had difficulty in leaving the ER, whereas most of the missense mutated construct reached the Golgi complex but was not detectable on the plasma membrane. Effect of Brefeldin A and Cycloheximide on REK Hyaluronan Secretion—To study the influence of HAS trafficking on hyaluronan synthesis, we treated REKs with brefeldin A, which interferes with vesicular traffic from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane and redistributes Golgi elements back to ER (21Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). A 6-h treatment with brefeldin A caused a 60-80% reduction in the secretion of hyaluronan in the GFP-Has2- and -Has3-transfected cultures (Fig. 5, A and B). A similar degree of inhibition was also seen in cultures transfected with a vector containing only GFP and also in non-transfected cultures (Fig. 5A). The amount of hyaluronan released into the culture medium in cultures pretreated with brefeldin A for 2 h and then chased for 4 h varied from 70 to 95% of that both in control and in Has-transfected cultures (Fig. 5A), indicating that the effect of brefeldin A treatment was reversible. Inhibition of protein synthesis using a 4-h cycloheximide treatment caused ∼50% reduction in the amount of hyaluronan secreted into culture medium (Fig. 5B). When added together with brefeldin A, it did not further impair hyaluronan synthesis (Fig. 5B). To see whether the recovery of hyaluronan synthesis during the chase after brefeldin A was due to newly translated HAS protein or redistribution of pre-existing HAS blocked in the Golgi and ER, we added cycloheximide into the chase medium of the cultures pretreated with brefeldin A. During the chase following brefeldin A block, hyaluronan secretion recovered almost at the same rate as in cultures chased without cycloheximide (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the recovery was largely due to HAS already existing in the secretory pathway. GFP-HAS3 Traffic in Brefeldin A and Cycloheximide-treated Cultures—Confocal analysis showed that the GFP-HAS3 signal formed a diffuse reticular pattern in the cytoplasm of cultures treated with brefeldin A for 2 h (Fig. 6, A-C), resembling the images of the C-terminally truncated GFP-HAS3 (Fig. 4, A-C) and indicating that GFP-HAS3 had returned from the Golgi apparatus to ER. In the brefeldin A-treated cultures, no GFP-HAS3 was detected on the plasma membrane (Fig. 6A), also indicated by the lack of colocalization with CD44 (Fig. 6B). The turnover of plasma membrane GFP-HAS3 was thus less than 2 h. After a 30-min chase following brefeldin A block, most of the GFP-HAS3 signal still gave an ER-like pattern, with a smaller proportion on sites and structures corresponding to Golgi apparatus (Fig. 6D). A chase for 1 h brought most of the GFP-HAS3 to the Golgi complex and brought a small amount also to the plasma membrane (Fig. 6E). Cells harvested after a 2-h chase showed intense GFP-HAS3 labeling of Golgi-like structures, plasma membrane, and the large endocytic vesicles (Fig. 6F). The GFP-HAS3 signal on the plasma membrane was often more intense in the chased than in the untreated control cultures and was close to strong hyaluronan staining, giving an impression of a rebound effect (Fig. 6F). Following release of the brefeldin A block, it thus took ∼1 h to refill Golgi apparatus with GFP-HAS3 from ER, and the whole secretory and endocytosis pathway reached a new equilibrium by 2 h. In cells treated with cycloheximide for 2 h with a concentration that reduces protein synthesis by 95% in mouse keratinocytes (22Yuspa S.H. Ben T. Hennings H. Lichti U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 97: 700-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the distribution of GFP-HAS3 resembled that in the untreated cells (Fig. 6G). By 4 h, cycloheximide had reduced the signal, especially in the Golgi-like structures, whereas GFP-HAS3 was still found on the plasma membrane and small vesicles in the peripheral cytoplasm (Fig. 6H). After a 5-h cycloheximide treatment, the intensity and the extent of the GFP-HAS3 signal were very low (Fig. 6I). The result indicates that the turnover time of the GFP-HAS3 protein in REKs is 4-5 h. Interestingly, although all GFP-HAS3 had left the plasma membrane during the 2 h in brefeldin A, low to moderate levels of cell-associated hyaluronan were still present (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, the amount of cell-associated hyaluronan was considerable even after 5 h in cycloheximide (Fig. 6I), indicating independent metabolic rates and routes for HAS-associated and receptor bound hyaluronan. Effect of Hyaluronan Synthesis Inhibition on GFP-HAS Localization—4-Methylumbelliferone (4-MU) is an effective inhibitor of hyaluronan synthesis in REKs (20Rilla K. Pasonen-Seppänen S. Rieppo J.

https://openalex.org/W2003911732,"The exact molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular effects associated with various flavonoids have yet to be fully explained. In the present study, we have administered several flavonoids to human HaCaT keratinocytes and determined that 3,4′-dihydroxy flavone (3,4′-DHF) exerts a slight stimulatory effect on cell growth, although other flavonoids, including kaempferol, quercetin, and isorhamnetin, exhibited growth inhibitory properties. 3,4′-DHF was found to exert an anti-apoptotic effect on etoposide-induced cell death of HaCaT keratinocytes. We were also able to determine that sustained ERK activation was intimately associated with the etoposide-induced apoptosis of HaCaT cells, and treatment with 3,4′-DHF induced a significant suppression of etoposide-induced ERK activation, concomitant with the repression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase or the cleavage of pro-caspase 3. ERK overexpression significantly overrode the anti-apoptotic function of 3,4′-DHF, but this was not true of ERK-DN. Moreover, treatment with 3,4′-DHF resulted in the protection of cells from H2O2-induced cell death and exerted an apparent suppressive effect on the stress-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, we showed that 3,4′-DHF almost completely abolished kaempferol-induced apoptosis, coupled with a concomitant suppression of both intracellular ROS generation and the activation of ERK. Taken together, our data clearly indicate that a host of phytochemicals, including etoposide and a variety of flavonoids, differentially regulate the apoptosis of human HaCaT keratinocytes via the differential modulation of intracellular ROS production, coupled with the concomitant activation of the ERK signaling pathway. According to these results, we are able to conclude the distinct structure-activity relationship between several flavonoids.

Apoptosis is not only a fundamental cellular activity, which allows for the maintenance of physiological balance within an organism, but it also constitutes a protective mechanism against carcinogenesis, via the elimination of damaged cells or abnormal excess cells (1Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6275) Google Scholar). It is also involved in the machinery of immune defense and the pathogenesis of a host of diseases associated with imbalances between positive and negative cell survival regulatory factors. Apoptotic processes occur under the tight control of many pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules and are typically executed by the caspase family of cysteine proteases (2Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). A series of recent studies has established that the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of key regulatory proteins are two of the most essential cellular events with regard to both cell growth and apoptosis. One of the primary phosphorylation-dephosphorylation apoptotic signaling cascades has been shown to be composed of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; MAPKKK, MAPKK kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; DAPI, 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DCFH-DA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; 3,4′-DHF, 3,4′-dihydroxy flavone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DCFH, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin; DCF, 2′-7′-dichlorofluorescein. a family of serine/threonine kinases that is composed of three distinct components of the protein kinase family; the MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs), the MAPK kinases (MAPKKs), and the MAPKs (3Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Currently, several distinct MAPKs, including the p42/p44 extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK1 and -2) (4Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A.

Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar), p38 MAPK (6Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar), and big MAPK (BMK1/ERK5) have been demonstrated to function in these independent signaling pathways (7Lee S.H. Fujita N. Imai K. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The activated MAPKs affect the phosphorylation of Ser-Pro and Thr-Pro motifs in the substrate proteins and have also been shown to be regulated by a variety of extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, mitogens, cytokines, and environmental stresses (8Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). The specificity of the activation and function of the MAP-kinase signaling modules is determined by the activities of several apoptotic regulators, including scaffold, adaptor, and inhibitory proteins, which engage in interactions with the kinases in the MAPK signaling cascade. The flavonoids comprise a broadly distributed class of plant pigments, all of which can be synthesized from phenylalanine. Recently, considerable scientific and therapeutic interest has focused on the structure and functions of these flavonoids (9Havsteen B.H. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 96: 67-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar, 10Cody V. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 280: 29-44PubMed Google Scholar), including the well known compounds etoposide and taxol in cancer chemotherapy. They appear to be ubiquitous in the cells of green plants, and are responsible for much of the coloring of plants in nature. Most emit brilliant fluorescence when excited by UV light. Flavonoids also exert a host of regulatory functions on plant growth, via inhibition of the exocytosis of the auxin indolyl acetic acid, as well as by inducing gene expression, and have been shown to modulate other biological functions, as well. Moreover, the flavonoids have been demonstrated to either inhibit or kill many bacterial strains, as well as viral enzymes such as reverse transcriptase and protease. They have also been observed to destroy some pathogenic protozoans, but their toxicity to animal cells is generally low. Flavonoids have been used in the treatment of many important common diseases, due to their well proven ability to inhibit specific enzymes, to stimulate some hormones and neurotransmitters, and to scavenge free radicals (11Hertog M.G. Hollman P.C. Katan M.B. Kromhout D. Nutr. Cancer. 1993; 20: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). The flavonoids are phenolic compounds and are characterized by a diphenylpropane (C6C3C6) skeleton. This structure (and the appellation “flavonoid”) is shared by the monomeric flavonols, flavones, flavanols, and flavanones, and all of these compounds have been subjected to intensive study, to determine their possible roles in human health, including cancer prevention. Several previous studies have indicated that some flavonoids exhibit potent anti-tumor properties and can modulate apoptosis, differentiation, and the cell cycle, probably by virtue of their anti-oxidant functions (12Fu Y. Hsieh T.C. Guo J. Kunicki J. Lee M.Y. Darzynkiewicz Z. Wu J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, only a few cases have exhibited their anti-oxidant activities in vitro, and some controversy has arisen with regard to the possible antioxidant properties possessed by several flavonoids, which have been reported to function as either pro-oxidant or anti-oxidant compounds, depending on their concentration (13Cemeli E. Schmid T.E. Anderson D. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2004; 44: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Despite the many studies that have been conducted regarding the function of flavonoids, the pro-oxidant/anti-oxidant properties of flavonoids remain somewhat debatable, and the detailed molecular mechanisms of their effects remain largely unknown. The objective, then, of the present work was to assess the apoptosis-modulating effects of several flavonoids, and to clearly elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying their activity on the apoptosis of human keratinocytes. Epidermal keratinocytes, which comprise the barrier between the body and the environment, are routinely and continuously exposed to a variety of environmental and physiological stresses, including radiation and chemicals. Keratinocytes respond to such sometimes-noxious stimuli via the activation of distinct signaling pathways which result in either apoptosis or survival (14Diker-Cohen T. Koren R. Liberman U.A. Ravid A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 1010: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present study, we treated experimental HaCaT keratinocytes with a variety of flavonoids, and determined that several flavonoids, including kaempferol, quercetin, and isorhamnetin, exerted distinct pro-apoptotic effects. However, some of the tested flavonoids, including 3,4′-dihydroxy flavone (3,4′-DHF), appeared to exert an anti-apoptotic influence. We also determined that 3,4′-DHF suppresses etoposide- and kaempferol-induced apoptosis via the reverse modulation of the ROS-mediated ERK signaling pathway, clearly showing the structure-activity relationship inherent to the flavonoids. Our findings indicate that apoptosis is differentially modulated by various flavonoids, and this appears to be dependent on the specifically different hydroxyl (OH) substitutions in their diphenylpropane (C6C3C6) skeletons. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—The spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte HaCaT cell line was cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. For the DNA transfection, we plated the HaCaT cells at a density of 3 × 106 cells per 100-mm culture dish, incubated this overnight, and then transfected it with the indicated expression vectors, using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Antibodies and Materials—The 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was acquired from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and the electrophoresis reagents and Bio-Rad protein assay kit were purchased from Bio-Rad. Antibodies against pro-caspase-3, actin, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and the ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibodies were acquired from Cell Signaling (Beverly, USA). Determination of Cell Viability—The HaCaT cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells in 96-well plates, and cell viability was evaluated via conventional MTT reduction assays. After incubation, the cells were treated with MTT solution (final concentration, 0.25 mg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. Dark blue formazan crystals forming in the intact cells were then dissolved with Me2SO, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. The results were then expressed as percentages of MTT reduction, with the absorbance exhibited by the control cells being arbitrarily set as 100%. DAPI Staining—We also conducted DAPI staining for the identification of apoptotic nuclei. HaCaT cells were collected at 2000 rpm for 5 min, washed once with cold PBS, fixed in ice-cold methanol/acetic acid (1:1, v/v) for 5 min, then stained with 0.8 mg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenolindole (DAPI) in darkness (15Studzinski G.P. Harrison L.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 189: 1-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Morphological changes in the apoptotic cells were assessed visually under a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope, at the fluorescence DAPI region (excitation, 351 nm; emission, 380 nm). To count the apoptotic nuclei of the transiently transfected cells, the cells were co-transfected with pEGFP (Clontech) and the indicated plasmids. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were either left unexposed or were exposed to the indicated agents. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then stained with DAPI. The number of cells containing apoptotic nuclei among the green fluorescent protein-expressing cells was counted via fluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cell death was then calculated as a percentage of apoptotic cells over the total green fluorescent protein-positive cells (16Cho S.G. Kim J.W. Lee Y.H. Hwang H.S. Kim M.S. Ryoo K. Kim M.J. Noh K.T. Kim E.K. Cho J.H. Yoon K.W. Cho E.G. Park H.S. Chi S.W. Lee M.J. Kang S.S. Ichijo H. Choi E.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Ryoo K. Huh S.H.

Western Blot Analysis—Cells in 100-mm dishes were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped from the dishes, then collected in extraction buffer (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After the cells had been incubated on ice for 30 min, the lysates were centrifuged, and the amount of proteins in the cleared lysates was quantitated with Bradford Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). An equal amount of proteins was then separated on 10–12% SDS-PAGE gel, and then transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 mm, Schleicher and Schuell). These membranes were blocked with 3–5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline and subsequently probed with primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline, which contained 3% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20. The antibody-antigen complexes were then detected using goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugates, followed by the use of an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Bioscience). Measurement of Intracellular ROS Levels—Intracellular ROS levels were assessed using the oxidant-sensitive fluorescent probe, DCFH-DA, under inverted microscopy. Cells grown at 1 × 106 cells per 35-mm culture dish were maintained for 24 h in growth medium, then exposed for 30 min to 5 mm DCFH-DA. The cells were washed with PBS, and a cover-lass was placed atop the dish. DCF fluorescence (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 520 nm) was then imaged on an inverted fluorescence microscope. The production of intracellular peroxide was also measured, using DCFH-DA coupled with Spectrofluorometry. Fluorescence was quantified with a Shimadzu RF5301 PC spectrofluorometer, set at an excitation of 504 nm and an emission of 524 nm (18Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). The cells were then exposed to RB/light, and a 5 mm stock solution of DCFH-DA dissolved in 20 μlofMe2SO was added to each culture dish 30 min prior to the assay. After another incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, and disrupted by three 10-s cycles of low output sonication. The supernatants were then acquired after 10 min of centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, and the crude extracts (500 μg of protein) were suspended in PBS, after which the fluorescence was recorded. Effects of Several Flavonoids on the Cell Viability of HaCaT Keratinocytes—The body's initial line of defense is often the skin, which is composed of the epidermis and the dermis. Keratinocyte are the principal cell type comprising the epidermis, and constitute ∼90% of total epidermal cells. The HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line is a spontaneously immortalized human epithelial cell line, which was developed by Dr. Norbert Fusenig and coworkers (19Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3476) Google Scholar), and harbors specific p53 mutations (20Lehman T.A. Modali R. Boukamp P. Stanek J. Bennett W.P. Welsh J.A. Metcalf R.A. Stampfer M.R. Fusenig N. Rogan E.M. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). However, HaCaT cells are not tumorigenic when inoculated into mice. To evaluate the effects of various flavonoids on the cell viability of human HaCaT keratinocytes, we treated these cells with differing quantities of several flavonoids, including isorhamnetin, kaempferol, 3,4′-dihydroxy flavone (3,4′-DHF), and quercetin. We then determined cell viability at several time points, via MTT assay. The MTT assay relies principally on the mitochondrial metabolic capacities of the viable cells and, hence, reflects the intracellular redox state. Most flavonoids have been shown to reduce the cell viability of the HaCaT cells, and kaempferol and isorhamnetin exhibited the most dramatic effects (Fig. 1, A and B). However, some flavonoids exhibited no negative effects on cell viability and, interestingly, 3,4′-DHF was shown to induce a slight but significant increase in the cell viability of the HaCaT keratinocytes. 3,4′-Dihydroxy Flavone Suppresses Etoposide-induced Apoptosis—To evaluate the differential effects of flavonoids in a more apparent manner, we initially attempted to induce apoptosis in the HaCaT cells using etoposide, which is another phenolic phytochemical and one of the better-known apoptosis-inducing agents. As expected, etoposide effected a reduction in the viability of the HaCaT cells, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). In a further experiment to determine the differential effects of flavonoids on etoposide-induced cell death, we used 10 μm etoposide, at which concentration we observed a cell viability of ∼50%. At this concentration, etoposide was shown to induce the cleavage of PARP and the activation of caspase 3, both of which constitute markers for the etoposide-induced apoptosis of HaCaT keratinocytes (Fig. 1D). We then treated the cells with flavonoids, combined with 10 μm etoposide. Whereas the additional treatment of kaempferol, quercetin, and isorhamnetin was determined to enhance the negative effects of etoposide on cell viability, 3,4′-DHF was shown to significantly suppress the etoposide-induced abnegation of cell viability (Fig. 1, E and F). We also assessed morphological changes in the amount of apoptotic nuclei in the cells, via DAPI staining, after the exposure of the cells to 10 μm etoposide, and/or 3,4′-DHF. Etoposide induced nuclear fragmentation in the HaCaT cells, but this etoposide-induced apoptosis was suppressed by 3,4′-DHF (Fig. 2A). Addition of 3,4′-DHF also protected the etoposide-induced PARP and pro-caspase 3 cleavage (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that a variety of flavonoids exhibit differential effects on cell death, and that 3,4′-DHF, a flavonoid which has not been thoroughly studied, exerts an anti-apoptotic effect on etoposide-induced cell death in human HaCaT keratinocytes. The ERK Signaling Pathway Is Involved in the Anti-apoptotic Effect of 3,4′-DHF—Despite the many previous studies that have been conducted with flavonoids, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the observed cellular effects of flavonoids remain largely unclear. Several reports, however, have reported that the MAPK signaling pathway may play an important role in the activities and effects of chemotherapeutic drugs (21Boldt S. Weidle U.H. Kolch W. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). MAPK signaling pathways are clearly involved in a host of cellular functions, including cell growth, differentiation, development, and apoptosis. They are, in general, subdivided into three different pathways, namely the ERK, p38 kinase, and JNK signaling pathways (22Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3209) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether the MAPK signaling pathway is, indeed, involved in the anti-apoptotic effects of 3,4′-DHF, we treated the cells with several kinase inhibitors, each of which blocks a specific MAPK pathway. We initially treated the cells with kinase inhibitors, such as PD98059, SB202190, or SP600125, to ascertain which MAPK signaling pathway was involved in the etoposide-induced apoptosis of HaCaT keratinocytes. Both SB202190 (p38 kinase inhibitor) and SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), were found to have little, if any, influence on the etoposide-induced loss of cell viability in the HaCaT cells (Fig. 3A). Notably, treatment with PD98059 (MEK inhibitor) was shown to suppress etoposide-induced cell death. The effects of PD 98059, a specific ERK signaling pathway inhibitor, was demonstrated to be similar to those associated with 3,4′-DHF. We then evaluated nuclear fragmentation and caspase activation, both of which are fairly reliable indicators of apoptotic cell death. Pretreatment with an MEK inhibitor clearly antagonized both etoposide-induced nuclear breakdown and caspase activation (Fig. 3, B and C). However, sustained ERK1 and ERK2 activation was observed in cells that had been exposed to etoposide (Fig. 3D). This clearly indicates that sustained ERK activation may be involved in etoposide-induced apoptosis in human HaCaT keratinocytes. ERK activation is generally thought to inhibit apoptosis, but recent studies have demonstrated that sustained ERK activation is also involved in the apoptotic process (23Yang Y.L. Li X.M. Cell Res. 2000; 10: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, in human HaCaT keratinocytes, we can surmise that the observed sustained ERK activation is associated with etoposide-induced apoptosis. It is significant that 3,4′-DHF treatment was shown to induce the suppression of etoposide-induced ERK activation, concomitantly with the repression of PARP or pro-caspase 3 cleavage (Fig. 3E). According to these results, the ERK signaling pathway appears to perform an important function in the etoposide-induced apoptosis of HaCaT keratinocytes and, particularly, in the anti-apoptotic effects associated with 3,4′-DHF. To confirm the involvement of ERK stimulation in the anti-apoptotic effects associated with 3,4′-DHF treatment, we transfected our HaCaT keratinocytes with wild-type ERK, or with the kinase-inactive and dominant negative ERK2 mutant, ERK2-DN (K52R). ERK overexpression was shown to significantly override the anti-apoptotic functions of 3,4′-DHF, but this was not seen in the cells treated with ERK2-DN (Fig. 4). When ERK was overexpressed, we registered a significant level of recovery with regard to both ERK phosphorylation and concomitant caspase activation (Fig. 4A). Our DAPI-staining nuclear fragmentation analysis also clearly showed that ERK overexpression exerted an antagonistic effect on the anti-apoptotic effects of 3,4′-DHF (Fig. 4B). These data clearly demonstrate that the ERK signaling pathway is intimately involved in the anti-apoptotic effects associated with 3,4′-DHF. Suppression of ROS-ERK Signaling Pathway by 3,4′-DHF Plays an Important Role in the Modulation of Apoptosis in HaCaT Cells—Several reports have suggested that a host of phenolic phytochemicals, including etoposide and flavonoids, can induce variations in the levels of cellular ROS (24Ko C.H. Shen S.C. Hsu C.S. Chen Y.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 913-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the molecular basis of the anti-apoptotic effects of 3,4′-DHF, we therefore attempted to determine whether 3,4′-DHF exerts a suppressive effect on ROS-induced apoptosis. We initially assessed the effects of 3,4′-DHF treatment on cell viability after the exposure of HaCaT keratinocytes to hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide was shown to induce cell death in about 50% of the cells at a concentration of 300 μm. However, the addition of 3,4′-DHF significantly protected the cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death (Figs. 5, A and B). We then measured intracellular ROS production using the oxidant-sensitive fluorescent dye, DCFH-DA, after the cells were treated with either etoposide or flavonoids. In the presence of intracellular peroxides, the esterase-mediated deacylation of DCFH-DA to DCFH occurs within the cells, and the non-fluorescent DCFH is subsequently oxidized, resulting in the formation of the highly fluorescent DCF. Recently, DCFH has been reported to be sensitive to oxidation by peroxynitrite, hydrogen peroxide (in combination with cellular peroxidases), peroxidases alone, and hydroxyl radicals. However, DCFH appears to be unsuitable for the measurement of NO, hypochlorous acid, or superoxide radicals in biological systems (25Myhre O. Andersen J.M. Aarnes H. Fonnum F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 1575-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Etoposide treatment was shown to strongly induce the generation of fluorescent DCF in the HaCaT keratinocytes, and etoposide-induced ROS generation was wholly antagonized as the result of the addition of N-acetyl cysteine, a well known anti-oxidant and free radical scavenger (Fig. 5C). The administration of N-acetyl cysteine was also shown to suppress both etoposide-induced caspase activation and ERK phosphorylation. This suggests that etoposide induces both apoptosis and ERK phosphorylation in HaCaT keratinocytes, via the generation o of intracellular ROS (Fig. 5D). Most importantly, the addition of 3,4′-DHF had an obviously repressive influence on the etoposide-induced generation of ROS (Fig. 5C). By way of contrast, kaempferol exhibited an additive effect on etoposide-induced ROS generation. In a consistent result, kaempferol alone induced intracellular ROS generation in the HaCaT cells, although 3,4′-DHF did not. These results indicate that 3,4′-DHF protects keratinocytes from stress-induced apoptosis via the suppression of intracellular ROS generation and the concomitant activation of the ERK signaling pathway. Differential Regulation of ROS-ERK Signaling Pathway by Different Flavonoids Plays Distinct Roles in Modulation of Apoptosis in HaCaT Keratinocytes—Kaempferol, a compound that occurs naturally in fruits and vegetables, has been shown to exert anti-proliferative effects in a variety of living systems, on the basis of its striking repressive effects on the diverse cellular events associated with tumor initiation, promotion, and progression (26Aligiannis N. Mitaku S. Mitrocotsa D. Leclerc S. Planta Med. 2001; 67: 468-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because two different flavonoids, namely kaempferol and 3,4′-DHF, were shown to exert differential effects on both cell viability and ROS production (Figs. 1A and 5C), we attempted to determine whether 3,4′-DHF also antagonized effects of kaempferol. MTT and DAPI staining assays also revealed that 3,4′-DHF resulted in the almost complete abolition of the apoptotic effects associated with kaempferol treatment (Fig. 6, A and B). The addition of 3,4′-DHF was also shown to suppress ROS generation, as well as the associated caspase activation and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 6, C and D). Taken together, our present findings suggest that many phytochemicals, including etoposide and a variety of flavonoids, can induce apoptosis, mediated by both ROS and the ERK signaling pathway. Also, other specific flavonoids, including 3,4′-DHF, have been clearly demonstrated to block apoptosis in the human HaCaT keratinocytes, via the modulation of the ROS-ERK signaling pathway (Fig. 6E). Recently, the use of naturally occurring compounds in the development of anti-tumor agents has become a critical topic in the scientific and industrial communities. Several phytochemicals, most notably taxol and etoposide, have already been put into use as clinical anti-tumor drugs"

Asthmatic airways are exposed to mechanical strain, which contributes to their remodeling. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) plays an important role in remodeling. In the present study, we examined if the mechanical strain of human ASM (HASM) cells contributes to their proliferation and migration and the role of MMPs in this process. HASM were exposed to mechanical strain using the FlexCell system. HASM cell proliferation, migration and MMP release, activation, and expression were assessed. Our results show that cyclic strain increased the proliferation and migration of HASM; cyclic strain increased release and activation of MMP-1, -2, and -3 and membrane type 1-MMP; MMP release was preceded by an increase in extracellular MMP inducer; Prinomastat [a MMP inhibitor (MMPI)] significantly decreased cyclic strain-induced proliferation and migration of HASM; and the strain-induced increase in the release of MMPs was accompanied by an increase in tenascin-C release. In conclusion, cyclic mechanical strain plays an important role in HASM cell proliferation and migration. This increase in proliferation and migration is through an increase in MMP release and activation. Pharmacological MMPIs should be considered in the pursuit of therapeutic options for airway remodeling in asthma."

https://openalex.org/W1993456991,"The hypothesis that a single mushroom-like mantle plume head can generate a large igneous province within a few million years has been widely accepted. The Siberian Traps at the Permian-Triassic boundary and the Deccan Traps at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary were probably erupted within one million years. These large eruptions have been linked to mass extinctions. But recent geochronological data reveal more than one pulse of major eruptions with diverse magma flux within several flood basalts extending over tens of million years. This observation indicates that the processes leading to large igneous provinces are more complicated than the purely thermal, single-stage plume model suggests. Here we present numerical experiments to demonstrate that the entrainment of a dense eclogite-derived material at the base of the mantle by thermal plumes can develop secondary instabilities due to the interaction between thermal and compositional buoyancy forces. The characteristic timescales of the development of the secondary instabilities and the variation of the plume strength are compatible with the observations. Such a process may contribute to multiple episodes of large igneous provinces."

https://openalex.org/W2147156175,"The technology required for creating an in vivo microenvironment and a neovasculature that can grow with and service new tissue is lacking, precluding the possibility of engineering complex three-dimensional organs. We have shown that when an arterio-venous (AV) loop is constructed in vivo in the rat groin, and placed inside a semisealed chamber, an extensive functional vasculature is generated. To test whether this unusually angiogenic environment supports the survival and growth of implanted tissue or cells, we inserted various preparations of rat and human skeletal muscle. We show that after 6 weeks incubation of muscle tissue, the chamber filled with predominantly well-vascularized recipient-derived adipose tissue, but some new donor-derived skeletal muscle and connective tissue were also evident. When primary cultured myoblasts were inserted into the chamber with the AV loop, they converted to mature striated muscle fibers. Furthermore, we identify novel adipogenesis-inducing properties of skeletal muscle. This represents the first report of a specific three-dimensional tissue grown on its own vascular supply."
https://openalex.org/W2075665113,"In a previous study, we showed that in situ injection of glycosaminoglycan mimetics called RGTAs® (ReGeneraTing Agents) enhanced neovascularization after skeletal muscular ischemia (Desgranges, P., Barbaud, C., Caruelle, J. P., Barritault, D., and Gautron, J. (1999) FASEB J. 13, 761–766). In the present study, we showed that the RGTA® OTR4120 modulated angiogenesis in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay, in a dose-dependent manner. We therefore investigated the effect of OTR4120 on one of the most specific angiogenesis-regulating heparin-binding growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165). OTR4120 showed high affinity binding to VEGF165 (Kd = 2.2 nm), as compared with heparin (Kd = 15 nm), and potentiated the affinity of VEGF165 for VEGF receptor-1 and -2 and for neuropilin-1. In vitro, OTR4120 potentiated VEGF165-induced proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In the in vivo Matrigel™ plug angiogenesis assay, OTR4120 in a concentration as low as 3 ng/ml caused a 6-fold increase in VEGF165-induced angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical staining showed a larger number of well differentiated VEGFR-2-expressing-cells in Matrigel™ sections of OTR4120-treated plug than in control sections.

Tech. 2003; 60: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Proliferation, migration, and differentiation of endothelial cells during wound repair are influenced by cells, cytokines, and the organization and quality of ECM components (4Tonnesen M.G. Feng X. Clark R.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 2000; 5: 40-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans are a subset of complex polysaccharides bound covalently to a core protein in the ECM. These polysaccharides include glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains such as heparan sulfate (HS) or dermatan sulfate (DS). GAG may act as an endothelial cell receptor that recognizes the ECM (5Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar) and regulates cellular events. Furthermore, GAG plays a key role in the bioavailability of heparin-binding growth factors (HBGF) by providing storage and protection sites (6Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3757) Google Scholar). The exact mechanisms by which GAG participates in this multifactorial process remain unclear but may include modulation of endothelial cells-ECM interactions or signaling of angiogenic or anti-angiogenic factors (7Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar). Thus, depending on their structure and concentration, GAG molecules may exert a variety of regulatory effects on the local bioavailability of angiogenic growth factors such as VEGF (8Zakine G.

VEGF induces endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. In vivo, VEGF is a homodimeric glycoprotein whose monomer exists as five isoforms produced by alternative splicing of a single gene, which yields polypeptides with 121, 145, 165, 189, and 206 amino acid residues, respectively (9Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). These VEGF isoforms differ in their affinity for heparin and ECM components. The best characterized VEGF is the heparin-binding 165-amino acid form, VEGF165 (10Ferrara N. Houck K. Jakeman L. Leung D.W. Endocr.

Commun. 1992; 182: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Two tyrosine kinase receptors that are VEGF high affinity receptors have been identified in humans, VEGFR-1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase, Flt-1) (12de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar) and VEGFR-2 (kinase domain region, KDR) (13Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D. Armellino D.C. Gospodarowicz D. Bohlen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). An additional binding site, neuropilin-1 (NP1), acts as a co-receptor for VEGF165, forming a complex with VEGFR-2 and thereby enhancing VEGF165-induced effects (14Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar).

Macromolecules. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). These substitution degrees are similar to those assayed in heparin used as a control. The molecular mass of OTR4120 is 77 kDa. Chick Embryo Chorioallantoic Membrane Assay—The in vivo chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) angiogenesis model was used to investigate the angiogenic potency of OTR4120 (31Papadimitriou E. Polykratis A. Courty J. Koolwijk P. Heroult M. Katsoris P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, Leghorn fertilized eggs (Pindos, Greece) were incubated for 4 days at 37 °C. Then, a window was opened on the eggshell, exposing the CAM. The window was covered with sterile tape, and the eggs were returned to the incubator. On day 9 of embryo development, 20 μl of distilled water alone as a control or containing OTR4120 (1.5 or 15 μg) was applied on a 1-cm2 area of the CAM inside a silicon ring. After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C, CAMs were fixed in situ with saline-buffered formalin, excised from the eggs, placed on slides, and left to dry in air. Pictures were taken through a stereoscope equipped with a digital camera, and the total length of the vessels was measured using the Image PC image analysis software (Scion Corp.). Each sample was tested three times using 15–20 eggs for each data point. For the total RNA extraction, instead of in situ fixation, the CAM inside the ring was excised from five eggs for each sample tested, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and stored at –80 °C until use. RNA Isolation—Total RNA isolation was performed using NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). CAMs from five eggs for each sample tested were disrupted by grinding with a pestle and mortar to a fine powder, in the presence of liquid N2. The powder was immediately mixed with lysis buffer RA1 containing β-mercaptoethanol and passed several times through a 0.9-mm syringe needle. Extraction was conducted as recommended by the manufacturer. The integrity of isolated RNA was assessed by electrophoresis on 1.3% formaldehyde/agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and quantification was performed spectrophotometrically. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—The RT-PCR reactions for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), VEGFR-1, and VEGFR-2 mRNAs were performed using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (M. J. Research), with 200–250 ng of total RNA per reaction. Primers used for VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and GAPDH were designed according to the chicken sequences available (GenBank™ accession numbers NM001004368, NM204252, and NM204305, respectively) and were as follows: VEGFR-1 sense, CAC AGC GAG TGA GTA CAA AGC; VEGFR-1 antisens, TCC AGC ATG ATT TGG TAG ATC TC; VEGFR-2 sense, CAG CAC CAT GCA GGA TCA GG; VEGFR-2 antisens, GCC AGC AAG TGG GAG TTT CC; GAPDH sense, ACG GAT TTG GCC GTA TTG GC; GAPDH antisens, GCA GGA TGC GAA ACT GAG CG). The reverse transcriptase reaction was performed using a mix of Omniscript and Sensiscript reverse transcriptase for 30 min at 50 °C, followed by incubation at 95 °C for 15 min to activate the HotStarTaq DNA polymerase, inactivate the reverse transcriptase, and denature the cDNA template. After the denaturation step, 35 amplification cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for GAPDH; 94 °C for 45 s, 56 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for VEGFR-1; 94 °C for 45 s, 57 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min for VEGFR-2) were performed and followed by a final DNA synthesis step at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR reactions were not in the saturating phase, and DNA contamination was ruled by performing PCR without the reverse transcription step (data not shown). The RT-PCR products of all the reactions were subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, photographed using a digital camera, and quantified using the Image PC image-analysis software (Scion Corp.). The ratio of electrophoretic band values of each PCR product over the GAPDH electrophoretic band value, used as loading control, represents the expression of each gene. Each sample was tested three times using five eggs for each data point. Preparation of OTR4120- and Heparin-Bovine Serum Albumin Complexes—OTR4120 and heparin were covalently coupled to bovin serum albumin (BSA) as previously described by Soulie et al. (32Soulie P. Heroult M. Bernard I. Kerros M.E. Milhiet P.E. Delbe J. Barritault D. Caruelle D. Courty J. J. Immunoassay Immunochem. 2002; 23: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, heparin or OTR4120 (912 mg) and BSA (34 mg) were dissolved in 5 ml of potassium phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 8.0). Then, 25 mg of sodium cyanoborohydride was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 days at 37 °C. At the end of incubation, mixtures were dialyzed against water and freeze-dried. The residue was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The OTR4120-BSA and heparin-BSA complex concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay kit with BSA as the standard. The complexes were subjected to SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The solutions were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Radio-iodination of VEGF165—Radio-iodination was carried out using the Iodobeads® method. 125I-VEGF165 was separated from free iodine using a heparin-Sepharose column (0.2 ml bed volume) pre-equilibrated with PBS/0.2% gelatin and eluted with PBS/0.2% gelatin and 2 M NaCl. The specific activity of radio-iodinated VEGF165 was 1–3·105 cpm/ng. Binding of 125I-VEGF165 to OTR4120-BSA and Heparin-BSA Complexes—The surface of 96-well ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μ l of 0.2 μg/ml OTR4120-BSA or heparin-BSA as a positive control in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with 12.7 mm EDTA. After three washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (washing buffer), nonspecific interactions were saturated with PBS containing 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Then, 2·105 cpm 125I-VEGF165 (177 pm) and unlabeled VEGF165 in concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 nm were added to a final volume of 100 μl/well in PBS containing 1% BSA. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the wells were washed five times with washing buffer and, after solubilization with 0.2 m NaOH, the radioactivity in each well was measured in a γ-counter (1275 minigamma counter, LKB Wallac). Each curve was analyzed according to the Scatchard procedure by fitting to a logistic curve using the Ligand software (33Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out in triplicate and were repeated five times. 125I-VEGF165 Binding to Soluble Receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and NP-1)—Purified recombinant human VEGFR-1-Fc, VEGFR-2-Fc, or NP-1-Fc chimera in a concentration of 1 μg/ml in 100 μl PBS/well were adsorbed on the surface of 96-well ELISA plates overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed three times with washing buffer, and the nonspecific interactions were saturated with PBS containing 3% BSA, for 1 h at room temperature. Blocking solution was removed, and then 2·105 cpm of 125I-VEGF165 was added with or without heparin or OTR4120 in increasing concentrations (0–100 μg/ml). After incubation overnight at 4 °C, free 125I-VEGF165 was removed by five washes with washing buffer. Solubilization was achieved using 0.2 m NaOH, and the radioactivity in each well was measured in a γ-counter (1275 minigamma counter, LKB Wallac). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of an excess (1000 ×) of unlabeled VEGF165. All experiments were carried out in triplicate and were repeated three times with similar results. Saturation binding experiments were performed in the presence of VEGF165 at increasing concentrations (0 – 0.15 nm for VEGFR-1, 0–1.2 nm for VEGFR-2, and 0 – 0.3 nm for NP-1) and of heparin or OTR4120 at 100 ng/ml, a concentration previously shown to induce maximal VEGF165 binding to its receptors. Each curve was analyzed according to the Scatchard procedure by fitting to a logistic curve using the Ligand software (33Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out in triplicate and were repeated three times. Cell Culture—HUVECs were grown in EBM-2 BulletKit® medium supplemented with 2% FBS, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. The cells were used between passages 2 and 5. Cell Proliferation Assay—HUVECs were seeded in a density of 2·104 cells/well into 12-well tissue culture plates in EBM-2 medium supplemented with 2% FBS. After 24 h, cells were starved with EBM-2 medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS. After 24 h, VEGF165 (3 ng/ml), OTR4120, or heparin (0.3, 3, or 33 ng/ml) alone or in combination (as specified in the results section) were added. After 72 h of incubation, cells were washed with PBS, dissociated with trypsine-EDTA (Clonetics Biowhittaker), and counted using a Coultronics Coulter counter (Beckman Coulter, Roissy, France). The experiment was performed in triplicate and was repeated three times. Results are reported as the mean (±S.E.) percentage of growth in the presence of stimulators compared with the control. Chemotactic Migration Assay—HUVECs migration in response to VEGF165 and/or OTR4120 was assessed in a 24-well modified Boyden chamber as described previously (31Papadimitriou E. Polykratis A. Courty J. Koolwijk P. Heroult M. Katsoris P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A polycarbonate membrane filter with 8-μm pore diameter was coated with collagen type I to promote cell adhesion. The coated filter was placed in the microchamber. HUVECs were loaded into the upper part of chemotaxis chamber at 105 cells/well in 0.1 ml EBM-2 medium supplemented with 0.2% FBS. The lower wells of the chamber were filled with 0.6 ml of the same medium containing VEGF165 (3 ng/ml), OTR4120 (10 ng/ml), or both, as chemoattractants. After 12-h incubation at 37 °C, cells on the upper surface of the filters were completely removed by wiping with a cotton tip. Then, the filters were fixed with methanol, and migrated cells were stained with Crystal Violet. The cells that had migrated through the pores to the lower filter surface were counted per microscopic field magnified ×100. The area of endothelial cells that migrated through the filter was quantified using the NIH Image analysis software. Results are reported as the mean of seven independent high power fields/well provided by three independent experiments. Migration of unstimulated cells served as the control. Matrigel™ Plug Assay—Mice were injected subcutaneously with 0.3 ml of Matrigel™ at 4 °C, alone or with VEGF165 (50 ng/ml), OTR4120 (3 ng/ml), heparin (3 ng/ml), or OTR4120 or heparin combined with VEGF165 (n = 5). The Matrigel™ rapidly formed a single solid gel plug. After 6 days, the mouse skins were pulled back to expose the plug, which remained intact. The plugs were dissected out and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections of 8 μm thickness were cut using a cryostat (Leica), fixed with acetone at 4 °C for 20 min, and stained with Gomori-Trichrome. Histological slides were evaluated to determine the Matrigel™ plug area infiltrated by endothelial cells; to this end, NIH Image software was used on eight Matrigel™-plug sections/mouse, as described previously (34Bernard-Pierrot I. Delbe J. Caruelle D. Barritault D. Courty J. Milhiet P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12228-12234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Experiment was repeated twice. Immunohistochemistry Analysis of VEGFR Expression in Matrigel™—Frozen Matrigel™ sections (8 μm) were fixed for 20 min in acetone at 4 °C. The sections were re-hydrated and saturated inPBS containing 1% BSA and 2% normal goat serum. Endogenous biotin was blocked using the Vector blocking kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Then, the sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 (5 μg/ml) in saturation buffer. After two washes in PBS, 0.2% Tween 20, sections were incubated for 1 hat room temperature with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) (1:1000 dilution) in saturation buffer, followed by three washes in PBS, 0.2% Tween 20 and incubation with an avidin-biotinylated-alkaline phosphatase complex (Vector Laboratories). Alkaline phosphatase activity was revealed using the Vector red substrate (Vector Laboratories). Nuclear staining was achieved by 15 min of incubation with Hoechst, 0.01μg/ml, followed by water wash. The mounting medium for fluorescence was from Thermo Shandon (Pittsburgh). OTR4120 Induces Angiogenesis—We first tested the angiogenic potency of OTR4120, using the chicken embryo CAM assay. This assay has been used previously to evaluate the effects of GAGs and heparin on angiogenesis (35Ribatti D. Roncali L. Nico B. Bertossi M. Acta Anat. (Basel). 1987; 130: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The effect of OTR4120 is dose-dependent. While 1.5 μg/cm2 of OTR4120 applied to CAM increased the vascular network by 30% compared with control CAM, the 15 μg/cm2 dose inhibited vessels development (Fig. 1A). In keeping with these data, expression of both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 was increased in OTR4120-treated CAM (Fig. 1, B and C). GAGs are known to bind angiogenic growth factors such as VEGF165 and to modulate VEGF165 bioavailability. Since VEGF165 was expressed in CAM (36Ribatti D. Cruz A. Nico B. Favier J. Vacca A. Corsi P. Roncali L. Dammacco F. Cytokine. 2002; 17: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the angiogenic activity of OTR4120 occurred through VEGF165 activity. OTR4120 Binds to VEGF165—The interactions between VEGF165 and OTR4120 were studied by radio-receptor assays using OTR4120-coated microtiter plate. Specific binding of 125I-VEGF165 was determined with or without a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled VEGF165. Specific bindings of 125I-VEGF165 to OTR4120 (Fig. 2A) or to heparin (Fig. 2B) as the positive control was observed. A molar excess of 1000-fold of unlabeled VEGF165 displaced 85 and 60% of 125I-VEGF165 bound to OTR4120 and heparin, respectively. Neither control nor BSA alone or uncoupled OTR4120 bind 125I-VEGF165 (data not shown). Saturation ligand binding was demonstrated. Scatchard analysis of 125I-VEGF165 displacement by unlabeled VEGF165 performed using Ligand software (37Munson P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 92: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) showed a Kd of 2.2 ± 2nm for OTR4120 and 15 ± 4nm heparin (Fig. 3, A and B).FIGURE 3125I-VEGF165 affinity to OTR4120-BSA and heparin-BSA complexes. The surface of 96-well ELISA plates was coated with OTR4120-BSA (A) or heparin-BSA (B) complexes. Affinity constants were determined by homologous displacement. 125I-VEGF165 in a concentration of 20 pm was allowed to bind in the presence or absence of unlabeled VEGF165 in increasing concentrations (0–250 nm) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the radioactivity in each well was measured in a γ-counter. Each curve was analyzed according to the Scatchard procedure by fitting to a logistic curve using the Ligand program. All experiments were carried out in triplicate and were repeated five times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) OTR4120 Potentiates the Binding of 125I-VEGF165 to Its High Affinity VEGF165 Receptors—To determine the effect of OTR4120 on the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to VEGF receptors, we conducted experiments in which 125I-VEGF165 bound to the extracellular domain of VEGF receptors in the presence of increasing OTR4120 concentrations. According to the concentration of OTR4120 or heparin, a bell-shaped curve was obtained for the effect on VEGF165 binding to its receptors; binding was enhanced with low concentrations and decreased with higher concentrations (Fig. 4). The presence of heparin or OTR4120 had only a very slight effect on 125I-VEGF165 binding to VEGFR-1. Indeed, 125I-VEGF165 binding was increased less than 2-fold and 1.5-fold in the presence of OTR4120 and heparin, respectively. In contrast, OTR4120 or heparin concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 ng/ml markedly and dose-dependently increased 125I-VEGF165 binding to VEGFR-2 and NP-1. When 100 ng/ml OTR4120 or heparin was used, VEGF165 binding to VEGFR-2"

Understanding disulfide bond catalysis in mammals is important because of the involvement of protein misfolding in conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, cancer, and aging. Mammals express two related Ero proteins, Ero1α and Ero1β. Ero1β is incompletely characterized but is of physiological interest because it is induced by the unfolded protein response. Here, we show that Ero1β can form homodimers and mixed heterodimers with Ero1α, in addition to Ero-PDI dimers. Ero-Ero dimers require the Ero active site, occur in vivo, and can be modeled onto the Ero1p crystal structure. Our data indicate that the Ero1β protein is constitutively strongly expressed in the stomach and the pancreas, but in a cell-specific fashion. In the stomach, selective expression of Ero1β occurs in the enzyme-producing chief cells. In pancreatic islets, Ero1β expression is high, but is inversely correlated with PDI and PDIp levels, demonstrating that cell-specific differences exist in the regulation of oxidative protein folding in vivo.

Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3701) Google Scholar), ranging from cystic fibrosis to α1 anti-trypsin deficiency (2Lawless M.W. Greene C.M. Mulgrew A. Taggart C.C. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5722-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Professional secretory cells in particular must regulate the synthesis of their ER membranes and chaperones to cope with the demands of increased protein production. This is achieved through ER to nucleus signaling pathways, mediated by the trans-membrane associated proteins Ire1α, PERK, and ATF6 (3Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schroder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). ATF6 and Ire1α induce the transcription of XBP1 and the splicing of its mRNA, culminating in the expression of UPR target genes (4Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K.

However, the relationship between Ero mRNA and protein levels, and the relationship between UPR induction of Ero1β by a chemical versus a physiological (nutritional) stimulus is not known. Cells in culture generally express low levels of Ero proteins. The assumption is that low expression of an oxidoreductase is enough to drive the oxidation of many substrate proteins by fuelling many PDI molecules. Here we show that this model is too simple and that the pathway of an oxygen electron acceptor-Ero-PDI-substrate chain is incomplete. Our experiments demonstrate that in stomach and pancreatic tissues, Ero1β protein expression is much higher than expected for an oxidoreductase catalyst and is restricted to groups of enzyme-producing cells, notably the chief cells in the stomach, and the insulin- and enzyme-producing cells of the pancreas. Constitutively high expression of Ero1β is differentially correlated to PDI expression in professional secretory cells in vivo. At a molecular level, both Ero1α and Ero1β do more than simply engage PDI. Ero1β can form alkylation-independent homodimers, which require Cys396 of the CXXCXXC active site, and Ero1β complexes are more abundant in the pancreas than the stomach. Our biochemical analysis is supported by the Ero1p crystal structure, which can be modeled as a symmetrical dimer in which interfacial FAD-FAD contacts are prominent. Our results show that the ER oxidation machinery is more complex than anticipated in mammals, demonstrating how disulfide bond formation could be regulated in vivo through differential complex formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Antibodies, and Tissues—Human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), and human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), both supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 2 mm Glutamax, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 5% CO2. The polyclonal antiserum against Ero1β was raised against the unique internal Ero1β peptide YTGNAEEDADTKTLL (Sigma Genosys). Thirteen of the fifteen residues were conserved between mouse and human Ero1β. The polyclonal rabbit anti-sera against PDI, Ero1α (D5), and ERp57 have been described previously (18Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polyclonal PDIp antiserum was a gift from M. Lan (29Desilva M.G. Notkins A.L. Lan M.S. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antisera against BiP and insulin (H-86) (both Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the mouse monoclonal antibody HA-7 (Sigma), and the anti-myc antibody 9B11 and the anti-myc polyclonal antibody (both Cell Signaling) were commercially available. Normal goat serum was obtained from DAKO, and normal rabbit serum was obtained from a pre-immune rabbit used to generate the PDI antibody. Murine tissue samples were obtained from male Balb/c or CD1 mice. Anonymous healthy human tissue samples (stomach and pancreas) were obtained embedded in wax from Medical Solutions, Nottingham, UK, with full ethical consent.Transfections—Transfections with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sub-confluent cells in 6-cm dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen), and transfected with 1 or 2 μg DNA for 6 h in the presence of Opti-Mem serum-free medium (Invitrogen). The medium was replaced after 6 h with complete medium, and the cells were analyzed 24 h post-transfection.Construction of Ero1β Mutants—The wild-type pcDNAEro1β-HA and pcDNAEro1β-myc constructs were a kind gift from Roberto Sitia. Site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) was used to create CXXCXXC mutants with the following forward primers: C390A, GAATATCTCCCGTATAATGGACGCTGTTGGATGTGACAAATGCAG; C393A, GTATAATGGACTGTGTTGGAGCTGACAAATGCAGATTATGGGG; and C396A, GACTGTGTTGGATGTGACAAAGCCAGATTATGGGGAAAATTACAG. Each construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The Ero1α-myc tagged constructs have been previously described (18Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Gel Filtration—Gel filtration was performed using a Superdex 200 Precision Column 3.2/30 (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare). Chicken egg albumin (45 kDa) and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa and 132 kDa) (both Sigma) were used as standards. Proteins and mouse tissue lysates injected in a volume of 140 μl were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1, with samples collected every 2 min. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated fractions were neutralized with Tris and taken up in sample buffer, and equal volumes were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE.Immunohistochemistry—Human tissues were sectioned at 4-μm thickness onto Apes coated slides and placed at 60 °C for 1 h. The slides were cleared through xylene and 100–70% alcohol before blocking endogenous peroxidase activity in methanol peroxidase for 10 min. The slides were washed in cold water, and the optimal digestion technique for each tissue type was determined: for stomach tissue, microwave digestion was in 600 ml of citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 20 min; for pancreatic tissue, pressure cooker digestion was in 3 liters of citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 2 min. The slides were washed in tap water and then in TBS (pH 7.4) for 5 min. Tissue sections were blocked in 1% normal goat serum (DAKO) for 10 min before incubating with the optimum dilution of primary antibody in TBS (PDI and PDIp, 1:1000; Ero1β, 1:150; BiP 1:40; and ERp57 and H-86, 1:200) at 4 °C overnight. The sections were washed for 5 min in TBS, and 0.01% biotinylated goat anti-mouse/rabbit antibodies (DAKO) diluted in TBS was added for 30 min. The sections were developed using streptavidin AB complex horseradish peroxidase (DAKO) and 3,3-diaminobenzidine. Counterstaining was achieved with hematoxylin.Western Blotting—Cells or fresh mouse tissues were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm MES, 30 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) with 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A and 20 mm NEM where required. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Post-nuclear cell lysates, immunoprecipitates, or comparable amounts of mouse tissue lysates were taken up in sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. When non-reducing analysis was needed, DTT was left out of the sample buffer. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using 1 μl of anti-HA or anti-myc antibodies immobilized on 50 μl of a 20% suspension of Protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h, followed by washing twice with lysis buffer. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) at 150 mA for 2 h or 30 V overnight, and the membranes were blocked in 8% milk/phosphate-buffered saline Tween for 1 h or overnight. The primary antibodies were used at 1:5,000 (α-myc and α-HA), 1:1,000 (αEro1α/D5 and αPDI), and 1:50 (αEro1β). After washing six times with phosphate-buffered saline Tween membranes were incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies (DAKO) at 1:3,000 for 1 h, washed extensively, and visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Protein markers were from Bio-Rad. Determination of protein concentration of the tissue samples prior to gel loading was carried out by using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), with samples equalized to 1.8 μg/μl. Each blotting experiment was reproduced at least twice.RESULTSEro1β Proteins Are Highly Expressed in Stomach and Pancreas—Despite much interest in ER oxidoreductases, little is known about the expression of Ero proteins in mammalian tissues. Most work has concentrated on the relationship between Eros and PDI and the mechanism of electron transfer to molecular oxygen. The mammalian cell lines thus far examined have low expression of Eros, making study of endogenous protein behavior in tissue culture difficult. Given that studies at the mRNA level suggest that Ero1β transcripts are high in stomach and pancreas (11Pagani M. Fabbri M. Benedetti C. Fassio A. Pilati S. Bulleid N.J. Cabibbo A. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23685-23692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we investigated whether Ero1β proteins could be detected in these mouse tissues. To do this, we raised a polyclonal antiserum against an internal peptide unique to Ero1β. To verify that the antiserum recognized Ero1β, HeLa cells were mock transfected or transfected with Ero1α-myc, Ero1β-myc, Ero1β-HA, or both Ero1β-HA and Ero1β-myc. The tagged proteins were only detected in the relevant individual transfectants (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 1 and 2) and in the co-transfectant (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 3). The Ero1β serum specifically detected both tagged Ero1β forms (Fig. 1C, lanes 2–4), and no Ero1β could be detected in non-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 1C, lane 5). Ero1α was not detected by the Ero1β serum, demonstrating that the serum did not cross-react with Ero1α (Fig. 1C, lane 1). As a positive control, Ero1α could be detected by D5 when the membrane from Fig. 1C was reprobed (without stripping the blot) with the specific polyclonal Ero1α serum (Fig. 1D, lane 1). Ero1β-HA migrated faster than Ero1β-myc because of size/charge differences in the C-terminal tag. Tagged Ero1β proteins can restore viability to yeast Ero1p ts mutants (11Pagani M. Fabbri M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23685-23692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and support oxidative protein folding of model substrates (19Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), demonstrating that tagging does not affect Ero1β function.Having established the specificity of our Ero1β antibody, we then asked whether Ero1β expression could be detected in mouse tissues. Samples of mouse tissues were lysed and clarified by centrifugation, and equal amounts of protein were analyzed by Western blotting. Pancreas and stomach (Fig. 1E, lanes 1 and 4) expressed high levels of Ero1β, whereas liver, small intestine, kidney, and heart did not (Fig. 1E, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). Unlike Ero1β, PDI was expressed in all tissues (Fig. 1F). We conclude that our antibody specifically detected Ero1β and that Ero1β expression was strikingly high in a restricted range of tissues.Ero1β, PDI, ERp57, and BiP Are Highly and Specifically Expressed in the Chief Cells of the Stomach—We further investigated Ero1β expression in the digestive system by using immunohistochemistry. Human stomach tissue sections (blocked with normal goat serum) were negative when primary antibody was omitted (Fig. 2A) and sections exposed to pre-immune rabbit sera instead of primary antibody gave a faint nonspecific staining (Fig. 2B). However, sections probed with the Ero1β antiserum showed very strong, specific staining in the basal area of the stomach (Fig. 2C). Higher magnification showed that Ero1β had a patchwork distribution, and was present in the enzyme producing chief cells of the stomach (arrow) and absent from the acid producing parietal cells (arrowhead) within the same glands (Fig. 2D).FIGURE 2Immunohistochemistry of the stomach. Human stomach sections were probed with TBS (A), normal rabbit serum (NRS) (B), αEro1β (C and D), αPDI (E and F), αERp57 (G and H), and αBiP (I and J) and photographed at 4× (C, E, G, and I; bar = 200 μm) and 20× (A, B, D, F, H, and J; bar = 100 μm) magnification. Arrow = chief cells; arrowhead = parietal cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we asked whether other ER chaperones involved in protein oxidation and the unfolded protein response also showed cell-specific expression in the stomach. PDI (Fig. 2, E and F), ERp57 (Fig. 2, G and H), and BiP (Fig. 2, I and J) were all expressed at a high level in the same cell types. In contrast to Ero1β, both PDI and BiP showed some additional expression in the gastric epithelium (Fig. 2, E and I). We conclude that enzyme-producing cells in the stomach express high levels of ER chaperones and the oxidoreductase Ero1β.Ero1β and PDI Are Both Expressed in the Pancreas but Show Differential Expression in Pancreatic Islets—To determine whether high oxidoreductase expression correlates with high expression of ER chaperones in other tissues, we examined human pancreas. This was of particular interest given the fact that the UPR and protein misfolding contribute to type II diabetes (6Ozcan U. Cao Q. Yilmaz E. Lee A.-H. Iwakoshi N.N. Ozdelen E. Tuncman G. Gorgun C.

Tissue sections (blocked with normal goat serum) showed faint background staining when TBS (Fig. 3A) or pre-immune rabbit sera (Fig. 3B) were used instead of specific antibody. Pancreas sections stained for the pancreas-specific PDI, PDIp, showed expression of this enzyme in the acinar cells and weak staining of islets, as expected (Fig. 3, C and D) (29Desilva M.G. Notkins A.L. Lan M.S. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Pancreatic islets were specifically detected with the anti-insulin antibody H-86 (Fig. 3, E and F). Sequential sections were used to determine the expression pattern of Ero1β (Fig. 3, G and H) and PDI (Fig. 3, I and J). Ero1β was expressed in both islets (arrow) and the surrounding enzyme secreting cells, with a stronger expression in islets. In contrast, PDI expression was diminished in islets (arrow) compared with the surrounding acinar cells. We conclude that in the pancreas Ero1β is found in both exocrine and endocrine cells, whereas PDI and PDIp are both more strongly expressed in exocrine acinar cells.FIGURE 3Immunohistochemistry of the pancreas. Human pancreas sections were probed with TBS (A), normal rabbit serum (NRS) (B), αPDIp (C and D), αinsulin (E and F), αEro1β (G and H), and αPDI (I and J) and photographed at 4× (C, E, G, and I; bar = 200 μm) and 20× (A, B, D, F, H, and J; bar = 100 μm) magnification. Arrow = pancreatic islets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ero1β Engages in Disulfide-dependent, Alkylation-independent Interactions in the ER—Having established that the expression patterns of Ero1β and PDI were not strictly correlated, we decided to investigate the nature of Ero1β-PDI complex formation more closely. Ero1α interacts with PDI in a disulfide-dependent manner, and Ero-PDI complexes can only be recovered when NEM or another alkylating agent is included in the lysis buffer (18Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PDI forms mixed disulfide bonded complexes with Ero proteins that are normally rapidly resolved. NEM blocks the transfer of these intermolecular disulfides by binding to free thiols, thus preventing disulfide bond isomerization and rearrangement. Mutations in the Ero1α CXXCXXC active site alter the structural integrity of the protein (18Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of the CXXCXXC motif in Ero1β has not been studied. We therefore investigated the properties of Ero1β, its CXXCXXC motif, and its relationship to PDI by transfecting three Ero1β myc-tagged mutants (C390A, C393A, and C396A) into HeLa cells. The transfected cells were lysed either in the presence or absence of the alkylating agent NEM, and the post nuclear supernatants were examined by Western blotting after non-reducing and reducing 8% SDS-PAGE. Running the gels under non-reducing conditions kept disulfide bonds intact and allowed any disulfide-dependent interactions with PDI to be observed.At steady state, monomeric wild-type Ero1β existed as a population of mainly oxidized molecules (OX) of ∼60 kDa, based on the faster migration of the protein on non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A, lane 1). The exact ratio of oxidized:reduced (OX:R) Ero1β varied somewhat between transfections and was also dependent on cell type (not shown and see also Fig. 4C). Ero1βC390A was in a less compact state (Fig. 4A, lane 3), consistent with the loss of a long distance disulfide and comparable with previous results for Ero1αC391A (18Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ero1βC393A was found as a mixture of oxidized (OX) and reduced (R) forms (Fig. 4A, lane 5), whereas Ero1βC396A was found in a predominantly reduced state (Fig. 4A, lane 7). Alkylation was required to trap the oxidation states (compare Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2), and mock-transfected cells were negative (Fig. 4A, lanes 9 and 10). Reduction of the samples with DTT resulted in the appearance of a single reduced band (Fig. 4B), and treatment of living Ero1β transfected HT1080 cells with DTT prior to nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4C) demonstrated that the shifts seen in the non-reducing gel are the result of compaction by disulfide bonds and not degradation. These results are similar but not identical to those found with Ero1α. The most notable difference is that the oxidation states of Ero1α are more discrete when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (18Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Ero1β forms redox-dependent, NEM independent complexes.A, non-reducing (NR) and (B) reducing (R) SDS-PAGE of myc-tagged wtEro1β (lanes 1 and 2), Ero1βC390A (lanes 3 and 4), Ero1βC393A (lanes 5 and 6), Ero1βC396A (lanes 7 and 8), and mock transfectants (lanes 9 and 10) lysed in the presence (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) or absence (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) of NEM and probed with α-myc.

https://openalex.org/W1973770205,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen equipped with multiple secretion systems. The type II secretion machinery (Xcp secreton) is involved in the release of toxins and enzymes. The Xcp secreton is a multiprotein complex, and most of its components share homology with proteins involved in type IV pili biogenesis. Among them, the XcpT-X pseudopilins possess characteristics of the major constituent of the type IV pili, the pilin PilA. We have shown previously that XcpT can be assembled in a multifibrillar structure that was called the pseudopilus. By using two different microscopic approaches, we show here that the pseudopili are preferentially isolated fibers rather than tight bundles. Moreover, none of the other four pseudopilins are able to form a pseudopilus, suggesting that the assembly of such a structure is a unique property of XcpT. Moreover, we show that 5 of the 12 Xcp proteins are not required for pseudopilus biogenesis, whereas they are for type II secretion. Most interestingly, we showed that one pseudopilin, XcpX, controls the assembly of XcpT into a pseudopilus. Indeed, when the number of XcpX subunits increases, the length of the pseudopilus decreases. Conversely, in the absence of XcpX, the pseudopilus length is abnormally long. Our results indicate that XcpT and XcpX directly interact with each other. Furthermore, this interaction induces a clear destabilization of XcpT. The interaction between XcpT and XcpX could be part of the molecular mechanism underlying the dynamic control of pseudopilus elongation, which could be crucial for type II-dependent protein secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2101858083,"Arterial pathology manifests as aneurysmal or obstructive disease depending on changes in lumen size due to vascular remodeling (change in vessel external diameter) and/or intimal expansion. Recent clinical and experimental observations in abdominal aortic aneurysms have led to the emerging dogma that Th2-dominant immune responses result in expansive vascular remodeling and luminal ectasia, whereas Th1 immune responses cause intimal hyperplasia and luminal stenosis. We tested this hypothesis by descriptive analyses of 31 non-aneurysmal and 29 aneurysmal ascending thoracic aortic specimens. Approximately half the aneurysms were distinguished by transmural inflammation. The remaining aneurysms and all the non-aneurysmal aortas had a similar leukocytic infiltrate that spared the inner media. Aneurysm tissue had increased expression of the prototypical Th1 cytokine, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and undetectable Th2 cytokines. Specimens with inner media infiltration displayed robust production of IFN-gamma, induction of the IFN-gamma-inducible chemokines IP-10 and Mig, and recruitment of lymphocytes bearing their cognate receptor CXCR3. Transmural inflammation and IFN-gamma production were associated with increased aortic external diameter, intimal thickening, preserved vascular smooth muscle cell density, and decreased matrix proteins. Th1, but not Th2, immune responses have a positive correlation with both outward vascular remodeling and intimal expansion of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms."

Here we identified a potent Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP), RA-RhoGAP, as a direct downstream target of Rap1 in the neurite outgrowth. RA-RhoGAP has the RA and GAP domains and showed GAP activity specific for Rho, which was enhanced by the binding of the GTP-bound active form of Rap1 to the RA domain. Overexpression of RA-RhoGAP induced inactivation of Rho for promoting the neurite outgrowth in a Rap1-dependent manner. Knockdown of RA-RhoGAP reduced the Rap1-induced neurite outgrowth.

On the other hand, extension of neurites requires the SNARE-dependent fusion of plasmalemmal precursor vesicles with the plasma membrane of growth cones. ROCK activated by Rho phosphorylates syntaxin-1, which increases the affinity of syntaxin-1 for tomosyn and forms a stable complex with tomosyn, resulting in inhibition of the formation of the SNARE complex (15Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Izumi G. Yasumi M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Tomosyn localizes at the palm of growth cones and inhibits the fusion of the vesicles there, thus promoting transport of the vesicles to the plasma membrane of the leading edges of growth cones. In retraction of neurites, tomosyn localizes at all over the edges of the neurites and inhibits fusion of the vesicles with the plasma membrane. Thus, the capacity of Rho-directed pathways to control actin stability and vesicle transport is fundamental for neurite extension, guidance, and branching. An increase in Rho activity results in reduction of axon extension, guidance, and branching, whereas a decrease in Rho activity enhances axon extension, guidance, and branching. In contrast to these activities of Rho, activation of Rap1 through the angiotensin II and cannabinoid receptors enhances neurite outgrowth in neuronal cell lines (16Gendron L. Oligny J.F.

Activation of Epac, a Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), enhances neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (18Christensen A.E. Selheim F. de Rooij J. Dremier S. Schwede F. Dao K.K. Martinez A.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that Rap1 is involved in the establishment of neuronal polarity and that Rap1 may play a general role as a positional signal and organize cell architecture (19Schwamborn J.C. Püschel A.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Rap1 determines which neurite will become an axon and directs the recruitment of Cdc42, which is essential for the formation of molecularly distinct dendrites and axon. For this Rap1- and Cdc42-induced selection of a single neurite to become an axon and to extend rapidly, inactivation of Rho is required for the extension of the axon. Supporting this idea that Rap1 negatively regulates Rho in the regulation of vascular endothelial barrier function, Rap1 has been shown to negatively regulate Rho activity and counteract the Rho-induced disruption of VE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (20Cullere X. Shaw S.K. Andersson L. Hirahashi J. Luscinskas F.W. Mayadas T.N. Blood. 2005; 105: 1950-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the functional relationship between Rap1 and Rho in the neurite outgrowth remains unknown. The activities of the Rho family are positively regulated by GEFs and negatively regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (21Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Translocation of the Rho family between the membrane and the cytosol is regulated by Rho GDP dissociation inhibitors (22Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The activities of these regulators are controlled by upstream cell surface receptors for guidance cues or cell adhesion molecules. Several RhoGEFs and RhoG-APs have been shown to be important for the neurite outgrowth (7Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 23Dickson B.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, a clear understanding of what specific regulator(s) of the Rho family, which connects Rap1 and Rho, contributes to the neurite outgrowth is still missing. We have identified here the KIAA1391 human gene product as a novel downstream target of Rap1, which has the RA and GAP domains in addition to the PH and annexin-like repeat domains. The KIAA1391 gene is also designated as ARHGAP20 on the advice of the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee. The KIAA1391/ARHGAP20 gene is predicted to be a tumor suppressor gene inactivated by deletion in breast cancer and also by chromosomal translocation in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (24Katoh M.

The mouse and rat counterparts were also deposited in GenBank™ and termed RA-RhoGAP (RhoGAP having the RA domain) (27Curry B.J. Su H. Law E.G. McLaughlin E.A. Nixon B. Aitken R.J. Genomics. 2004; 84: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, their biological or biochemical properties have not been studied. We show here that RA-RhoGAP is activated by Rap1 and induces inactivation of Rho, resulting in the neurite outgrowth. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—V12Rap1B, in which a glycine residue (Gly) at 12 amino acid (aa) residue of bovine Rap1B was replaced by a valine (Val), was prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). V12Rap1B (aa 1–172) was subcloned into a pBTM116 bait vector; the expressed fusion protein contains a LexA DNA-binding domain. The yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using a human brain cDNA library (Clontech) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40. Approximately 5.7 × 106 clones were screened for HIS3 and β-galactosidase expression as described (28Kohno H. Tanaka K. Mino A. Umikawa M. Imamura H. Fujiwara T. Fujita Y. Hotta K. Qadota H.

Construction of Expression Vectors—KIAA1391/RA-RhoGAP cDNA was obtained from Dr. Takahiro Nagase at the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan). Mammalian expression vectors were constructed in pCMV-FLAG (29Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol.

Constructs of RA-RhoGAP contained the following aa: pCMV-FLAG-RA-RhoGAP, aa 1–1194; pCMV-FLAG-RA-RhoGAP-ΔRA, aa 200–349 deletion. The cDNA for a GAP activity-defective mutant, RA-RhoGAP-R399A, in which arginine (Arg) at 399 aa residue was replaced to alanine (Ala), was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and subcloned into pCMV-FLAG vector. The pEF-BOS-myc-Rap1GAP was constructed (30Fukuyama T. Ogita H. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara T. Yamada T. Sato T. Shimizu K. Nakamura T. Matsuda Takai Y. J. Biol.

Matsuda (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). pEGFP-C1 was from Clontech. Antibodies—The GST fusion fragment of RA-RhoGAP (aa 793–994) was produced in Escherichia coli, purified, and used as an antigen to raise a polyclonal antibody (pAb) in rabbit. The rabbit anti-RA-RhoGAP pAb was affinity purified by using MBP-RA-RhoGAP (aa 793–994) immobilized on amino-link agarose beads (Pierce). A mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (mAb) and a mouse anti-β-tubulin mAb were purchased from Sigma. A mouse anti-actin mAb was purchased from Chemicon International. Quantification of Neurites—After cultured in DMEM with or without 8CPT-cAMP for 48 h, NG108 cells were processed for immunocytochemistry (15Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Izumi G. Yasumi M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Images were captured using a Bio-Rad confocal laser scanning microscope using a 60× oil immersion objective lens (model Radiance 2000; Bio-Rad). Collected data were exported as 8-bit TIFF files and processed using Adobe Photoshop Software. The assay for neurite outgrowth was performed on 40–60 cells randomly chosen in each group. The number of primary neurites per cell was defined as the number of thin cell processes with a length longer than one cell diameter. The length of individual neurites for each cell was measured by use of the NIH image software. Neurite length was defined as the traced distance from the neurite tip to the point where neurite emanated from the cell body. Neurite length encompasses all visible parts of a neurite without the length of its branches. β-Tubulin-positive collaterals were counted as brances. Collaterals longer than one cell diameter were counted as branches. The statistical significance of differences between each group was analyzed by the two-tailed Student's t test. Pull-down Assay for Binding of Rap1 to RA-RhoGAP—To determine the GTP-dependent and substrate-specific binding of Rap1B to RA-RhoGAP, HEK293 cells were transfected with pCMV-FLAG-RA-RhoGAP or pCMV-FLAG-RA-RhoGAP-ΔRA. After 48-h incubation, the cells were harvested, homogenized in Buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant (the soluble fraction) was incubated with the glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) carrying immobilized GST-Rap1B or GST-Ha-Ras preloaded with GTPγS or GDP as described (34Machida N. Umikawa M. Takei K. Sakima N. Myagmar B.E. Taira K. Uezato H. Ogawa Y. Kariya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15711-15714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in the SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris/HCl at pH 6.7, 3% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) for 10 min. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG mAb. Rho GAP Assay—GAP assay was performed as described (35Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y.

Lipid-modified RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 (3 pmol) was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in a reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% CHAPS, and 1.5 μm [γ-32P]GTP (1 × 104 cpm/pmol). The reaction was stopped by adding 2.5 μl of 80 mm MgCl2. To this mixture (12.5 μl), the sample containing His-RA-RhoGAP (0.1 pmol) and the GDPβS- or GTPγS-bound form of Rap1B (0.5 pmol) was added in a total volume of 50 μl and further incubated at 30 °C for the indicated periods of time. The mixture was applied to a nitrocellulose filter, and the radioactivity retained on the filter was measured by Cerenkov counting. Pull-down Assay for the GTP-bound form of Rho—The pull-down assay was performed as described (30Fukuyama T. Ogita H. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara T. Yamada T. Sato T. Shimizu K. Nakamura T. Matsuda Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 815-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). NG108 cells were transiently co-transfected with pEFBOS-myc-RhoA wild-type and various constructs of RA-RhoGAP, and cultured for 24 h. The cells were then washed with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and lysed in Buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate). The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected as the cell lysates. The cell lysate (600 μg of protein) was incubated with GST-rhotekin Rho-binding domain (RBD) (30 μg) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (50 μl) for 1 h. After the beads were washed three times with Buffer B, the GTP-bound form of RhoA was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-RhoA mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Knock-down of RA-RhoGAP by the RNA Interference (RNAi) Method— The mammalian expression vector, pBS-H1 (38Yamada A. Irie K. Hirota T. Ooshio T. Fukuhara A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6016-6027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), was used for expression of small interfering RNA in NG108 cells. The following inserts were used: RA-RhoGAP gene-specific insert was a 21-nucleotide sequence corresponding to nucleotides 434–454 (5′-AGAGATACATCGCTCTAGAAA-3′) of RA-RhoGAP cDNA, which was separated by a 10-nucleotide non-complementary spacer (5′-TTGATATCCG-3′) from the reverse complement of the same 21-nucleotide sequence. A control (Scramble) insert was a 21-nucleotide sequence (5′-TCTAAGTCAGGCATAACAAGA-3′) with no significant homology to any mammalian gene sequence, which was separated by a 10-nucleotide non-complementary spacer (5′-TTGATATCCG-3′) from the reverse complement of the same 21-nucleotide sequence. Requirement of Inactivation of Rho in the Rap1-induced Neurite Outgrowth—To analyze the functional relationship between Rap1 and Rho in the neurite outgrowth, we first performed gain- and loss-of-function experiments using a neuroblastoma cell line, NG108 cells, which are known to be differentiated into neuron-like cells by the action of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) (39Nirenberg M. Wilson S. Higashida H. Rotter A. Krueger K. Busis N. Ray R. Kenimer J.G. Adler M. Science. 1983; 222: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). NG108 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a morphological marker along with other proteins to be tested. A constitutively active mutant of Rap1B (V12Rap1B: Rap1B-CA) enhanced neurite outgrowth in NG108 cells (Fig. 1A). Statistically, the number, length, and branching of neurites of the cells transfected with Rap1B-CA were more than those of the control cells transfected with GFP alone (Fig. 1B). It has been shown that a constitutively active mutant of RhoA (V14RhoA: RhoA-CA) inhibits the Bt2cAMP-induced neurite outgrowth, whereas C3, a potent Rho-inhibiting enzyme, enhances neurite outgrowth in NG108 cells (13Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 15Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Izumi G. Yasumi M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Rap1B-induced neurite outgrowth was reduced by co-expression with RhoA-CA. 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (8CPT-cAMP), an activator of Epac, a Rap1GEF, enhanced neurite outgrowth in NG108 cells as described for PC12 cells (18Christensen A.E. Selheim F. de Rooij J. Dremier S. Schwede F. Dao K.K. Martinez A. Maenhaut C. Bos J.L. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35394-35402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). This 8CPT-cAMP-induced neurite outgrowth was reduced by overexpression of Rap1GAP in NG108 cells, and this inhibitory effect of Rap1GAP was rescued by co-expression with C3. To neglect the possibility that the rescue effect of C3 (inactivation of Rho) on the neurite outgrowth is attributable to activation of Rap1, Rac, or Cdc42, we examined the effect of inactivation of Rap1, Rac, or Cdc42 on the C3-induced neurite outgrowth. Co-expression of Rap1GAP, an enzyme hydrolyzing the GTP-bound form of Rap1 and inactivating it, did not affect the C3-induced neurite outgrowth (supplemental Fig. 1). Co-expression of a dominant negative mutant of Rac did not affect the C3-induced neurite outgrowth. Co-expression of N-WASP-CRIB, a specific inhibitor of the GTP-bound form of Cdc42, did not affect the C3-induced neurite outgrowth. Thus, the rescue effect of C3 on the neurite outgrowth is mediated by inactivating Rho, not by activating Rap1, Rac, or Cdc42, in NG108 cells. These results indicate that the Rap1-induced neurite outgrowth requires inactivation of Rho, and Rap1 may be an upstream regulator of Rho in the neurite outgrowth. Identification of RA-RhoGAP as a Connector between Rap1 and Rho— To identify a molecule which connects these two small G proteins, we performed the yeast two-hybrid screening using a human brain cDNA library with Rap1B-CA as a bait. We isolated several clones, one of which encoded a partial fragment (aa 96–382) of a human KIAA1391/ARHGAP20 gene, which has the RA and GAP domains in addition to the PH and annexin-like repeat domains (24Katoh M. Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 23: 1471-1476PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The mouse and rat counterparts were also deposited in GenBank™ and termed RA-RhoGAP (RhoGAP having the RA domain) (27Curry B.J. Su H. Law E.G. McLaughlin E.A. Nixon B. Aitken R.J. Genomics. 2004; 84: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, their biological or biochemical properties have not been studied. We used the same terminology but RA-RhoGAP means Rap-activated RhoGAP. We then confirmed the binding of Rap1 to RA-RhoGAP in a pull-down assay using recombinant proteins. FLAG-tagged full-length RA-RhoGAP (FLAG-RA-RhoGAP) bound to the GST fusion protein of Rap1B (GST-Rap1B) but not to the GST fusion protein of Ha-Ras (GST-Ha-Ras) (Fig. 2B). FLAG-RA-RhoGAP bound the GTPγS-bound form of GST-Rap1B preferentially to the GDP-bound form of GST-Rap1B. To confirm the binding of Rap1B to RA-RhoGAP through the RA domain, we generated the RA domain (Rap1B-binding region)-truncated mutant of RA-RhoGAP, RA-RhoGAP-ΔRA, as shown in Fig. 2A. RA-RhoGAP-ΔRA did not bind either the GTPγS-bound form of GST-Rap1B or the GDP-bound form of GST-Rap1B. These results indicate that RA-RhoGAP binds Rap1 specifically through the RA domain and that the binding is GTP-dependent. Tissue Distribution and Localization of RA-RhoGAP in the Growth Cone of the Neurite—We made an anti-RA-RhoGAP pAb and examined the tissue distribution of RA-RhoGAP in rat by use of this pAb. Immunoblot analysis revealed that RA-RhoGAP was dominantly expressed in the brain, the liver, and the testis (Fig. 3A). We next examined the localization of RA-RhoGAP in Bt2cAMP-induced differentiated NG108 cells. NG108 cells were fixed after being cultured in DMEM with Bt2cAMP for 24 h and stained with the combinations of the anti-RA-RhoGAP pAb and an anti-β-tubulin mAb. The immunofluorescence signal for RA-RhoGAP was found in the cell body and the growth cones of neurites (Fig. 3B). Enhancement of GAP Activity of RA-RhoGAP by Rap1—To examine whether RA-RhoGAP indeed shows RhoGAP activity, we first generated recombinant proteins of RA-RhoGAP and its truncated and point mutants as shown in Fig. 4A. His-tagged full-length RA-RhoGAP (His-RA-RhoGAP) showed GAP activity toward RhoA, while it showed much less effect on Rac or Cdc42 (Fig. 4B). The GTPγS-bound form of Rap1B enhanced the RA-RhoGAP activity, whereas the GDPβS-bound form of Rap1B was less effective (Fig. 4C). The apparent Ka value of the GTPγS-bound form of Rap1B for His-RA-RhoGAP (the concentration necessary for the half-maximal activation) was about 10 nm (data not shown). These results indicate that RA-RhoGAP is a direct downstream target of Rap1. In addition, His-RA-RhoGAP-ΔRA showed more potent RhoGAP activity than wild-type His-RA-RhoGAP. The activity of His-RA-RhoGAP-ΔRA was similar to that of wild-type His-RA-RhoGAP which bound the GTPγS-bound form of Rap1B. In addition, the GAP activity of RA-RhoGAP-ΔRA was not affected by the presence of the GTPγS-bound form of Rap1B. To confirm the GAP activity of RA-RhoGAP through the RhoGAP domain, we generated a GAP activity defective mutant, RA-RhoGAP-R399A, as shown in Fig. 4A. Both His-RA-RhoGAP-R399A and His-RA-RhoGAP-ΔRA-R399A abolished their GAP activity toward RhoA. These results suggest that the RA domain inhibits the GAP activity of the GAP domain and that when the RA domain binds Rap1, this inhibitory effect is released to induce the full activation of RA-RhoGAP. Involvement of RA-RhoGAP in the Neurite Outgrowth in a Manner Dependent on its GAP Activity—We then examined whether RA-RhoGAP is indeed involved in the neurite outgrowth regulated by Rap1 and Rho in NG108 cells. Expression of RA-RhoGAP enhanced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 5A). Statistically, the number, length, and branching of neurites of the cells transfected with RA-RhoGAP were more than those of the control cells transfected with GFP alone (Fig. 5B). The RA-RhoGAP-induced neurite outgrowth was further enhanced by co-expression with Rap1B-CA. These effects of Rap1B-CA and RA-RhoGAP are selectively on undifferentiated NG108 cells but not on differentiated NG108 cells already bearing neurites (supplemental Fig. 2). Rap1 and RA-RhoGAP seem to be mainly involved in the early phase of neurite formation (neurite sprouting) in the undifferentiated cells. Expression of RA-RhoGAP-ΔRA enhanced neurite outgrowth to extents more than those induced by wild-type RA-RhoGAP alone and similar to those induced by wild-type RA-RhoGAP and Rap1B-CA. Expression of RA-RhoGAP-ΔRA-R399A did not enhance the neurite outgrowth. The effect of RA-RhoGAP on the neurite outgrowth is dependent on its GAP activity. Under these conditions, we performed Rho-GTP pull-down assays to further confirm the level of the GTP-bound form of RhoA altered in the presence of Rap1B-CA, RA-RhoGAP, or both together in vivo. We carefully titrated RA-RhoGAP expression levels of each sample and performed the pull-down assay. Rap1B-CA alone was sufficient to cause a decrease in the amount of the GTP-bound form of RhoA in NG108 cells (Fig. 6). RA-RhoGAP alone caused a significant decrease in the amount of the GTP-bound form of RhoA. RA-RhoGAP together with Rap1B-CA and RA-RhoGAP-ΔRA more potently caused a decrease in the amount of the GTP-bound form of RhoA than RA-RhoGAP or Rap1B-CA alone. RA-RhoGAP-ΔRA-R399A indeed abolished its GAP activity toward RhoA. These results are consistent with those of the cell level experiments as shown in Fig. 5. These results indicate that RA-RhoGAP is involved in the neurite outgrowth dependent on its GAP activity which is regulated by Rap1. Involvement of RA-RhoGAP in the 8CPT-cAMP-induced Neurite Outgrowth—To confirm that RA-RhoGAP is involved in the 8CPT-cAMP-induced neurite outgrowth, we examined the effect of RA-RhoGAP and RA-RhoGAP-R399A, a GAP activity-defective mutant, on the 8CPT-cAMP-induced neurite outgrowth in NG108 cells. RA-RhoGAP enhanced the 8CPT-cAMP-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 7). In contrast, RA-RhoGAP-R399A reduced the 8CPT-cAMP-induced neurite outgrowth. Thus, the GAP activity of RA-RhoGAP is required for the 8CPT-cAMP-induced neurite outgrowth. These data are another line of evidence supporting our argument that RA-RhoGAP is involved in the neurite outgrowth in NG108 cells. Involvement of RA-RhoGAP in the Neurite Outgrowth Downstream of Rap1—In the last set of experiments, to further confirm that RA-RhoGAP is involved in the neurite outgrowth downstream of Rap1, we performed a loss-of-function analysis by use of the RNAi method. We knocked down endogenous RA-RhoGAP by the RNAi method (Fig. 8Aa). RA-RhoGAP knocked down cells reduced the Rap1B-CA-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 8Ab). Statistically, the number, length, and branching of neurites of the cells transfected with RA-RhoGAP siRNA and Rap1B-CA were less than those of the control cells transfected with scramble RNA and Rap1B-CA (Fig. 8B). Taken together, these results indicate that RA-RhoGAP transduces a signal from Rap1 to Rho and is involved in the neurite outgrowth regulated by Rap1 and Rho. Many downstream targets of Rap1 have been identified: they include Raf1, B-Raf, RalGDS, afadin/AF-6, PI3-kinase, and RAPL (40Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 41Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 42Kinashi T. Katagiri K. Immunol. Lett. 2004; 93: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 43Price L.S. Bos J.L. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1007-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Raf and B-Raf are protein kinases connecting Ras small G protein to ERK; RalGDS is a regulator of another small G protein Ral; afadin/AF-6 is an actin filament- and nectin-binding protein at adherens junctions; PI 3-kinase is a phosphatidylinositol kinase, and RAPL is a small protein that transduces a signal from Rap1 to integrin. In this study, we have identified RA-RhoGAP as another direct downstream target of Rap1. RA-RhoGAP has the RA and GAP domains in addition to the PH and annexin-like repeat domains. It indeed shows a GAP activity specific for Rho and this GAP activity is enhanced by the GTP-bound form of Rap1. The RA domain (the Rap1-binding region)-deficient truncated form of RA-RhoGAP, RA-RhoGAP-ΔRA, shows more potent RhoGAP activity than the wild type, suggesting that the RA domain negatively regulates the RhoGAP activity. In the steady state, RA-RhoGAP is likely to form a closed conformation by an intramolecular interaction between the RA domain and the RhoGAP domain and thereby negatively regulates the RhoGAP activity. In the active state, the binding of Rap1 to the RA domain may reduce the intramolecular interaction and stabilize an open conformation of RA-RhoGAP. We have then shown here that RA-RhoGAP is dominantly expressed in the brain and localizes at the growth cones of extending neurites of NG108 cells and that RA-RhoGAP indeed transduces a signal from Rap1 to Rho and inactivates Rho. It has been shown that repression of the Rho-mediated signaling pathway induces rapid actin depolymerization of the growth cone and thereby extends the incipient neurite further (13Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 14Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Consistently, we have shown here that the Rap1-induced, RA-RhoGAP-mediated inactivation of Rho enhances neurite outgrowth of NG108 cells. It has been proposed that the localization and activation of Rap1B determine which neurite will be a single elongated axon (19Schwamborn J.C. Püschel A.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is likely that, during the initiation of the neurite formation, a neurite formation signal(s) may recruit and activate Rap1 to a growth cone of the nascent neurite, and that RA-RhoGAP may subsequently be recruited and activated by Rap1 to cause the inactivation of Rho there. Thus, the Rap1-RA-RhoGAP-Rho system could serve as a positional signal in neurite outgrowth. Rap1 is activated by RapGEFs, and many RapGEFs have been identified: they include C3G regulated by Crk adaptor protein, Epacs regulated by cAMP, CalDAG-GEFs regulated by diacylglycerol and Ca2+, and PDZ-GEFs regulated by unknown factor(s) (40Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). It remains unknown which RapGEF is involved in the activation of Rap1 to induce the neurite outgrowth, but the recruitment of a Rap1GEF to the growth cone may be required primarily. It remains unknown how Rap1GEF is recruited to the growth cone, but several Rap1GEFs have been reported to respond to various signaling cascades including integrin-mediated cell adhesion, cAMP siganling, exocytosis, intracellular levels of Ca2+, synaptic plasticity, and cell-cell adhesion formation (40Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 45Caron E. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase and its lipid product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate have also been shown to play instructive roles in neurite outgrowth and neuronal polarization (46Shi S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 47Aoki K. Nakamura T. Fujikawa K. Matsuda M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2207-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Several diffusible factors, including chemoattractants, neurotrophins, transmitters, and cell adhesion molecules, may cause activation of PI 3-kinase and accumulation at the leading edge of the growth cone, resulting in recruiting the group of PH domain-containing proteins there. After the PI 3-kinase activation at the growth cone, an unidentified Rap1GEF containing the PH domain might be recruited to activate the Rap1-RA-RhoGAP-Rho system, eventually causing neurite outgrowth. The interaction between Rap1 and another RA domain-containing protein, RA-GEF/PDZ-GEF, has been shown to regulate the localization of RA-GEF/PDZ-GEF (44Liao Y. Satoh T. Gao X. Jin T.G. Hu C.D. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28478-28483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Expressed RA-RhoGAP-ΔRA localized at the growth cones of neurites and the cell body in NG108 cells (supplemental Fig. 3). The localization of expressed RA-RhoGAP-ΔRA was apparently similar to that of expressed RA-RhoGAP. Thus, in contrast to the case of RA-GEF/PDZ-GEF, the localization of RA-RhoGAP seems to be determined in a RA domain-independent manner. In summary, we have described here that a novel signaling pathway, the Rap1-RA-RhoGAP-Rho pathway, plays an important role in the neurite outgrowth. Download .pdf (.11 MB) Help with pdf files"

This ionic interaction is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds from Ser-65, Thr-158, Thr-162, and a conserved water-mediated contact. This alternating ionic bridge interaction between negatively and positively charged residues stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonding we have named an electron-sharing network.

Kinetic studies demonstrate that the mutation of electron-sharing network residues results in a decreased ability to lower the pKa of the thiol group of glutathione. Although the residues that contribute to the electron-sharing network are not conserved in the primary sequence, structural characterizations indicate that the presence of the network can be mapped to the same region in all GST classes. A structural diversification but functional conservation suggests a significant role for the electron-sharing network in catalysis as the purpose was maintained during the divergent evolution of GSTs.

The enzyme catalyzes the nucleophilic addition of the glutathione (GSH) sulfhydryl group to electrophilic centers of such organic compounds. The glutathione conjugates formed are rendered more water soluble, thereby facilitating their eventual elimination (3Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. CRC Crit. Rev.

GSTs possess a high specificity for glutathione as the nucleophile but exhibit broad specificity with regard to structurally diverse electrophilic second substrates. Individual classes of GSTs exhibit overlapping but distinct hydrophobic substrate and ligand binding specificities while retaining a high specificity toward the thiol substrate glutathione. Hence, a step of the activation of GSH by deprotonation of the thiol group to enhance the nucleophilicity for reaction with diverse types of electrophilic centers is crucial for the enzymatic catalysis. This thiol deprotonation results from the lowering of the pKa of the thiol group of the enzyme-bound GSH from 9.0 to between 6.0 and 6.9, which causes a 200-300-fold rate acceleration at physiological pH (6Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 20Wilce M.C.J. Parker M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Many of the mechanistic investigations of GSTs have emphasized the importance of a conserved tyrosine or serine residue at the glutathione binding site of certain GSTs (Tyr-8 for Pi, Tyr-9 for Alpha, Tyr-6 for Mu, and Ser-9 for Delta class) in facilitating the thiol deprotonation (10Caccuri A.M.

The hydroxyl group of this tyrosine or serine residue that is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the thiol group of enzyme-bound glutathione is considered to be required for the correct orientation and stabilization of the deprotonated thiolate anion in the active site (10Caccuri A.M.

Apart from the foregoing, several experimental observations have implicated an alternative mechanism named “base-assisted deprotonation” (25Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Nicotra M. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Widersten M. Björnestedt R. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7731-7742Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This model has been proposed on the basis of the function of the glutamyl α-carboxylate of glutathione as a catalytic base that accepts the thiol proton from the thiol group. In this regard, it has become apparent that apart from the thiol group, the α-carboxylate of the Glu residue is also a crucial functional group of the glutathione contributing to the catalytic mechanism. It has been reported that an alternative thiol substrate in which the glutamyl part of the tripeptide was decarboxylated (GABA-Cys-Gly) displayed a large decrease in the catalytic efficiency of GSTA1-1 using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as the electrophilic substrate (28Gustafsson A. Pettersson P.L. Grehn L. Jemth P. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15835-15845Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The decrease was postulated to be partially due to a raised pKa value of the active site-bound thiol group of glutathione resulting in an inability of the enzyme to promote ionization of decarboxylated GSH. Introduction of a carboxylate in the glutathione binding site of the enzyme in a location generally occupied by the glutamyl α-carboxylate partially rescued the activity lost by the deletion of the α-carboxylate from glutathione, as the ability to ionize the thiol was improved. Recent studies in the Anopheles dirus GSTD3-3 (adGSTD3-3) have provided information bearing on the base-assisted deprotonation model (29Winayanuwattikun P. Ketterman A.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the pKa value of the active site-bound GSH of a mutant, where the Arg-66 that directly interacts with the glutamyl α-carboxylate was changed into alanine, was shifted ∼1 pH unit toward higher pH values. The positively charged Arg-66 would provide a counter ion that helps stabilize the α-carboxylate, thereby facilitating ionization of the thiol. Observations on the active site structure have provided a further insight into the enzyme catalysis (30Oakley A.J. Harnnoi T. Udomsinprasert R. Jirajaroenrat K. Ketterman A.J. Wilce M.C.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2176-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The configuration of the glutamyl α-carboxylate group of glutathione, together with the G-site residues Ser-65, Arg-66, Asp-100, Thr-158, and Thr-162 makes possible an electron-sharing network for the distribution of a charge that could be in the form of either a proton or an electron. The aim of the present study is to ascertain the validity of this proposed electron-sharing network. Our study shows that the electron-sharing network helps promote the ionization of the thiol group of GSH through the base-assisted deprotonation model. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The plasmid pET3a-adgstD3, previously described (31Jirajaroenrat K. Pongjaroenkit S. Krittanai C. Prapanthadara L. Ketterman A.J. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), was used to generate the mutants via PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. The proposed residues Ser-65, Arg-66, Asp-100, Thr-158, Thr-162, and Thr-158/Thr-162 were substituted with Ala by using the mutagenic primers that have been designed according to the 5′- and 3′-sequence of the adgstD3 wild type gene (GenBank™ accession number AF273039). Each mutant was randomly screened by restriction digestion analysis. Mutant plasmids could be distinguished from the template by digestion with the restriction enzyme corresponding to the restriction recognition site introduced by the mutagenic primers. The full-length GST coding sequences of the plasmids carrying S65A, R66A, D100A, T158A, T162A, and T158A/T162A mutations were verified by the dideoxy chain termination method. Heterologous Expression and Purification—The proteins were expressed from the pET3a-adgstD3 vector in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)pLysS. The cells were grown to A600 = 0.5, and expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-galactopyranoside. Following induction for 3 h, cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed using sonication. The soluble recombinant GST proteins were purified by GSTrap affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) or S-hexylglutathione-agarose (Sigma) affinity chromatography in the case of low affinity toward the glutathione ligand. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). The results showed that all mutant enzymes, S65A, R66A, D100A, Thr158Ala, T162A, and T158A/T162A were successfully expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Steady-state Kinetics—Steady-state kinetics were studied for wild type and mutant enzymes at varying concentrations of CDNB and GSH in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The reaction was monitored at 340 nm, ϵ = 9600 m-1 cm-1. Apparent kinetic constants, kcat, Km, and kcat/Km were determined by fitting the collected data to a Michaelis-Menten equation by non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA). pH Dependence of Kinetic Constants—The pH dependence of kcat/KmCDNB was obtained as stated above by recording the enzymatic reaction in the following buffers: 0.1 m sodium acetate buffers (from pH 5.0-5.5) and 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (from pH 6.0-8.5). The control studies showed that the affinity of the enzyme toward GSH does not change in the pH range utilized. pKa values were obtained by fitting the data to equation y = ylim/(1 + 10pKa-pH) (10Caccuri A.M.

Fluoride/Chloride Leaving Group Substitution—The second order kinetic constants at pH 6.5 for the spontaneous reaction of GSH with CDNB and FDNB (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) and the catalytic center activities at pH 6.5 for adGSTD3-3 with CDNB and FDNB as cosubstrates were obtained as described previously (33Caccuri A.M. Ascenzi P. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Battistoni A. Mazzetti P. Ricci G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 200: 1428-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Substrate Specificity—The specific activities of the enzymes were determined by spectrophotometer with five different substrates: CDNB, 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene, ethacrynic acid, PNPBr (p-nitrophenethyl bromide), and p-nitrobenzyl chloride as previously described (34Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the results showed that there is no detectable activity for all recombinant enzymes toward PNPBr as a cosubstrate. Viscosity Effect on the Kinetic Parameters—The effect of viscosity on kinetic parameters was obtained by using 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, with varying glycerol concentrations. Viscosity values (η) at 25 °C were calculated as previously described (35Wolf A.V. Brown M.G. Prentiss P.G. Weast R.C. Astle M.J. Beyer W.H. Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: D219-D269Google Scholar). Half-life Determination—The thermal stability assay was performed to determine half-life of the GST proteins at 45 °C. The wild type and mutant enzymes were incubated at 45 °C at the protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. The inactivation time courses were determined by withdrawing suitable aliquots at the different time points for assay of remaining activity to calculate half-life of the enzyme. Steady-state kinetic constants were obtained with varying concentrations of glutathione and CDNB substrate. Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis was performed using non-linear regression (Table I). All the mutants showed increased Km values for glutathione, except T158A and T162A, which are third sphere residues. In particular, the mutants S65A, R66A, D100A, and T158A/T162A showed Km increases in the range of 5-21-fold. Conversely, no significant differences were found in Km values for CDNB substrate, except for D100A, which was ∼4-fold higher, when compared with the wild type enzyme.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters and pKa values for the thiol group of GSH of wild type and mutants of adGSTD3-3 for the CDNB conjugation reaction at pH 6.5 and 25 °C The enzyme activities were measured at varying concentrations of CDNB and GSH in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The pKa was obtained by using 0.1 m sodium acetate buffers (from pH 5.0 to 5.5) and 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (from pH 6.0 to 8.5).

The remaining enzymes showed the catalytic center activity to be decreased to ∼20-50% lower than wild type. The pH dependence of kcat/KmCDNB should reflect a kinetically relevant ionization of the GST·GSH complex. Therefore, an apparent pKa value of 6.36 was determined for the wild type GST enzyme (Fig. 1). Then, to characterize the influence of the proposed electron-sharing network on GSH thiol ionization, the pKa values for these mutant enzymes were measured by this kinetic approach (Table I). Each of the alanine mutations at the proposed network residues exhibited an increase in pKa for the bound GSH ranging from ∼0.5-1.1 pH unit higher than that found for the wild type. It is well established that the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions precede through a σ-complex intermediate (36Chen W.-J. Graminski G.F. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, the rate-limiting formation of a spontaneous σ-complex intermediate can be increased by substitution of chlorine in the CDNB molecule with fluorine, which is more electronegative. With regard to the results, the ratio of the catalytic rate of GSH with FDNB and CDNB was comparable with the ratio of the second-order rate constants for the spontaneous uncatalyzed reaction. That is, kcatFDNB/kcatCDNB = 40 is similar to kcFDNB/kcCDNB = 47, which indicates that the σ-complex formation is the rate-limiting step. Though the kcat of the GST variants reflected different sensitivity to the nature of the leaving group, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) was nearly unchanged (Table II). Therefore it appears that an alteration of the relative turnover number is a consequence of changes in binding affinity toward different substrate leaving groups rather than a reflection of the rate of σ-complex formation.Table IIEffect of fluoride/chloride leaving group substitution on the rate of catalysis The ratio of kinetic constants for the conjugation reaction catalyzing by adGSTD3-3 enzymes of GSH with CDNB and FDNB as cosubstrates was calculated at pH 6.5.EnzymekcatFDNB/kcatCDNB(kcat/Km)FDNB/(kcat/Km)CDNBWild type2.40 ± 0.086.72 ± 0.34S65A5.28 ± 0.258.71 ± 1.48R66A5.57 ± 0.474.04 ± 0.77D100A8.40 ± 0.1810.9 ± 0.69T158A2.08 ± 0.079.56 ± 0.68T162A1.77 ± 0.0512.3 ± 0.62T158A/T162A1.91 ± 0.0412.3 ± 2.77 Open table in a new tab The next step was to observe the effect of viscosity on kinetic parameters to study the rate-determining step of the catalytic reaction. A decrease of the rate constant by increasing the medium viscosity should reflect the weight of diffusion events on catalysis (37Johnson W.W. Liu S. Ji X. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11508-11511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It would indicate that the rate-limiting step is related to diffusion-controlled motions of the protein or the dissociation of the product. A plot of the reciprocal of the relative catalytic constant (kcato/kcat) against the relative viscosity (η/ηo) should be linear. The slope should be equal to unity when the product release or structural transition is limited by a strictly diffusional barrier. If the slope approaches zero, either the chemistry or another non-diffusion barrier is rate-limiting. For adGSTD3-3 wild type, a plot of the inverse relative rate constant (kcato/kcat) versus the relative viscosity (η/ηo) gives a linear dependence with a slope (1.14 ± 0.01) very close to unity (Fig. 2). In contrast, the R66A mutant yields plots fully viscosity independent with a slope approaching zero. The other mutants, S65A, D100A, T158A, T162A, and T158A/T162A, exhibited kcat values with different degrees of viscosity dependence compared with the wild type enzyme. The activity of the enzymes toward various hydrophobic substrates revealed that the specificity or the interactions with these substrates differed (Fig. 3). This result suggests that changes in the electron-sharing network residues cause a rearrangement of the active site, resulting in changes in the topology of the active site pocket and/or the ability of the responsible residues in the active site pocket of the enzyme to interact with hydrophobic substrates by an induced-fit mechanism (26Tan K.-L.

The heat inactivation assay for adGSTD3-3 wild type was performed at different temperatures and demonstrated that the GST activity began to decrease at 45 °C (39Wongtrakul J. Udomsinprasert R. Ketterman A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This temperature was used to determine half-life stabilities for the mutant enzymes. The half-life corresponds to the time of preincubation when the mutant enzymes still have 50% remaining activity. All mutant enzymes, except R66A and T162A, showed no significant difference in half-life compared with the wild type (Table III). The R66A mutant enzyme was more stable than wild type by ∼60-fold. In contrast, the alanine replacement at the Thr-162 position decreased the stability of the enzyme to ∼7 times lower than the wild type.Table IIIThermal stability of wild type and mutants of adGSTD3-3 at 45 °C The wild type and mutant enzymes were incubated at 45 °C at the protein concentration of 1 mg/ml.

These three functional groups appear to form a resonance motif that is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds between Ser-65, Thr-158, Thr-162, and a conserved water-mediated contact (Fig. 5). To test the hypothesis of this electron-sharing network involvement in enzyme catalysis, the five G-site residues forming the network, Ser-65, Arg-66, Asp-100, Thr-158, and Thr-162, were replaced with alanine.Fig. 5Schematic representation of the electron-sharing network in adGSTD3-3. The proposed electron-sharing network is composed of an ionic bridge interaction between the negatively charged glutamyl α-carboxylate group of glutathione, the positively charged Arg-66, and the negatively charged Asp-100.

The motif appears to be stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds involving Ser-65, Thr-158, Thr-162, and a conserved water-mediated contact (dotted line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The kinetic studies demonstrated that the mutations reduced kcat, which resulted from a disruption of the electron distribution network. A dramatic decrease in enzyme activity was observed for the alanine replacements at Arg-66 and Asp-100. We propose that Arg-66 and Asp-100 are key residues in this network because they generate an ionic bridge that is critical to the function of this motif. Lesser effects were observed for the remaining positions, suggesting these results may be due to the loss from the network of several stabilizing hydrogen bonds, as the key residues are still present. The question arose whether the effect on enzyme catalysis was due to a change in the rate-limiting step of the catalytic mechanism. The pH dependence of the kinetic parameters in the binary complex was determined to observe the ionization process. A crucial property of GSTs is their ability to lower the pKa of the thiol group of the bound GSH. The data show that the mutations caused an increase in the pKa values for the key residues, Arg-66 and Asp-100, of ∼1 pH unit. The other network position mutants, Ser-65, Thr-158, and Thr-162, gave increases in pKa of ∼0.5 pH unit when compared with the wild type. This suggests that the ionic bridge interaction and the stabilizing H-bonds of Ser-65, Thr-158, and Thr-162, as well as the water-bridge contact, are important for the ionization process. To test this concept, we engineered the wild type enzyme to introduce a more positively charged histidine into the Thr-158 position to expand the ionic bridge interaction. The kcat of this mutant enzyme, T158H, is nearly two times greater and the pKa of the bound GSH ∼ 0.2 pH unit lower than the wild type (Table I). The viscosity experiment elucidated that the rate-limiting step in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction by adGSTD3-3 is a non-physical step (Fig. 2). The mutatio"

We found previously that inhibition of HGF-induced proliferation in HepG2 hepatoma cells is caused by cell cycle arrest at G1 through a high intensity ERK signal, which represses Cdk2 activity. To examine further the mechanisms of G1 arrest by HGF, we analyzed the Cdk inhibitor p16INK4a, which has an anti-proliferative function through cell cycle arrest at G1. We found that HGF treatment drastically increased endogenous p16 levels. Knockdown of p16 with small interfering RNA reversed the arrest, indicating that the induction of p16 is required for G1 arrest by HGF. Analysis of the promoter of the human p16 gene identified the proximal Ets-binding site as a responsive element for HGF, and this responded to the high intensity ERK signal. HGF treatment of the cells led to a redistribution of p21CIP1 and p27KIP1 from Cdk4 to Cdk2. The redistribution was blocked by the knockdown of p16 with small interfering RNA, which restored the Cdk2 activity repressed by HGF, demonstrating the requirement of p16 induction for the redistribution and eventual repression of Cdk2 activity.

HGF and its high affinity receptor c-Met are widely expressed in normal tissues and are thought to play a key role in the interaction between mesenchymal (the site of HGF expression) and epithelial (the site of c-Met expression) cells (11Rosen E.M.

Among the pleiotropic effects, HGF has opposing effects on cell growth: treatment with HGF inhibits the proliferation of a number of tumor cell lines (14Shima N. Itagaki Y. Nagao M. Yasuda H.

The anti-proliferative effect of HGF is especially important in that it is observed not only in cultured tumor cells, but also in tumors in vivo: administration of HGF decreases the synthesis of DNA in diethylnitrosamine-induced rat liver tumors (23Liu M.-L. Mars W.M. Michalopoulos G.K. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 841-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and c-myc-induced hepatocarcinogenesis is inhibited by HGF in a transgenic mouse model coexpressing c-myc and HGF (24Santoni-Rugiu E.

The anti-proliferative effect of HGF thus seems to be concerned with the control of tumorigenesis, but the mechanism of the effect remains to be elucidated. Because all of the pleiotropic effects of HGF are transduced through the activation of the c-Met receptor, which is known as the c-met proto-oncogene product (25Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L.

Biochem. 2003; 88: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We have investigated the molecular mechanisms of the anti-proliferative effect of HGF and found previously that HGF induces cell cycle arrest at G1 in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. This G1 arrest was shown to be induced through a high intensity ERK signal because the anti-proliferative effect of HGF was suppressed by a low concentration of MEK inhibitor, which reduces the strong activation of ERK to weak activation (32Tsukada Y. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40968-40976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The high intensity ERK signal leads to the repression of Cdk2 (cyclin-dependent kinase-2) kinase activity for pRb, which mainly regulates the proliferation of HepG2 cells (33Tsukada Y. Tanaka T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cdk2 generally controls the transition of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase, and its activity is regulated by phosphorylation, association with cyclins A and E, and association with the CIP/KIP family of Cdk inhibitors (CdkIs) (34Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). HGF down-regulates the expression of cyclin A protein and up-regulates that of p21CIP1 protein in HepG2 cells, suggesting that these changes result in the repression of Cdk2 activity and induction of G1 arrest (33Tsukada Y. Tanaka T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that p21/p27KIP1 proteins are expressed upon treatment of HepG2 cells with HGF and that the induction is accompanied by cell cycle arrest (3Shima N. Stolz D.B. Miyazaki M. Gohda E. Higashio K. Michalopoulos G.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of how CdkIs are involved in cell cycle arrest at G1 by HGF has not been uncovered. In this study, we focused on p16INK4a, which is included in another group of CdkIs, the INK4 family, because p16 has been implicated in cell cycle arrest at G1 in various types of cells. p16 specifically associates with Cdk4 and Cdk6 (36Quelle D.E. Cheng M. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 993-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 37Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar) and keeps them from their binding partners, D-type cyclins. The association of p16 with Cdk4 and Cdk6 thus results in inactivation of the Cdk proteins, accumulation of hypophosphorylated pRb, and eventual G1 arrest of the cell cycle (34Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar, 37Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar). Here, we found that treatment of HepG2 cells with HGF up-regulated p16 mRNA and protein. Overexpression of p16 increased the HepG2 cell population in G1 phase, and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of p16 reversed G1 arrest induced by HGF, suggesting that the induction of p16 by HGF is responsible for the arrest in G1 by HGF. Analysis of the p16 promoter identified the proximal Ets-binding site as a HGF-responsive element. Although p16 is incapable of directly associating with Cdk2, the induction of p16 by HGF was necessary for the repression of Cdk2 activity because siRNA-mediated knockdown of p16 restored the Cdk2 activity repressed by HGF. The HGF treatment led to a redistribution of p21 and p27 from Cdk4 to Cdk2. siRNA-mediated p16 knockdown blocked the redistribution, demonstrating that the induction of p16 is required for the redistribution, which causes inactivation of Cdk2 and leads to G1 arrest. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C as described previously (32Tsukada Y.

They were treated with 4 μg of plasmid mixed with 11.2 μl of jetPEI (Polyplus-transfection) for 24 h, and the medium was replaced with fresh medium. The cells were cultured further in the absence or presence of HGF (50 ng/ml) and were either harvested after trypsinization for flow cytometry or extracted for lysate production. To measure DNA synthesis, at 24 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and reseeded. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR of p16 mRNA—Total RNA was purified with ISOGEN (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's instruction, and 1 μg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using the 1st Strand cDNA synthesis kit with oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). PCR for p16 was performed in a total volume of 50 μl containing 1 μl of the cDNA and 10 pmol of forward primer 5′-AGCACCGGAGGAAGAAAGAGGAG-3′, 10 pmol of reverse primer 5′-AGTTGTGGCCCTGTAGGACCTTC-3′, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 200 mm dNTPs, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 2.5 units of LA Taq polymerase (Takara) with 28 cycles of denaturing (94 °C, 1 min), annealing (60 °C, 1 min), and extension (72 °C, 1 min). PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Experiments conducted using various amounts of input template ensured that the assay was quantitative under these conditions. Construction of a p16 Expression Plasmid—PCR amplification to construct a p16 expression plasmid was performed with a pair of p16-specific oligonucleotide primers (5′-CCAAGCTTAGCATGGAGCCGGCGGC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCAATCGGGGATGTCTGAGGG-3′) and cDNA as described above with 32 cycles of denaturing (94 °C, 1 min), annealing (60 °C, 1 min), and extension (72 °C, 1 min). The amplified cDNA was cloned into the vector pT7Blue (Novagen), and its sequence was confirmed. The entire coding sequence of p16 was inserted into the BamHI and Hind III sites of pcDNA3. Cell Proliferation Assay—Following replacement of the medium after transfection as described above, the cells were cultured and harvested at specific time points after trypsinization. The number of cells was counted with a hemocytometer. Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry—Cells were trypsinized and harvested at specific time points after HGF treatment and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. They were incubated in flow reagent (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 1 μg/ml DNase-free RNase (Roche Applied Science)) for an appropriate time period at room temperature. After filtration with a nylon cell strainer (pore size of 70 μm), cell cycle distribution was monitored with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). RNA Interference—p16-targeting siRNA was synthesized according to published data (38Bond J. Jones C. Haughton M. DeMicco C. Kipling D. Wynford-Thomas D. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 292: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Its sense sequence (5′-CGCACCGCCTAGTTACGGT-3′) corresponds to nucleotides 117–135 of the human p16 coding sequence, which is in exon 1α of the INK4a locus. A DNA oligonucleotide containing the sense target sequence, a hairpin loop, and the antisense target sequence was synthesized, annealed, and inserted into a polymerase III-mediated siRNA expression plasmid vector, pSilencer1.0-U6 (Ambion Inc.). The siRNA expression plasmid was transfected as described above. Measuring DNA Synthesis—DNA synthesis was assayed by measuring the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into the genome. Cells were transfected as described above. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and seeded at 5 × 103 in 96-well plates in the absence or presence of HGF. The cells were incubated with 10 μm BrdUrd for 2 h before being harvested, and DNA synthesis was measured with the Biotrak cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (Amersham Biosciences). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody was used at 1:100 dilution, and the resultant immune complexes were quantified by measurements of absorbance after the subsequent reaction with substrate using a microtiter plate spectrophotometer (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland). Luciferase Reporter Assays—A series of p16 promoter constructs containing 5′-truncated promoter regions of the p16 gene (bases –1216 to +1 from the transcription initiation site) fused to the luciferase gene were produced as described previously (39Hara E. Smith R. Parry D. Tahara H. Stone S. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Each promoter construct was cotransfected along with a standard amount of the pSV-β-galactosidase control plasmid (Promega). Transfected cells were stimulated with HGF (50 ng/ml) for 24 h, and cell extracts were prepared with reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed in 20 μl of cell extract with the luciferase assay system kit (Promega) and the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega), respectively, on a microtiter plate multi-label counter (Wallac Oy). Each luciferase activity was normalized to the corresponding β-galactosidase activity. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Ets-binding Sites in the p16 Promoter—Mutations in the p16 promoter were designed based on published data (40Ohtani N. Zebedee Z. Huot T.J. Stinson J.A. Sugimoto M. Ohashi Y. Sharrocks A.D. Peters G. Hara E. Nature. 2001; 409: 1067-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following mutant primers: M1, 5′-GAGGGGGCTCTTCCGCCAGCACCCCATTAAGAAAG-3′; M2, 5′-GAGGGGGCTCTTAAGCCAGCACCGGAGGAAGAAAG-3′; and M3, 5′-GAGGGGGCTCTTAAGCCAGCACCCCATTAAGAAAG-3′. Ets-binding motifs are shown in boldface, and point mutations are underlined. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Cells (2.5 × 105) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature for cross-linking. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.1 volume of 1.25 m glycine. Cells were scraped and collected in a 1.5-ml tube. They were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with ChIP lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.1), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin), and sonicated using a Branson Model 250 sonifier to shear the chromatin. After clarification by centrifugation, the lysate was precleared by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), which had been blocked previously with 1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in ChIP lysis buffer. ChIP lysis buffer was added to the precleared lysate up to 1 ml, and 100 μl was used for control PCR. The aliquot of the rest of the lysate was incubated with 10 μg of anti-Ets1/2 antibody (C-275, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or normal rabbit IgG (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 16 h at 4 °C. After a 1-h incubation with blocked protein A-Sepharose, immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation; washed once with low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.1), and 150 mm NaCl), once with high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.1), and 500 mm NaCl), once with LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0)), and twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA); and incubated for 2 h at 55 °C with 20 μg of proteinase K. The precipitates were eluted three times with 80 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, and 0.01 mg/ml herring sperm DNA) and combined. The eluted samples were incubated for 5 h at 65 °C to reverse cross-links and extracted with phenol/chloroform, followed by precipitation of the DNA in ethanol. The resultant DNA was resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer, and 2 μl was used as a template for PCR with a pair of specific primers flanking the Ets site (5′-TGCTCGGGATTAATAGCACC-3′ and 5′-CTCCATGCTGCCCCGCCG-3′) (40Ohtani N. Zebedee Z. Huot T.J. Stinson J.A. Sugimoto M. Ohashi Y. Sharrocks A.D. Peters G. Hara E. Nature. 2001; 409: 1067-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). PCR was performed with denaturing for 5 min at 95 °C; 34 cycles of denaturing (94 °C, 1 min), annealing (60 °C, 30 s), and amplification (72 °C, 1 min); and extension (72 °C, 10 min). PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Preparation of Cell Extracts—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 200 μl of ice-cold cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 30 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) per 100-mm plate. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration of the precleared cell extract was measured with the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). In Vitro Kinase Assays—Kinase assays were carried out as described by Matsushime et al. (41Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Equal amounts of protein in the precleared cell extracts (250–500 μg of total protein) were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-Cdk2 antibody. Precipitated immune complexes were washed twice with cell lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm Na3VO4, 2 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm EGTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 12 mm MgCl2). Kinase reactions were performed in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.2 μg of full-length pRb (QED Bioscience Inc.), 24 μm ATP, and 0.22 MBq of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of 30 μlof2× Laemmli sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol), and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel after heat denaturation. Phosphorylation of the substrate was visualized by autoradiography. The band intensity on the autoradiogram was quantitated by NIH Image-J software. Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Antibodies used for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were obtained as follows: anti-p16 (H-156), anti-p21 (C-19), anti-p27 (C-19), anti-Cdk2 (M-2), anti-Cdk4 (H-22), and anti-cyclin D2 (C-17) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; α-tubulin antibody (T 9026) from Sigma; and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulins from Amersham Biosciences. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (33Tsukada Y. Tanaka T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). HGF Treatment Induces the Expression of p16INK4a—We have reported previously that HGF treatment induces cell cycle arrest at G1 in HepG2 cells and that this arrest first appears at 48 h after HGF treatment and reaches a maximum by 72 h, at which time >70% of the cells are in G1. Pretreatment with a low concentration (10 μm) of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 prevents cell cycle arrest by HGF, indicating that the effect of HGF is mediated by an intensive activation of the ERK signal (32Tsukada Y. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40968-40976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Tsukada Y. Tanaka T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To examine the expression pattern of a Cdk inhibitor, p16INK4a, we performed a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis with total RNA extracted from HepG2 cells treated with HGF. The level of the p16 transcript increased at 4 h and peaked at 72 h after HGF treatment (Fig. 1A, upper panels). This increase was completely blocked by pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (10 μm) (Fig. 1A, lower panels). Immunoblotting showed that the level of p16 protein increased at 12 h of HGF treatment and that addition of the MEK inhibitor blocked the accumulation of p16 (Fig. 1B). Thus, the increase in p16 mRNA was followed by an increase in the protein. Altered stability of p16 mRNA is unlikely to account for the increase in p16 mRNA because it has been reported that p16 mRNA is stable, with a half-life of >24 h (39Hara E. Smith R. Parry D. Tahara H. Stone S. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Thus, p16 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level through the ERK signal. Increased Expression of p16 Is Responsible for G1 Arrest in HepG2 Cells—It was previously shown that down-regulation of Cdk2 activity primarily contributes to cell cycle arrest by HGF at G1 in HepG2 cells (33Tsukada Y. Tanaka T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because p16 does not bind to Cdk2 and does not directly inhibit Cdk2 activity, we examined whether the increase in p16 expression leads to cell cycle arrest at G1 in HepG2 cells. We transfected a p16 expression plasmid into HepG2 cells and examined cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution. The expression of exogenous p16 peaked at 24 h after transfection, and its level remained essentially unchanged after this point (data not shown). The exogenous p16 level was almost the same as the endogenous p16 level induced by HGF (Fig. 2A). At 24 and 48 h after transfection, the number of HepG2 cells exogenously expressing p16 was smaller than that of untransfected cells (Fig. 2B). Analysis of cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry showed that the elevated p16 expression increased cell numbers in G1 phase and reduced cell numbers in S phase compared with untransfected controls (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the increased expression of p16 contributes to cell cycle arrest at G1 in HepG2 cells. Next, to examine whether the endogenous expression of p16 induced by HGF is actually required for G1 arrest of HepG2 cells induced by HGF, we used the siRNA method. p16 is known to be encoded at the INK4a/ARF locus of the genome, and this locus also encodes another tumor suppressor gene, p14ARF (36Quelle D.E.

Each of their first exons is present in the genome as exons 1α and 1β, but p16 and p14 share common exons, 2 and 3, in which their reading frames are different (36Quelle D.E. Cheng M. Ashmun R.A.

Metazoans encode additional NXF1-related proteins of unknown function, which share homology and domain organization with NXF1. Some mammalian NXF1-related genes are expressed preferentially in the brain and are thought to participate in neuronal mRNA metabolism. To address the roles of NXF1-related factors, we studied the two mouse NXF1 homologues, mNXF2 and mNXF7. In neuronal cells, mNXF2, but not mNXF7, exhibited mRNA export activity similar to that of Tip-associated protein/NXF1. Surprisingly, mNXF7 incorporated into mobile particles in the neurites that contained poly(A) and ribosomal RNA and colocalized with Staufen1-containing transport granules, indicating a role in neuronal mRNA trafficking. Yeast two-hybrid interaction, coimmunoprecipitation, and in vitro binding studies showed that NXF proteins bound to brain-specific microtubule-associated proteins (MAP) such as MAP1B and the WD repeat protein Unrip. Both in vitro and in vivo, MAP1B also bound to NXF export cofactor U2AF as well as to Staufen1 and Unrip. These findings revealed a network of interactions likely coupling the export and cytoplasmic trafficking of mRNA. We propose a model in which MAP1B tethers the NXF-associated mRNA to microtubules and facilitates their translocation along dendrites while Unrip provides a scaffold for the assembly of these transport intermediates.

The best studied family members are the metazoan TAP/NXF1 and their Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue Mex67p, which are essential for general mRNA export from the nucleus and act as direct export receptors by linking their mRNA cargo to the nuclear pore complex. TAP/NXF1 is added to the export-ready messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNP) in a manner that is coupled to splicing via the interactions of its N-terminal region with cofactors such as exonic junction complex components (1Strasser K.

Subsequently, TAP/NXF1 docks the mRNP to the nuclear pore complex via interactions of its C-terminal region with the phenylalanine/glycine-rich repeat domains of nucleoporins, resulting in their translocation to the cytoplasm.

Based on the extensive structural similarity, both within and across species, they are thought, like TAP/NXF1, to be involved in mRNA metabolism. For some of them, such activity has been confirmed by mRNA export assays (human NXF2), whereas the others (such as human NXF3) were inactive (17Herold A. Suyama M. Rodrigues J.P. Braun I.C. Kutay U. Carmo-Fonseca M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8996-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Several proteins were also shown by loss-of-function experiments in Drosophila cultured cells to be nonessential for general mRNA export, suggesting roles that are more specialized than that of TAP/NXF1 (14Herold A. Klymenko T. Izaurralde E. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1768-1780PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the nonessential Caenorhabditis elegans Ce-NXF2 (18Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Bear J. Patenaude D.J. Felber B.K.

Here, we show that mNXF2 has properties similar to these of TAP/NXF1. In contrast, mNXF7 has properties of a cytoplasmic RNA transport factor.

Another NXF-interacting factor identified in this study is Unrip/STRAP, which belongs to a family of WD-repeat proteins (for review, see Ref. 36Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Human Unrip participates in the inhibition of transforming growth factor β signaling by direct binding to its receptor (37Matsuda S. Katsumata R. Okuda T. Yamamoto T. Miyazaki K. Senga T. Machida K. Thant A.A. Nakatsugawa S. Hamaguchi M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 13-17PubMed Google Scholar, 38Datta P.K. Chytil A. Gorska A.E. Moses H.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Unrip also associates with an RNA-binding protein, Unr, which has been implicated in translation regulation and mRNA turnover (40Hunt S.L. Hsuan J.J. Totty N. Jackson R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 41Grosset C. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Sonenberg N. Jacquemin-Sablon H. Shyu A.B. Cell. 2000; 103: 29-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Because WD-repeat proteins are thought to act as scaffolds for the assembly of multiprotein complexes, it is possible that Unrip may facilitate the recruitment of soluble factors onto the NXF-containing mRNP complexes or that it may act by anchoring such complexes to specific subcellular locations. Cell Culture, Fractionation, and Immunofluorescence—Transfections in human 293 or HeLa-derived HLtat cells, luciferase and GFP measurements, DM128 export assays, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity measurements were performed as described previously (42Bear J. Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Tabernero C. Hudson E.A. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6306-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a (N2a) cells (ATCC number CCL-131) were transfected using calcium phosphate or the LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI) protocol. Primary chicken forebrain neurons were isolated, cultured, and transfected by electroporation as described previously (43Martinez C.Y. Hollenbeck P.J. Methods Cell Biol. 2003; 71: 339-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Heidemann S.R. Reynolds M. Ngo K. Lamoureux P. Methods Cell Biol. 2003; 71: 51-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Live cell treatments with colchicine (1 μg/ml), taxol (20 μm), and cytochalasin B (10 μm) were performed for 30-60 min at room temperature. The cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of 293 cells were prepared as described previously (5Zolotukhin A.S. Tan W. Bear J. Smulevitch S. Felber B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3935-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For indirect immunofluorescence, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min. If cells were permeabilized prior to fixation, they were treated with 0.004% digitonin in PBS followed by a 2-min fixation in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS at room temperature. The Alexa 590-, Alexa 488-, or Alexa 320-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used as secondary antibodies. In Situ Hybridization—Cells were grown and transfected in 35-mm glass-bottomed polylysine-coated plates (MatTek, Ashland, MA) fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. After rehydration in PBS, cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS, equilibrated in 2× SSC/40% formamide for 5 min, and hybridized overnight at 37 °C with 5′-biotinylated oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes. Hybridization mixes contained 1 μg/ml probe in 2× SSC, 40% formamide, 1× Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA. Cells were washed twice with 2× SSC and once with 0.2× SSC at room temperature, incubated in blocking solution (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), and stained with Alexa 594-conjugated streptavidin. Recombinant DNA and Proteins—mNXF2 (GenBank™ accession numbers AY017476 and AF490577) and mNXF7 (GenBank™ accession numbers AY266683 and AY260550) are described elsewhere (21Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Tretyakova I. Bear J. Lindtner S. Smulevitch S. Felber B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3855-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mammalian expression plasmids for untagged, HA-, and GFP-tagged mNXF2 and mNXF7 and for GFP-tagged Unrip were constructed as described previously (42Bear J. Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Tabernero C. Hudson E.A. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6306-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The plasmids expressing GFP-TAP/NXF1 and its mutants, GFP-U2AF35 and GFP-U2AF65, were described previously (5Zolotukhin A.S. Tan W. Bear J. Smulevitch S. Felber B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3935-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 42Bear J. Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Tabernero C. Hudson E.A. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6306-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CFP-mNXF7 plasmid was constructed by inserting the mNXF7 coding region in pECFP (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). YFP and HA-Stau1 expression plasmids were a generous gift from M. Kiebler. The MAP1B LC-3XFLAG expression plasmid contains a region encoding the light chain of MAP1B that was inserted into p3XFLAG-CMV-14 (Sigma). The expression plasmids for the Ref and p15-1 proteins were provided by E. Izaurralde. For expression in Escherichia coli, MAP1B L chain and its portions were inserted in the pGEX-2T plasmid in-frame with GST, and the proteins were purified following the standard protocols. The plasmid DsRed2-Mito expresses a fluorescently tagged mitochondrial marker protein (BD Clontech). Microscopy—For microscopy, cells were grown in 35-mm glass-bottomed plates. The wide-field epifluorescence images were captured using an inverted microscope (Axiovert 135TV) with PlanApo X40 or X100 objective, equipped with an Axiocam MRM charge-coupled device camera, appropriate filter sets, and Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Confocal microscopy was performed as described previously (42Bear J. Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Tabernero C. Hudson E.A. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6306-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 45Stauber R.H. Horie K. Carney P. Hudson E.A. Tarasova N.I. Gaitanaris G.A. Pavlakis G.N. BioTechniques. 1998; 24 (468-471): 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For some live cell experiments, plates were maintained at 37 °C in a closed chamber. The dual color experiments were performed using appropriate controls to exclude leakage between the channels. Some images of N2a neurites and 293 processes were acquired with parameters that maximized the pixel intensity while maintaining signal linearity in these compartments. Under these conditions, the cell body fluorescence intensity was saturated. Image refinement, digital deconvolution, and colocalization were performed using the AutoDeblur and Imaris software (Bitplane, Saint Paul, MN). In Vitro Protein Binding Assays—Reticulocyte-produced proteins were synthesized and metabolically labeled in a coupled transcription/translation system (TnT T7 Quick, Promega, Madison, WI), using T7 promoter-containing PCR fragments as templates and were adjusted with unprogrammed extract to equal molar concentrations. Equimolar amounts of these proteins were used in binding reactions that contained 1-2 μg of E. coli-produced GST-tagged proteins that were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The binding was performed in 200 μl of RBB buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100) supplemented with 200 or 400 mm NaCl. Following incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the beads were pelleted and washed three times with binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected using a phosphorimaging device. Immunoprecipitations—Complexes of epitope-tagged proteins were immunopurified from transiently transfected 293 cells. Typically, about 3 × 106 cells were extracted with 200 μl of RBB-200 buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100), which was supplemented with RNase and protease inhibitors for 10 min at 4 °C. The extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and, in some experiments, were further fractionated by gel filtration on Chromaspin-200 columns (BD Clontech) to enrich for high molecular mass complexes. Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C for 10 min in 200 μl of RBB-200 buffer, using covalently attached antibodies (anti-HA and anti-GFP agarose, VectorLabs, Burlingame, CA) or anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma). The precipitates were analyzed on immunoblots using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated epitope tag antibodies. Yeast Two-hybrid Interactions—The mNXF2 cDNAs were inserted into the bait plasmid pGBKT7. Screens of a pretransformed mouse brain cDNA library in S. cerevisiae AH 109 (BD Clontech MY4008AH) were performed using the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system 3 (BD Clontech) with medium stringency selection conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions. The prey plasmids were recovered from the primary colonies, and MAP1A, MAP1B, and Unrip cDNAs were identified by sequencing. After retransformation into AH109, the MAP1A, MAP1B, and Unrip clones were subjected to mating assays against the full-length and the 1-400 amino acid portions of NXF1 and NXF2 that were inserted into the pGBKT7 plasmid and transformed into S. cerevisiae Y187. As control, the empty pGBKT7 plasmid was used. In mating assays, the interactions were rated positive when all selection/indicator criteria were fulfilled, according to the manufacturer's instructions. mNXF2 but Not mNXF7 Exhibits mRNA Export Activity—In cultured cells, exogenous TAP/NXF1 stimulates the expression of DM128 mRNA, a reporter transcript that contains an intron-encoded CAT reporter gene embedded within a portion of HIV-1 env (46McDonald D. Hope T.J. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7232-7238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Huang X.J. Hope T.J. Bond B.L. McDonald D. Grahl K. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2131-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is normally retained in the nucleus. The DM128 mRNA also contains a HIV-1 Rev-responsive element element that, in the presence of the HIV-1 Rev protein, leads to strong activation of CAT expression. Although TAP/NXF1 alone leads to a small stimulation, coexpression of its cofactor p15 augments this effect (48Braun I.C. Herold A. Rode M. Conti E. Izaurralde E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20536-20543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the exogenous TAP/NXF1-p15 as well as the export cofactor of TAP/NXF1, U2AF65, acts by increasing the nuclear export of cat mRNA (5Zolotukhin A.S. Tan W. Bear J. Smulevitch S. Felber B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3935-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and therefore CAT activation provides a measure of nuclear export stimulation in this reporter system. We examined the activity of mNXF2 and mNXF7 in this assay and compared it with that of TAP/NXF1. Mouse neuronal N2a cells were cotransfected with the pDM128 plasmid and vectors encoding untagged TAP/NXF1, mNXF2, or mNXF7 in the presence or in the absence of the p15-1 expression plasmid. The cloning and characterization of mouse NXF cDNAs are described in detail elsewhere (21Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Tretyakova I. Bear J. Lindtner S. Smulevitch S. Felber B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3855-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All transfections contained a GFP expression plasmid as an internal reference. As positive control, pDM128 was cotransfected with the rev expression plasmid. We found that coexpression of Rev activated the DM128 mRNA expression 16-fold (Fig. 1), as expected (46McDonald D. Hope T.J. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7232-7238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Huang X.J. Hope T.J. Bond B.L. McDonald D. Grahl K. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2131-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), confirming the validity of our assay conditions. In the absence of p15-1, TAP/NXF-1 activated the DM128 expression about 2-fold, whereas cotransfection of TAP/NXF1 and p15-1 led to an at least 20-fold activation, in agreement with previous data (48Braun I.C. Herold A. Rode M. Conti E. Izaurralde E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20536-20543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that mNXF2 alone led to 7-fold activation, and cotransfection of p15-1 resulted in 14-fold effect. In contrast, mNXF7 was inactive both in the absence and in the presence of p15-1 (Fig. 1). Neither of the coexpressed proteins had significant effects on GFP expression (Fig. 1), and similar results were obtained when using mouse PA317 or human 293 cells (21Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Tretyakova I. Bear J. Lindtner S. Smulevitch S. Felber B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3855-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because mNXF7 was localized exclusively to the cytoplasm of N2a cells (see Fig. 2A), the lack of export activity could be due to its absence from the nucleus. The lack of an effect by mNXF7 is likely not because of its lower levels but rather its intrinsic properties, because mNXF7 and NXF1 are always expressed to higher levels compared with mNXF2 (see e.g. Fig. 5A). Together, our results show that the mouse mNXF2 is an active export receptor, whereas mNXF7 is inactive in this assay. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that mNXF7 has a more specialized export role that was not revealed using the DM128 reporter mRNA and N2a cells.Fig. 2Subcellular localization of mNXF2 and mNXF7.

All indicated proteins were transiently expressed in 293 cells.

The immunoprecipitates (IP, αFLAG) and 1:100 aliquots of input extracts (Load) were analyzed on Western blots using GFP and FLAG antibodies. Positions of GFP-NXF factors (black arrowheads) and GFP protein (gray arrow-heads) are indicated.

GFP-TAP/NXF1 localized to the nucleoplasm and nuclear membrane, whereas GFP-mNXF2 was found both in the cytoplasm and nucleus and was most prominent at the nuclear membrane (Fig. 2A). Hence, the localization of these proteins was that of typical NXF factors, in agreement with their export activity in N2a cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, GFP-mNXF7 was found uniquely in small cytoplasmic foci, both in the cell body and in the neurites, and it was excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 2, A and B). The observed localization did not depend on the tag because the HA-tagged mNXF7 was localized similarly (Fig. 2A) and was not sensitive to actinomycin D or leptomycin B treatments (data not shown). To assess the motility of mNXF7-containing particles in neurites, we used time-lapse microscopy of live N2a cells coexpressing GFP-mNXF7 and, as internal control, a mitochondria-tagged DsRed2-Mito protein. Fig. 2B shows that mNXF7 and mitochondria were segregated into discrete, non-colocalizing particles and were present abundantly in neurites. The majority of mNXF7 particles oscillated along neurites with amplitudes of several micrometers (see also Fig. 2E), and the movements of mNXF7 granules were distinct from those of mitochondria at all times (data not shown).

The cell death is markedly suppressed by hypoxia, and we have reported involvement of AMP-activated protein kinase-α (AMPK-α), Akt, and ARK5 in hypoxia-induced tolerance. In the current study we investigated the mechanism of hypoxia-induced tolerance in human hepatoma cell line HepG2. ARK5 expression was induced in HepG2 cells when they were subjected to glucose starvation, and we found that glucose starvation transiently induced Akt and AMPK-α phosphorylation and that hypoxia prolonged phosphorylation of both protein kinases. We also found that hypoxia-induced tolerance was partially abrogated by blocking the Akt/ARK5 system or by suppressing AMPK-α expression and that suppression of both completely abolished the tolerance, suggesting that AMPK-α activation signaling and the Akt/ARK5 system play independent essential roles in hypoxia-induced tolerance. By using chemical compounds that specifically inhibit kinase activity of type I-transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor, we showed an involvement of TGF-β in hypoxia-induced tolerance. TGF-β1 mRNA expression was induced by hypoxia in an hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-independent manner, and addition of recombinant TGF-β suppressed cell death during glucose starvation even under normoxic condition. AMPK-α, Akt, and ARK5 were activated by TGF-β1, and Akt and AMPK-α phosphorylation, which was prolonged by hypoxia, was suppressed by an inhibitor of type I TGF-β receptor. Based on these findings, we propose that hypoxia-induced tumor cell tolerance to glucose starvation is caused by hypoxia-induced TGF-β1 through AMPK-α activation and the Akt/ARK5 system.

ARK5 is unique in that it is directly activated by Akt, and activated ARK5 suppresses cell death induced by glucose starvation and death receptor activation (20Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Lu J.

We have also reported that ARK5 is closely involved in hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation in human hepatoma HepG2 cells (20Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Lu J. Ogura T. Lavin M.F.

Cheifetz S. Laiho M. Ralph D.A. Weis F.M. Zentella A. Cancer Surv. 1992; 12: 81-103PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an induced expression of TGF-β under hypoxic condition in osteoblast was reported, and the induction was HIF-1-independent (24Warren S.M. Steinbrech D.S. Mehrara B.J. Saadeh P.B.

The intracellular signaling induced by TGF-β is initiated by ligation to receptor (25Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar) and is mediated by a unique pathway, Smad pathway (25Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). In addition to the Smad pathway, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase stimulation via Ras/mitogen-activated kinase has been found to be an intracellular signaling pathway induced by TGF-β receptor (26Yan Z.

Recent investigations have revealed that TGF-β is closely involved in tumor malignancy via induction of cell survival, invasion, and metastasis (27Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat.

In the present study we investigated the mechanism of hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation by human hepatoma HepG2 cells, and results showed that TGF-β expression is stimulated by hypoxia and that TGF-β is closely involved in hypoxia-induced tumor cell tolerance to glucose starvation through activation of Akt/ARK5 system. Cell Lines and Transfection—Human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma). For transfection cells were seeded into a 6-well plates at 2.5 × 105/well, and transfection was performed with TransFast Transfection reagent (5 μg of DNA/well: Promega Corp.). Cells were exposed to transfection reagent for 4 h. Transfection yield was measured with green fluorescent protein-inserted expression plasmid and was 70–80%. Recombinant Protein, Antibody, Chemical Inhibitor, and Plasmid— Recombinant human TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems Ltd. Polyclonal antibodies against Akt (total and phosphorylated Ser-473), AMPK-α (total and phosphorylated Thr-172), and Smad2 (phosphorylated Ser-465/467) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. The antibody for total Smad2 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. SB431542 was purchased from TOCRIS. Dominant-negative Akt1 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The same antisense RNA expression vector of ARK5 and dominant negative ARK5 were used as in our previous studies (20Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Lu J. Ogura T. Lavin M.F. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). DE mutant of Smad3 was a generous gift from Drs. Miyazono and Imamura of The Cancer Institute of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA extraction was performed with Isogen purchased from Nippon Gene Co., Ltd. The concentration of extracted RNA was measured at A260, and 0.5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus transcriptase (TaKaRa Bio Co., Ltd.). After reverse transcription, PCR was performed with an LA PCR kit (Takara) using primer pairs for human TGF-β1 and type I/II/III TGF-β receptor. PCR was performed for 25 cycles. Western Blot Procedure—Proteins were prepared for Western blot analysis by lysing cells for 30 min with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Sample proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by a semidry blotting system. Membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h with PBS containing 5% (w/v) skim milk (BD Biosciences), washed with a mixture of PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma; Tween PBS), and then incubated overnight at room temperature with antibody diluted with PBS. After washing with Tween PBS, membranes were incubated at room temperature for 60 min with a 2000-fold diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Membranes were then washed with Tween PBS and developed with ECL system (Amersham Biosciences.). Cell Survival Assay—Cell viability was assessed by Hoechst 33342/PI staining procedure. Hoechst 33342 and PI were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. After incubation, cells were collected and stained with Hoechst 33342 and PI and then examined by fluorescence microscopy. Cell survival was measured as the ratio of cells carrying PI-unstained nuclei to all cells counted (∼1000 cells). Involvement of Akt/ARK5 System in Hypoxia-induced Tolerance to Glucose Starvation—We have reported that glucose starvation induces cell death in HepG2 cells (3Izuishi K. Kato K. Ogura T. Kinoshita T. Esumi H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6201-6207PubMed Google Scholar, 5Esumi H. Izuishi K. Kato K. Hashimoto K. Kurashima Y. Kishimoto A. Ogura T. Ozawa T. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6177-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the current study we showed that cell survival of HepG2 cells was dependent on glucose concentration and that hypoxia delayed cell death induced by glucose starvation (Fig. 1A). In addition, hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation was also exhibited in non-tumor cells, fibroblast cell lines Rat1 and KMST6 (Fig. 1B). Because we had previously shown that AMPK-α, especially the AMPK-α1 subunit, Akt, and ARK5 are required for hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation (5Esumi H. Izuishi K. Kato K. Hashimoto K.

Lavin M.F. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we first investigated ARK5 protein expression by HepG2 cells by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1C, no protein expression of ARK5 was detected in HepG2 cells in the presence of glucose under normoxia, but ARK5 expression was induced when cells were exposed to 12 h of glucose starvation (Fig. 1C). Brief glucose starvation (<12 h) did not induce ARK5 expression (data not shown). Cells exposed to glucose starvation under hypoxic conditions, but not cells exposed to hypoxia alone, also expressed ARK5 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that ARK5 expression is regulated by glucose status, not by oxygen reduction. As stated above, we previously demonstrated that overexpression of ARK5 in HepG2 cells suppressed cell death during glucose starvation; however, results of the present study showed that HepG2 cells underwent cell death during glucose starvation even though ARK5 expression was markedly increased at 12 h. Because ARK5 activity is regulated by Akt (20Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Lu J. Ogura T. Lavin M.F. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Lu J. Ogura T. Esumi H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6177-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of glucose starvation and/or hypoxia on Akt status in HepG2 cells to investigate why the newly expressed ARK5 did not suppress cell death during glucose starvation. We also investigated the phosphorylation status of AMPK-α, which is also required for hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation (5Esumi H. Izuishi K. Kato K. Hashimoto K. Kurashima Y. Kishimoto A. Ogura T. Ozawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32791-32798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, Akt and AMPK-α phosphorylation increased when cells were exposed to glucose starvation, whereas there was no increase in phosphorylation of Akt and AMPK-α when cells were exposed to glucose-containing medium or hypoxia alone (Fig. 1D). Clear glucose starvation-induced phosphorylation of Akt and AMPK-α was observed after 3 h of glucose starvation, but their phosphorylation had decreased after 12 h and had disappeared by 24 h (Fig. 1D). Because HepG2 cells exposed to glucose starvation for 24 h undergo caspase-dependent cell death (21Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Lu J. Ogura T. Esumi H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6177-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and some protein kinases, including Akt, are caspase substrates (30Widman C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), we suspect that decreased expressions of Akt and AMPK-α is caused by transduction of cell death signaling. No glucose starvation-induced phosphorylation of either molecule was observed after 3 h of glucose starvation during hypoxia, but phosphorylation of both was detected at 12 h, and it was observed even after 24 h of glucose starvation under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1D). In the present study we observed transient phosphorylation of Akt in cells exposed to glucose starvation, but hypoxia prolonged phosphorylation of both Akt and AMPK-α during glucose starvation. ARK5 was newly expressed after 12 h of glucose starvation, but glucose starvation-induced phosphorylation of Akt was significantly decreased at 12 h. We, therefore, hypothesized that the newly expressed ARK5 in HepG2 cells exposed to glucose starvation under normoxic condition is inactive because of the absence of sufficient active Akt and that hypoxia is required for ARK5 activation through prolonged activation of Akt to allow cells to survive during glucose starvation. In addition, we found that even the first 3 h exposure to hypoxia suppressed cell death by glucose starvation, and some protein kinase phosphorylation and de novo protein synthesis occurred within these 3 h. 2A. Suzuki, G.-i. Kusakai, Y. Shimojo, J. Chen, T. Ogura, M. Kobayashi, and H. Esumi, unpublished data. A more detailed mechanism that can explain an importance of this first 3-h reaction for hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation should be clarified. Our results showed that prolonged phosphorylation of Akt is required for ARK5 activation that is essential for hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation. In addition to these findings, the fate to survival or death after glucose starvation might be decided within a very early term. To determine whether blocking of the Akt/ARK5 system and/or AMPK-α activation influences hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation in the present study, we prepared RNAi for AMPK-α1, AMPK-α2, and ARK5. When each RNAi was introduced into cells, it specifically suppressed mRNA expression of its target factor (Fig. 1E). As shown in Fig. 1F, introduction of RNAi for AMPK-α1 or ARK5 or DN-Akt1 partially suppressed hypoxia-induced cell survival, but RNAi for AMPK-α2 had no effect on hypoxia-induced cell survival. The combined introduction of RNAi for AMPK-α1 and ARK5 or of RNAi for AMPK-α1 and DN-Akt1 completely suppressed hypoxia-induced cell survival (Fig. 1F), suggesting that two distinct signaling pathways are required for hypoxia-induced cell survival against glucose starvation, one mediated by Akt/ARK5 and the other by AMPK-α1. Involvement of TGF-β1 in Hypoxia-induced Tolerance to Glucose Starvation—TGF-β1 has been reported to be closely involved in tumor progression, characterized by induction of tumor cell survival, invasion, and metastasis (27Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar, 28Muraoka R.S. Dumont N. Ritter C.A. Dugger T.C. Brantley D.M. Chen J. Easterly E. Roebuck L.R.

Cordon-Carco C. Guise T.A. Massague J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 537-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar), and TGF-β1 gene has been reported to be a hypoxia-responsible gene (24Warren S.M. Steinbrech D.S. Mehrara B.J. Saadeh P.B. Greenwald J.A. Spector J.A. Bouletreau P.J. Longaker M.T. J. Surg. Res. 2001; 99: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the present study we observed increased expression of TGF-β1 mRNA in HepG2 cells exposed to 12 h of hypoxia (Fig. 2A), and HepG2 cells exposed to glucose starvation under hypoxic conditions expressed TGF-β1 mRNA slightly more weakly than cells exposed to hypoxia alone (Fig. 2A). However, under normoxic conditions, HepG2 cells exposed to medium containing or not containing glucose did not show any increase in expression of TGF-β1 mRNA (Fig. 2A). By contrast with TGF-β1, neither glucose nor oxygen status affected expressions of TGF-β receptor I, II, and III mRNAs (Fig. 2A), and tolerance to glucose starvation was induced by recombinant TGF-β1 protein even under normoxic conditions (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that TGF-β1 mRNA expression is responsible for oxygen status in HepG2 cells and hypothesize an involvement of TGF-β1 in the tolerance to glucose starvation. To confirm the above hypothesis, we investigated an effect of specific inhibitor for TGF-β receptor 1 kinase activity SB431542 (31Laping N.J. Grygielko E. Mathur A. Butter S. Bomberger J. Tweed C.

Aburatani H. Mishima H.K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7791-7798PubMed Google Scholar) on hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation. As shown in Figs. 2, C and D, tolerance of HepG2 cells to glucose starvation that was induced by hypoxia (Fig. 2C) or recombinant TGF-β1 (Fig. 2D) was suppressed by SB431542 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that hypoxia promotes TGF-β1 production, which in turn plays a central role in hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation in HepG2 cells. In addition, we investigated whether TGF-β induces phosphorylation of Akt, AMPK-α, and Smad2 in HepG2 cells under the presence or absence of glucose using Western blotting. Although glucose starvation did not affect Smad2 status in HepG2 cells (data not shown), the phosphorylation status of Akt and AMPK-α exhibited drastic changes by glucose starvation and/or TGF-β treatment. As shown in Fig. 2E, TGF-β induced phosphorylation of Akt, AMPK-α, and Smad2 in the presence of glucose. Glucose starvation transiently induced phosphorylation of Akt and AMPK-α, and TGF-β sustained the phosphorylation (Fig. 2E). Thus, we showed that TGF-β induces sustained phosphorylation of protein kinases those are needed for hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation in HepG2 cells. Hypoxia-induced Tolerance to Glucose Starvation Is Independent of HIF-1—Results of this study strongly suggested a critical role of TGF-β in hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation in HepG2 cells, and TGF-β mRNA expression has been reported to be stimulated by hypoxia (24Warren S.M.

A luciferase reporter gene assay using a five-repeat HIF-responsive element-containing luciferase reporter plasmid (5xHRE/luc and ref. 39Kimura H. Weisz A. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. Ogura T. D'Acquisto F. Addeo R. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. Blood. 2000; 95: 189-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to confirm the dominant-negative activity of DN-HIF. As shown in Fig. 3A, an ∼2-fold increase in luciferase activity was observed in HepG2 cells during hypoxia, and when both 5xHRE/luc and wild-type HIF-1α (wtHIF) expression vector were introduced into HepG2 cells, hypoxia induced a dramatic increase in activity (>10-fold) (Fig. 3A). DN-HIF transfection, on the other hand, completely suppressed an increase induced by hypoxia (Fig. 3A). We also investigated whether hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression is suppressed by DN-HIF by means of RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 3B, no vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA expression was observed under normoxic condition, except in cells overexpressing wtHIF. A dramatic increase in expression was detected when subjected to hypoxia, but DN-HIF transfection markedly suppressed it. These findings indicate that DN-HIF used in this study functions well as a dominant-negative factor. In our previous study hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation seemed not to be associated with HIF-1 action (5Esumi H. Izuishi K. Kato K. Hashimoto K. Kurashima Y. Kishimoto A. Ogura T. Ozawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32791-32798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and the above-mentioned-DN-HIF was used in the current study to directly address the question of whether HIF-1 activation is involved in tolerance to glucose starvation. As shown in Fig. 3C, transient expression of DN-HIF did not affect survival of HepG2 cells exposed to glucose starvation for 24 h under hypoxic conditions. Wild-type HIF-1α did not affect it either (Fig. 3C), confirming that hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation in HepG2 cells is promoted by HIF-1-independent signaling. We also investigated whether HIF-1α is involved in hypoxia-induced TGF-β1 mRNA expression by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 3D, transient expression of wtHIF-1 or DN-HIF had no effect on hypoxia-induced TGF-β mRNA expression. Hypoxia-induced Tolerance to Glucose Starvation Is Independent of the Smad Pathway—The Smad pathway is well known as the most important intracellular signal transduction system that mediates the effects of TGF-β (27Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar, 40Kawabata M. Imamura T. Inoue H. Hanai J. Nishihara A. Hanyu A. Takase M. Ishidou Y. Udagawa Y.

Because the results of the present study revealed that TGF-β is required for hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation, we investigated whether the Smad pathway is a necessary part of the mechanism by using DE-mutated Smad3 (Smad3/DE), which has a dominant-negative effect (42Goto D. Yagi K. Inoue H. Iwamoto I. Miyazono K. Kato M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, Smad/DE was expressed by HepG2 cells and suppressed phosphorylation of Smad2 in response to stimulation with human recombinant TGF-β1, indicating a dominant-negative effect (Fig. 4B). Although Smad3/DE suppressed Smad2 phosphorylation by TGF-β1, it had no effect on phosphorylation of Akt and AMPK-α by TGF-β1 (Fig. 4C). Hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation was also unaffected by Smad3/DE (Fig. 4D). Based on these findings, we concluded that tolerance to glucose starvation by TGF-β is Smad-independent and that the AMPK-α1 and Akt/ARK5 pathway downstream of TGF-β receptor may be essential for hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation to develop. We also recently confirmed that hypoxia-induced tolerance in human colon cancer cell lines is independent of the Smad pathway. 3A. Suzuki, G.-i. Kusakai, Y. Shimojo, J. Chen, T. Ogura, M. Kobayashi, and H. Esumi, submitted for publication. Hypoxia-induced Tolerance to Glucose Starvation Is Mediated by Sustained Activation of the Akt/ARK5 System Stimulated by TGF-β—When HepG2 cells were exposed to human recombinant TGF-β1, phosphorylation of Akt (Ser-473), ARK5 (Ser-600), and AMPK-α (Thr-172) was observed in both the presence and absence of glucose (Figs. 4C and 5A). In addition to that shown in Fig. 5B, Akt and AMPK-α phosphorylation observed in HepG2 cells exposed to glucose starvation under hypoxic condition was suppressed by 10 μm SB431542, suggesting that TGF-β is closely involved in sustained activation of Akt and AMPK-α in HepG2 cells exposed to glucose starvation under hypoxic conditions. Thus, TGF-β is essential for hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation through induction of Akt and AMPK family member phosphorylations. Because DN-Smad3 did not suppress hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation, the signal transduction seems to be Smad signaling-independent. Recently it has been reported that an inhibition of adipocytogenesis by hypoxia is caused by TGF-β, and the intracellular signaling was mediated by Smad3 (43Zhou S. Lechpammer S. Greenberger J.S. Glowachi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22688-22696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cells exhibit several responses to hypoxia through TGF-β (6Semenza G.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Although the differentiation seems to be regulated by Smad-dependent signaling, we suggest that cell survival against glucose starvation is regulated by an Smad-independent system at least. Based on the results of this study, we hypothesize that the molecular mechanism of hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation is as follows (Fig. 5C). When glucose and oxygen supply decreases, cell survival system is activated. Glucose reduction triggers AMPK-α and Akt phosphorylation, but phosphorylation is transient. Transient phosphorylation of Akt in cells exposed to glucose starvation has recently been reported, and possible involvement of ceramide in down-regulation of phosphorylated Akt has also been reported (44Nam S.Y. Amoscato A.A. Lee Y.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 337-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oxygen reduction stimulates TGF-β mRNA expression, and TGF-β sustained phosphorylation of AMPK-α and Akt. Although our and other research groups reported Akt phosphorylation caused by glucose reduction (3Izuishi K. Kato K. Ogura T. Kinoshita T. Esumi H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6201-6207PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kato K. Ogura T. Kishimoto A. Minegishi Y. Nakajima N. Miyazaki M. Esumi H.

Precise mechanisms are not known yet, but many cell lines, in which Akt is endogenously and highly activated to play important roles, show tolerance to glucose starvation (Refs. 3Izuishi K. Kato K. Ogura T. Kinoshita T. Esumi H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6201-6207PubMed Google Scholar and 4Kato K. Ogura T. Kishimoto A. Minegishi Y. Nakajima N. Miyazaki M. Esumi H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6082-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar and colorectal cancer cell lines3). The difference might be caused by the difference in cellular background. Another possibility is the role of AMPKs, which exert anti-cell death function during metabolic stresses (4Kato K. Ogura T. Kishimoto A. Minegishi Y. Nakajima N. Miyazaki M. Esumi H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6082-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Lu J. Ogura T. Esumi H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6177-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Akt, induced by glucose starvation and sustained by hypoxia-induced TGF-β, activates ARK5. We recently demonstrated that necrotic cell death induced by glucose starvation is mediated by caspase-8 (21Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Lu J. Ogura T. Esumi H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6177-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and that ARK5 promotes cell survival through suppression of caspase-6-induced flice-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) cleavage (22Suzuki A.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7067-7075Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting that Akt-activated ARK5 protects cells from glucose starvation under hypoxic condition through caspase inactivation. Results of the present study showed an important role of AMPK-α in hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation. Upon the stimulation of TGF-β, AMPK-α was also phosphorylated. Tumor suppressor LKB1 was recently identified as the upstream kinase of AMPK-α (50Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carlson M.

A. 2004; 101: 3329-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar); however, the role of LKB1 as AMPKK was limited in cells under low glucose, and we reported that AMPK-α phosphorylation in cells stimulated by growth factor, including TGF-β, is promoted by ataxia telangiectasia-mutated rather than LKB1 (53Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Shimojo Y. Ogura T. Lavin M.F. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we concluded that TGF-β, whose expression is stimulated by oxygen deprivation, is essential for hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation through promotion of AMPK-α and Akt/ARK5 pathway activation. It is well known that blockage of TGF-β signaling is closely involved in colorectal cancer progression (54Lebrin F. Goumans M.J. Jonker L. Carvalho R.L. Valdimarsdottir G. Thorikay M. Mummery C.

Sporadic colorectal cancer cells lack functional Smad4, and the absence of functional type II TGF-β receptor has been reported in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer cells (60Bronner C.E.

Moreover, it is also well known that the malignant potential of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is weaker than that of colorectal cancer and that hypoxia is essential for tumor progression, including the progression of colorectal cancer (7Harris A.L.

All of these findings taken together suggest that hypoxia-induced cell survival by TGF-β observed in this study may be related to the malignant potential of colorectal cancer and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2084477259,"Transcription from multiple promoters along with alternative mRNA splicing constitutes the basis for cell-specific gene expression and mRNA and protein diversity. The prodynorphin gene (PDYN) gives rise to prodynorphin (PDYN), precursor to dynorphin opioid peptides that regulate diverse physiological functions and are implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we characterized PDYN transcripts and proteins in the adult human brain and studied PDYN processing and intracellular localization in model cell lines. Seven PDYN mRNAs were identified in the human brain; two of the transcripts, FL1 and FL2, encode the full-length PDYN. The dominant, FL1 transcript shows high expression in limbic-related structures such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala. The second, FL2 transcript is only expressed in few brain structures such as the claustrum and hypothalamus. FL-PDYN was identified for the first time in the brain as the dominant PDYN protein product. Three novel PDYNs expressed from spliced or truncated PDYN transcripts either lack a central segment but are still processed into dynorphins, or are translated into N-terminally truncated proteins. One truncated PDYN is located in the cell nucleus, suggesting a novel nonopioid function for this protein. The complexity of PDYN expression and diversity of its protein products may be relevant for diverse levels of plasticity in adaptive responses for the dynorphin system."
https://openalex.org/W1964020147,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) and its receptor KDR (kinase insert domain-containing receptor) are central regulators of blood vessel formation. We herein report a KDR-binding protein we have isolated in the venom of eastern cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus). Sequence analysis revealed the isolated KDR-binding protein (designated KDR-bp) is identical to Lys49-phosholipase A2 (Lys49PLA2), an inactive PLA2 homologue with strong myotoxicity, in which Lys49 substitutes Asp49, a key residue for binding the essential cofactor Ca2+.

Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of this system has been established in several reports which show that genetic deficiency of either ligand or receptor results in embryonic lethality because of failed vasculature development. VEGF165 binds to two well characterized receptors on endothelial cells, namely fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1, VEGF receptor 1) and kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR, VEGF receptor 2). Flt-1 and KDR have highly homologous features related to the receptor tyrosine kinase family; both receptors are comprised of a seven-tandem extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. Several studies show the second and third domains are ligand-binding domains in both receptors (2Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M.

VEGF165 is an antiparallel homodimer, covalently linked by two disulfide bridges. It has been shown that one VEGF165 dimer binds two molecules of receptor, indicating the dimer ligand causes receptor dimerization following receptor activation (4Fuh G. Li B. Crowley C. Cunningham B. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11197-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To date, several trials have attempted to find antagonizing molecules for VEGF-VEGF receptor interaction (5Ferrara N. Oncologist. 2004; 9: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), including monoclonal antibodies, soluble receptors, peptides, siRNA, and several small synthetic inhibitors. The only physiological inhibitor of this interaction reported is tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) (6Qi J.H. Ebrahem Q. Moore N. Murphy G. Claesson-Welsh L. Bond M. Baker A. Anand-Apte B. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). TIMP-3 directly binds to the extracellular domain of KDR and blocks the angiogenic activity of VEGF165 with subnanomolar affinity (6Qi J.H. Ebrahem Q. Moore N. Murphy G. Claesson-Welsh L. Bond M. Baker A. Anand-Apte B. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Snake venoms are a plentiful source of several interesting molecules possessing unique biological activities that are never seen in mammals. Recently, two novel VEGFs, designated VEGF-F, have been isolated and characterized from viper venoms (7Yamazaki Y. Takani K. Atoda H. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51985-51988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These snake venom-derived VEGFs exhibit strict receptor selectivity compared with other known VEGF subtypes; they specifically recognize KDR but do not recognize any other known VEGF receptors (7Yamazaki Y. Takani K. Atoda H. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51985-51988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of both proteins display similar but markedly distinct features from other known VEGFs, including the structure of receptor-binding loop and the surface potential (8Suto K. Yamazaki Y. Morita T. Mizuno H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2126-2131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that myotoxic basic phospholipase A2 (Lys49PLA2) obtained from the venom of eastern cottonmouth binds the extracellular domain of KDR with subnanomolar affinity and results in the blockage of VEGF165. Lys49PLA2s are widespread in the venom of several vipers and are structurally classified as group II PLA2s, although the molecular mechanism of their myotoxicity remains unknown (9Lomonte B. Angulo Y. Calderon L. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 885-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 10Gutierrez J.M. Ownby C.L. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 915-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Despite significant homology to active PLA2s, Lys49PLA2s are inactive phospholipolytic enzymes because the Lys49 substitutes Asp49, a key residue for binding of the essential Ca2+-cofactor (11Ward R.J. Chioato L. de Oliveira A.H. Ruller R. Sa J.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This is the first report demonstrating that the exogenous factor antagonizes the VEGF receptor by binding to the exterior face of the receptor and, furthermore, is the first identification of the target molecule of myotoxic basic phospholipase A2 in viper venom. The “Experimental Procedures” section is provided in the supplemental material. Identification of KDR-binding Protein in the Venom of Eastern Cottonmouth—Several snake venoms contain activator and inhibitor toxins that both target the same molecule; some vipers possess blood coagulation factor X activators (12Tans G. Rosing J. Haemostasis. 2001; 31: 225-233PubMed Google Scholar), such as RVV-X, while others include factor X-binding protein, which binds the Gla domain of factor X and prevents blood coagulation (13Mizuno H. Fujimoto Z. Atoda H. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7230-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). From this point of view, we speculated that some snake venoms might contain VEGF receptor antagonists, in contrast to previously identified snake venom VEGF-like proteins. We screened 29 species of snake venom using an index of blocking activity for the interaction between KDR-IgG and vammin, a snake venom-derived KDR-specific VEGF from the venom of Vipera ammodytes ammodytes. As a result, we detected strong inhibitory activity in the venom of A. piscivorus piscivorus (eastern cottonmouth) with an IC50 of ∼10 μg/ml, in addition to previously identified VEGF-containing venoms, while the venom of Pseudechis australis, an elapid snake, did not affect this assay at all, even at 200 μg/ml (supplemental Fig. 1). By using two successive chromatographic runs, we isolated the inhibitory protein to give a single chain, highly basic protein with a relative molecular mass of 16.8 kDa, hereinafter named KDR-binding protein (KDR-bp) (Fig. 1A). Sequence analysis of N-terminal and enzymatically digested fragments revealed that the peptide sequence of KDR-bp is identical to Lys49-phospholipase A2 (Lys49PLA2), an inactive phospholipase A2 homologue with potent myotoxic activity (GenBank™ accession number: PSSNAM; Fig. 1B). KDR-bp Binds to the Extracellular Domain of VEGF Receptors but Not Those of PDGF or FGF Receptors—To evaluate the affinity of the isolated protein to KDR, kinetic parameters were measured using the Biacore system. KDR-bp bound to both immobilized KDR-IgG and the extracellular domain of KDR (KDRD1–7) with similar affinities (Kd of ∼1 × 10–8 m), while no specific interaction was observed with active Asp49PLA2 from Trimeresurus flavoviridis venom (Tf PLA2), despite the structural similarity (Fig. 2A and Table I). We also tested the binding ability of KDR-bp to other VEGF receptors, Flt-1 (14de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar), neuropilin-1 (15Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar), and Flt-4 (16Joukov V. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Chilov D. Lahtinen I. Kukk E. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, 17Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Makinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Specific binding was observed with Flt-1-IgG and the extracellular domain of the Flt-1 (Flt-1D1∼6)-immobilized surface, although the binding affinity was ∼10 times smaller than that of KDR (Kd = 7.4 × 10–8 m, Fig. 2B). In contrast to Flt-1, only slight interaction was observed with neuropilin-1-IgG and the Flt-4-IgG-immobilized surface (Fig. 2C). As the extracellular region of VEGF receptors, including KDR, Flt-1, and Flt-4, is composed of seven tandem immunoglobulin-like domains, we considered the possibility that KDR-bp recognizes a common structural feature of immunoglobulin superfamily proteins, resulting in apparent binding ability to receptor-immunoglobulin chimeric proteins, such as neuropilin-1-IgG and Flt-4-IgG. We therefore evaluated the binding ability to human IgG and the extracellular domains of other growth factor receptors, which are composed of tandem immunoglobulin-like domains that are similar to VEGF receptors. KDR-bp bound to immobilized-human IgG to a smaller extent (Kd = 1.75 × 10–6 m) but did not bind to the extracellular domain of PDGF receptor α at all (supplemental Fig. 2). KDR-bp bound only slightly to PDGF receptor β-IgG and FGF receptor 1a-IgG, with a comparative extent to human IgG, suggesting binding to the IgG portion of chimeric proteins (supplemental Fig. 2). In all binding experiments, specific interaction was only observed with KDR-bp (Lys49PLA2), while we could not detect any specific interaction with Tf PLA2 (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 2). These results strongly indicate that Lys49PLA2 from the venom of eastern cottonmouth is a selective ligand for VEGF receptors, especially KDR.Table IKinetic parameters for binding of KDR-bp to immobilized VEGF receptorskakdissKdm-1·s-1 (× 104)s-1 (× 10-4)m (× 10-8)KDR-bp from A. p. piscivorusKDR-IgG3.443.300.96KDRD1-73.413.421.0Flt-1D1-60.110.847.6IgG0.0468.04175Basic protein I from T. flavoviridisKDRD1-73.032.740.90Flt-1D1-60.211.517.2 Open table in a new tab KDR-bp Inhibits VEGF165-KDR Interaction and Blocking of VEGF165—As expected from the screening in the initial study, purified KDR-bp competitively blocked both VEGF165 and vammin binding to KDR-IgG with an IC50 of ∼2 × 10–6 m (supplemental Fig. 3). Similarly, KDR-bp and KDR-IgG interaction was inhibited by VEGF165 (Fig. 3), indicating that KDR-bp shares the binding epitope on KDR with VEGF165, or alternatively, blocks allosterically by binding to a region distinct from the VEGF165-binding site, such as the fourth immunoglobulin-like domain, which is essential for VEGF165-induced KDR dimerization. We next evaluated the effect of KDR-bp on the biological activity of VEGF165. KDR-bp specifically and completely attenuated the endothelial cell growth stimulated by VEGF165 without toxic effect on cell viability but did not affect fetal serum (5%)-induced cell growth (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. 4). These observations indicate that KDR-bp is an antagonistic ligand for KDR. Influence of KDR Binding Ability on Biological Properties of Lys49PLA2s—Snake venom PLA2s are a widespread toxin in most venomous snakes. Several Viperidae snakes possess Lys49PLA2s in their venoms, which are inactive PLA2 homologues, because of substitution of Asp49, a key residue for the binding of essential Ca2+-cofactor, by Lys49, and which exhibit strong myotoxic activity (9Lomonte B. Angulo Y. Calderon L. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 885-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 10Gutierrez J.M. Ownby C.L. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 915-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To date, a large number of myotoxic PLA2s from several viper venoms have been isolated and structurally characterized; however, the molecular mechanism of myotoxicity of these inactive PLA2s is poorly understood. We have reported herein that snake venom Lys49PLA2 is an antagonistic ligand for KDR. This result provides further insight into the molecular mechanism of snake venom myotoxicity. It has been reported that heparin could attenuate the myotoxic activity of Lys49PLA2s and that their heparin binding ability and myotoxic activity are completely mediated by the C-terminal portion (9Lomonte B. Angulo Y. Calderon L. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 885-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 18Nunez C.E. Angulo Y. Lomonte B.

The KDR-bp (Lys49PLA2) we have identified interacted with heparin with a Kd of 4.5 × 10–9 m (supplemental Fig. 5) and has shown that its myotoxic site is located in the C-terminal region (18Nunez C.E. Angulo Y. Lomonte B. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Heparin is known to greatly modulate VEGF-VEGF receptor interaction, particularly that of VEGF165-KDR (20Tessler S. Rockwell P. Hicklin D. Cohen T. Levi B.Z. Witte L. Lemischka I.R. Neufeld G. J.

In addition, Lys49PLA2s were shown to form a Ca2+-independent homodimer in aqueous solution and to exhibit dimerization-dependent myotoxic activity (22de Oliveira A.H. Giglio J.R. Andriao-Escarso S.H. Ito A.S. Ward R.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6912-6920Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For these aspects, both KDR-bp and VEGF165 have very similar ligand properties, despite their opposite biological effects. Lys49PLA2s from the venom of the Habu snake (T. flavoviridis), basic protein I and basic protein II, were shown to induce apoptosis in HL-60 promyelomonocytic leukemia cells but not in Tf PLA2, an active PLA2 derived from same venom. 2N. Oda-Ueda, D. Tsuru, and M. Ohno, presented at the XIIIth World Congress of the International Society of Toxinology, 2000, Paris, France, Abstract No. L87. Similar Lys49PLA2-induced apoptosis was observed on a lymphoblastoid cell line CRL-8062 (23Mora R. Valverde B. Diaz C. Lomonte B. Gutierrez J.M. Toxicon. 2005; 45: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is well established that KDR is functional on some VEGF-producing leukemias, including HL-60 cells, resulting in the formation of a VEGF/KDR autocrine loop, which mediates their proliferation and survival (24Dias S. Hattori K. Zhu Z. Heissig B. Choy M. Lane W. Wu Y. Chadburn A. Hyjek E. Gill M. Hicklin D.J. Witte L. Moore M.A. Rafii S. J. Clin.

Taking our findings into consideration, Lys49PLA2-mediated apoptosis in leukemic cells could be explained by its KDR-blocking property. In fact, both basic protein I and basic protein II interacted with the extracellular domain of KDR with similar affinities compared with KDR-bp (Table I). These data also suggest that KDR-binding ability is a general characteristic of Lys49PLA2s in several snake venoms. However, it is unclear whether the KDR binding property is directly involved in its myotoxicity and, furthermore, why KDR-bp/Lys49PLA2 is myotoxic but not toxic for other cell types, despite their expression of KDR. KDR-bp/Lys49PLA2 may affect another unidentified molecule that is specifically expressed on skeletal muscle cells and leads to its myotoxicity, although further experiments would be required to investigate this. KDR-bp also bound to IgG, but not to the extracellular domains of PDGF or FGF receptors, which are composed of tandem immunoglobulin-like domains similar to KDR and Flt-1. It is unclear whether the binding to IgG is a biologically important event in envenoming or not. Several animals, such as hedgehogs and mongoose, have toxin-neutralizing proteins in their blood. An anti-myotoxic protein, DM64, was isolated from the serum of southern opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), which is composed of five immunoglobulin-like domains. DM64 forms a noncovalent complex with snake venom-derived myotoxic PLA2 (myotoxin II/Lys49PLA2 from Bothrops asper venom) and neutralizes its myotoxicity (26Rocha S.L. Lomonte B. Neves-Ferreira A.G. Trugilho M.R. Junqueirade-Azevedo Ide L. Ho P.L. Domont G.B. Gutierrez J.M. Perales J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 6052-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that snake venom Lys49PLA2 may recognize a specific structural motif present in some of the immunoglobulin superfamily proteins. At the present, we could not confirm the reactive site of KDR-bp on KDR binding. Crystal structural studies reveal that the overall structure of Lys49PLA2 is quite similar to that Asp49PLA2 (27Holland D.R. Clancy L.L. Muchmore S.W. Ryde T.J. Einspahr H.M. Finzel B.C. Heinrikson R.L. Watenpaugh K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17649-17656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it is reported that the replacement of Lys49 of Lys49PLA2 to Asp does not reduce its myotoxic activity at all (11Ward R.J. Chioato L. de Oliveira A.H. Ruller R. Sa J.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Considering these facts, we speculate that KDR binding properties of Lys49PLA2 are also not directly dependent on the amino acid at position 49, although it is unknown whether KDR binding ability is involved in its myotoxicity or not. In this study, we identified Lys49PLA2s from the venom of eastern cottonmouth as an antagonistic ligand for KDR with subnanomolar affinity and also identified Lys49PLA2s from another snake venom. In addition to its unique activity, KDR-bp is a major component of eastern cottonmouth venom (it can be obtained at a yield of ∼10% of venom proteins); for these aspects, it is far superior to other VEGF-antagonizing molecules. Recent literature shows that KDR is also expressed on skeletal muscle cells, although the physiological role of skeletal muscle KDR remains unknown. Skeletal muscle KDR exhibits some distinct properties from KDR expressed on endothelial cells, e.g. it undergoes autophosphorylation to some extent (28Germani A. Di Carlo A. Mangoni A. Straino S.

Our study offers insight into the as yet unknown mechanism of myotoxic activity of snake venom Lys49PLA2. Furthermore, KDR-bp is potentially a valuable tool in the study of the structure and function of KDR. We are grateful to Koji Takani for his help on some of the early experiments.

Lithium chloride (LiCl) efficiently inhibits GSK3 and was recently reported to also decrease the production of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) from its precursor, the amyloid precursor protein. Therefore, lithium has been proposed as a combined therapeutic agent, inhibiting both the hyperphosphorylation of tau and the production of Aβ. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of GSK3 by LiCl induced the nuclear translocation of β-catenin in Chinese hamster ovary cells and rat cultured neurons, in which a decrease in tau phosphorylation was observed. In both cellular models, a nontoxic concentration of LiCl increased the production of Aβ by increasing the β-cleavage of amyloid precursor protein, generating more substrate for an unmodified γ-secretase activity. SB415286, another GSK3 inhibitor, induced the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and slightly decreased Aβ production. It is concluded that the LiCl-mediated increase in Aβ production is not related to GSK3 inhibition.

Alzheimer disease, the most frequent cause of dementia, is characterized by the presence of typical microscopic lesions in the brain of affected patients.

Senile plaques contain an amyloid core that is mainly constituted of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) (10Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The neuronal APP is a single pass type I transmembrane protein containing 695 amino acids (11Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K.

The β-cleavage of APP, catalyzed by the well characterized aspartyl protease β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) (14Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B.

Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar), produces a C-terminal fragment of APP (βCTF), which is further cleaved by γ-secretase to generate Aβ. The γ-secretase activity is found as a multiprotein complex containing at least four different proteins: Aph-1, nicastrin, presenilin, and Pen-2 (15De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 16Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). APP can also be cleaved within the Aβ sequence by an α-secretase. The α-cleavage of APP generates a soluble N-terminal fragment (sαAPP) and a 83-membrane-anchored C-terminal fragment (C83). Experimental evidence indicates that the α-cleavage of APP695 could be performed by members of the desintegrin and metalloprotease family, ADAM10 and ADAM17 (17Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). The short intracellular C-terminal domain of APP can be phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by several protein kinases such as cdk5, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and GSK3 (18Aplin A.E. Gibb G.M. Jacobsen J.S. Gallo J.M. Anderton B.H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 19Iijima K. Ando K. Takeda S. Satoh Y. Seki T. Itohara S. Greengard P. Kirino Y.

Neurochem. 2001; 76: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Another substrate of GSK3 is β-catenin, an essential protein of the Wnt signaling pathway. In the absence of a Wnt ligand, GSK3 activity is not inhibited, resulting in the phosphorylation of soluble β-catenin for ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation (21van Noort M. Meeldijk J. van der Zee R. Destree O. Clevers H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17901-17905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Alternatively, as a result of GSK3 inactivation by Wnt signaling, intracellular levels of β-catenin increase, allowing its binding to components of the high mobility group family of transcription factors and its translocation into the nucleus. LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK3 (22Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reduces the phosphorylation of tau in rat cultured neurons (23Munoz-Montano J.R. Moreno F.J. Avila J. Diaz-Nido J.

Interestingly, LiCl was recently reported to decrease Aβ production in both transfected cells and transgenic mice (26Sun X. Sato S. Murayama O. Murayama M. Park J.M. Yamaguchi H. Takashima A. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 321: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 27Phiel C.J. Wilson C.A. Lee V.M. Klein P.S.

In this study, transfected CHO cells and rat cultured neurons expressing human APP695 and producing human Aβ were treated with LiCl. This GSK3 inhibitor decreased the phosphorylation of tau in neurons and induced the nuclear translocation of β-catenin in both CHO cells and neurons. It was found that LiCl increased the β-secretase activity and consequently increased the amount of βCTF generated from human APP695. The cleavage of βCTF by an unchanged γ-secretase activity led to an overproduction of Aβ. SB415286, another GSK3 inhibitor, induced the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and slightly decreased neuronal Aβ production. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that LiCl stimulates the amyloidogenic pathway of human APP independently of its inhibition of GSK3.

Cells were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; purchased from Roche Applied Science). The samples were precleared overnight at 4 °C by incubation with 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose. After removal of protein A-Sepharose by centrifugation (15,800 × g for 3 min), the samples were immunoprecipitated with 1.5 μg of WO-2 antibody for 12 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (5 mg) was then added overnight. The samples were centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 3 min, and the pellets were washed three times with 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and once with TBS buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Pellets were incubated for 10 min at 96 °C in sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% bromphenol blue). The samples were then centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 3 min, and the supernatants were loaded onto NuPage™ 4–12% bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and analyzed by Western blotting (see above). Quantification of Aβ Production—Aβ production was monitored by immunoprecipitation of cell culture medium. The quantification of extracellular Aβ-(1–40) was performed by ELISA (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). For both approaches, culture medium was collected, treated with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and cleared by centrifugation (15,800 × g for 5 min, 4 °C). Supernatants (100 μl) were recovered for Aβ quantification by fluorescent sandwich ELISA assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Previous experiments showed that there was no cross-reaction between Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) recognition (38Kienlen-Campard P. Octave J.N. Peptides (N. Y.). 2002; 23: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission was measured on an HTS 7000 Plus plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 485 nm/535 nm, respectively. Immunoprecipitation was performed in 1 ml of the culture medium as described previously (33Macq A.F. Czech C. Essalmani R. Brion J.P. Maron A. Mercken L. Pradier L. Octave J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28931-28936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in a phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) The immunohistochemical labeling was performed using the ABC method. Briefly, fixed cells were treated with H2O2 to inhibit endogenous peroxidase and incubated with blocking solution (10% (v/v) normal horse serum in TBS (0.01 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4)). After overnight incubation with the diluted primary antibody, the fixed cells were sequentially incubated with horse anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to biotin (Vector, Burlingame, CA) followed by the ABC complex (Vector). Peroxidase activity was revealed using diaminobenzidine as chromogen. β- and γ-Secretase Activity Assay—The β- and γ-secretase activities were measured by FRET-based in vitro assays. CHO cells were washed, scraped in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation (1,000 × g for 5 min, 4 °C). One hundred μl of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100) was added to the cell pellet (∼1.5 × 106 cells). After brief sonication (5 s), cellular extracts were cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min, 4 °C), and enzymatic activities were measured in the supernatant. The β-secretase assay was carried out on ∼ 20 μg of proteins in reaction buffer containing the fluorogenic NH2RE(EDANS)EVNLDAEFK(DABCYL)R-OH β-secretase specific substrate (39Ermolieff J. Loy J.A. Koelsch G. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12450-12456Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions (BioVision, Mountain View, CA). After 1.5 h of incubation at 37 °C in the dark, samples were analyzed in a HTS 7000 Plus fluorescence microplate reader with excitation/emission wavelengths of 360/535 nm, respectively. Positive controls were performed with purified human β-secretase (10 μg/ml, final concentration). The β-secretase inhibitor used in the assays was Z-VLL-CHO (40Abbenante G. Kovacs D.M. Leung D.L. Craik D.J. Tanzi R.E. Fairlie D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The γ-secretase activity was measured by the QTL Lightspeed™ γ-secretase assay (QTL Biosystems, Santa Fe, NM). Approximately 10 μg of cellular extract were mixed to γ-secretase substrate (GVVIATVK, flanked by biotin and a fluorescence quencher, 20 μm) in 20 μl (final volume) of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm reduced glutathione). After 2 h of incubation in the dark, 40 μl of QTL Sensor™ (41Kumaraswamy S. Bergstedt T. Shi X. Rininsland F. Kushon S. Xia W. Ley K. Achyuthan K. McBranch D. Whitten D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7511-7515Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) was added, and the fluorescence was measured in a microplate reader with excitation/emission wavelengths of 430/595 nm, respectively. Results are expressed as β- and γ-secretase activities/mg of cellular protein. Analytical Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were incubated with 4 μg/ml [125I]transferrin for 5 min, 37 °C. Under these conditions, transferrin is an early endosomal marker. Cells were recovered in 0.25 m sucrose containing 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm imidazole buffered at pH 7.4, and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cellular suspension was homogenized in a tight Dounce homogenizer. A low-speed nuclear fraction was pelleted at 1,000 × g for 10 min and washed three times by resuspension and sedimentation. Pooled postnuclear supernatants were further sedimented at 100,000 × g for 60 min in a Ti50 rotor (Beckman). The high-speed pellet was resuspended in 0.3 ml of homogenization buffer, mixed with 2.3 m sucrose to reach 1.28 g/ml in density, and layered at the bottom of a linear sucrose gradient (from 1.10 to 1.24 g/ml in density). After floatation by centrifugation at 200,000 g for 22 h in a Sw40 rotor (Beckman), 12 fractions were collected and analyzed for protein content. Western blotting and quantifications were performed as described above. Results are represented as normalized histograms (42Leighton F. Poole B. Beaufay H. Baudhuin P. Coffey J.W. Fowler S.

Statistical Analysis—The number of samples (n) in each experimental condition is indicated in the legends to Figs. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Unpaired t test were performed to compare two experimental conditions. Otherwise, statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison post-hoc test.

In Escherichia coli precise Z-ring placement at midcell depends on controlled oscillatory behavior of MinD and MinE: In the presence of ATP MinD interacts with the FtsZ inhibitor MinC and migrates to the membrane where the MinD-MinC complex recruits MinE, followed by MinD-mediated ATP hydrolysis and membrane release. Although correct Z-ring placement during Arabidopsis plastid division depends on the precise localization of the bacterial homologs AtMinD1 and AtMinE1, the underlying mechanism of this process remains unknown. Here we have shown that AtMinD1 is a Ca2+-dependent ATPase and through mutation analysis demonstrated the physiological importance of this activity where loss of ATP hydrolysis results in protein mislocalization within plastids. The observed mislocalization is not due to disrupted AtMinD1 dimerization, however; the active site AtMinD1(K72A) mutant is unable to interact with the topological specificity factor AtMinE1. We have shown that AtMinE1, but not E. coli MinE, stimulates AtMinD1-mediated ATP hydrolysis, but in contrast to prokaryotes stimulation occurs in the absence of membrane lipids. Although AtMinD1 appears highly evolutionarily conserved, we found that important biochemical and cell biological properties have diverged. We propose that correct intraplastidic AtMinD1 localization is dependent on AtMinE1-stimulated, Ca2+-dependent AtMinD1 ATP hydrolysis, ultimately ensuring precise Z-ring placement and symmetric plastid division.

Plastids are essential plant organelles vital for life on earth. They are not formed de novo but arise by binary fission from pre-existing plastids (1Possingham J.V. Saurer W.

New Phytol. 1977; 78: 599-605Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar); plastid division is therefore essential for the maintenance and accumulation of plastid populations within plant cells. Many proteins involved in plastid division are derived from bacterial components conserved from the cyanobacterial origins of higher plant chloroplasts (4Osteryoung K.W. Vierling E.

The Z-ring is localized to the plastid midpoint (10Vitha S. McAndrew R.S. Osteryoung K.W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 11Fujiwara M. Yoshida S.

The Escherichia coli minB operon encodes MinC, MinD, and MinE, which together limit Z-ring placement to midcell (13de Boer P.A.J. Crossley R.E. Rothfield L.I.

ATP-bound MinD recruits MinC to the membrane where the MinD-MinC complex forms a stable inhibition structure at the polar zone of the cell (19Szeto T.H. Rowland S.L. Rothfield L.I. King G.F. Proc.

Topological specificity is conferred on this complex through interaction of MinE with membrane-bound MinD whereby MinE stimulates MinD ATPase activity, causing MinD to disassociate from the membrane and oscillation to the opposite side of the cell (22Hu Z.

The MinD dynamic behavior ensures the lowest MinD-MinC inhibitor complex concentration at midcell, resulting in FtsZ polymerization and appropriate placement of cell division (25Meinhardt H. de Boer P.A.J.

These phenotypes are reminiscent of minicelling and filamenting E. coli deficient in or overexpressing MinD (13de Boer P.A.J. Crossley R.E. Rothfield L.I. Cell. 1989; 56: 641-649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), suggesting functional conservation between E. coli MinD and AtMinD1. In agreement with this, the polar localization of E. coli MinD reflects the distinct intraplastidic localization pattern of AtMinD1, which localizes to a single spot or two spots at opposite poles of chloroplasts (7Maple J. Chua N.H. Møller S.G. Plant J. 2002; 31: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Fujiwara M. Nakamura A. Itoh R. Shimada Y. Yoshida S. Møller S.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). AtMinD1 encodes a protein of 326 amino acids and, based on amino acid similarity, belongs to the ParA ATPase protein family containing a Walker A motif involved in the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. Like many ParA proteins, AtMinD1 can dimerize (27Fujiwara M. Nakamura A. Itoh R. Shimada Y. Yoshida S. Møller S.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and our studies on the accumulation and replication of chloroplasts 11 (arc11) mutant have demonstrated that the asymmetric plastid division observed in arc11 is due to a A296G missense mutation in AtMinD1 that leads to loss of dimerization and inappropriate intraplastidic localization (27Fujiwara M. Nakamura A. Itoh R. Shimada Y. Yoshida S. Møller S.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This suggests that AtMinD1 dimerization and correct intraplastidic localization is in part important for correct Z-ring placement during Arabidopsis plastid division. Here we have expanded on our studies and demonstrated that AtMinD1 in Arabidopsis is an ATPase but, in contrast to its bacterial counterpart, is activated by Ca2+ rather than Mg2+. We further showed that the AtMinD1-mediated ATP hydrolysis is stimulated by AtMinE1 in the absence of envelope membrane lipids. Mutation analysis reveals that an active site AtMinD1(K72A) mutant leads to loss of ATPase activity and mislocalization within plastids and that, although AtMinD1(K72A) is able to dimerize, the interaction with AtMinE1 is abolished. Our findings reveal that appropriate AtMinD1 intraplastidic localization not only depends on AtMinD1 dimerization but on AtMinE1-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, which in turn governs correct Z-ring placement and symmetric plastid division. Site-directed Mutagenesis of AtMinD1—A full-length 981-bp AtMinD1 cDNA was PCR amplified using primers MIND/5 (5′-ATCATATGGCGGTCTGAGATTGTTC-3′; NdeI is underlined) and MIND/7 (5′-ATGGATCCTTAGCCGCCAAAGAAAGAGAAGAAGCC-3′; BamH1 is underlined) and cloned into pCRScript (Stratagene) to generate pCRScript-AtMinD1. Two oligonucleotide primers, MIND/20 (5′-TTGCGGTGGTTGTCGTCGCTCCAACACCGCCTTTTC-3′) and MIND/21 (5′-CGGAAAAGGCGGTGTTGGAGCGACGACAACCACCGC-3′) were designed spanning the AtMinD1 Walker A motif containing single point mutations (underlined) changing the active site lysine (K) at position 72 to alanine (A). PCR amplification, using pCRScript-AtMinD1 as a template and the primer pairs MIND/5-MIND/20 and MIND/21-MIND/7 generated two AtMinD1 overlapping fragments that were joined together by Splicing by Overlap Extension using the flanking primers MIND/5 and MIND/7 to generate AtMinD1(K72A). The 981-bp full-length AtMinD1(K72A) cDNA was ligated into pCRScript (Stratagene) to generate pCRScript-AtMinD1(K72A) and subjected to DNA sequencing to verify the incorporated K72A mutation. Protein Expression and Purification—Full-length wild-type AtMinD1 and AtMinD1(K72A) cDNAs were subcloned from pCRScript-AtMinD1 and pCRScript-AtMinD1(K72A) into pET14b (Novagen) to generate pET14b-AtMinD1 and pET14b-AtMinD1(K72A) and transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). 50-ml cultures were grown at 37 °C to a density of A600 = 0.6. Protein expression was induced with 1.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Both AtMinD1 and AtMinD1(K72A) were insoluble and purified using TALON metal affinity resin (BD Biosciences) under denaturing conditions following the user manual. The purity of the proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE and refolded by dialysis against sodium phosphate buffers (50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 m EDTA, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, pH 7.2) containing 8-0 m urea. AtMinE1 was expressed as a translational fusion to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST) 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; S.D., synthetic dropout medium; AD, activation domain; BD, binding domain; YFP, yellow fluorescence protein. from pGEX-AtMinE1 (7Maple J.

Protein expression was performed as described above and the soluble AtMinE1-GST fraction purified using glutathione resin (BD Biosciences) following the user manual. The purity was verified by SDS-PAGE. As a control, GST was purified from pGEX-6P (Amersham Biosciences) in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The 267-bp full-length E. coli minE gene was PCR amplified using primers EcE/3 (5′-ATCATATGGCATTACTCGATTTCTT-3′; NdeI is underlined) and EcE/4 (5′-ATGGATCCTTATTTCAGCTCTTCTGCTTCC-3′; BamH1 is underlined), ligated into pET14b to generate pET14b-EcMinE, and transformed into BL21 (DE3). Protein expression was performed as described above. EcMinE was soluble and was purified under native conditions using TALON metal affinity resin (BD Biosciences) following the user manual and the purity verified by SDS-PAGE. ATPase Assays—For all assays, the reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm CaCl2, except for the cation effects assays where 5 mm CaCl2 was replaced with either 5 mm MgCl2, KCl, or MnCl2. In experiments testing the effects of the AtMinD1(K72A) mutation, different cation effects, and pH dependence, 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 10 mCi/mmol) and 0.1 μm AtMinD1 or AtMinD1(K72A) were used, and reactions (20 μl) were incubated for 1 h at 35 °C and stopped with 1 μl of 1 m formic acid. In the time course assays for the double reciprocal plot 10-80 μm [γ-32P]ATP and 0.1 μm AtMinD1 were used, and reactions were incubated at 35 °C and stopped at the specified time. To analyze the effect of AtMinE1 and EcMinE on AtMinD1 ATP hydrolysis, 0.1 μm AtMinE1 (1 pmol), 0.1 μm EcMinE (1 pmol), and 0.1 μm AtMinD1 (1 pmol) were used. Reactions were incubated at 35 °C and stopped after 10 min. In all assays a no-enzyme control was used to assess the background. Samples were spotted onto PEI-cellulose (POLYGRAM CEL 300 PEI; Macherey-Nagel) TLC plates and developed using 0.5 m LiCl and 0.5 m formic acid. Radioactive nucleotides were visualized by autoradiography using x-ray film (Kodak). For quantification purposes plates were scanned using phosphorimaging (Cyclone Storage Phosphor System; Packard). AtMinD1/AtMinD1(K72A) Localization Analysis—Full-length AtMinD1 and AtMinD1(K72A) cDNAs were PCR amplified using primers MIND/1 (5′-TACTCGAGATGGCGTCTCTGAGATTGTTC-3′; XhoI underlined) and MIND/6 (5′-ATGGTACCGCCGCCAAAGAAAGAGAAGAAGCC-3′; KpnI underlined), removing the termination codon, and cloned into pWEN18 as N-terminal fusions to the YFP to generate pWEN18/AtMinD1 and pWEN18/AtMinD1(K72A). pWEN18/AtMinD1 and pWEN18/AtMinD1(K72A) were transiently expressed in tobacco leaves by particle bombardment (28Kost B. Spielhofer P. Chua N.H. Plant J. 1998; 16: 393-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon TE2000U inverted microscope, and image analysis was performed by using OPENLAB software (Improvision, Coventry, UK). The number of fluorescent spots in each chloroplast was recorded for each bombardment. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Full-length AtMinD1(K72A) was PCR amplified using MIND/5 and MIND/7 and cloned into pGADT7 (GAL4 activation domain; AD) and pGBKT7 (GAL4 DNA-binding domain; BD) (Matchmaker two-hybrid system, version 3; Clontech). The resulting constructs, pGADT7/AtMinD1(K72A) and pGBKT7/AtMinD1(K72A) together with pGADT7/AtMinD1 and pGBKT7/AtMinD1 (27Fujiwara M. Nakamura A. Itoh R. Shimada Y. Yoshida S. Møller S.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), pGADT7/ARC11 and pGBKT7/ARC11 (27Fujiwara M. Nakamura A. Itoh R. Shimada Y. Yoshida S. Møller S.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), pGADT7/AtMinE1 and pGBKT7/AtMinE1 (29Maple J. Aldridge C. Møller S.G. Plant J. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and empty vector controls (pGADT7 and pGBKT7), were transformed into HF7c yeast cells in different combinations (Fig. 5). Double transformants were selected on minimal synthetic drop-out medium (S.D. medium) lacking tryptophan (T) (pGBKT7 vectors) and leucine (L) (pGADT7 vectors). Restoration of histidine (H) auxotrophy was used as a marker for protein-protein interactions. Quantitative data were obtained by growing 3-day-old double transformants in liquid S.D.-LT medium in a shaking incubator at 30 °C for 24 h. Cultures were grown to A600 of 1.0 before spotting 5 μl on to S.D.-LT and S.D.-LTH media plates. The plates were incubated for 4 days at 30 °C, and growth was assessed visually. For quantification each yeast spot was suspended in 1 ml of liquid S.D. medium and the A600 of the suspension recorded. Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation—Full-length AtMinD1(K72A) cDNA was PCR amplified using primers MIND/1 and MIND/6 and cloned into pWEN-NY (29Maple J. Aldridge C. Møller S.G. Plant J. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) as a fusion to the N-terminal fragment of YFP (containing amino acids 1-154 of YFP). The resulting construct pWEN-NY/AtMinD1(K72A) was co-bombarded into tobacco along with pWEN-CY/AtMinD1 (29Maple J. Aldridge C. Møller S.G. Plant J. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) (containing amino acids 155-238 of YFP), and bimolecular fluorescence complementation was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. As a positive control tobacco was also co-bombarded with pWEN-NY/AtMinD1 and pWEN-CY/AtMinD1 (29Maple J. Aldridge C. Møller S.G. Plant J. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). As a negative control pWEN-CY/AtMinD1, pWEN-NY/AtMinD1, and pWEN-NY/AtMinD1(K72A) were bombarded separately into tobacco cells. AtMinD1 Is a Ca2+-dependent ATPase—AtMinD1 contains a putative Walker A motif, and to test whether AtMinD1 is an ATPase a His6-AtMinD1 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli followed by denaturing Co2+ affinity chromatography purification and refolding by dialysis. The purity of refolded AtMinD1 was verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) followed by incubation with radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP at pH 7.4 in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2. TLC analysis and autoradiography showed clear AtMinD1-induced radiolabeled inorganic phosphate (Pi) release compared with a no-enzyme control, revealing that AtMinD1 is an ATPase (Fig. 1B). To ensure the measured ATP hydrolysis was due to AtMinD1 and not a contaminating E. coli ATPase, we generated an active site AtMinD1 mutant by substituting the conserved Walker A lysine for alanine, creating AtMinD1(K72A). AtMinD1(K72A) was expressed and purified as a His6 fusion protein as for wild-type AtMinD1 (Fig. 1A), incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2, and analyzed by TLC. Autoradiography revealed no significant Pi release above the no-enzyme control reaction (Fig. 1B), confirming that the K72A mutation inactivates AtMinD1 ATPase activity and that AtMinD1 ATP hydrolysis is mediated through the Walker A domain. To more fully characterize the catalytic activity of AtMinD1, we determined key kinetic parameters of AtMinD1-mediated ATP hydrolysis. The extent of ATP hydrolysis as a function of protein concentration was calculated by measuring Pi release in response to increasing AtMinD1 amounts (Fig. 2A). As seen from Fig. 2A, the extent of ATP hydrolysis was proportional to the amount of input AtMinD1, and in the linear range of enzyme dependence 7 pmol of ATP was hydrolyzed per pmol AtMinD1, which translates to a turnover number of ∼2 fmol s-1. Using input [γ-32P]ATP concentrations from 10-80 μm, we quantified Pi release as a function of time in separate time course assays (supplemental Fig. 1). From initial reaction rates a reciprocal plot revealed that AtMinD1 has a Km of 500 μm ATP and a Vmax of 0.2 pmol ATP s-1 (Fig. 2B). These values show that AtMinD1 is a weak ATPase. Divalent cations are known to influence the activity of ATPases (30Berger G. Girault G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and we investigated whether different cations affected AtMinD1 activity. Surprisingly, Mg2+ had no significant effect on AtMinD1 activity (Fig. 2C) in contrast to the Mg2+-dependent activity of E. coli MinD (31de Boer P.A. Crossley R.E. Hand A.R. Rothfield L.I. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4371-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Similarly, K+ and Mn2+ did not significantly stimulate AtMinD1-mediated ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 2C). However, addition of Ca2+ ions had a dramatic effect leading to an ∼5-fold increase in ATP hydrolysis compared with reactions containing Mg2+ (Fig. 2C). Further analysis showed maximum ATP hydrolysis between pH 7.5-8 (Fig. 2D). Combined, these data demonstrate that AtMinD1 is a Ca2+-dependent ATPase. AtMinE1 Stimulates AtMinD1 ATPase Activity—Because of the low basal ATPase activity of AtMinD1, we analyzed whether AtMinE1 can stimulate AtMinD1-mediated ATP hydrolysis. Equimolar amounts of purified AtMinE1-GST and AtMinD1 were incubated with CaCl2 and [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min. The inclusion of AtMinE1 had a marked effect on the amount of Pi release, showing an ∼3-fold increase in ATP hydrolysis compared with AtMinD1 alone and taking into account background Pi release in assays only containing AtMinE1 (Fig. 3), demonstrating that AtMinE1 can stimulate AtMinD1 activity. To ensure the increase in ATP hydrolysis was not due to either inherent AtMinE1 ATPase activity or a contaminating E. coli ATPase, we performed ATPase assays using only purified AtMinE1-GST. Although AtMinE1-GST assays did result in low background ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 3), probably due to contaminating E. coli protein(s), it is clear that the measured increase in ATP hydrolysis in reactions containing both AtMinD1 and AtMinE1 is because of AtMinD1 activity. To further verify this, we performed assays with AtMinD1(K72A) and AtMinE1 that resulted in similar ATP hydrolysis levels as observed for AtMinE1-GST alone (data not shown). As a control for AtMinE1-GST, we performed assays using purified GST that resulted in no Pi release (Fig. 3). To investigate the evolutionary conservation of AtMinE1-stimulated AtMinD1 activity, E. coli MinE (EcMinE) was purified and substituted for AtMinE1 in the ATPase assays. Although we have previously demonstrated that AtMinE1 can function as a topological specificity factor in E. coli (7Maple J. Chua N.H. Møller S.G. Plant J. 2002; 31: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), experiments revealed EcMinE was unable to stimulate AtMinD1 activity (Fig. 3). Loss of ATP Hydrolysis Results in Abnormal AtMinD1 Localization—AtMinD1 shows distinct intraplastidic localization patterns localizing into one or two discrete spots at polar regions of ellipsoidal chloroplasts (7Maple J. Chua N.H. Møller S.G. Plant J. 2002; 31: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Fujiwara M. Nakamura A. Itoh R. Shimada Y. Yoshida S. Møller S.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, the A296G mutation in AtMinD1/ARC11 results in mislocalization, forming large and distorted fluorescent aggregates and/or multiple speckles (27Fujiwara M. Nakamura A. Itoh R. Shimada Y. Yoshida S. Møller S.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To test whether an active site mutation affects AtMinD1 localization, translational fusions of AtMinD1 and AtMinD1(K72A) to YFP were created and transiently expressed in tobacco leaves by particle bombardment. As expected, the majority of AtMinD1-YFP (75%) localized into one or two discrete spots (Fig. 4A). In contrast, AtMinD1(K72A)-YFP forms multiple speckles often up to six or more speckles within chloroplasts (Fig. 4). Unlike the mislocalization of AtMinD1(A296G), protein aggregation is rarely observed and AtMinD1(K72A)-YFP frequently forms more speckles per chloroplast than reported for AtMinD1(A296G)-GFP (27Fujiwara M. Nakamura A. Itoh R. Shimada Y. Yoshida S. Møller S.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting a different mechanism is responsible for the mislocalization. It is clear from these results that ATP binding/hydrolysis plays an important role in ensuring correct intraplastidic localization of AtMinD1. AtMinD1(K72A) Can Dimerize—Yeast two-hybrid and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses have demonstrated AtMinD1 is able to form homodimers (27Fujiwara M. Nakamura A. Itoh R. Shimada Y. Yoshida S. Møller S.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In line with this, E. coli MinD undergoes self assembly on phospholipid vesicles forming filamentous polymeric structures (24Hu Z. Gogol E.P. Lutkenhaus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6761-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Both ARC11/AtMinD1(A296G) and AtMinD1(K72A) exhibit mislocalization within plastids, and we have previously shown that ARC11/AtMinD1(A296G) mislocalization is due to loss of dimerization (27Fujiwara M. Nakamura A. Itoh R. Shimada Y. Yoshida S. Møller S.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To investigate whether AtMinD1(K72A) mislocalization was due to loss of dimerization, we performed yeast two-hybrid studies using restoration of histidine auxotrophy as a marker for interaction. In agreement with our previous data (27Fujiwara M. Nakamura A. Itoh R. Shimada Y. Yoshida S. Møller S.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) we found His auxotrophy restoration in cells expressing AD-AtMinD1 and BD-AtMinD1 (Fig. 5A). Similarly, HF7c expressing AD-AtMinD1(K72A) and BD-AtMinD1 (Fig. 5A) or AD-AtMinD1 and BD-AtMinD1(K72A) (data not shown) showed restoration of His auxotrophy, revealing the K72A mutation does not affect AtMinD1 dimerization. As a negative control we expressed AD-ARC11/AtMinD1(A296G) and BD-AtMinD1 (Fig. 5A) and AD-AtMinD1 and BD-ARC11/AtMinD1(A296G) (data not shown), which showed no growth without His. BD-ARC11/AtMinD1(A296G) and AD-AtMinD1(K72A) (Fig. 5A) and AD-ARC11/AtMinD1(A296G) and BD-AtMinD1(K72A) (data not shown) were also co-expressed, showing no growth without His. To ensure the interactions detected were not because of autoactivation, each construct was co-expressed with the empty vector controls and showed no restoration of His auxotrophy. To verify that AtMinD1(K72A) can dimerize inside living chloroplasts, bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays were carried out. Separate, non-fluorescent N-terminal (NY) and C-terminal (CY) YFP protein domains can associate to form a functional fluorescent bimolecular complex when brought into proximity by interacting proteins. As previously observed (29Maple J. Aldridge C. Møller S.G. Plant J. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), tobacco co-bombarded with pWEN-NY/AtMinD1 and pWEN-CY/AtMinD1 showed clear fluorescence (Fig. 5B). Tobacco co-bombarded with pWEN-NY/AtMinD1(K72A) and pWEN-CY/AtMinD1 also showed clear fluorescence (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that AtMinD1(K72A) is able to dimerize in planta and showing that AtMinD1(K72A) mislocalization is not because of loss of dimerization as observed for ARC11/AtMinD1 (A296G). Tobacco cells bombarded with single vectors (negative controls) showed no fluorescence, as expected. AtMinD1(K72A) Is Unable to Interact with AtMinE1—The MinE binding site in E. coli MinD is in close proximity to the ATP binding site on α-helix 7 (32Ma L. King G.F. Rothfield L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and lysine 11 within the Walker A motif (equivalent to AtMinD1 lysine 67) interacts with residues within α-helix 7 competing with MinE (32Ma L. King G.F. Rothfield L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting the Walker A motif is involved in mediating MinD-MinE interaction. To test whether the AtMinD1 K72A mutation affects interaction with AtMinE1 we expressed AD-AtMinE1 and BD-AtMinE1 with BD-AtMinD1(K72A) and AD-AtMinD1(K72A), respectively, in HF7c. In contrast to yeast cells expressing AD-AtMinE1 and BD-AtMinD1 (Fig. 5A) or AD-AtMinD1 and BD-AtMinE1 (data not shown) showing growth on His-free media, cells containing AD-AtMinE1 and BD-AtMinD1(K72A) or AD-AtMinD1(K72A) and BD-AtMinE1 (Fig. 5A) showed no restoration of His auxotrophy, demonstrating that the K72A mutation in AtMinD1 abolishes the interaction with AtMinE1. AD-AtMinE1 and BD-ARC11/AtMinD1(A296G) were also co-expressed in HF7c and demonstrated the AtMinD1 A296G mutation has no effect on AtMinD1-AtMinE1 interaction (Fig. 5A). To ensure the interactions detected were not due to AtMinE1 autoactivation, empty BD and AD vector were expressed with AD-AtMinE1 and BD-AtMinE1, revealing no His auxotrophy restoration (Fig. 5A). The importance of AtMinD1 in plastid division has been shown by studies demonstrating that a disequilibrium of AtMinD1 levels in transgenic plants results in Z-ring misplacement and inappropriate plastid division (5Colletti K.S. Tattersall E.A. Pyke K.A. Froelich J.E. Stokes K.D. Osteryoung K.W. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 507-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 26Dinkins R. Reddy M.S. Leng M. Collins G.B. Planta. 2001; 214: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although little is known about how AtMinD1 ensures correct Z-ring placement, we recently reported, through the cloning of the disrupted locus in arc11, that AtMinD1 dimerization is important for correct interplastidic localization and central Z-ring positioning during plastid division (27Fujiwara M. Nakamura A. Itoh R. Shimada Y. Yoshida S. Møller S.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this report we have revealed the importance of the biochemical activity of AtMinD1 and shown how the topological specificity factor AtMinE1 modulates both AtMinD1 activity and AtMinD1 localization dynamics. We showed that AtMinD1, in contrast to its bacterial counterpart, is a Ca2+-dependent ATPase and that the Walker A motif is important for both ATPase activity and correct intraplastidic localization. Although an active site AtMinD1 mutant can still dimerize, loss of ATPase activity abolishes its interaction with AtMinE1. Together with the fact that AtMinE1 can stimulate the ATPase activity of AtMinD1, our data suggest that AtMinE1 not only modulates ATP hydrolysis but also ensures correct AtMinD1 localization within plastids during division. AtMinD1 ATP hydrolysis is mediated through the Walker A domain, as a K72A mutation within this motif leads to a complete loss of ATPase activity (Fig. 1B). The high Km and low Vmax values show that AtMinD1 is a weak ATPase, like the MinD-related protein ParA (33Bouet J.Y. Funnell B.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The weak activity exhibited by AtMinD1 may be because of electrostatic properties of the ATP binding site. In the F1 ATPase (34Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar) and in hydrolases (35Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), basic amino acids near the ATP γ-phosphate are responsible for stabilization of the transition state negative charge (36Hayashi I. Oyama T. Morikawa K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar); both E. coli MinD and AtMinD1 lack these basic amino acids, possibly explaining the weak ATP turnover. The low basal activity may, however, be an important feature of the AtMinD1 mode of action, as in E. coli MinD membrane dissociation only occurs after stimulation by MinE and this plays an essential role in the MinCDE oscillatory cycle (22Hu Z. Lutkenhaus J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1337-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24Hu Z. Gogol E.P. Lutkenhaus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6761-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Although AtMinD1 and AtMinE1 oscillatory behavior has not been reported, based on the evolutionary conservation of the division machinery it is probable that a similar mechanism occurs during plastid division. Although E. coli MinD and AtMinD1 show a high degree of similarity at the amino acid level, we have found significant differences in the functioning of the two proteins, First, a difference in cation dependence of ATPase activity between Ca2+-dependent AtMinD1 and Mg2+-dependent E. coli MinD implies an important functional difference, probably signifying evolutionary adaptation as many plant processes are regulated by calcium. Indeed, studies have suggested a regulatory role for plastidic Ca2+ fluxes (37Sai J. Johnson C.H. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1279-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and our findings suggest plastidic Ca2+ levels regulate AtMinD1 activity during plastid division. Second, although we have demonstrated that AtMinE1 stimulates the activity of AtMinD1, this stimulation can occur independently of membrane binding (Fig. 3) in contrast to the phospholipid-dependent MinE stimulation of E. coli MinD (31de Boer P.A. Crossley R.E. Hand A.R. Rothfield L.I. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4371-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), suggesting functional divergence in the mechanism of AtMinE1-stimulated AtMinD1 ATP hydrolysis during plastid division in Arabidopsis. In addition, purified MinE from E. coli is unable to stimulate AtMinD1 ATPase activity in vitro (Fig. 3), further indicating that at least in part the mechanism of AtMinE1-stimulated AtMinD1 activity is different from that in prokaryotes. In E. coli, wild-type MinD localizes to the cell periphery, whereas the active site MinD(K16Q) mutant is distributed throughout the cell (24Hu Z. Gogol E.P. Lutkenhaus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6761-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). MinD(K16Q) is, however, still able to bind ATP but cannot bind phospholipids (24Hu Z. Gogol E.P. Lutkenhaus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6761-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In agreement with this we have shown that the active site AtMinD1(K72A) mutant exhibits aberrant localization patterns, distributed as speckles throughout plastids (Fig. 4). This mislocalization is not because of loss of AtMinD1 dimerization (Fig. 5) as observed for ARC11 (27Fujiwara M. Nakamura A. Itoh R. Shimada Y. Yoshida S. Møller S.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) but most probably because of lack of interaction with AtMinE1 (Fig. 5A). The loss of interaction between AtMinD1(K72A) and AtMinE1 may either be because lysine 72 is directly involved in the AtMinE1 interaction or because AtMinD1(K72A) is unable to adopt the correct conformation upon binding ATP necessary for AtMinE1 interaction. In E. coli, the α-helical region of the MinE anti-MinCD domain interacts with MinD α-helix 7 forming a coiled-coil structure (38Ma L. King G. Rothfield L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4948-4955Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32Ma L. King G.F. Rothfield L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and lysine 11 within the Walker A region (P-loop) competes with MinE for residues within α-helix 7 (32Ma L. King G.F. Rothfield L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). MinE-mediated disruption of the non-covalent interaction between lysine 11 and α-helix 7 changes the lysine 11 side-chain orientation and the P-loop conformation. This transmits an activation signal to the neighboring catalytic domain or to the bound ATP, bringing about ATP hydrolysis (32Ma L. King G.F. Rothfield L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This model suggests MinE stimulation is through conformational change in the Walker A motif rather than through direct interaction between MinE and Walker A residues. Based on this model it is unlikely that AtMinE1 interacts directly with the Walker A motif; we favor the theory that a Walker A mutation in AtMinD1 changes the overall conformation, ultimately disabling its interaction with AtMinE1. Based on our data we propose a working model for the AtMinD1 mode of action during plastid division in Arabidopsis (Fig. 6). We suggest AtMinD1 undergoes dimerization and binds ATP and that this AtMinD1 dimer complex exhibits low basal Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity. AtMinD1 then interacts with AtMinE1, stimulating ATP hydrolysis. How does this impinge on the function of AtMinD1 in ensuring the correct placement of the Z-ring? In line with the prokaryotic model, dimerized ATP-bound AtMinD1 may bind to the chloroplast envelope before AtMinE1 interaction, which stimulates ATP hydrolysis and membrane release followed by protein relocation. However, in contrast to E. coli, AtMinE1 can stimulate ATP hydrolysis in the absence of envelope lipids; therefore, AtMinE1 can enhance AtMinD1 activity prior to envelope binding. In addition, plants do not harbor MinC, suggesting that AtMinD1 and AtMinE1 modes of action differ from those in prokaryotes. Together with the fact that AtMinD1 is dependent on Ca2+ and not Mg2+, it is clear that AtMinD1 has evolved at the biochemical and cell biological level, presumably to adapt from being a part of cell division machinery in free living prokaryotes to becoming an integral component of the plastid division machinery in higher plants.

https://openalex.org/W2092551313,"Degradation of misfolded and damaged proteins by the 26 S proteasome requires the substrate to be tagged with a polyubiquitin chain. Assembly of polyubiquitin chains and subsequent substrate labeling potentially involves three enzymes, an E1, E2, and E3. E2 proteins are key enzymes and form a thioester intermediate through their catalytic cysteine with the C-terminal glycine (Gly76) of ubiquitin. This thioester intermediate is easily hydrolyzed in vitro and has eluded structural characterization. To overcome this, we have engineered a novel ubiquitin-E2 disulfide-linked complex by mutating Gly76 to Cys76 in ubiquitin. Reaction of Ubc1, an E2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with this mutant ubiquitin resulted in an ubiquitin-E2 disulfide that could be purified and was stable for several weeks. Chemical shift perturbation analysis of the disulfide ubiquitin-Ubc1 complex by NMR spectroscopy reveals an ubiquitin-Ubc1 interface similar to that for the ubiquitin-E2 thioester. In addition to the typical E2 catalytic domain, Ubc1 contains an ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, and we have utilized NMR spectroscopy to demonstrate that in this disulfide complex the UBA domain is freely accessible to non-covalently bind a second molecule of ubiquitin. The ability of the Ubc1 to bind two ubiquitin molecules suggests that the UBA domain does not interact with the thioester-bound ubiquitin during polyubiquitin chain formation. Thus, construction of this novel ubiquitin-E2 disulfide provides a method to characterize structurally the first step in polyubiquitin chain assembly by Ubc1 and its related class II enzymes. Degradation of misfolded and damaged proteins by the 26 S proteasome requires the substrate to be tagged with a polyubiquitin chain. Assembly of polyubiquitin chains and subsequent substrate labeling potentially involves three enzymes, an E1, E2, and E3. E2 proteins are key enzymes and form a thioester intermediate through their catalytic cysteine with the C-terminal glycine (Gly76) of ubiquitin. This thioester intermediate is easily hydrolyzed in vitro and has eluded structural characterization. To overcome this, we have engineered a novel ubiquitin-E2 disulfide-linked complex by mutating Gly76 to Cys76 in ubiquitin. Reaction of Ubc1, an E2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with this mutant ubiquitin resulted in an ubiquitin-E2 disulfide that could be purified and was stable for several weeks. Chemical shift perturbation analysis of the disulfide ubiquitin-Ubc1 complex by NMR spectroscopy reveals an ubiquitin-Ubc1 interface similar to that for the ubiquitin-E2 thioester. In addition to the typical E2 catalytic domain, Ubc1 contains an ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, and we have utilized NMR spectroscopy to demonstrate that in this disulfide complex the UBA domain is freely accessible to non-covalently bind a second molecule of ubiquitin. The ability of the Ubc1 to bind two ubiquitin molecules suggests that the UBA domain does not interact with the thioester-bound ubiquitin during polyubiquitin chain formation. Thus, construction of this novel ubiquitin-E2 disulfide provides a method to characterize structurally the first step in polyubiquitin chain assembly by Ubc1 and its related class II enzymes. The ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis pathway controls the removal of damaged and misfolded proteins in the cell. One of the key steps in this pathway is the assembly of a polyubiquitin chain that ultimately targets a substrate for degradation (1Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This process involves tagging of a substrate protein with an arrangement of four to eight ubiquitin molecules linked in series through the C-terminal Gly76 of one ubiquitin molecule and the side-chain ϵ-NH2 from Lys48 of another (3Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Once tagged, the polyubiquitinated protein is recognized by the 26 S proteasome, where it is degraded. The building of a polyubiquitin chain and subsequent labeling of a substrate protein is a complex process potentially involving the passage of ubiquitin through three different enzymes (1Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 4Fang S. Weissman A.M. Cell Mol.

Initially, ubiquitin is activated in an ATP-dependent step forming a high energy E1 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; Ubc11-150, S. cerevisiae Ubc1 (residues 1-150); Ub, S. cerevisiae K48R-ubiquitin; UbCys, K48R-ubiquitin with a G76C mutation; UBA, ubiquitin-associated; UbCys-Ubc1, disulfide-linked complex between UbCys and Ubc1 (or Ubc11-150).1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; Ubc11-150, S. cerevisiae Ubc1 (residues 1-150); Ub, S. cerevisiae K48R-ubiquitin; UbCys, K48R-ubiquitin with a G76C mutation; UBA, ubiquitin-associated; UbCys-Ubc1, disulfide-linked complex between UbCys and Ubc1 (or Ubc11-150).-ubiquitin thioester complex. Ubiquitin is then transferred to an E2 or ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme forming a thioester intermediate. E2 proteins have been demonstrated recently to bind to the ubiquitin-like domain of the E1 providing insight into the mechanism in which the thioester-bound ubiquitin is passed to the E2 (6Huang D.T.

Two different E3 ligase proteins can catalyze the final passage of ubiquitin to the substrate. For RING E3 ligases, ubiquitin or a polyubiquitin chain is transferred directly from the E2 to the substrate, whereas HECT E3 ligases form an ubiquitin-E3 thioester prior to ubiquitin transfer to the substrate (5Passmore L.A. Barford D. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The E2 conjugating proteins are the key enzymes in this pathway because they are required to transfer ubiquitin either to the E3 ligase (HECT E3) or to the substrate (RING E3). All E2 proteins have a 150-residue catalytic domain that is structurally conserved throughout many species and contains the cysteine residue necessary for thioester formation with Gly76 of ubiquitin. Structures of E2 proteins show that the catalytic domain has an α/β-fold that is maintained upon complexation with either HECT (9Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wan G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M.

Details on the involvement of the E2 thioester in the polyubiquitin chain-building process or the mechanism for transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 protein to an E3 or substrate are less certain. The E2 proteins Ubc1 and Ubc3 (Cdc34) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae assemble polyubiquitin chains and exhibit autoubiquitination activities (12Hodgins R. Gwozd C. Arnason R. Cummings M. Ellison M.J.

Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ubc1 has been shown to be important for the creation of polyubiquitin chains required for protein labeling and subsequent degradation (12Hodgins R. Gwozd C. Arnason R. Cummings M. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28766-28771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of Ubc1 from S. cerevisiae, determined by NMR spectroscopy, provides some insights into these biological activities (15Merkley N. Shaw G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47139-47147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The structure shows that Ubc1 and its related class II conjugating enzymes form a unique two-domain protein having a typical α/β-fold catalytic domain connected via a flexible tether to a C-terminal UBA (ubiquitin-associated) domain. UBA domains, such as the one in Ubc1, are capable of interaction with mono- or polyubiquitin chains in a non-covalent fashion and may result in either inhibition of degradation or transfer enhancement via ubiquitin interaction (16Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 17Raasi S. Orlov I. Fleming K.G. Pickart C.M. J. Mol.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The E2 conjugating protein Ubc1, is a well positioned candidate to examine the transfer of ubiquitin from the ubiquitin-E2 thioester because of its ability to moderate and build polyubiquitin chains. Mechanistic experiments that examine the role of the ubiquitin-E2 thioester in polyubiquitin chain assembly have been difficult because of the inherent instability of the thioester complex. To date the best details have been garnered from models derived from NMR chemical shift perturbation data for ubiquitin-E2 thioester intermediates (20Hamilton K.S. Ellison M.J. Shaw G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Attempts to stabilize this complex for more detailed structural and mechanistic experiments have met with limited success. To circumvent this we have created a novel disulfide-linked ubiquitin-Ubc1 complex that mimics the ubiquitin-E2 thioester intermediate. We show that this ubiquitin-Ubc1 complex can be purified in high amounts, is stable for long periods of time, and has similar structural characteristics to the ubiquitin-E2 thioester intermediate. We have used this complex and NMR spectroscopy to show that the UBA domain can bind ubiquitin in a non-covalent fashion even in the presence of an ubiquitin molecule covalently bound at the catalytic domain. These results provide a glimpse at the first step of polyubiquitin chain formation by Ubc1 and its related class II E2 enzymes. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant S. cerevisiae Ubc11-150, Ubc1, and ubiquitin (Ub) were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified as described previously (12Hodgins R. Gwozd C. Arnason R. Cummings M. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28766-28771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Both Ubc1 proteins carried K93R mutations, and ubiquitin contained a K48R change to inhibit autoubiquitination. Uniform 15N labeling of Ubc1 (21Merkley N. Shaw G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and [Val,Leu,Ile-(δ1)-methyl-protonated-13C,2H,15N]Ubc1 (15Merkley N. Shaw G.S. J. Biol.

The expression plasmid for ubiquitin carrying a G76C mutation (UbCys) was constructed by PCR from the K48R-ubiquitin template and purified as reported for ubiquitin (12Hodgins R. Gwozd C. Arnason R. Cummings M. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28766-28771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) except that dithiothreitol was omitted from buffers. Isotopically labeled UbCys was achieved by overexpression in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS in 1 liter of M9 minimal media with 1.0 g/liter 15NH4Cl and 2.0 g/liter [13C6]glucose for uniformly labeled [13C,15N]UbCys. UbCys-Ubc1 Disulfide Complex Formation—Solutions (0.1 mm) of UbCys, Ubc11-150, and Ubc1 were fully reduced with 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. An excess of either Ubc11-150 or Ubc1 was combined with UbCys and dialyzed at 4 °C against several changes of 100 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm CuCl2 at pH 7.5. The progress of disulfide complex formation was monitored by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and was considered complete when the reduced UbCys was exhausted. The protein solution was concentrated and purified by size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-75 with 25 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA at pH 7.5. Fractions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, and those containing pure UbCys-Ubc11-150 or UbCys-Ubc1 were pooled and concentrated for NMR experiments. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR samples of the UbCys-Ubc1 complexes with the following isotopic labeling schemes were used: [13C,15N]UbCys-Ubc11-150, UbCys-[Val,Leu,Ile-(δ1)-methyl-protonated-13C,2H,15N]Ubc1, and UbCys-[15N]Ubc1. All samples were prepared at pH 7.5 in 90% H2O/10% D2O (v/v) with final concentrations of 0.5 mm. NMR experiments were acquired at 35 °C on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer with a pulse field gradient triple resonance probe. Sequential assignments for the backbone residues for the [13C,2H,15N]Ubc1 component of UbCys-Ubc1 or the [13C,15N]UbCys portion of the UbCys-Ubc11-150 complex were made from HNCA and HNCACB experiments (23Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 99: 201-207Google Scholar). NMR spectra were processed with NMRPipe (24Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11527) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView (25Johnson B.A. Belvins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar) software on a Sun Ultra 10 work station. Titration of UbCys-[15N]Ubc1 with Ub—The equilibrium dissociation constant for Ub with the UbCys-Ubc1 complex was measured by NMR spectroscopy from 1H-15N HSQC experiments. A solution of the UbCys-[15N]Ubc1 complex (0.5 mm) was prepared in 25 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm NaCl at pH 7.5 in 10% D2O/90% H2O (v/v). Increasing amounts of unlabeled Ub (34.8 mm) to a maximum of 4.0 eq Ub:UbCys-Ubc1 were titrated into the sample. Chemical shift deviations were calculated for each isolated residue and analyzed by non-linear regression using the software Prism 4. All protein concentrations were determined in triplicate by amino acid analysis. The class II E2 enzyme Ubc1 from S. cerevisiae is a flexible two-domain protein comprising a canonical N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal UBA domain (Fig. 1). The catalytic domain of Ubc1 contains four α-helices (α1, Lys5-Ala13; α2, Leu102-Leu113; α3, Ala124-Leu131; α4 Arg134-Leu147) and four β-strands (β1, Ile22-Phe26; β2, His34-Leu40; β3, Lys51-Val58; β4, Lys68-Gln70), and the fold is typical for E2 proteins (26Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Xu Y. Chau V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13809-13817Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The catalytic cysteine (Cys88) used in the formation of the ubiquitin-E2 thioester intermediate is found in a relatively unstructured region below helix α2 and is the only cysteine in the protein. In Ubc1 and other class II E2 proteins, a C-terminal UBA domain consisting of three α-helices (α5, His170-Glu177; α6, Lys183-Arg191; α7, Asn204-Leu213) is present. Unlike the catalytic domain, the UBA domain is able to interact with ubiquitin in a non-covalent manner (15Merkley N. Shaw G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47139-47147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-E2 thioester intermediate formed in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway occurs between the C-terminal Gly76 carboxylate of ubiquitin and the side-chain thiol of Cys88. Based on a model of the Ubc1-ubiquitin thioester, the length of this linkage from Gly76 Cα to Cys88 Cα is ∼4.8 Å. In attempting to stabilize the linkage between Ubc1 and ubiquitin we wanted to preserve this distance while increasing the stability of this junction to a significant extent. To accomplish this, we replaced the ubiquitin Gly76 with a cysteine residue (UbCys) to form a disulfide linkage between the side chains of Cys76 in ubiquitin and Cys88 in Ubc1. In this process the geometry of Cys88 in Ubc1 should be unaffected. Ubc1 is an ideal candidate to model this disulfide reaction because its sequence contains exclusively the catalytic cysteine preventing any multiple ubiquitin adducts or disulfide exchange between different sites from occurring. Furthermore, in UbCys the cysteine side chain, being at the C terminus of the protein, should be flexible enough to adopt a preferred conformation that may be dictated by interaction with Ubc1. In modeling studies, the span between the Cα atoms of Cys76 in UbCys and Cys88 in Ubc1 was ∼4.9-5.5 Å, a distance similar to that observed in the native ubiquitin-E2 thioester. Formation of a Stable, Covalent Ubiquitin-E2 “Intermediate”—A disulfide-linked complex between UbCys and Ubc1 (UbCys-Ubc1) was formed by mixing fully reduced UbCys with an excess of fully reduced E2 protein in phosphate buffer containing a catalytic amount of Cu2+ as an oxidizing agent. In both cases the K93R mutant of Ubc1 and the K48R mutant of ubiquitin were used. These mutations are utilized to prevent autoubiquitination and polyubiquitin chain formation reactions from occurring, although these reactions were not a factor in our experiments. A disulfide complex between UbCys and a truncated version of Ubc1 lacking the C-terminal domain (Ubc11-150) was also synthesized in addition to the complex utilizing the full-length Ubc1 protein containing the C-terminal UBA domain. Formation of the UbCys-E2 complex occurred for both Ubc1 and Ubc11-150 over a period of 10 h at room temperature at which point the UbCys had been exhausted (Fig. 2A). In both experiments two products were observed, the UbCys-Ubc1 disulfide (or UbCys-Ubc11-150) as the major species and a minor amount of UbCys-UbCys disulfide. Over the same time period and under identical conditions there was little difference between the rates or extent of formation for UbCys-Ubc1 compared with that of the truncated UbCys-Ubc11-150 indicating that the C-terminal UBA domain in Ubc1 does not appear to enhance or inhibit formation of the disulfide. Both UbCys-Ubc1 and UbCys-Ubc11-150 could be readily purified by size exclusion chromatography, and their identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry (UbCys-Ubc1 MWobs 33,270.7, MWcalc 33,274.2; UbCys-Ubc11-150 MWobs 25,421.4, MWcalc 25,420.1). Because Ubc1 and Ubc11-150 contain a single cysteine residue, which is at the catalytic site, the UbCys-Ubc1 (and UbCys-Ubc11-150) disulfide must be formed using the catalytic site cysteine. The complexes were stable in solution for several weeks at room temperature. Formation of a disulfide-linked complex between UbCys and other E2 proteins was tested to assess the general applicability of this method. Both of the human E2 proteins, Ubc13 and UbcH7, formed stable disulfide complexes using the identical conditions for synthesis of UbCys-Ubc1. The sequence of Ubc13 has exclusively the catalytic cysteine and like Ubc1, the reaction afforded a single product, UbCys-Ubc13 (Fig. 2B) identified by mass spectrometry (UbCys-Ubc13 MWobs 26,180.8, MWcalc 26,180.2). A disulfide reaction between UbCys and UbcH7 yielded a single UbCys-UbcH7 disulfide, and multiubiquitin adducts were not observed by non-reducing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2B), although UbcH7 has a catalytic cysteine residue and two additional cysteine residues. UbCys-Ubc1 Mimics an Ubiquitin-E2 Thioester Intermediate—The instability of the ubiquitin-E2 thioester precluded three-dimensional structure determination of this species and limited characterization of the interface between the two proteins. NMR spectroscopy was used to identify residues in ubiquitin or Ubc11-150 that decreased in intensity during formation of the thioester. However, the stability of the thioester (∼1 h) did not allow sequence-specific assignment of 1H-15N resonances in the Ub-E2 thioester complex thereby limiting this approach (27Hamilton K.S. Ellison M.J. Barber K.R. Williams R.S. Huzil J.T. McKenna S. Ptak C. Glover M. Shaw G.S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because UbCys-Ubc1 is orders of magnitude more stable than its thioester counterpart this has now allowed the 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance (backbone) assignment of the 33-kDa UbCys-Ubc1 complex using conventional triple resonance techniques. Fig. 3 shows the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the UbCys-Ubc1 complex using 15N-labeled Ubc1 and unlabeled UbCys. In general the spectrum is similar to Ubc1 alone indicating that disulfide formation between UbCys and Ubc1 did not result in global conformational changes in Ubc1. In addition calculation of the Chemical Shift Index (CSI) using CA, CB, and C′ shifts (28Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar) indicated that there was little change in the secondary structure of Ubc1 upon formation of the disulfide complex. Although the inter-residue distance between the active site Cys88 in Ubc1 and the C-terminal Cys76 in UbCys is similar to that in the thioester, it is possible that intermolecular contacts between the two proteins could be modified. A subtle difference also exists between the UbCys-Ubc1 disulfide and the Ub-Ubc1 thioester. Because of the difference in covalent linkage, the UbCys-Ubc1 disulfide possesses a free C-terminal carboxylate that would normally be used to form the thioester bond. Previously, the ubiquitin-Ubc1 interface for the Ub-Ubc11-150 thioester has been partially characterized by following changes in line widths from 1H-15N HSQC spectra upon thioester formation (20Hamilton K.S. Ellison M.J. Shaw G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The protein-protein interface for the Ub-Ubc11-150 thioester complex was compared with that of UbCys-Ubc11-150 using 15N-labeled UbCys to probe the similarity of the two interfaces for the two complexes. In the absence of Ubc11-150, the 1H-15N HSQC for UbCys is well resolved with most resonances in similar positions to those found in the wild-type protein (Fig. 4A). Upon formation of UbCys-Ubc11-150 several resonances shift to new positions including Arg48, Val70, Leu71, Arg72, Leu73, and Cys76 in UbCys (Fig. 4B). These residues are essentially the same as those identified in the Ub-Ubc11-150 thioester (Fig. 4C) (20Hamilton K.S. Ellison M.J. Shaw G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and are found in a tight cluster in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra. Histograms of the chemical shift perturbations for both UbCys (Fig. 4D) and Ub (Fig. 4E) upon complex formation have similar patterns indicating that the same residues are affected in ubiquitin at the ubiquitin-E2 interface in both complexes. Minor variations between the histograms may be a result of the changes in experimental conditions (pH and ionic strength) upon sequential addition of the reaction mixture (E1 and ATP) to the Ub, E2 sample, which is required for the synthesis of the Ub-Ubc11-150 thioester in situ (20Hamilton K.S. Ellison M.J. Shaw G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The UbCys-Ubc11-150 on the other hand could be purified, and the pH and ionic strength was controlled. In addition, residual Ub correlations are present in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the thioester (Fig. 4C) as a result of incomplete thioester formation hindering the analysis of the chemical shift perturbations. Several of the Ubc1 amide resonances in the UbCys-Ubc1 disulfide complex underwent chemical shift changes (residues Lys74, Ser81, Cys88, Trp96, Ile100, Ala105, Ser115, and Asn119) or extensive line broadening (residues Ile87, Leu89, Ile91, and Leu92) as a result of complex formation. These are common to those reported to undergo a decrease in peak intensity in the Ub-Ubc1 thioester intermediate (27Hamilton K.S. Ellison M.J. Barber K.R. Williams R.S. Huzil J.T. McKenna S. Ptak C. Glover M. Shaw G.S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), indicating that the interacting surface in Ubc1 is similar to that of the thioester intermediate. The interacting residues in both Ubc1 and ubiquitin in the disulfide complex are similar to those observed in the thioester, indicating that the disulfide complex mimics the thioester intermediate, and a minimal influence on the E2 surface is created by the presence of a charged carboxylate group near the active site. Two major advantages exist for the UbCys-Ubc1 disulfide complex. First, the complex contains no side products such as uncomplexed ubiquitin or E2 that can hamper data analysis. For example, in the UbCys-Ubc1 complex, resonances resulting from residues in the “tail” region of ubiquitin (Val70, Leu71, Arg72, and Leu73) are completely absent (Fig. 4B) from their original positions in UbCys (Fig. 4A). However in the Ub-Ubc11-150 thioester (Fig. 4C), remnants of these peaks exist because formation of the thioester only occurs to ∼90% completion. Second, the stability of UbCys-Ubc11-150 has allowed backbone NMR assignments to be obtained for the UbCys component enabling identification of the new resonance positions in the UbCys-Ubc11-150 complex. This was not possible in the thioester due to hydrolysis of the Ub-Ubc11-150 thioester bond under aqueous conditions. Overall, the formation of the UbCys-Ubc11-150 complex not only mimics the Ub-Ubc11-150 thioester structure but also facilitates its analysis. Ubc1 Coordinates Two Ubiquitin Molecules at Different Sites—In addition to the catalytic domain, Ubc1 has a C-terminal UBA domain that non-covalently binds ubiquitin (15Merkley N. Shaw G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47139-47147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). UBA domains bind mono- or polyubiquitin chains with a dissociation constant between 300 and 500 μm (29Mueller T.D. Kamionka M. Feigon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11926-11936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Ryu K.S. Lee K.J. Bae S.H. Kim B.K. Kim K.A. Choi B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36621-36627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Ubc1 has the potential to coordinate two ubiquitin molecules simultaneously, suggesting that during the Ub-Ubc1 thioester formation process, it is possible that the UBA domain might guide or perturb the interaction of ubiquitin with Ubc1. Alternatively, the UBA domain could also interact with the thioester-bound ubiquitin once the bond is formed at Cys88 of Ubc1. Identification of either of these steps would provide insight into the first step of polyubiquitin chain formation. The UbCys-Ubc1 disulfide allowed us to examine the ubiquitin binding properties of the UBA domain of Ubc1 in the UbCys-Ubc1 disulfide complex. A similar investigation of the ubiquitin binding properties of the UBA in the Ub-Ubc1 thioester complex has not been possible because of the transient nature of the thioester conjugate. We probed the UbCys-Ubc1 complex to determine whether this enzyme could coordinate two ubiquitin molecules concurrently. The UbCys-[15N]Ubc1 complex was titrated with unlabeled ubiquitin, and each addition was followed by 1H-15N HSQC spectroscopy. Fig. 5 shows a portion of the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of UbCys-[15N]Ubc1 in which resonances Gly180, Asn201, and Asn207 are perturbed upon ubiquitin binding (Fig. 5A). In addition, residues Glu177, Ser178, and Glu211 in the UBA domain of the UbCys-Ubc1 complex are strongly affected by ubiquitin binding (Fig. 5B). Several other residues (His170, Asp199, Asn203, Thr205, Ala206, Arg208, Ile209, and Leu214) in the UBA domain of the UbCys-Ubc1 complex underwent smaller but significant chemical shift changes. Overall the pattern of residues most affected in UbCys-Ubc1, upon interaction with ubiquitin, was specific to the UBA domain of Ubc1. This is remarkably similar to that observed in Ubc1 alone (Fig. 5, B and C). To quantify the interaction of ubiquitin with the UbCys-Ubc1 complex, the 15N chemical shift changes were analyzed by non-linear least-squares fitting (Fig. 6A) for a number of affected residues. This resulted in a dissociation constant of 259 ± 105 μm. The dissociation constant calculated from 15N chemical shift changes for Ubc1 titrated with Ub was 280 ± 69 μm using comparable residues. When the data for the ubiquitin interaction with UbCys-Ubc1 were normalized and compared with the interaction of ubiquitin with Ubc1 alone, the curves were nearly superimposable, reinforcing the similarity of the strength and stoichiometries of the interactions (Fig. 6B).Fig. 6Ubiquitin interacts in a similar manner with both Ubc1 and UbCys-Ubc1.

The mechanism in which these polyubiquitin chains are assembled is unclear. Two possibilities exist in which either the polyubiquitin chain is constructed on the E2 protein and transferred to an E3 or substrate, or the chain is built on the target substrate. In both cases the ubiquitin-E2 thioester complex is a key intermediate in this process. The transient nature of this thioester species has not allowed its three-dimensional structure to be determined or permitted direct experimentation showing how the thioester participates in the assembly of polyubiquitin chains. To date, the best structural analysis of the ubiquitin-E2 thioester complex has been found from peak intensity changes in NMR experiments upon thioester formation. This has indicated that the surface on ubiquitin at the protein-protein interface encompasses residues Val70-Gly76 and Arg48 (27Hamilton K.S. Ellison M.J. Barber K.R. Williams R.S. Huzil J.T. McKenna S. Ptak C. Glover M. Shaw G.S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the current work, the ubiquitin-E2 disulfide is the first thioester intermediate synthesized that mimics this surface. In the disulfide the ubiquitin surface includes residues Arg48, Val70-Leu73, and Cys76, which are common not only to those in the thioester but also in the UBA domain interface. This indicates the ubiquitin-E2 disulfide is a suitable mimic of the transient ubiquitin-E2 thioester. The ubiquitin-Ubc1 disulfide complex is straightforward to synthesize in high yields and may be purified from any remaining starting materials by size exclusion chromatography. The product is stable for several weeks at room temperature. This is a remarkable improvement from other attempts to stabilize the ubiquitin-E2 linkage. For example, mutation of the active site cysteine in the E2, HsUbc2b, to a serine residue has allowed formation of an ester linkage between ubiquitin and the E2 (31Miura T. Klaus W. Gsell B. Miyamoto C. Senn H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 32Sullivan M.L. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8777-8780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although the resulting complex could be purified, it was short-lived at pH 6.7 and unstable at alkaline pH impeding any attempts to model the association of the two proteins or to use the complex for biochemical characterization (31Miura T. Klaus W. Gsell B. Miyamoto C. Senn H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, chemical shift analysis revealed that residues Val70-Gly76 and Lys48 on ubiquitin were most significantly perturbed upon HsUbc2b binding, a similar observation to that obtained for the ubiquitin-Ubc1 thioester and the disulfide complex described here. An alternative procedure traps the thioester intermediate by reducing it to a hemithioacetal with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). This approach was successful in stabilizing the complex between ubiquitin and an ubiquitin hydrolase for several days allowing for structural characterization by NMR spectroscopy (34Rajesh S. Sakamoto T. Iwamoto-Sugai M. Shibata T. Kohno T. Ito Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9242-9253Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our method for mimicking the ubiquitin-E2 thioester by forming a stable disulfide complex with S. cerevisiae Ubc1, human Ubc13, and UbcH7 E2 proteins can be used for mechanistic or structural studies with ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Approximately 20% of E2 conjugating enzymes contain exclusively the catalytic cysteine residue (35Winn P.J. Battey J.N. Schleinkofer K. Banerjee A. Wade R.C. Proteins. 2005; 58: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and this procedure can be used as described in this work. For other conjugating enzymes such as UbcH7, which contains multiple cysteine residues, site-directed mutagenesis may be required to mutate the non-catalytic cysteine residues. In addition, the generality of this procedure illustrates that the disulfide complex designed could be used to investigate the intermediates between ubiquitin and other ubiquitin pathway enzymes, for example, E1 enzymes or HECT E3 ligases. A unique feature of Ubc1 is that it is a flexible two-domain protein that consists of catalytic and UBA domains, representative of several other class II E2 proteins. Upon titration of UbCys-Ubc1 with Ub, the UBA domain is able to non-covalently bind a second ubiquitin molecule. Therefore, Ubc1 has the ability to bind an ubiquitin molecule as a thioester at the active site of the catalytic domain and a second ubiquitin at the C-terminal UBA domain. The ability of Ubc1 to interact with two ubiquitin proteins may explain how Ubc1 and its related class II E2 proteins can build or manipulate polyubiquitin chains. The presence of a UBA domain affects the chain-building properties of two homologous class II E2 proteins in vitro, Ubc1 and E2-25K. Ubc1 undergoes autoubiquitination by assembling polyubiquitin chains at Lys93 near the Cys88 active site (12Hodgins R. Gwozd C. Arnason R. Cummings M. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28766-28771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitin chains comprising up to 10-12 ubiquitin molecules are assembled in the absence of the UBA domain. Shorter chains averaging only four ubiquitin molecules are built when full-length Ubc1 is utilized. A flexible tether (22Goto N.K. Gardner K.H. Mueller G.A. Willis R.C. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar amino acids) links the catalytic and UBA domains in Ubc1. This tether is long enough to allow the UBA domain to reach the thioester-bound ubiquitin thereby either aiding or interfering with thioester formation or polyubiquitin chain formation. However, our data show that the UBA domain does not interfere with disulfide formation. Furthermore, the affinity of the UBA domain for ubiquitin is not affected by the presence of a covalently attached ubiquitin at the catalytic site. This indicates that any interaction between the thioester-bound ubiquitin and the UBA domain is either very weak or does not occur. It is possible that the UBA domain may perturb the chain elongation step by potentially interacting with the growing thioester-bound polyubiquitin chain upon assembly of longer polyubiquitin chains at the thioester or on Lys93. A related class II E2 protein, E2-25K, has a flexible two-domain structure similar to Ubc1 and does not autoubiquitinate itself. Instead unanchored polyubiquitin chains are detected in vitro (14Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the UBA domain in E2-25K results in termination of polyubiquitin chain formation, although ubiquitin-E2 thioester formation proceeds (36Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Both of these observations are consistent with our observations that the UBA domain in Ubc1 does not affect initial thioester formation and must be involved in construction of polyubiquitin chains. Further structural characterization of the ubiquitin-Ubc1 disulfide should provide some insight into how the UBA domain influences polyubiquitin chain assembly by Ubc1 and other related class II E2 proteins. From a mechanistic perspective, the ability of Ubc1 to bind two ubiquitin molecules may allow the thioester-bound acceptor ubiquitin (Gly76) to be in close proximity to the UBA-bound (donor) ubiquitin, which contains the nucleophilic side-chain ϵ-NH2 of Lys48. Recently, mechanisms for the construction of polyubiquitin chains have been proposed in which the acceptor ubiquitin is near the donor ubiquitin in other E2 complexes. Assembly of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains by the canonical E2 (Ubc13) proceeds through a heterodimer of Ubc13 with an inert E2 variant (Mms2) that non-covalently binds ubiquitin (37McKenna S. Hu J. Moraes T. Xiao W. Ellison M.J. Spyracopoulos L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7922-7930Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A thioester formed between Ubc13 and ubiquitin accepts a second ubiquitin from Mms2, building up a Lys63-linked chain. The Mms2-Ubc13 complex binds the two ubiquitin molecules required for chain building, keeping them in close proximity. A mechanism for multiubiquitin chain synthesis has been proposed for S. cerevisiae Cdc34 (Ubc3), which has been observed to self-associate in vitro. Dimerization of the Ubc3 is driven by formation of the ubiquitin thioester, and this Ub-Ubc3 thioester dimer with or without E3 participation directs polyubiquitin assembly (38Varelas X. Ptak C. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5388-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Both of these mechanisms involve association of two ubiquitin molecules by dimerization of an ubiquitin-E2 thioester or an E2 thioester and an inert E2 variant. Similar to the mechanisms discussed above, self-association of a glutathione S-transferase-tagged E2-25K protein lacking its UBA domain initiates assembly of polyubiquitin chains, thus reversing the effect of deleting the UBA domain (36Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This may indicate that in E2-25K and Ubc1 the UBA domain and ubiquitin binding could facilitate dimerization of these E2 proteins in a manner similar to Ubc13-Mms2 or Ubc3. Although dimerization of Ubc1 has not been observed (21Merkley N. Shaw G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) our design of the ubiquitin-E2 disulfide thioester mimic is well positioned to probe the potential association of the Ub-Ubc1 intermediate and provide further information on polyubiquitin chain building.

As a paradigm for cell engineering, we have studied the molecular mechanisms by which AR42J cells become β-cells. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), implicated in a myriad of developmental pathways, have not been well studied in insulin-positive differentiation. We found that the canonical intracellular mediators of BMP signaling, Smad-1 and Smad-8, were significantly elevated in AR42J cells undergoing insulin-positive differentiation in response to exendin-4 treatment, suggesting a role for BMP signaling in β-cell formation. Similarly, endogenous BMP-2 ligand and ALK-1 receptor (activin receptor-like kinase-1; known to activate Smads 1 and 8) mRNAs were specifically up-regulated in exendin-4-treated AR42J cells. Surprisingly, Smad-1 and Smad-8 levels were suppressed by the addition of BMP-soluble receptor inhibition of BMP ligand binding to its receptor. Here, insulin-positive differentiation was also ablated. BMP-2 ligand antisense also strongly inhibited Smad-1 and Smad-8 expression, again with the abolition of insulin-positive differentiation. These results demonstrate a previously unrecognized key role for BMP signaling in mediating insulin-positive differentiation through the intracellular Smad signaling pathway. In short, BMP signaling may represent a novel downstream target of exendin-4 (glucagon-like peptide 1) signaling and potentially serve as an upstream regulator of transforming growth factor-β isoform signaling to differentiate the acinar-like AR42J cells into insulin-secreting cells.

Type 1 diabetes is an insulin deficiency state due to pancreatic destruction of β-cells caused by autoimmunity. Several approaches to treat diabetes are being pursued, such as islet cell transplantation, pancreas transplantation, and genetic manipulation. However, a key alternative strategy is cellular engineering to manipulate progenitor cells to become β-cells, allowing cellular therapy to cure diabetes. As a paradigm for cell engineering, we have used exendin-4 treatment of AR42J cells, a fairly plastic acinar cell carcinoma-derived cell line, as a model for studying the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; ALK, activin receptor-like kinase; GLP, glucagon-like peptide; TGF, transforming growth factor. signaling in the induction of insulin-positive differentiation. Exendin-4, a peptide from Helodermatidae venom, is a novel insulinotropic agent and a long acting analogue of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). It interacts with endocrine pancreatic islet GLP-1 receptors, inducing a stimulatory effect on insulin secretion. Over the past few decades significant progress has been made in our understanding of the biological function of BMPs, which have been found to regulate a myriad of developmental and differentiation process in the embryo, including epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, cell fate specification, dorsoventral patterning, and apoptosis as well as the secretion of extracellular matrix components (1Hogan B.L.

The TGF-β isoforms proper (TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3) are also included in this superfamily. The canonical pathway for the pleiotropic biological effects of BMPs is signaling through to the nucleus via ligand-induced hetero-oligomerization of type I (activin receptor-like kinases ALK-2, ALK-3, and ALK-6) and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors (BMP receptor type II and the activin receptors ActR-IIA and ActR-IIB) and their downstream effectors, known as Smad-1, Smad-5, and Smad-8 (6Yamashita H.

Upon ligand stimulation, these receptor-regulated Smads become phosphorylated by activated type I receptor kinases and form heteromeric complexes with the shared common mediator Smad-4. Subsequently, these Smad complexes translocate into the nucleus, where they regulate the transcription of target genes (10Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar, 11Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that exendin-4-induced differentiation of the β-cell-like phenotype in AR42J cells requires TGF-β isoform (TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3) signaling initially in the form of Smad-2 and followed by Smad-3. Smad-3 appears to play a secondary role in suppressing further increases in insulin mRNA and may facilitate β-cell-like maturation (12Yew K.H. Prasadan K.L. Preuett B.L. Hembree M.J. McFall C.R.

Given the frequent interplay of function between TGF-β isoform signaling and BMP signaling, here we studied the possible role of BMP signaling in exendin-4-induced differentiation of AR42J cells into insulin-positive cells. We observed a hierarchy of BMP signaling to TGF-β isoform signaling. Taken together with previous findings, our results suggest that GLP-1 stimulation of insulin-positive differentiation in AR42J cells acts first via BMP ligands and Smads, followed by TGF-β isoform signaling. Reagents and Kits—Exendin-4 was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The RNeasy mini kit, the Sensiscript reverse transcriptase kit, and the QIAquick gel extraction kit were all from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). AmpliTaq Gold with GeneAmp 10× PCR Buffer and MgCl2 solution was from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The F-12K nutrient mixture (Kaighn's modification) was from Invitrogen. Antibodies/Ligands—BMP-soluble receptor 1B (BMP-R1B) antibodies from Sigma-Aldrich were at a concentration of 3 μg/ml, which is defined as the effective concentration for inhibiting alkaline phosphatase production. In additional experiments, BMP-2 (obtained from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was measured by its ability through three different doses (10 pg/ml, 100 pg/ml, and 1 ng/ml) to rescue or augment the system. TGF-β1, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, was added at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml, which was chosen with reference to the previous synergistic effect data as those required to enhance TGF-β activity. Morpholino Oligos—Antisense morpholino oligos complementary to Smad-1 (5′-AGGATGGACGACATGACTGGCACTC-3′), ALK-1 (5′-CCTTCGGAAAATCCCCAGGGTCATG-3′), BMP-2 (5′-TCGACCTTTAGGAGACCGCAGTCCG-3′), and missense control oligos were obtained from Gene Tools (Philomath, OR). The scrape delivery method was performed, and the scraped cells along with morpholino oligos were incubated over the weekend in a 5% CO2 incubator, which gives the best result in our system. List of PCR Primer Sequences—Given here are the PCR primer sequences for the following genes: β-actin, 5′-CTAAGGCCAACCGTGAAAAG-3′ (left primer) and 5′-ACCCTCATAGATGGGCACAG-3′ (right primer); insulin II, 5′-GGGAGCGTGGATTCTTCTAC-3′ (left primer) and 5′-CAGTGCCAAGGTCTGAAGGT-3′ (right primer); Pdx-1, 5′-GAAATCCACCAAAGCTCACG-3′ (left primer) and 5′-GAATTCCTTCTCCAGCTCCA-3′ (right primer); Pax-4, 5′-CTCGAATTGCCCAGCTAAAG-3′ (left primer) and 5′-CCCGAAGGACTCGATTGATA-3′ (right primer); Pax-6, 5′-TCAGCTTGGTGGTGTCTTTG-3′ (left primer) and 5′-ACTCACACATCCGTTGGACA-3′ (right primer); Smad-1, 5′-CGGAACTGCAACTACCACCA-3′ (left primer) and 5′-GACTGCGCCAGTAGCTGAGC-3′ (right primer); Smad-5, 5′-AACTTTCACCATGGCTTCCA-3′ (left primer) and 5′-CCAGAAGCTGAGCAAACTCC-3′ (right primer); and Smad-8, 5′-GTATCATCGCCAGGATGTCA-3′ (left primer) and 5′-TGTGGGGAGCCCATCTGAGT-3′ (right primer). Cell Culture and Treatment—AR42J cells, purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), were grown in Kaighn's modification of Ham's F-12K medium with 2 mm l-glutamine, 250 μg/ml amphotericin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under a humidified condition of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were plated at a density of ∼105 cells/ml in 12-well plates. Morpholino antisense or missense control was added separately to culture media at 20 μm. Cells were then cultured with exendin-4 at doses of 1, 5, and 10 pm for 3 days. Reverse Transcription PCR (Non-quantitative)—Total RNA was extracted from cells and treated with DNase. RNA was subjected to reverse transcription. cDNA was then amplified by PCR for 40 cycles. All PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel. The PCR cycles were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. SYBR Green Real Time Quantitative PCR—PCR amplifications were performed using a Bio-Rad iCycler® (Hercules, CA) sequence detection system. Reactions were performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture that included 10× AmpliTaq Gold buffer, 25 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dNTPs, 10× SYBR Green, AmpliTaq Gold polymerase, distilled H2O, DNA template, and 10 μm each primer. Amplification was performed by initial polymerase activation for 10 min at 95 °C and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 20 s, and elongation for 30 s at 72 °C. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated on a 10% Tris-HCl Ready Gel® (Bio-Rad), transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with a β-actin antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at a dilution of 1:5000, a Smad-1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) at 4 μg/ml, an ALK-1 antibody (Abcam) at 0.2 μg/ml, or a BMP-2 antibody (Abcam) at 2 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the membranes were washed twice for 15 min in washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with a secondary anti-mouse (β-actin/BMP-2), anti-rabbit (Smad-1), or anti-goat (ALK-1) antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed three times for 15 min in washing buffer, and immunoreactivity was normalized by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences ECL Plus kit, RPN2132) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Involvement of BMP Smads in Insulin-positive Differentiation—We found previously (12Yew K.H. Prasadan K.L. Preuett B.L. Hembree M.J. McFall C.R. Benjes C.L. Crowley A.R. Sharp S.L. Li Z. Tulachan S.S. Mehta S.S. Gittes G.K. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2824-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that TGF-β isoforms and their Smads (-2 and -3) were essential for mature β-cell formation from AR42J cells treated with exendin-4 (12Yew K.H. Prasadan K.L. Preuett B.L. Hembree M.J. McFall C.R. Benjes C.L. Crowley A.R. Sharp S.L. Li Z. Tulachan S.S. Mehta S.S. Gittes G.K. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2824-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, we also wished to study a potential role for BMP signaling in the induction of this insulin-positive differentiation. Because Smad-1, Smad-5, and Smad-8 are receptor-regulated Smads in the BMP signaling pathway, we first examined the possible involvement of those Smads in the insulin-positive differentiation of AR42J cells induced by exogenous exendin-4. Interestingly, Smad-1 and Smad-8 mRNA levels were greatly elevated in response to exendin-4 treatment, whereas Smad-5 mRNA levels dropped precipitously from the base line (Fig. 1). These changes are reminiscent of those seen for Smad-3 and Smad-2, respectively (12Yew K.H. Prasadan K.L. Preuett B.L. Hembree M.J. McFall C.R. Benjes C.L. Crowley A.R. Sharp S.L. Li Z. Tulachan S.S.

Role of BMP Ligands and BMP Receptors in Exendin-4-induced β-Cell Differentiation—Simple PCR was performed to screen for BMP ligands as well as potential type I receptors (Fig. 2). ALK-1 is a type I TGF-β superfamily receptor that is thought to activate only Smad-1 and Smad-5 and transmits BMP-like signals (even though it is thought to serve as a type I receptor for TGF-β isoforms) (9Miyazawa K. Shinozaki M. Hara T. Furuya T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1191-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 18Oh S.P. Seki T. Goss K.A. Imamura T. Yi Y. Donahoe P.K. Li L.

ALK-3 and ALK-6 (also termed BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB, respectively) are type I receptors for BMPs that activate Smad-1, Smad-5, and Smad-8. BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-7 ligands bind with high affinity to ALK-3 and ALK-6, whereas BMP-7 only binds to the ALK-2 receptor, which then activates Smad-1, Smad-5, and Smad-8 (6Yamashita H. Ten Dijke P.

Biosci. 2003; 8: s275-s284Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The key result was that ALK-1 was up-regulated from undetectable at base line to strongly positive in the exendin-4-treated AR42J cells. ALK-2, ALK-3, and ALK-6 were present at base line and then decreased with the exendin-4. BMP-2 was negative at base line and then up-regulated with the exendin-4 treatment. BMP-4 and BMP-7 were expressed in both base-line and exendin-4-treated cells. It is possible that BMP-2, which turns on in response to the stimulus, could then form a heterodimer with BMP-4 or BMP-7 and become stimulatory, possibly signaling through ALK-1. BMP-4 or BMP-7 alone may be inhibitory. (Fig. 2) We then used BMP-soluble receptors as BMP ligand inhibitors to study a potential role for endogenous BMP signaling in exendin-4-induced insulin-positive differentiation of AR42J cells. BMP soluble receptors inhibited insulin expression and also blocked PDX-1 and Pax-4 expression similarly as in our previous findings with TGF-β-neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 3A–C) (12Yew K.H. Prasadan K.L. Preuett B.L. Hembree M.J. McFall C.R. Benjes C.L. Crowley A.R. Sharp S.L. Li Z. Tulachan S.S. Mehta S.S. Gittes G.K. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2824-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Then, mRNA levels of Smad-1, Smad-2, Smad-3, Smad-5, and Smad-8 in the BMP-soluble receptor-treated cells were tested (Fig. 3, D–H). There was suppression of Smad-1 and Smad-8 mRNA, implying that the soluble receptors had blocked BMP downstream signaling (Fig. 3, D and H). Prevention of the normal rise in Smad-3 mRNA that occurs in response to TGF-β isoform signaling (Fig. 3F) suggests that BMP signaling is acting upstream of TGF-β isoform signaling. In Smad-2 and Smad-5, the decrease that normally occurs with exendin-4 was not affected (Fig. 3, E and G). ALK-1 is an activator of BMP Smads, although it can bind TGF-β isoforms and Müllerian inhibiting substances. We used ALK-1 morpholino antisense and blocked insulin-positive differentiation and the accompanying PDX-1 and Pax-4 up-regulation (Fig. 4, A–C). Elevations in Smad-1 and Smad-8 mRNA were again inhibited (Fig. 4, D and H), whereas Smad-5 mRNA levels were barely affected (Fig. 4G). Interestingly, Smad-2 suppression was unaffected (Fig. 4E), but elevations in Smad-3 mRNA levels were blocked (Fig. 4F). These results suggest that ALK-1 morpholino blocks BMP Smad activation, which then leads secondarily to inhibition of the elevation of Smad-3 mRNA levels. These results would again imply that TGF-β isoform signaling is downstream of BMP signaling. To confirm the effects of the morpholino ring antisense on Smad levels, Western blotting was performed in morpholino ring antisense-treated and sense-treated controls, confirming sequence-specific effects in target Smads by antisense (Figs. 4I, 5I, and 7H).FIGURE 5Effect of BMP-2 antisense on insulin-positive differentiation. Insulin II mRNA (A) was eliminated by BMP-2 antisense. Similar suppression was seen for PDX-1 (B) and Pax-4 mRNAs (C). Marked suppression of the BMP-2 downstream Smads, Smad-1 (D) and Smad-8 (H), was also seen. Exendin-4-induced suppression of Smad-2 (E) and Smad-5 (G) had minimal effect, but the suppression of Smad-3 mRNA (F) had great effect (means ± S.D., n = 4).

Insulin II mRNA (A) levels were ablated by Smad-1 antisense. Similar effects were seen on PDX-1 (B) and Pax-4 mRNA (C). No change was seen for Smad-2 (D) and Smad-3 mRNA (E). Smad-1 antisense blocked changes in Smad-8 mRNA (G) but not in Smad-5 mRNA (F) (means ± S.D., n = 4).

Here again we saw complete suppression of insulin II, PDX-1, and Pax-4 mRNA (Fig. 5, A–C), consistent with the soluble BMP receptor data shown earlier. For the Smads, there was a strong suppression of Smad-1 and Smad-8 mRNA levels (Fig. 5, D and H), but no effect on Smad-2 and Smad-5 suppression (Fig. 5, E and G). Smad-3 was suppressed back to base line (Fig. 5F), which is again consistent with TGF-β isoform signaling being down-stream of BMP signaling. Rescue Effects of Exogenous BMP-2 on Insulin-positive Differentiation—Because BMP is known to act through different receptors and can exert different effects at different concentrations, arescue-type experiment was performed with three different doses of exogenous BMP-2 after BMP-2 antisense treatment to determine the potential for either a rescue effect or a supraphysiologic effect and to confirm the specificity of the BMP antisense experiments. The rescue dose of 10 pg/ml BMP-2 showed a complete rescue even beyond that of the missense controls, suggesting that endogenous BMPs are likely to be important. However, the lowest tested dose of 1 pg/ml BMP-2 does not get a rescue effect (data not shown). Interestingly, higher concentrations did not have an effect either. The loss of effect at higher and lower doses does suggest that the BMP-2 effect is a specific and important endogenous effect rather than a simple pharmacologic effect (Fig. 6). Smad-1 Is Necessary in the Hierarchy of β-Cell Differentiation—Initially, ALK-1 mRNA was found to be up-regulated with exendin treatment in AR42J cells (Fig. 2). ALK-1 mainly works through the phosphorylation of Smad-1 and Smad-5, but not Smad-8. Because Smad-1 mRNA was up-regulated and Smad-5 down-regulated (Fig. 1), Smad-1 seemed to be a likely candidate in mediating ALK-1 effects. We found that there was a strong inhibition of insulin II, PDX-1, and Pax-4 mRNA with Smad-1 antisense (Fig. 7, A–C). In all cases, when insulin mRNA levels were reduced a concomitant block of the key pro-insulin transcription factors PDX-1 and Pax-4 was also seen. Interestingly, the typical changes in Smad-2 and Smad-3 mRNA levels seen with exendin-4 treatment were not seen with Smad-1 antisense (Fig. 7, D and E), consistent with our theory that BMP signaling is upstream of TGF-β isoform signaling. Additionally, even with TGF-β blockage, Smad-2 was always down-regulated previously whenever AR42J cells were exposed to exendin-4. The failure of Smad-2 mRNA expression levels to go down despite exendin-4 suggests that the mechanism for Smad-2 down-regulation is through BMP-mediated Smad-1 activation. With the Smad-1 antisense, although the Smad-8 mRNA levels were blocked (Fig. 7G) the Smad-5 mRNA levels did not go down (Fig. 7F), consistent with the possibility that there is a direct competition between Smad-1 and Smad-5 similar to that suggested earlier for Smad-2 and Smad-3 (12Yew K.H. Prasadan K.L. Preuett B.L. Hembree M.J. McFall C.R. Benjes C.L. Crowley A.R. Sharp S.L. Li Z. Tulachan S.S. Mehta S.S. Gittes G.K. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2824-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Hierarchy between BMP and TGF-β Isoform Signaling—Loss of insulin-positive differentiation with Smad-1 antisense could be rescued with exogenous TGF-β1, suggesting that BMP or Smad-1 signaling is upstream of TGF-β isoforms (Fig. 8A–C). Also, these results suggest that a key role of Smad-1 is to activate, directly or indirectly, TGF-β isoform signaling. Smad-2 and Smad-5 were elevated with the Smad-1 antisense (Fig. 7, D and F), but that effect was mostly reversed with the addition of exogenous TGF-β1 (Fig. 8, D and F). Conclusion—Understanding the mechanisms of the TGF-β superfamily signaling cascade in the possible regulation of insulin-positive differentiation has high importance for our goal of engineering glucose-regulated insulin-producing cells for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Our results show that there is a novel synergistic activity of TGF-β and BMP Smad proteins as part of an intracellular signaling pathway that plays an important role during insulin-positive differentiation of AR42J cells. Based on the observed patterns of Smad protein expression, Gupta and co-workers (13Vrljicak P. Myburgh D. Ryan A.K. van Rooijen M.A. Mummery C.L. Gupta I.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F625-F633Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) speculated that specific individual or combinations of Smads may play different roles in lineage selection during kidney development. The expression of various Smad proteins has been shown in pancreatic islets and in glucagon cells by reverse transcription-PCR and by immunostaining (14Brorson M. Hougaard D.M. Nielsen J.H. Tornehave D. Larsson L.I. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 116: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). BMPs and TGF-βs have been strongly implicated in many embryologic and cell differentiation pathways. Jiang et al. (15Jiang F.X. Stanley E.G. Gonez L.J. Harrison L.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 753-760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that BMP induces embryonic pancreatic epithelia to form insulin-positive cell colonies. Thus, we hypothesized that BMP signaling may play a role in the insulin-positive differentiation of AR42J cells. Our results support the idea that BMP-2 ligands play an important endogenous role in this process and that BMPs sit high on a hierarchy above TGF-β isoforms in the initiation of insulin-positive differentiation. Previously, we quantified BMP Smads, namely Smad-1, Smad-5, and Smad-8, in TGF-β neutralizing antibody-treated AR42J cells and found that there were essentially no changes in any of the BMP Smads (12Yew K.H. Prasadan K.L. Preuett B.L. Hembree M.J. McFall C.R. Benjes C.L. Crowley A.R. Sharp S.L. Li Z. Tulachan S.S. Mehta S.S. Gittes G.K. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2824-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which is consistent with TGF-β signaling being downstream of BMP signaling. Here, with the BMP soluble receptor we showed that the Smad-2 decrease that normally occurs with exendin-4 treatment was not affected, whereas the elevation in Smad-3 that occurs in response to exendin-4 was completely blocked. These results suggest a novel overlap of BMP and TGF-β isoform pathways with BMP upstream of TGF-β isoform signaling, which, in turn, appears to be specifically responsible for Smad-3 up-regulation. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that BMP may be necessary to stimulate these precursor cells to become endocrine-committed progenitor cells that then proceed further to differentiate under the influence of Smad-3 into mature β-cells. Overall, there appears to be a synergistic interaction of BMP and TGF-β signaling to push AR42J cells toward an insulin-positive fate. To understand the role of Smad-1 in mouse development, Robertson and co-workers (16Tremblay K.D. Dunn N.R. Robertson E.J. Development. 2001; 128: 3609-3621PubMed Google Scholar) generated a Smad-1 null mutant mouse. They found an essential role for Smad-1-dependent signals in primordial germ cell specification (16Tremblay K.D. Dunn N.R. Robertson E.J. Development. 2001; 128: 3609-3621PubMed Google Scholar), but because of early lethality there was no potential for analysis of pancreatic development. Our results with Smad-1 antisense and the rescue of Smad-1 antisense by exogenous TGF-β1 suggest that BMP signaling activates Smad-2 and Smad-3 pathways, possibly through the induction of the release of TGF-β isoforms from the cells in a paracrine or autocrine manner. It was interesting that the BMP-soluble receptor did not block Smad-2 down-regulation, whereas Smad-1 antisense did. These results suggest that BMP ligand-independent pathways, which may also activate Smad-1, may play a more important role in the decrease of Smad-2 levels. We found previously that Smad-2, which is highly expressed in untreated AR42J cells, was necessary for insulin-positive differentiation. A role for Smad-5 down-regulation in insulin-positive differentiation is also unclear. The Hammerschmidt group (17Dick A. Meier A. Hammerschmidt M. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 216: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) has shown distinct roles for Smad-1 and Smad-5 during dorsoventral patterning of the zebrafish embryo. Their data suggest that Smad-1 acts later than Smad-5 and is itself a transcriptional target of Smad-5-mediated BMP-2 signaling (17Dick A. Meier A. Hammerschmidt M. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 216: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the decrease in Smad-5 may disinhibit or otherwise allow Smad-1 to up-regulate and/or become activated."

Deacylated tRNA in the P-site stimulates multiple turnover GTPase activity of EF-G. We suggest that the allosteric signal from the peptidyltransferase center that activates EF-G may involve the alteration in the conformation of elongation factor binding center of the ribosome. The latter consists of the moveable GTPase-associated center and the sarcin-ricin loop that keeps its position on the ribosome during translation elongation. The position of the GTPase-associated center was altered by mutagenesis. An insertion of additional base pair at positions C1030/G1124 was lethal and affected function of EF-G, but not that of EF-Tu. Structure probing revealed a putative allosteric signal pathway connecting the P-site with the binding site of the elongation factors. The results are consistent with the different structural requirements for EF-G and EF-Tu function, where the integrity of the path between the peptidyltransferase center and both GTPase-associated center and sarcin-ricin loop is important for EF-G binding.

The ribosome is a large molecular machine for protein synthesis. During the elongation EF 1The abbreviations used are: EF, elongation factor; GAC, GTPase-associated center; SRL, sarcin-ricin loop; GMP-PNP, guanosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate trisodium salt; DMS, dimethyl sulfate.-Tu brings aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site, and its GTPase activity is stimulated by recognition of the mRNA codon by the aminoacyl-tRNA anticodon at the decoding center of the small subunit. EF-G acts after completion of peptide transfer at the peptidyltransferase center of the large subunit. Before the peptidyltransferase reaction, the growing peptide is attached to the 3′-end of the tRNA bound to the P-site, whereas the aminoacyl-tRNA is located in the A-site. After peptide transfer, the A-site carries the peptidyl-tRNA, whereas the P-site holds the deacylated tRNA. This is the state that should be recognized by EF-G. It has been reported that deacylated tRNA in the P-site stimulates multiple turnover GTPase activity of EF-G, but that peptidyl-tRNA does not (1Lill R. Robertson J.M. Wintermeyer W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3933-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2Zavialov A.V. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2003; 114: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This stimulation is attributed to the enhanced binding of EF-G to the ribosome (2Zavialov A.V. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2003; 114: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The P-site is located more than 70 Å away from the binding site of the elongation factors. Thus, an intriguing question is how can information from the P-site be transmitted across half the width of the ribosome? We believe that to answer this question one must seek for elements that are located between the peptidyltransferase center and the elongation factor binding site, the latter consisting of the GTPase-associated center (GAC) and the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL) (3Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). One can expect that some of the relevant elements should be mobile, as they have to transfer an allosteric signal by its movement relative to the rest of the large subunit. The SRL interacts with the switch regions of the elongation factors close to the GTP binding site (4Valle M. Zavialov A. Li W. Stagg S.M. Sengupta J. Nielsen R.C. Nissen P. Harvey S.C. Ehrenberg M. Frank J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and it is likely that it is involved in the activation of GTP hydrolysis. However, in all available atomic structures of large ribosomal subunits from various organisms, as well as in cryoelectron microscopic reconstitutions, the SRL always occupies the same position. The GAC, in contrast, is moveable (4Valle M. Zavialov A. Li W. Stagg S.M. Sengupta J. Nielsen R.C. Nissen P. Harvey S.C. Ehrenberg M. Frank J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 5Gao H. Sengupta J. Valle M. Korostelev A. Eswar N. Stagg S.M. Van Roey P. Agrawal R.K. Harvey S.C. Sali A. Chapman M.S. Frank J.

These conformations are also referred to as “open” and “closed” in the literature (4Valle M. Zavialov A. Li W. Stagg S.M. Sengupta J. Nielsen R.C. Nissen P. Harvey S.C. Ehrenberg M. Frank J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a difference of ∼20 Å in the GAC positions can be seen if one compares the large subunit atomic structures from Haloarcula marismortui (6Klein D.J. Schmeing T.M. Moore P.M. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4214-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) and Deinococcus radiodurans (7Harms J. Schluenzen F. Zarivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I. Bartels H. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Cell. 2001; 107: 679-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Furthermore, different locations of the GAC are visible in cryoelectron microscopic reconstitutions of various functional complexes of ribosomes; in particular, formation of complexes with EF-G·GMP-PNP is associated with the “closed” conformation of the GAC (5Gao H. Sengupta J. Valle M. Korostelev A. Eswar N. Stagg S.M. Van Roey P. Agrawal R.K. Harvey S.C. Sali A. Chapman M.S. Frank J. Cell. 2003; 113: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In the complexes of ribosomes with EF-G·GDP and fusidic acid the GAC is in the open conformation (8Agrawal R.K. Linde J. Sengupta J. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast, the complex of ribosome with EF-Tu·aminoacyl-tRNA·GDP, stabilized by kirromycin, is characterized by a closed conformation of the GAC (4Valle M. Zavialov A. Li W. Stagg S.M. Sengupta J. Nielsen R.C. Nissen P. Harvey S.C. Ehrenberg M. Frank J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). There are differences in the protection patterns for EF-G and EF-Tu on 23 S rRNA as well (3Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). EF-G protects A1067 and A1069 residues of the GAC (3Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), whereas EF-Tu ternary complex weakly protects G1068 and G1071 (9Moazed D. Noller H.F. Cell. 1989; 57: 585-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The main goal of our study was to model the conformation of the ribosomes with GAC in open or closed position by mutations and to investigate the effects on ribosome function and conformation of 23 S rRNA. The GAC is connected with the rest of the 23 S rRNA by the RNA helix 42. The insertion of a base pair into this RNA helix should cause a displacement of 3.3 Å along the helix axis together with a rotation of 33°. Accordingly, given the specific structure of the GAC connected to helix 42, we expected that deletion or duplication of the helix 42 base pair C1030/G1124 would lead to upward or downward movement of the GAC, respectively. The movement, caused by the binding of EF-G·GMP-PNP (5Gao H. Sengupta J. Valle M. Korostelev A. Eswar N. Stagg S.M. Van Roey P. Agrawal R.K. Harvey S.C. Sali A. Chapman M.S. Frank J.

As for the insertion of the base pair next to C1030/G1124, it could move the GAC downwards, further away from the position, seen in the complexes with EF-G·GMP-PNP (5Gao H. Sengupta J. Valle M.

The natural mRNA analogue was T7-transcribed from a PCR-amplified fragment of the plasmid pET33b (Novagen) with the coding region altered as shown in Fig. 3A. Toeprinting Analysis—Binding studies were performed in a volume of 20 μl, containing 2 pmol of ribosomes. Each experiment was repeated at least twice with independent ribosome preparations. Equal amounts of ribosomes and mRNA were used for toeprinting. For binding of fMet-tRNAMetf to the P-site, a 2-fold excess of tRNA was incubated with ribosomes for 10 min at 37 °C. A-site binding of Phe-tRNAPhe or Lys-tRNALys in 2-fold excess over ribosomes was induced by addition of stoichiometric amounts of recombinant EF-Tu and 0.1 molar amounts of EF-Ts in the presence of 0.5 mm GTP, followed by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C. Translocation was induced by addition of equimolar amounts of recombinant EF-G in the presence of 0.5 mm GTP. Toeprinting was carried out as in Hartz et al. (20Hartz D. McPheeters D.S. Traut R. Gold L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). For monitoring the AcPhe-tRNAPhe translocation to the P-site MFK-programmed ribosomes were incubated with 2-fold excess of tRNAMetf for 10 min. Later, 2-fold excess of AcPhe-tRNAPhe was used to fill the A-site. Translocation and Lys-tRNALys binding were done as described above. GTPase Activities of EF-G and EF-Tu—Multiple turnover [γ-32P]GTP (0.5 mm) hydrolysis by EF-G stimulated by various ribosomal complexes was measured in a buffer containing 60 mm Hepes-K, pH 7.6, 6 mm MgCl2, 80 mm NH4Cl, 8 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The concentration of the ribosomes or the ribosomal complex with poly(U) and tRNAPhe was 0.04 μm. The range of EF-G concentrations was 0.05-1.06 μm. The reactions were stopped after 20 min by addition of equal volume of 20% HCOOH. Time course of the GTP (0.4 μm) hydrolysis by EF-Tu ternary complexes was measured similarly. We used complex of ribosomes (0.1 μm), MFK-mRNA (0.2 μm) and fMet-tRNAMetf (0.2 μm), containing the UUC codon in the A-site as the ribosomal substrate. Either Phe-tRNAPhe·EF-Tu·GTP (0.2 μm) or Lys-tRNALys·EF-Tu·GTP (0.2 μm) was added to the ribosomal complex. After 1, 5, and 30 min aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken and quenched by an equal volume of 20% HCOOH. Thin layer chromatography was made as described by Ehrenberg et al. (21Ehrenberg M. Bilgin N. Kurland C.G. Spedding G. The Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1990: 101-129Google Scholar). Chemical Probing and Footprinting—Chemical modification of ribosomes and ribosomal complexes was done as described by Sergiev et al. (13Sergiev P.V. Bogdanov A.A. Dahlberg A.E. Dontsova O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The following complexes were used for the footprinting of EF-G and EF-Tu: ribosomes (0.3 μm), MFK-mRNA (0.6 μm), fMet-tRNAMetf (0.6 μm), and EF-Tu·Phe-tRNAPhe·GTP (0.6 μm); ribosomes (0.3 μm), EF-G (1 μm), and GMP-PNP (0.2 mm); ribosomes (0.3 μm), EF-G (1 μm), GTP (0.2 mm), and fusidic acid (0.2 mm); ribosomes (0.3 μm), MFK-mRNA (0.6 μm), and tRNAMetf (0.6 μm); ribosomes (0.3 μm), MFK-mRNA (0.6 μm), tRNA· (0.6 μm), EF-G (1 μm), and GMP-PNP (0.2 mm); ribosomes (0.3 μm), MFK-mRNA (0.6 μm), tRNAMetf (0.6 μm), GTP (0.2 mm), and fusidic acid (0.2 mm); ribosomes (0.3 μm), MFK-mRNA (0.6 μm), fMet-tRNAMetf (0.6 μm); ribosomes (0.3 μm), MFK-mRNA (0.6 μm), fMet-tRNAMetf (0.6 μm), EF-G (1 μm), and GMP-PNP (0.2 mm); ribosomes (0.3 μm), MFK-mRNA (0.6 μm), fMet-tRNAMetf (0.6 μm), GTP (0.2 mm), and fusidic acid (0.2 mm), and empty ribosomes (0.3 μm) as a control. In Vivo Effects of the Mutations—Deletion of the C1030/G1124 (ΔC1030/G1124) pair was viable, even if the mutant rDNA was expressed in cells devoid of any source of the wild type rRNA (12Asai T. Zaporojets D. Squires C. Squires C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar); the growth of the strain carrying only ΔC1030/G1124 23 S rRNA was almost not retarded. In contrast, the corresponding insertion of an extra base pair (InsC1030/G1124) was lethal and could only be expressed from a regulated promoter, with the cell life being supported by the expression of the wild type rDNA. The translational fidelity of the mutant ribosomes was measured in vivo with the help of reporter plasmids expressing mutant variants of the lacZ gene (14O'Connor M. Dahlberg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9214-9218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Cupples C.G. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In this system active protein could only be synthesized as a result of various translational errors, such as stop codon readthrough, or +1 and -1 frameshifting. ΔC1030/G1124 mutant ribosomes had almost no effect on translational fidelity. In contrast InsC1030/G1124 caused a significant increase in the translational error level specifically on the stop codon readthrough and -1 frameshifting (Table I). The synthesis of the wild type galactosidase from the control reporter plasmid was also increased in the InsC1030/G1124 mutant. This effect is characteristic for the mutants having severe phenotypes and is explained by increase in the wild type ribosome biosynthesis (22Moine H. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Table IEffect of InsC1030/G1124 and ΔC1030/G1124 mutations on translation fidelityTest plasmidType of translation errorWild typeΔC1030/G1124InsC1030/G1124pSG 853UAA readthrough2.2 ± 0.13.5 ± 0.19.3 ± 0.8pSG 12-6UAG readthrough6.8 ± 0.37.6 ± 0.518.0 ± 1.8pSG 3/4UGA readthrough45 ± 348 ± 592 ± 10pSG lac7+1 Frameshift43 ± 446 ± 472 ± 5pSG 12DP−1 Frameshift47 ± 437 ± 4119 ± 3f'CSH 103Glu/Gln substitution0.61 ± 0.080.47 ± 0.080.71 ± 0.08pSG25No error3980 ± 7004500 ± 4006500 ± 500 Open table in a new tab Purification of the Mutant Ribosomes—Ribosomes carrying the lethal InsC1030/G1124 mutation were purified from the mixture with wild type ribosomes by means of a streptavidin-binding RNA tag, introduced at a silent site within the 23 S rRNA (11Leonov A.A.

The wild type ribosomes, carrying the same tag and purified similarly, were used as controls in all further experiments. ΔC1030/G1124 mutant ribosomes were isolated according to standard procedures. As was expected for the ribosomes carrying the lethal mutation, the ribosomes carrying the Ins1030/1124 mutation showed a significant (80%) decrease of activity in poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis in vitro in contrast to ΔC1030/G1124 ribosomes that demonstrated the same activity as the wild type ones. Influence of the Mutation on 23 S rRNA Conformation Revealed by Chemical Probing—Movement of the GAC “downward” in InsC1030/G1124 mutant ribosomes should stimulate it to make contact with the tip of rRNA helix 89. Thus we should expect the changes in chemical reactivity of the 23 S rRNA nucleotide bases located at the tip of helix 89 and in helices that have a direct contact with helix 89, namely helices 91 and 95 (Figs. 1 and 2). Indeed, the most prominent difference in chemical reactivity was found for the nucleotide bases 2472-2483, 2529-2532, and 2661-2662 involved in the interactions between the tips of the helices 89, 91, and 95 (SRL) (Figs. 1 and 2). Furthermore, it is important that the conformational change induced by the contact of the GAC with helix 89 is transmitted to the SRL, influencing the structure of the latter.Fig. 2Nucleotides of the 23 S rRNA whose reactivity toward the base-specific reagents DMS, kethoxal, and CMCT was altered as a result of the InsC1030/G1124 and ΔC1030/G1124 mutations.

In the ribosome these helices connect the peptidyltransferase center (helix 80, P-loop) through helix 39 and helix 89 with GAC and SRL (Fig. 2). The third class of nucleotides whose reactivity was changed as a result of the downward movement of the GAC were tertiary contacts of the stem consisting of the helices 96 and 97; nucleotides 2702-2705, 2751, and 2764-2766 (Figs. 1 and 2). One end of this stem is located just below the “elbow” between helix 42 and the GAC. The stem penetrates through almost the entire subunit from “top” to “bottom,” with the SRL being attached at its midpoint. The structure probing of ribosomes carrying the ΔC1030/G1124 mutation revealed the changes in protection pattern, consisted with the movement of GAC “upward”, or away from the helix 89 and SRL. Two bases increasing their reactivity as a result of ΔC1030/G1124 mutation (G1115 and G2751) are located in the contact area between the helices 42 and 97. The third base, whose reactivity was increased, is G2529, which forms a contact between helices 89 and 91. Determination of the Translation Step Affected by the Lethal Mutation in in Vitro Translation System—To check the ability of the mutant ribosomes to fulfil different stages of translation we tested them in the stepwise translation of MFK-encoding mRNA. Progression through the elongation cycle was monitored by toeprinting (Fig. 3). Formation of the 70 S initiation complex by binding of fMet-tRNAMetf to the ribosomes programmed with MFK-mRNA resulted in a clear toeprint signal at position +16 relative to the A in the AUG start codon for both the InsC1030/G1124 and ΔC1030/G1124 mutant ribosomes similar to wild type ones. At the next step the pretranslocation complex was formed by enzymatic binding of Phe-tRNAPhe to the 70 S initiation complex to the ribosomal A-site (with help of the ternary complex Phe-tRNAPhe·EF-Tu·GTP). That resulted in an arising of the additional toeprint signal at position +17 for both mutant and wild type ribosomes. The translocation was stimulated by of EF-G·GTP treatment. In the case of the wild type and ΔC1030/G1124 mutant ribosomes the translocation was complete. A new toeprint signal at positions +19, +20 appeared, and the signal for the pretranslocation complex disappeared. However, in the case of the lethal InsC1030/G1124 mutant the translocation was less efficient and did not proceed to completion (translocation signal at positions +19, +20, and substantial pretranslocation signal at position +17). To test the system in the elongation mode, Lys-tRNALys·EF-Tu·GTP was added. Again, the translocation for the InsC1030/G1124 mutant ribosomes was significantly less efficient but not abolished (toeprint signal at position +22). Some part of the peptidyl-tRNA underwent translocation, when it appeared in the A-site of the wild type ribosomes but not of the InsC1030/G1124 mutant (Fig. 3B) either spontaneously or because of the admixture of EF-G traces (in EF-Tu preparation). We repeated the stepwise translation experiments using the AcPhe-tRNAPhe as an A-site ligand (Fig. 3C) bound to the ribosomes non-enzymatically. It is known that spontaneous translocation is almost absent for the AcPhe-tRNA analogue (23Bergemann K. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15105-15113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The P-site of ribosomes was prefilled with deacylated tRNAMetf. The binding of the deacylated tRNA to the P-site produced the toeprint signal, indistinguishable between the wild type and the InsC1030/G1124 mutant (Fig. 3C). Non-enzymatic binding of the AcPhe-tRNAPhe to the A-site produced an additional toeprint stop at the +17 position for the wild type and InsC1030/G1124 mutant ribosomes (Fig. 3C). As expected (23Bergemann K. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15105-15113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the A-site bound AcPhe-tRNAPhe did not undergo spontaneous translocation even if bound to the wild type ribosomes. Upon the addition of EF-G·GTP, wild type ribosomes translocated AcPhe-tRNAPhe to the P-site, whereas the translocation was very inefficient for the InsC1030/G1124 mutant (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the InsC1030/G1124 mutation does not influence the functional activity of EF-Tu, but it interferes with EF-G-related function. Elongation Factors Binding to the Ribosomes—Because we found that the InsC1030/G1124 mutation had severe effect on the EF-G-related function we decided to check whether binding of EF-G to the ribosome was influenced by the mutation by using chemical footprinting tests. EF-G is known to strongly protect A2660 in SRL and weakly A1067 in GAC. The comparison of intensities of the characteristic bands for mutant and wild type ribosomes (Fig. 4, A and B) showed that the binding of EF-G·GMP-PNP and EF-G·GDP·fusidic acid to the ribosomes was significantly reduced but not abolished as a result of the mutation. To prove that mutation does not significantly affect EF-Tu binding to the ribosome we again used the chemical footprinting approach. EF-Tu is known to protect A2660 and A2665 in SRL upon binding of Aa-tRNA·EF-Tu·GDP-PNP ternary complex to the ribosome at the posttranslocation state (3Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). We used the complex of fMet-tRNAMetf with the ribosomes progr"

Previously, we showed that the overexpression of TB10 dramatically increases the frequency of apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells. To identify the critical residues responsible for TB10-mediated apoptosis, we used a series of computational methods. First, a three-dimensional structure of human TB10 was constructed using the homology modeling method with the calf thymosin β-9 NMR structure as a template. Although the sequences of both of these structures are almost identical, 200-ps molecular dynamics simulation results showed that their secondary structures differ. Analyses of molecular dynamics snapshot structures suggested that the TB10 structure is conformationally more complicated than the TB9 structure. The conserved 17LKKTET22 motif region of TB10 was tested by Ala and Ser scanning mutagenesis using computational and biochemical methods, and 12 mutants were transfected into cancer cell lines and tested for their effects on growth arrest. Of the 12 mutants examined, only the Thr20 to Ser20 mutation showed reduced growth arrest. These results strongly suggest that Thr20 is specifically required for actin sequestration by TB10 in ovarian cancer cells.

A majority share a conserved hexapeptide motif, “LKKTET,” which is critical for binding actin, and have important roles in maintaining cellular functions, such as cell morphology, proliferation, and locomotion (6Huff T.

In addition, TB10 up-regulates the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, which is associated with neoplastic transformation (16Hall A.K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 167-180PubMed Google Scholar). Thymosin β-9 (TB9) overexpression was also found to modulate infected bovine macrophage apoptosis (17Gutierrez-Pabello J.A. McMurray D.M. Adams L.G. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2121-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study, we employed a combined approach involving molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis to better understand the molecular regions of TB10 that control apoptosis. On the basis of its computer model-determined three-dimensional structure, we identified a region of TB10 that might be critical for apoptotic induction. This region was then tested in transfected ovarian cancer cell lines via mutagenesis (Ala and Ser scanning) of the conserved 17LKKTET22 motif with respect to actin binding. Computer Modeling Study: Three-dimensional Structure Generation, Structure Refinement, and Point Mutations—A three-dimensional structure of a target protein is critically required for computational or molecular modeling studies. Thus, because the three-dimensional structure of TB10 was unavailable from either x-ray or NMR studies, the homology modeling method was employed to build the TB10 three-dimensional structure using the known structure of its TB9 homolog, which was determined by the NMR method for TB9 (Protein Data Bank code: 1HJ0) (18Stoll R. Voelter W. Holak T.A. Biopolymers. 1997; 41: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The sequence identity between these entities is 87.8%. The MODELER module in the INSIGHT II program (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for the calculation. After building the three-dimensional structure of TB10, the modeled structure was refined by energy minimization (EM) and MD simulations after surrounding the structure with a 10-Å water layer of 1413 water molecules. The calculations were performed with the DISCOVER module in the INSIGHTII program using the consistent-valence force-field (20Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D.J. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). For the EMs, 500 steps of conjugate gradient scheme were performed with a tolerance of 0.05 kcal/mol. The 20-ps MD runs were used for the system equilibration at 300 K, and these were followed by 200-ps production runs. The integration time step for the MD simulations was 1 fs. To identify the critical residue in the conserved motif, 17LKKTET22, the six residues were mutated to Ala or Ser using the BIOPOLYMER module in the INSIGHTII program in computer-generated three-dimensional structures. For structural and energy comparisons against wild type (WT) TB10, the 12 mutant structures were refined using the protocol described above. Because this protein consists of a small number of amino acids, it is possible that in the ground state the structure may have several or multiple stable conformations rather than one unique state. To confirm the possibility, four trials of MD simulations of each system were performed over 14 systems (12 mutants and WT TB9 and TB10). Site-directed Mutagenesis of Human TB10—All PCR amplifications were carried out using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cDNA sequence encoding human TB10 was amplified by PCR from pQBI-Ad-TB10 (21Lee S.H. Zhang W. Choi J.J. Cho Y.S. Oh S.H. Kim J.W. Hu L. Xu J. Liu J. Lee J.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as a template using two specific primers (forward, 5′-CGGGAATTCATGGCAGACAAACCAGAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAGGAAATTTCACTCCG-3′). The PCR product obtained was cleaved with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). All 12 point mutants of the TB10 gene were obtained using the QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of mutated residues were confirmed by automatic sequencing (ABI 373, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Transfection, Growth Inhibition, and Apoptosis Assays—Cancer cell lines of SKOV-3 and PA-1 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Whittaker Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 24 h, SKOV-3 and PA-1 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with 5 μg of DNA in 6-well plates for 48 h. After transfection the cells were harvested, stained with trypan blue, and counted under a light microscope. To detect apoptotic cells, PA-1 and SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cell lines were also plated onto 4-chamber slides. Two days after transfection, chamber slides were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), stained with 2 mg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 15 min, washed twice with PBS, and examined under a fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence Detection of F-actin—Monolayers of SKOV-3 and PA-1 were fixed for 40 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then stained with phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) (25 μg/ml) for 1 h in the dark. Stained cell monolayers were washed twice with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Coverslips were mounted onto slides using a PBS/glycine mountant and examined under a fluorescence microscope. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis, in Vitro Binding Assay, and Coimmunoprecipitation—The interactions between TB10 (WT or mutants) and G-actin were examined using the yeast two-hybrid system. A positive interaction was defined as an ability to support cell growth on leucine-depleted media or by a blue result by white color testing on X-gal-containing media (22Rho S.B. Lee K.H. Kim J.W. Shiba K. Jo Y.J. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10128-10133Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). DNAs encoding human TB10 WT or T20S mutant (Thr20 to Ser20 mutation) for in vitro binding assay was ligated into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) using EcoRI and SalI to generate glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. DNA encoding for human G-actin was subcloned into pET29a (Novagen, Madison, WI). GST and His fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. For coimmunoprecipitation, we transfected the plasmids containing pEGFPC1-G-actin and pcDNA3.1-TB10(WT) or T20S mutant into SKOV-3 cells, immunoprecipitated G-actin with the antibody to GFP, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antibodies to GFP, TB10, and actin. Three-dimensional Structure of Human TB10—The dynamic equilibrium established between G- and F-actin is important during embryonic development, angiogenesis, and metastasis (23Fidler I.J.

Brain Res. 1999; 823: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Modulations of actin stability by proteins that sequester actin monomers like thymosins control these processes. Most β-thymosin family members contain the hexapeptide motif LKKTET, which is highly conserved in a number of other actin-binding proteins, e.g. α-actinine, villin, dematin, tropomyosin, and actobindin (27Vancompernolle K. Goethals M. Huet C. Louvard D. Vandekerchkhove J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4739-4746Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To consider a three-dimensional structural change in a new environment, the homologous three-dimensional structure must be refined by MD simulation. To perform MD simulations, the initial three-dimensional structure of each system was surrounded by a 10-Å water layer composed of 1413 water molecules. After the entire system had been energy-minimized using a conjugate gradient algorithm, 200-ps MD simulation was performed. The first computer-generated three-dimensional structure of WT TB10 was aligned with the NMR-determined TB9 template, as shown in Fig. 1A. The secondary structure of the first version TB10 structure, which was not refined yet, was a helix-turn-helix structure, in which the turn was located at residues 30-33. Moreover, its conserved motif was located in the long helix structure. However, a 200-ps MD simulation resulted in a distinctive structural change in TB10 as compared with the original TB9 structure. The severe bend was observed in 100-ps simulations (Fig. 1, B-E), and they were also found in the three additional trials (Fig. 1, G-I). Fig. 1 shows that TB10 contains two turns in the structure, whereas TB9 has only one. It appears that the severe bend was caused by an additional turn that is located among the 10-15 residues. The root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) of backbone atoms of WT TB10 between the starting and final snapshot structures were about 9 Å over the four structures. Because the four different MD simulations showed the same trend, the large bend structure seems to be the natural form of the human TB10 structure. To check whether the bend originated from the artifact of the MD simulation, the identical procedures were applied to the NMR TB9 structure. Four trials of 200-ps MD simulations of the TB9 structure showed no severe bent form (Fig. 1J), and moreover the final 200-ps snapshot structure was almost the same as the starting structure. The r.m.s.d. of TB9 between the starting and the final structure was less than 1.9 Å. Therefore, the bent form is believed to be a characteristic of the TB10 structure. Sequence comparisons showed that only two residues were different in the long helix region, namely, residues 6 and 10. Moreover, Leu6 and Asp10 in TB9 are replaced by Met6 and Ala10 in TB10. We believe that the change of Ala10 to Asp10 in the position of residue 10 explains the structural difference between TB9 and TB10, because residue 10 is located at the near of the new turn and because the size difference of the two side chains is remarkable. Computational Mutation Experiments—Computational mutation experiments were performed to obtain information on key residues in the conserved 17LKKTET22 motif. Six key residues in the homology-modeled three-dimensional WT structure were mutated to alanine and serine to produce 12 different mutant structures. Four 200-ps MD simulations were carried out for each of the 12 mutant structures. Final MD snapshot structures of the 12 mutants were collected, and their structures were compared with the WT using r.m.s.d. measurements. The potential energies from the EM structures and MD snapshot structures were collected from the 12 mutant structures and then compared with those of the WT. No distinctive r.m.s.d. (or structural) change was found in any of the 12 mutant structures, and the averaged r.m.s.d. values for starting and final structures were ∼9 Å. TABLE ONE shows that the potential energy of EM structures showed some remarkable features for point mutations at the positions of residues 20 and 21. It showed that the mutation of residue 20 caused remarkable energy stabilization but the mutation of residue 21 resulted in the most significant energy destabilization of the system. The same features concerning positions 20 and 21 were also shown by the potential energy results that were produced from MD structures. However, the results from the MD cases showed additional negative potential energy changes at position 17. Because these kinds of abrupt energy changes caused by the point mutation imply that the amino acid in the particular position should be conserved as the original one, we conclude that positions 20 and 21 are the two best candidates for the key residues for the protein function.TABLE ONEPotential energy comparisons for EM and MD simulations Energy values were collected from the four trials of MD simulations. All of the values are the relative energies (ΔE) from values of WT in kcal/mol.NameFor EMaΔE from WTFor MDaΔE from WTWT0.000.00L17A27.01–43.27K18A–0.90–2.06K19A67.0847.70T20A–24.32–28.52E21A190.89165.9T22A–1.35–12.12L17S7.48–39.04K18S23.3982.54K19S70.9023.95T20S–24.57–21.47E21S195.20184.48T22S–3.193.41a ΔE from WT Open table in a new tab Effect of TB10 Point Mutations on Growth in Ovarian Cancer Cells—We tested the contribution made by individual amino acids in the 17LKKTET22 motif to the biological activity of TB10 by Ala and Ser scanning mutagenesis. Each of the mutant sequences was confirmed by automatic sequencing, and transfected to SKOV-3 and PA-1 (data not shown) ovarian cancer cells. Three days after transfection, cells were harvested and stained with trypan blue, and apoptotic events were counted. As shown in Fig. 2, WT TB10-transfected cancer cells showed clear growth arrest, suggesting that overexpressed TB10 induced massive cell death. Moreover, only one of the mutants, T20S, restored cell growth. To better understand the structural-functional relationships of the conserved 17LKKTET22 motif, we also stained SKOV-3 and PA-1 (data not shown) ovarian cancer cells with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to confirm that the observed loss of viability was due to apoptosis. Transfectants containing only WT TB10 showed clear DNA fragmentation, whereas mock transfectants or the transfectant containing the TB10 (T21S) mutant showed no signs of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3). Moreover, staining with phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antiactin antibody revealed the presence of an intact and pervasive actin structure in the control and in cells transfected with the parent vector. However, when WT TB10 and all of the mutant TB10 proteins were expressed F-actin stress fibers were dramatically disrupted, but T20S-mutated TB10 overexpression did not effect any F-actin stress fiber change (Fig. 4). This result suggests that the Thr20 residue is a critical amino acid that helps determinate the actin-binding structure and provides an important clue about the possible tertiary structure of TB10.FIGURE 4Phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate-stained F-actin. PA-1 (data not shown) and SKOV-3 cells were transfected with WT and various mutants of TB10. Control and mock-treated cells show intact and pervasive actin stress fibers. The overexpression of WT or various mutants (data not shown) of TB10 severely disrupted the F-actin network. However, the overexpression of T20S mutant TB10 left the F-actin structure unaltered.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The actin-binding activity of TB4 is severely compromised by the mutation of leucine 17 to alanine (L17A) (28Van Troys M. Dewitte D. Goethals M. Cariler M.F. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The C terminus shows greatest heterogeneity among members of the β-thymosin family (29Eadie J.S. Kim S.W. Allen P.G. Hutchinson L.M. Kantor J.D. Zetter B.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Truncations of either 13 or 19 amino acids from the C terminus reduce the actin-binding affinity of TB4. Similarly, Huff et al. (30Huff T. Muller C.S. Hannappel E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that the removal of the last two C-terminal amino acids of TB10 reduces its actin-binding affinity by an ultrafiltration assay. Moreover, the centrally conserved motif 17LKKTETQ23 of TB10 is shared by several monomeric actin-binding proteins including the β-thymosins and actobindin and has been shown to be an essential actin-binding domain (31Vancompernolle K. Vandekerchkhove J. Bubb M.R. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15427-15431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study the actin-binding affinity of TB4 was studied by ultrafiltration assay, but the activity of mutated TB4 was not studied in cells. To explore the binding activity of this conserved motif in cells, we examined the actin-sequestering effect of mutant TB10s to identify critical residues. Accordingly, we created a three-dimensional structure of human TB10 and performed modeling studies. Based on the results obtained, we propose that the T20 position critically determines the structure of the protein. We also validated this model by transfecting site-mutated TB10 variants into ovarian cancer cell lines. With the exception of T20S, none of the mutants restored cell growth. Together with the previous ultrafiltration assay results our findings demonstrate that Thr20 is a critical residue that helps determine the actin-binding structure of TB10. Interaction between TB10 (WT) and Mutant T20S with G-actin in Vivo and in Vitro—To investigate the interaction between TB10 and G-actin, we conducted yeast two-hybrid assays. Positive interactions were defined by cell growth on leucine-depleted medium and by the formation of blue colonies on medium containing X-gal or in liquid medium using O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. These studies showed a strong interaction between WT TB10 and G-actin but no such interaction with TB10 (T20S) mutant (Fig. 5A). This interaction was confirmed by in vitro binding assays and coimmunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 5, B and C, cellular interaction between WT TB10 and G-actin was also evident by in vitro binding analyses and coimmunoprecipitation. Moreover, although WT TB10 was found to interact strongly with G-actin, no such interaction was observed between TB10 (T20S) and G-actin. These results indicate that T20S mutant TB10 cannot bind G-actin and thus cannot cause TB10-mediated ovarian cancer cell apoptosis. Recently, Philp et al. (32Philp D. Huff T. Gho Y.S. Hannappel E. Kleinman H.K. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2103-2105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the 17LKKTETQ23 motif of TB4 is essentially required for endothelial cell migration by binding actin. However, they did not identify the amino acid residue in the 17LKKTETQ23 motif required to bind actin. Herein, we demonstrate that the Thr20 residue is important for actin binding in vivo and in vitro and that changing the Thr20 residue to Ser20 abrogates TB10-mediated apoptosis. Thus, it will be interesting to determine whether replacing Thr20 with Ser20 also blocks endothelial cell migration. Taken together, our study demonstrates that actin-sequestering determinants mediate the apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells and that this is related to stress fiber disruption. Moreover, our study provides a detailed understanding of the structure of TB10 and of the influence of its actin-binding region. In summary, to identify the residues critical for TB10-mediated apoptosis, a series of computational and biochemical experiments were performed. The three-dimensional structure of human TB10 was built using a homology-modeling method with the calf TB9 NMR structure. The initial modeled structure was then refined by EM and 200-ps MD simulations, and the refined structure obtained was distinctly different from the initial structure. A computer-aided mutation experiment identified positions 17, 20, and 21 as potentially key residues in the conserved 17LKKTET22 motif for TB10 activity. Using biochemical methods, we examined the conserved motif region by Ala and Ser scanning mutagenesis. These TB10 mutants were then transfected into ovarian cancer cell lines, and their effects on growth arrest were investigated. Of the 12 possible mutations, only the T20S mutation showed an abrogated TB10 growth arrest function. These results strongly support the notion that Thr20 is an essential motif for actin sequestration in ovarian cancer cells and provide information useful for the design of new cancer inhibitors.
