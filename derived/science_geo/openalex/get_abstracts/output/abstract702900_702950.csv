https://openalex.org/W4306874674,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants in the Omicron lineage has resulted in diminished Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine efficacy and persistent transmission. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of two, recently authorized, bivalent COVID-19 vaccines that contain two mRNAs encoding Wuhan-1 and either BA.1 (mRNA-1273.214) or BA.4/5 (mRNA-1273.222) spike proteins. As a primary two-dose immunization series in mice, both bivalent vaccines induced greater neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron variants than the parental, monovalent mRNA-1273 vaccine. When administered to mice as a booster at 7 months after the primary vaccination series with mRNA-1273, the bivalent vaccines induced broadly neutralizing antibody responses. Whereas most anti-Omicron receptor binding domain antibodies in serum induced by mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273.222 boosters cross-reacted with the antecedent Wuhan-1 spike antigen, the mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273.222 bivalent vaccine boosters also induced unique BA.1-specific and BA.4/5-specific responses, respectively. Although boosting with parental or bivalent mRNA vaccines substantially improved protection against BA.5 compared to mice receiving two vaccine doses, the levels of infection, inflammation and pathology in the lung were lowest in animals administered the bivalent mRNA vaccines. Thus, boosting with bivalent Omicron-based mRNA-1273.214 or mRNA-1273.222 vaccines enhances immunogenicity and confers protection in mice against a currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain. Bivalent vaccines elicit broad immune responses that neutralize ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern and offer a customizable approach to protect from COVID-19 as new virus variants emerge."
https://openalex.org/W4306941875,"Metal additive manufacturing (AM) enables the production of high value and high performance components1 with applications from aerospace2 to biomedical3 fields. Layer-by-layer fabrication circumvents the geometric limitations of traditional metalworking techniques, allowing topologically optimized parts to be made rapidly and efficiently4,5. Existing AM techniques rely on thermally initiated melting or sintering for part shaping, a costly and material-limited process6–8. We report an AM technique that produces metals and alloys with microscale resolution via vat photopolymerization (VP). Three-dimensional-architected hydrogels are infused with metal precursors, then calcined and reduced to convert the hydrogel scaffolds into miniaturized metal replicas. This approach represents a paradigm shift in VP; the material is selected only after the structure is fabricated. Unlike existing VP strategies, which incorporate target materials or precursors into the photoresin during printing9–11, our method does not require reoptimization of resins and curing parameters for different materials, enabling quick iteration, compositional tuning and the ability to fabricate multimaterials. We demonstrate AM of metals with critical dimensions of approximately 40 µm that are challenging to fabricate by using conventional processes. Such hydrogel-derived metals have highly twinned microstructures and unusually high hardness, providing a pathway to create advanced metallic micromaterials. An additive manufacturing technique that infuses 3D printed hydrogels with metallic precursors leads to metallic micromaterials, providing new opportunities for the fabrication of energy materials, micro-electromechanical systems and biomedical devices."

https://openalex.org/W4306888709,"DNA methylation is critical for regulating gene expression, necessitating its accurate placement by enzymes such as the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A. Dysregulation of this process is known to cause aberrant development and oncogenesis, yet how DNMT3A is regulated holistically by its three domains remains challenging to study. Here, we integrate base editing with a DNA methylation reporter to perform in situ mutational scanning of DNMT3A in cells. We identify mutations throughout the protein that perturb function, including ones at an interdomain interface that block allosteric activation. Unexpectedly, we also find mutations in the PWWP domain, a histone reader, that modulate enzyme activity despite preserving histone recognition and protein stability. These effects arise from altered PWWP domain DNA affinity, which we show is a noncanonical function required for full activity in cells. Our findings highlight mechanisms of interdomain crosstalk and demonstrate a generalizable strategy to probe sequence-activity relationships of nonessential chromatin regulators."
https://openalex.org/W4306888732,"Abstract Detailed understanding of the mechanism by which Hsp70 chaperones protect cells against protein aggregation is hampered by the lack of a comprehensive characterization of the aggregates, which are typically heterogeneous. Here we designed a reporter chaperone substrate, MLucV, composed of a stress-labile luciferase flanked by stress-resistant fluorescent domains, which upon denaturation formed a discrete population of small aggregates. Combining Förster resonance energy transfer and enzymatic activity measurements provided unprecedented details on the aggregated, unfolded, Hsp70-bound and native MLucV conformations. The Hsp70 mechanism first involved ATP-fueled disaggregation and unfolding of the stable pre-aggregated substrate, which stretched MLucV beyond simply unfolded conformations, followed by native refolding. The ATP-fueled unfolding and refolding action of Hsp70 on MLucV aggregates could accumulate native MLucV species under elevated denaturing temperatures highly adverse to the native state. These results unambiguously exclude binding and preventing of aggregation from the non-equilibrium mechanism by which Hsp70 converts stable aggregates into metastable native proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4306888862,"Abstract Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC), which belong to the mitochondrial α-ketoacid dehydrogenase family, play crucial roles in cellular metabolism. These multi-subunit enzyme complexes use lipoic arms covalently attached to their E2 subunits to transfer an acyl group to coenzyme A (CoA). Here, we report a novel mechanism capable of substantially inhibiting PDHC and OGDC: reactive nitrogen species (RNS) can covalently modify the thiols on their lipoic arms, generating a series of adducts that block catalytic activity. S -Nitroso-CoA, a product between RNS and the E2 subunit’s natural substrate, CoA, can efficiently deliver these modifications onto the lipoic arm. We found RNS-mediated inhibition of PDHC and OGDC occurs during classical macrophage activation, driving significant rewiring of cellular metabolism over time. This work provides a new mechanistic link between RNS and mitochondrial metabolism with potential relevance for numerous physiological and pathological conditions in which RNS accumulate."
https://openalex.org/W4306896955,"We aimed to estimate associations between COVID-19 incidence and mortality with neighbourhood-level immigration, race, housing, and socio-economic characteristics.We conducted a population-based study of 28,808 COVID-19 cases in the provincial reportable infectious disease surveillance systems (Public Health Case and Contact Management System) which includes all known COVID-19 infections and deaths from Ontario, Canada reported between January 23, 2020 and July 28, 2020. Residents of congregate settings, Indigenous communities living on reserves or small neighbourhoods with populations <1,000 were excluded. Comparing neighbourhoods in the 90th to the 10th percentiles of socio-demographic characteristics, we estimated the associations between 18 neighbourhood-level measures of immigration, race, housing and socio-economic characteristics and COVID-19 incidence and mortality using Poisson generalized linear mixed models.Neighbourhoods with the highest proportion of immigrants (relative risk (RR): 4.0, 95%CI:3.5-4.5) and visible minority residents (RR: 3.3, 95%CI:2.9-3.7) showed the strongest association with COVID-19 incidence in adjusted models. Among individual race groups, COVID-19 incidence was highest among neighbourhoods with the high proportions of Black (RR: 2.4, 95%CI:2.2-2.6), South Asian (RR: 1.9, 95%CI:1.8-2.1), Latin American (RR: 1.8, 95%CI:1.6-2.0) and Middle Eastern (RR: 1.2, 95%CI:1.1-1.3) residents. Neighbourhoods with the highest average household size (RR: 1.9, 95%CI:1.7-2.1), proportion of multigenerational families (RR: 1.8, 95%CI:1.7-2.0) and unsuitably crowded housing (RR: 2.1, 95%CI:2.0-2.3) were associated with COVID-19 incidence. Neighbourhoods with the highest proportion of residents with less than high school education (RR: 1.6, 95%CI:1.4-1.8), low income (RR: 1.4, 95%CI:1.2-1.5) and unaffordable housing (RR: 1.6, 95%CI:1.4-1.8) were associated with COVID-19 incidence. Similar inequities were observed across neighbourhood-level sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19 mortality.Neighbourhood-level inequities in COVID-19 incidence and mortality were observed in Ontario, with excess burden experienced in neighbourhoods with a higher proportion of immigrants, racialized populations, large households and low socio-economic status."
https://openalex.org/W4306797762,"The communication between glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and the surrounding microenvironment is a prominent feature accounting for the aggressive biology of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the mechanisms by which GSCs proactively drive interactions with microenvironment is not well understood. In this study, we interrogated metabolites that are preferentially secreted from GSCs and found that GSCs produce and secrete histamine to shape a pro-angiogenic tumor microenvironment. This histamine-producing ability is attributed to H3K4me3 modification-activated histidine decarboxylase (HDC) transcription via MYC. Notably, HDC is highly expressed in GBM, which is associated with poor survival of these patients. GSC-secreted histamine activates endothelial cells by triggering a histamine H1 receptor (H1R)-Ca2+-NF-κB axis, thereby promoting angiogenesis and GBM progression. Importantly, pharmacological blockage of H1R using antihistamines impedes the growth of GBM xenografts in mice. Our findings establish that GSC-specific metabolite secretion remodels the tumor microenvironment and highlight histamine targeting as a potential strategy for GBM therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4306898268,"Amanzi Springs is a series of inactive thermal springs located near Kariega in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. Excavations in the 1960s exposed rare, stratified Acheulian-bearing deposits that were not further investigated over the next 50 years. Reanalysis of the site and its legacy collection has led to a redefined stratigraphic context for the archaeology, a confirmed direct association between Acheulian artefacts and wood, as well as the first reliable age estimates for the site. Thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence and post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence dating indicates that the Acheulian deposits from the Amanzi Springs Area 1 spring eye formed during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 at ~ 404-390 ka. At this time, higher sea levels of ~13-14m would have placed Amanzi Springs around 7 km from a ria that would have formed along what is today the Swartkops River, and which likely led to spring reactivation. This makes the Amanzi Springs Area 1 assemblage an unusual occurrence of a verified late occurring, seaward, open-air Acheulian occupation. The Acheulian levels do not contain any Middle Stone Age (MSA) elements such as blades and points that have been documented in the interior of South Africa at this time. However, a small number of stone tools from the upper layers of the artefact zone, and originally thought of as intrusive, have been dated to ~190 ka, at the transition between MIS 7 to 6, and represent the first potential MSA identified at the site."
https://openalex.org/W4306682555,"Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is an effective precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in human and animal cells. NR supplementation can increase the level of NAD in various tissues and thereby improve physiological functions that are weakened or lost in experimental models of aging or various human pathologies. However, there are also reports questioning the efficacy of NR supplementation. Indeed, the mechanisms of its utilization by cells are not fully understood. Herein, we investigated the role of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) in NR metabolism in mammalian cells. Using both PNP overexpression and genetic knockout, we show that after being imported into cells by members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family, NR is predominantly metabolized by PNP, resulting in nicotinamide (Nam) accumulation. Intracellular cleavage of NR to Nam is prevented by the potent PNP inhibitor Immucillin H in various types of mammalian cells. In turn, suppression of PNP activity potentiates NAD synthesis from NR. Combining pharmacological inhibition of PNP with NR supplementation in mice, we demonstrate that the cleavage of the riboside to Nam is strongly diminished, maintaining high levels of NR in blood, kidney, and liver. Moreover, we show that PNP inhibition stimulates Nam mononucleotide and NAD+ synthesis from NR in vivo, in particular, in the kidney. Thus, we establish PNP as a major regulator of NR metabolism in mammals and provide evidence that the health benefits of NR supplementation could be greatly enhanced by concomitant downregulation of PNP activity.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolism has emerged as a major driver and key regulator of vital cellular and organismal processes.

The mechanisms of this decline are not understood and could be caused by increased NAD consumption through NAD-dependent signaling or diminished NAD biosynthesis. Lowered NAD levels are considered to affect both metabolic, bioenergetic, and signaling pathways, thereby aggravating pathological alterations in aging. Therefore, so-called NAD supplementation strategies are under development aimed at re-adjusting NAD levels to normal values (14Katsyuba E. Romani M. Hofer D. Auwerx J. NAD(+) homeostasis in health and disease.Nat. Metab. 2020; 2: 9-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Covarrubias A.J. Perrone R. Grozio A. Verdin E. NAD(+) metabolism and its roles in cellular processes during ageing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2021; 22: 119-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These strategies exploit alternative entry routes or downstream metabolites of NAD biosynthesis. The cellular functions of NAD(P) include their well-known roles as major coenzymes of metabolic redox reactions as well as serving as substrates of several families of regulatory proteins such as protein deacylases (sirtuins), ADP-ribosyltransferases, and PARPs, which govern vital processes including gene expression, DNA repair, apoptosis, mitochondrial biogenesis, unfolded protein response, and many others (16Houtkooper R.H.

PARPs and ADP-ribosylation: recent advances linking molecular functions to biological outcomes.Genes Dev. 2017; 31: 101-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). NAD(P) is also used to generate calcium mobilizing second messengers such as cyclic ADP-ribose and NAADP (19Guse A.H. Calcium mobilizing second messengers derived from NAD.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1854: 1132-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Owing to the multiple functions of NAD and its phosphorylated form, NADP, and their continuous degradation in signaling reactions, the synthesis of these pyridine nucleotides is regarded as an important process which needs a permanent supply of precursors. Human cells regulate their NAD supply through biosynthesis using various precursors delivered with the diet. The main NAD precursors are nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinic acid known as vitamin B3 (20Nikiforov A. Kulikova V. Ziegler M. The human NAD metabolome: functions, metabolism and compartmentalization.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2015; 50: 284-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Yang Y. Sauve A.A. NAD(+) metabolism: bioenergetics, signaling and manipulation for therapy.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1864: 1787-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Nam is converted by the phosphoribosyltransferase NAMPT to the mononucleotide NMN, which in turn is adenylated by the adenylyl transferase of the NMNAT family to form NAD (Fig. S1). Nicotinic acid is converted to the corresponding mononucleotide NAMN by the phosphoribosyltransferase NAPRT. NAMN is adenylated by NMNATs to form the dinucleotide NAAD which is then amidated to NAD by NAD synthetase, (Fig. S1) (20Nikiforov A. Kulikova V. Ziegler M. The human NAD metabolome: functions, metabolism and compartmentalization.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2015; 50: 284-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Yang Y. Sauve A.A. NAD(+) metabolism: bioenergetics, signaling and manipulation for therapy.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1864: 1787-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. S1, the nucleoside form of Nam, nicotinamide riboside (NR) can enter NAD biosynthesis in an NAMPT-independent step to form NMN through phosphorylation by NR kinase (NRK) activity (22Bieganowski P. Brenner C.

Since NAMPT represents the rate-limiting step in human NAD biosynthesis (24Revollo J.R. Grimm A.A. Imai S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 50754-50763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), NR can serve as an effective precursor to enhance NAD levels. Indeed, dietary supplementation with NR or other NAD biosynthetic intermediates, such as NMN, can increase intracellular NAD contents and thereby facilitates restoration of physiological functions that are weakened or lost in experimental models of aging and various pathologies (14Katsyuba E. Romani M. Hofer D. Auwerx J. NAD(+) homeostasis in health and disease.Nat. Metab. 2020; 2: 9-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Covarrubias A.J. Perrone R. Grozio A. Verdin E. NAD(+) metabolism and its roles in cellular processes during ageing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2021; 22: 119-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In a previous work, we established that the import of NR into human cells is mediated by equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) (25Nikiforov A. Dolle C. Niere M. Ziegler M.

In particular, there are studies that showed no beneficial effects of NR supplementation (27Purhonen J. Rajendran J. Tegelberg S. Smolander O.P. Pirinen E.

We showed recently that after being imported into cells, NR is readily converted to Nam (26Kropotov A. Kulikova V. Nerinovski K. Yakimov A. Svetlova M. Solovjeva L. et al.Equilibrative nucleoside transporters mediate the import of nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid riboside into human cells.Int. J. Mol.

Solovjeva L. et al.Degradation of extracellular NAD(+) intermediates in cultures of human HEK293 cells.Metabolites. 2019; 9: 293Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). While Nam generation can, in principle, be explained by degradation of NAD in signaling processes (Fig. S1), a plausible alternative would be the direct conversion of NR to Nam by purine nucleoside phosphorylase, PNP. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible phosphorolytic cleavage of a variety of nucleosides to the corresponding base and ribose-1-phosphate (34Bzowska A. Kulikowska E. Shugar D. Purine nucleoside phosphorylases: properties, functions, and clinical aspects.Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 88: 349-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). It has been reported that NR can serve as a substrate for PNP (35Wielgus-Kutrowska B. Kulikowska E. Wierzchowski J. Bzowska A. Shugar D. Nicotinamide riboside, an unusual, non-typical, substrate of purified purine-nucleoside phosphorylases.Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 408-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Belenky P. Christensen K.C.

Quantitative basis for Urh1 and purine nucleoside phosphorylase function in NAD+ metabolism.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 158-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that PNP may have a critical role in NR utilization in human cells. Moreover, modulation of PNP activity could potentially explain the observed differences in the efficiency of NR supplementation to boost NAD levels and improve health. In the present study, we investigated the role of PNP in mammalian NAD metabolism driven by NR supplementation. Our results demonstrate that the utilization of NR as NAD precursor is considerably diminished by PNP activity present in mammalian cells. Of note, human red blood cells (RBCs) readily convert NR to Nam through PNP activity, thereby “deactivating” NR as an alternative to Nam as NAD precursor. On the other hand, inhibition of PNP activity strongly enhances the NAD boosting effect of NR in human cells and mouse tissues. These results indicate that the health benefits of NR supplementation could be greatly enhanced by concomitant downregulation of PNP activity. It was previously shown that members of the ENT family mediate the uptake of NR into human cells (25Nikiforov A. Dolle C. Niere M. Ziegler M.

Sci. 2021; 22: 1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, in HEK293 cells, overexpression of ENT1 strongly enhanced the intracellular utilization of NR resulting in accumulation of Nam in the medium (26Kropotov A. Kulikova V. Nerinovski K. Yakimov A. Svetlova M. Solovjeva L. et al.Equilibrative nucleoside transporters mediate the import of nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid riboside into human cells.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22: 1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here, we first tested whether ENT-mediated uptake followed by intracellular conversion of NR to Nam is a general property of mammalian cells. To do this, we used an experimental approach developed previously, based on the quantitative assessment of NAD intermediates in conditioned culture medium using NMR spectroscopy (37Shabalin K. Nerinovski K. Yakimov A. Kulikova V. Svetlova M. Solovjeva L. et al.NAD metabolome analysis in human cells using (1)H NMR spectroscopy.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 19: 3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After incubation of cells with NR for 24 h at concentrations of 100 to 150 μM, we analyzed the culture medium for the contents of NR and Nam. As shown in Figures 1 and S2, ENT-specific inhibitors such as S-(4-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine (NBTI) and dipyridamole strongly inhibited the disappearance of NR from the medium (left panels) and the concomitant accumulation of Nam (right panels) when incubated with mammalian cells including human HEK293, HeLa, A549 cells, and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) E14 (Figs. 1, A–C and S2). The amount of NR in the medium dropped by ∼50 to 70% and was paralleled by a proportional increase of the Nam concentration. Since for NR supplementation the dynamics in circulating blood is of importance, we exposed isolated human RBCs (2 billion cells in 1 ml buffer) to NR at a final concentration 300 μM. After only 2 h of incubation, NR was undetectable in the buffer and converted into Nam (Fig. 1D). Again, inhibition of ENT-mediated uptake by NBTI nearly completely prevented the conversion of NR to Nam. These observations confirm that mammalian cells import NR through ENTs followed by active conversion to Nam. Nam is then released from the cells into the culture medium. In principle, there are two plausible mechanisms of intracellular conversion of NR to Nam (Fig. 1E). First, NR is metabolized into NAD+, which is then converted to Nam by NAD+-consuming enzymes. Second, direct cleavage of NR to Nam by PNP (Fig. 1E). The massive conversion of NR to Nam in erythrocytes indicated a strong contribution of the latter mechanism, because these cells lack both a nucleus and mitochondria, the compartments in which most NAD+-degrading signaling processes take place in human cells. Therefore, we next wished to establish the role of PNP in NR metabolism in human cells. To explore the role of PNP, we first transiently overexpressed FLAG-tagged PNP in HEK293 cells and evaluated changes in the rate of utilization of extracellular NR. The level of overexpression of the FLAG-fusion protein was assessed by immunoblotting using antibodies recognizing the FLAG epitope (Fig. S3A). Twenty-four hours after transfection of the FLAG-PNP-encoding vector, NR was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 200 μM. After another 24 h, the conditioned culture medium was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2A, left panel). Overexpression of PNP-FLAG led to a moderate increase of NR conversion to Nam, whereas NBTI efficiently blocked NR consumption and Nam accumulation in the medium. A similar effect was observed under conditions when NR uptake into HEK293 cells was stimulated by ENT4 overexpression (26Kropotov A. Kulikova V. Nerinovski K. Yakimov A. Svetlova M. Solovjeva L. et al.Equilibrative nucleoside transporters mediate the import of nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid riboside into human cells.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22: 1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). When ENT4 and PNP were co-expressed, the NR level in the medium dropped by 50% compared to the decrease obtained from cells expressing ENT4 alone (Fig. S3B), indicating that both NR uptake and PNP control the intracellular conversion of NR to Nam. To further analyze the role of PNP, we characterized the efficiency of NR cleavage in cell extracts obtained from control cells or from cells overexpressing the PNP-FLAG protein. Twenty-four hours after transfection of НЕК293 cells with the vector encoding FLAG-tagged PNP or the FLAG peptide (control), cell extracts were incubated with 1 mM NR for 40 min at 37 °C and then analyzed by NMR. After incubation with extracts derived from cells overexpressing FLAG, the amount of NR in the reaction dropped to ∼70% (Fig. 2B, left panel). At the same time, the Nam concentration increased proportionally (Fig. 2B, right panel). In cell extracts derived from HEK293 cells overexpressing FLAG-PNP, NR cleaving activity was dramatically increased. In fact, after the incubation, NR was undetectable and converted to Nam (Fig. 2B). Notably, neither NR depletion nor Nam formation was observed when the potent pharmacological inhibitor of human PNP, Immucillin H (38Bantia S. Miller P.J. Parker C.D. Ananth S.L. Horn L.L. Kilpatrick J.M. et al.Purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitor BCX-1777 (Immucillin-H)--a novel potent and orally active immunosuppressive agent.Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was added to the reaction (Fig. 2B). Consequently, under these conditions, PNP accounted for most, if not all activity converting NR to Nam. To test whether suppression of PNP activity with Immucillin H can modulate NR conversion to Nam in cultured cells, we used an experimental approach which is schematically presented in Figure 3A, left panel. As shown in Figure 3, A–G, incubation of various human cell lines, including HEK293, HeLa, THP1, A549, dermal fibroblasts (HDF),and RBCs as well as mESCs, with high concentrations (100–150 μM) of NR led to considerable conversion of the nucleoside to Nam. This conversion was nearly completely prevented when the PNP inhibitor Immucillin H was present during the incubation. Using Western blot analysis, we verified that PNP is expressed in all cell lines tested. Moreover, the treatment with NR did not change PNP expression (Fig. S4A). When FLAG-tagged ENT1 was overexpressed in HEK293 cells, the amount of NR in the medium dramatically decreased compared to samples obtained from mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3A, middle panel), which was accompanied by a proportional accumulation of Nam (Fig. 3A, right panel). Addition of Immucillin H still potently inhibited the degradation of NR and accumulation of Nam. These results demonstrate that PNP significantly contributes to NR metabolism in various types of mammalian cells by mediating the cleavage to Nam. To further substantiate the role of PNP in NR metabolism, we exploited the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate PNP knockout HEK293 cells. As expected, expression of the endogenous PNP protein was detected by immunoblotting only in wildtype, but not in PNP knockout HEK293 cells (Fig. 4A). The absence of PNP did not noticeably affect cell viability or proliferation as established by propidium iodide staining and FACS analysis (Fig. 4B). Next, we incubated wildtype or PNP knockout cells with NR (150 μM) for 24 h. Genetic suppression of PNP resembled the effect of pharmacological inhibition by Immucillin H. Neither a drop in the NR concentration nor an increase in the Nam level was observed in the culture medium obtained from PNP knockout cells. Even after stimulation of NR uptake by overexpression of ENT1, the absence of PNP virtually precluded the conversion of NR to Nam (Figs. 4C and S5A). Importantly, overexpression of ectopic PNP in knockout cells restored the conversion of NR to Nam (Figs. 4D and S5B). These data validate that PNP is required for NR cleavage to Nam in НЕК293 cells. Another argument supporting this conclusion is that no cleavage of NR was observed in in vitro reaction in the presence of cell extract derived from PNP-knockout HEK293 cells (Fig. 4E). We reasoned that the highly active cleavage of NR by PNP might affect the utilization of the nucleoside for NAD synthesis. Therefore, we tested whether PNP suppression could improve the efficiency of NR as precursor for NAD biosynthesis. First of all, using NMR spectroscopy, we analyzed changes in NAD and its intermediates in HEK293 cell extracts prepared 24 h after treatment of cells with 150 μM NR. Following incubation with NR, the level of intracellular NR was below the limit of detection, as in control cells. Nevertheless, we observed a significant increase in the NAD concentration. As expected, cotreatment with Immucillin H led to considerable accumulation of intracellular NR; however, the NAD level remained the same as in cells treated with NR alone Fig. S6A). Similar effects were observed when comparing wildtype and PNP knockout HEK293 cells (Fig. S6B). The failure of Immucillin H to further increase NAD accumulation may possibly reflect the activation of a safety mechanism to prevent excessive NAD accumulation. In addition, the increase of the NAD concentration will kinetically activate NAD consuming enzymes. That is, to maintain higher NAD levels, biosynthesis needs also to counterbalance the accelerated consumption. To evaluate the utility of NR supplementation and PNP suppression at lowered NAD levels, we inhibited NAD synthesis from Nam by inhibiting NAMPT (Fig. S1). Cells were treated with NAMPT inhibitor, FK866, which causes a rapid drop in NAD levels and cell death (39Hasmann M. Schemainda I. FK866, a highly specific noncompetitive inhibitor of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, represents a novel mechanism for induction of tumor cell apoptosis.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7436-7442PubMed Google Scholar). NR was added to the medium at a concentration of 1, 10, or 100 μM. To inhibit PNP, cells were additionally treated with Immucillin H. Twenty-four hours after the treatment, we estimated the concentration of intracellular NAD using NMR spectroscopy. Treatment with FK866 depleted NAD to undetectable levels in HEK293, HeLa, and THP1 cells (Fig. 5A). NAD in extracts obtained from cells additionally treated with 10 μM NR was still below the detection limit, while cotreatment with Immucillin H was able to recover NAD to up to 50% of the control level. Consequently, PNP inhibition considerably improved the ability of cells to synthesize NAD from NR. When NR was added to HEK293 cells at a concentration of 100 μM, the cellular NAD concentration could be maintained at normal levels, even in the presence of FK866, but only when PNP was inhibited (Fig. 5A, left panel). We additionally assessed the NAD(P)H-dependent cell metabolic activity"
https://openalex.org/W4306896994,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has exceeded 6 million known disease-related deaths and there is evidence of an increase in maternal deaths, especially in low- and middle-income countries. We aimed to estimate excess maternal deaths in Brazil and its macroregions as well as their trajectories in the first 15 months of the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods This study evaluated maternal deaths from the Mortality Information System of the Ministry of Health, with excess deaths being assessed between March 2020 and May 2021 by quasi-Poisson generalized additive models adjusted for overdispersion. Observed deaths were compared to deaths expected without the pandemic, accompanied by 95% confidence intervals according to region, age group, and trimester of occurrence. Analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.1 and RStudio version 1.2.1335. Results There were 3,291 notified maternal deaths during the study period, resulting in a 70% excess of deaths regardless of region, while in the North, Northeast, South and Southeast regions, excess deaths occurred regardless of age group. Excess deaths occurred in the March-May 2021 trimester regardless of region and age group. Excess deaths were observed in the Southeast region for the 25-36-year-old age group regardless of the trimester assessed, and in the North, Central-West and South regions, the only period in which excess deaths were not observed was September-November 2020. Excess deaths regardless of trimester were observed in the 37-49-year-old age group in the North region, and the South region displayed explosive behavior from March-May 2021, with a 375% excess of deaths. Conclusions Excess maternal deaths, with geographically heterogenous trajectories and consistently high patterns at the time of the epidemic’s greatest impact, reflect not only the previous effect of socioeconomic inequalities and of limited access to maternal health services, but most of all the precarious management of Brazil’s health crisis."

Collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases (C-P4Hs; Enzyme Commission no.: 1.14.11.2), localized in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, catalyze a vital cotranslational and post-translational modification of procollagen polypeptides required for the assembly of the collagen triple helix (1Myllyharju J.

C-P4Hs are Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, which use molecular oxygen to hydroxylate proline residues that are present at the Y position of the -X-Y-Gly- repeats of the procollagen chain. The Fe(II) ion is bound in the active site to a fully conserved His-X-Asp--His sequence motif, being important for activating the O2 molecule. The catalysis involves oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate to succinate and carbon dioxide and the hydroxylation of procollagen peptidyl prolines into 4-hydroxyprolines. This modification is needed to provide stability for the triple helical collagen molecules. Subsequently, the collagens are secreted into the extracellular matrix where they are further modified and assembled into various supramolecular structures, and where they are involved in, for example, cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell remodeling during growth, differentiation, and wound healing (2Myllyharju J.

Like in all 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, the core of the fold consists of eight antiparallel β-strands (labeled as βI to βVIII), having the spiral topology of the double-stranded β-helix fold (the DSBH-fold) (28Dunwell J.M.

In the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, the cofactor 2-oxoglutarate is bound in a deeply buried cavity between these two sheets, shielded from bulk solvent by the bound substrate molecule (28Dunwell J.M.

In the structure of Cr-P4H complexed with its proline-rich substrate peptide, the peptide is bound in a tunnel shaped by two substrate-binding loops, being the hairpin loop and the βII-βIII loop (27Koski M.K.

In the unliganded Cr-P4H structure, the substrate-binding loops are disordered and/or adopt different conformations (26Koski M.K. Hieta R. Böllner C. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Wierenga R.K.

In addition, in the unliganded structure, the βI-βII catalytic loop (residues Tyr134 to Tyr140) adopts a different conformation when comparing liganded and unliganded structures. The conformational flexibility properties of the two substrate-binding loops and the catalytic loop are important for the catalytic function of this enzyme (27Koski M.K. Hieta R. Hirsilä M. Rönkä A.

Ruddock L.W. The human disulphide isomerase family: substrate interactions and functional properties.EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). These domains have a thioredoxin fold. The a domain and a’ domain of PDI are also referred to as its catalytic domains, as they both have the conserved CGHC-sequence motif (Figs. 2 and S2). The cysteines of this motif are the CAT residues, needed to catalyze the formation, breaking, and isomerization of disulfide bridges of the PDI substrate proteins in their folding pathway. Studies have shown that the β/PDI subunit is required for providing the soluble and catalytically competent conformation of the α-subunit, but it is not understood how it is assembled with the α-subunit, how it is involved in intersubunit disulfide bridges, and what its role is in the procollagen hydroxylation reaction mechanism of the mature C-P4H α2β2 tetramer (30John D.C.

The crystal structure of human PDI is known in oxidized (having a disulfide bond between the two cysteines of the CGHC-motif) and reduced (the cysteines of the CGHC motif are reduced) forms (35Wang C. Li W. Ren J. Fang J. Ke H. Gong W. et al.Structural insights into the redox-regulated dynamic conformations of human protein disulfide isomerase.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2013; 19: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Also known is the structure of the human heterodimer microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which includes PDI as its β-subunit (36Biterova E.I. Isupov M.N. Keegan R.M. Lebedev A.A. Sohail A.A. Liaqat I. et al.The crystal structure of human microsomal triglyceride transfer protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 17251-17260Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The α-subunit of MTP is a lipid-binding protein, and its amino acid sequence and fold are not related to the α-subunit of C-P4H. In addition, the crystal structure of ERp57 (a PDI family member, present in the endoplasmic reticulum), complexed with tapasin (not related to the α-subunits of C-P4H and MTP), is known (37Dong G. Wearsch P.A. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Reinisch K.M.

Small-angle X-ray scattering studies of mature C-P4H-I suggest that in the mature α2β2 C-P4H-I tetramer, the CAT domains of the two α-subunits point away from the α2-dimer interface (formed by the two N-terminal dimerization domains) and are capped by the β/PDI subunit, positioned at both ends of the elongated tetramer, suggesting that the β/PDI subunit interacts solely with the CAT domain (23Koski M.K. Anantharajan J. Kursula P. Dhavala P. Murthy A.V. Bergmann U. et al.Assembly of the elongated collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase α2β2 heterotetramer around a central α2 dimer.Biochem. J. 2017; 474: 751-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These small-angle X-ray scattering studies have provided also the shape information of proteolytically truncated forms of C-P4H-I, which were copurified together with the mature recombinant C-P4H-I. One of these truncated forms was a heterodimer complex of a truncated α-chain (consisting of the PSB and CAT domains but lacking the N-terminal dimerization domain) complexed with the intact β/PDI subunit. The truncation site of this heterodimer is near residue Asp139 of the α-subunit of C-P4H-I (just before the PSB domain) (Fig. 1) (23Koski M.K. Anantharajan J. Kursula P. Dhavala P. Murthy A.V. Bergmann U. et al.Assembly of the elongated collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase α2β2 heterotetramer around a central α2 dimer.Biochem. J. 2017; 474: 751-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The more detailed characterization of such a complex can provide key information on the structure of the CAT domain and its assembly with the β/PDI subunit, which is currently completely lacking. However, the optimal α-subunit truncation site for obtaining a heterodimer that has only the CAT domain of the α-subunit, complexed with the intact β/PDI subunit, is not clear, as it depends on the unknown structural and functional role of the linker region (Fig. 2). Here, we report on the characterization of two truncated human C-P4H-II variants in which the α-subunit is lacking either the N-terminal dimerization domain (C-P4H-II-Δ140) or the dimerization domain and the PSB domain (C-P4H-II-Δ281). These truncated variants of C-P4H-II are stable and soluble heterodimer complexes. The C-P4H-II-Δ281 complex could be crystallized, and its crystal structure reveals the structure of the CAT domain as well as its interactions with the β/PDI subunit. This crystal structure, together with the AlphaFold2 (DeepMind company and EMBL-EBI) (38Jumper J. Evans R. Pritzel A. Green T. Figurnov M. Ronnegerger O. et al.Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold.Nature. 2021; 596: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (4112) Google Scholar) model of the complete α-subunit dimer, enabled the prediction of the mode of assembly of the C-P4H-II α2β2 heterotetramer, which is also discussed. Considerable proteolytic degradation has been a problem in previous experiments on recombinant production of human C-P4H-I in the Escherichia coli Origami strain (23Koski M.K. Anantharajan J. Kursula P. Dhavala P. Murthy A.V. Bergmann U. et al.Assembly of the elongated collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase α2β2 heterotetramer around a central α2 dimer.Biochem.

Pre-expression of a sulfhydryl oxidase significantly increases the yields of eukaryotic disulfide bond containing proteins expressed in the cytoplasm of E.coli.Microb. Cell Fact. 2011; 10: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which has been used for the expression of MTP for crystallization (36Biterova E.I. Isupov M.N. Keegan R.M. Lebedev A.A. Sohail A.A. Liaqat I. et al.The crystal structure of human microsomal triglyceride transfer protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 17251-17260Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), was tested for production of human C-P4H-I and C-P4H-II. For this purpose, codon-optimized constructs of the α-subunit of C-P4H-I and C-P4H-II (Table S1) were coexpressed with β/PDI, being part of the CyDisCo expression vector. The complexes were expressed and purified as described in the Experimental procedures section. The C-P4H-I and C-P4H-II samples were pure after the size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) step. The yield of C-P4H-II was better, and proteolytic degradation was less than for C-P4H-I. Mass spectrometric (MS) peptide mapping of C-P4H-II confirmed that the purified C-P4H-II includes the N-terminal and C-terminal peptides of both subunits (Table S2). Therefore, subsequent experiments, aimed at finding the best possible truncation sites of the α-subunit that would allow for the recombinant generation and purification of a complex of the CAT domain assembled with β/PDI, were done with C-P4H-II. Four truncated constructs of the α-subunit were tested, referred to as C-P4H-II-Δ140, C-P4H-II-Δ281, C-P4H-II-Δ304, and C-P4H-II-Δ324, in which the first 140, 281, 304, and 324 residues, respectively, were deleted (Fig. 2). The truncated α-subunits were expressed with a 6× His tag at the N terminus, whereas the coexpressed β/PDI subunit was without a tag, identical as used for the expression of the mature C-P4H-I and C-P4H-II complexes (Table S1). Coexpression of PDI with the C-P4H-II-Δ140 construct (encoding for PSB and CAT, Fig. 2) as well as with the C-P4H-II-Δ281 construct (encoding for CAT only, Fig. 2) resulted in soluble complexes, whereas the C-P4H-II-Δ304 and C-P4H-II-Δ324 constructs were only expressed as insoluble proteins, which could not be purified. Apparently, the residues between 281 and 304 include amino acids that are required to form a soluble complex of the CAT domain, assembled with β/PDI. The C-P4H-II-Δ140 and C-P4H-II-Δ281 complexes were purified using the same protocols as used for mature C-P4H-I and C-P4H-II. The SDS-PAGE gel analysis showed that these samples are highly pure, and truncated α and intact β-subunits are present, which was also confirmed by MS characterization. Characterization by multiangle light scattering (MALS) (Fig. S3 and Table 1) confirmed that the purified C-P4H-II-Δ140 and C-P4H-II-Δ281 complexes are heterodimers. The CD spectra (Fig. S4A) show that wildtype C-P4H-II and its two truncated variants have the expected secondary structure properties. The CD melting curves of the truncated complexes (Fig. S4B) show Tm values of 50.2 and 53.2 °C for, respectively, C-P4H-II-Δ140 and C-P4H-II-Δ281, slightly higher than the Tm of mature C-P4H-II (Tm = 46.5 °C) (Table 1), which confirms that the truncated complexes indeed are stable proteins. Activity assays show that the two truncated variants have C-P4H activity, although to a lesser extent than mature C-P4H-II (Table 1). Subsequently, crystallization experiments were carried out with these purified complexes, which resulted in diffraction quality crystals of the C-P4H-Δ281 complex, as outlined in the next section.Table 1The molecular weights, the Tm values, and the activity assay results of mature C-P4H-II and its truncated variantsConstructMolecular weight (SEC–MALSaThe SEC–MALS graphs are shown in Fig. S3.)Tm (CDbThe CD melting curves are shown in Fig. S4B.)Indirect assaycThe mean values of the results of three experiments are provided. with 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate and (PPG)10 substrate, measuring the hydroxylation coupled amount of formed14CO2Direct assaydThe results of two experiments are reported.

Here, we undertook a large-scale transcriptomic study using 508 wild-type mouse striatal tissue samples dissected exclusively in the afternoons to define 38 highly reproducible gene coexpression modules. We found that 13 and 11 modules are enriched in cell-type and molecular complex markers, respectively. Importantly, 18 modules are highly enriched in daily rhythmically expressed genes that peak or trough with distinct temporal kinetics, revealing the underlying biology of striatal diurnal gene networks. Moreover, the diurnal coexpression networks are a dominant feature of daytime transcriptomes in the mouse cortex. We next employed the striatal coexpression modules to decipher the striatal transcriptomic signatures from Huntington's disease models and heterozygous null mice for 52 genes, uncovering novel functions for Prkcq and Kdm4b in oligodendrocyte differentiation and bipolar disorder-associated Trank1 in regulating anxiety-like behaviors and nocturnal locomotion."

R2R3-MYBs play a variety of functions in plants, such as cell fate determination, organ and tissue differentiations, primary and secondary metabolisms, stress and defense responses and other physiological processes. The Japanese morning glory (Ipomoea nil) has been widely used as a model plant for flowering and morphological studies. In the present study, 127 R2R3-MYB genes were identified in the Japanese morning glory genome. Information, including gene structure, protein motif, chromosomal location and gene expression, were assigned to the InR2R3-MYBs. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the 127 InR2R3-MYBs were classified into 29 subfamilies (C1-C29). Herein, physiological functions of the InR2R3-MYBs are discussed based on the functions of their Arabidopsis orthologues. InR2R3-MYBs in C9, C15, C16 or C28 may regulate cell division, flavonol biosynthesis, anthocyanin biosynthesis or response to abiotic stress, respectively. C16 harbors the known anthocyanin biosynthesis regulator, InMYB1 (INIL00g10723), and putative anthocyanin biosynthesis regulators, InMYB2 (INIL05g09650) and InMYB3 (INIL05g09651). In addition, INIL05g09649, INIL11g40874 and INIL11g40875 in C16 were suggested as novel anthocyanin biosynthesis regulators. We organized the R2R3-MYB transcription factors in the morning glory genome and assigned information to gene and protein structures and presuming their functions. Our study is expected to facilitate future research on R2R3-MYB transcription factors in Japanese morning glory."
https://openalex.org/W4306897006,"Increasing global food insecurity amidst a growing population and diminishing production resources renders the currently dominant linear production model insufficient to combat such challenges. Hence, a circular bioeconomy (CBE) model that ensures more conservative use of resources has become essential. Specifically, a CBE model that focuses on recycling and reusing organic waste is essential to close nutrient loops and establish more resilient rural-urban nexus food systems. However, the CBE status quo in many African food systems is not established. Moreover, scientific evidence on CBE in Africa is almost inexistent, thus limiting policy guidance to achieving circular food systems. Using a sample of about 2,100 farmers and consumers from key food value chains (cassava in Rwanda, coffee in DRC, and bananas in Ethiopia), we explored existing CBE practices; awareness, knowledge, and support for CBE practices; consumers' opinions on eating foods grown on processed organic waste (CBE fertilizers), and determinants of such opinions. We analysed data in Stata, first descriptively, and then econometrically using the ordered logistic regression, whose proportional odds assumption was violated, thus resorting to the generalized ordered logistic regression. Results show that communities practice aspects of CBE, mainly composting, and are broadly aware, knowledgeable, supportive of CBE practices, and would broadly accept eating foods grown CBE fertilizers. Households with heads that used mobile phones, or whose heads were older, or married, or had a better education and agricultural incomes were more likely to strongly agree that they were knowledgeable and supportive of CBE practices and would eat CBE foods (foods grown on processed organic waste). However, the reverse was true for households that were severely food insecure or lived farther from towns. Rwandan and Ethiopian households compared to DRC were less likely to eat CB foods. Policies to stimulate CBE investments in all three countries were largely absent, and quality scientific evidence to guide their development and implementation is currently insufficient."

To evaluate current reporting practices, we performed a cross-sectional survey of 400 preclinical oncology studies using mouse solid-tumour models. Articles published in 2020 were selected from 20 journals that specifically endorsed the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) preclinical reporting guidelines. We assessed reporting compliance for 22 items in five domains: ethical oversight assurance, animal signalment, husbandry, welfare, and euthanasia. Data were analysed using hierarchical generalised random-intercept models, clustered on journal. Overall, reporting of animal-related items was poor. Median compliance over all categories was 23%. There was little or no association between extent of reporting compliance and journal or journal impact factor. Age, sex, and source were reported most frequently, but verifiable strain information was reported for <10% of studies. Animal husbandry, housing environment, and welfare items were reported by <5% of studies. Fewer than one in four studies reported analgesia use, humane endpoints, or an identifiable method of euthanasia. Of concern was the poor documentation of ethical oversight information. Fewer than one in four provided verifiable approval information, and almost one in ten reported no information, or information that was demonstrably false. Mice are the ""invisible actors"" in preclinical oncology research. In spite of widespread endorsement of reporting guidelines, adherence to reporting guidelines on the part of authors is poor and journals fail to enforce guideline reporting standards. In particular, the inadequate reporting of key animal-related items severely restricts the utility and translation potential of mouse models, and results in research waste. Both investigators and journals have the ethical responsibility to ensure animals are not wasted in uninformative research."

This study aimed to clarify differences in the pathophysiology of ECP and FD-P and to determine whether duodenal inflammatory responses in the two diseases were associated with protease-activated receptor (PAR) 2, as the trypsin receptor.Eighty patients who presented with FD-P and ECP were enrolled. In duodenal specimens, PAR2 mRNA levels were determined using real-time PCR. Using immunostaining, CD68-, GLP-1-, PRG2-, and CCR2-positive cells, tight junction proteins, and PAR 2 were evaluated.There were no significant differences in clinical symptoms and gastric motility between ECP and FD-P patients. The CD68-positive cells infiltrations and occludin expression levels in the duodenal mucosa of patients with FD-P were significantly (p<0.001 and p = 0.048, respectively) lower than those in patients with ECP. Although serum trypsin levels in ECP and FD-P patents were significantly (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively) associated with duodenal eosinophils counts, elevated trypsin levels were not significantly associated with degranulated eosinophils, occludin, claudin-1 and ZO-1 expression levels in the duodenum of either group. PAR2 mRNA levels were increased in the duodenum of patients with ECP and FD-P. PAR2 was localized in the epithelial cells of the duodenal mucosa and the surface of degranulated eosinophils in ECP and FD-P patients.Elevated trypsin levels might be partly associated with duodenal inflammatory responses through PAR2-related degranulated eosinophils and the reduction of occludin in patients with ECP and FD-P."

In this study, we investigate how the sense of belonging, and how it is enacted, changed longitudinally amongst older adults in the UK. In addition, we examine the interplay of the sense of belonging and resilience over time.We employed a longitudinal qualitative research design to explore the experiences of older adults during one year of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020-April 2021). The analysis was undertaken with constructivist grounded theory.Before the pandemic older adults were free to engage in social relationships with family and friends, often enacted within social activity groups where they felt valued and gained positive experiences. During the pandemic face to face enactment of belongingness was reduced; adjustments needed to be made to maintain the sense of belonging. The experience of older adults was heterogeneous. We examine three themes. First, how belongingness was enacted prior to the pandemic. Examples include: family holidays, visiting each other, sports activities, eating with friends and family, and visiting cultural events. Second, how participants adapted and maintained their social involvement. Examples include: distanced face-to-face activities; and learning new technology. Third, for some, a belongingness gap emerged and persisted. There was an irretrievable loss of family members or friends, the closure of social groups, or withdrawal from groups as priorities changed. As a consequence, of challenged belongingness, participants expressed increased loneliness, anxiety, social isolation, frustration and, feelings of depression. For many, the disrupted sense of belonging no longer fostered resilience, and some previously resilient participants were no longer resilient."
https://openalex.org/W4306655443,"Phosphoserine (pSer) sites are primarily located within disordered protein regions, making it difficult to experimentally ascertain their effects on protein structure and function. Therefore, the production of 15N- (and 13C)-labeled proteins with site-specifically encoded pSer for NMR studies is essential to uncover molecular mechanisms of protein regulation by phosphorylation. While genetic code expansion technologies for the translational installation of pSer in Escherichia coli are well established and offer a powerful strategy to produce site-specifically phosphorylated proteins, methodologies to adapt them to minimal or isotope-enriched media have not been described. This shortcoming exists because pSer genetic code expansion expression hosts require the genomic ΔserB mutation, which increases pSer bioavailability but also imposes serine auxotrophy, preventing growth in minimal media used for isotopic labeling of recombinant proteins. Here, by testing different media supplements, we restored normal BL21(DE3) ΔserB growth in labeling media but subsequently observed an increase of phosphatase activity and mis-incorporation not typically seen in standard rich media. After rounds of optimization and adaption of a high-density culture protocol, we were able to obtain ≥10 mg/L homogenously labeled, phosphorylated superfolder GFP. To demonstrate the utility of this method, we also produced the intrinsically disordered serine/arginine-rich region of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein labeled with 15N and pSer at the key site S188 and observed the resulting peak shift due to phosphorylation by 2D and 3D heteronuclear single quantum correlation analyses. We propose this cost-effective methodology will pave the way for more routine access to pSer-enriched proteins for 2D and 3D NMR analyses."

Mixed methods were used to evaluate the feasibility of the intervention including its uptake (G6PD testing rate and the initiation of primaquine treatment according to G6PD status); adherence (self-reported); and acceptability, using quantitative analysis of primary and secondary data as well as focus group discussions and key informant interviews.The co-development process resulted in the design of a new care pathway with supporting interventions, and a phased approach to their implementation. Patients diagnosed with P.v infection by Village Malaria Workers (VMWs) were referred to local health centres for point-of-care G6PD testing and initiation of radical cure treatment with 14-day or 8-week primaquine regimens depending on G6PD status. VMWs carried out follow-up in the community on days 3, 7 and 14. Supporting interventions included training, community sensitisation, and the development of a smartphone and tablet application to aid referral, follow-up and surveillance. The testing rate was low initially but increased rapidly over time, reflecting the deliberately cautious phased approach to implementation. In total 626 adults received G6PD testing, for a total of 675 episodes. Of these 555 occurred in patients with normal G6PD activity and nearly all (549/555, 98.8%) were initiated on PQ14. Of the 120 with deficient/intermediate G6PD activity 61 (50.8%) were initiated on PQ8W. Self-reported adherence was high (100% and 95.1% respectively). No severe adverse events were reported. The pathway was found to be highly acceptable by both staff and patients. The supporting interventions and gradual introduction were critical to success. Challenges included travel to remote areas and mobility of P.v patients.The new care pathway with supporting interventions was highly feasible with high levels of uptake, adherence and acceptability in this setting where high prevalence of G6PD deficiency is high and there is a well-established network of VMWs. Scaling up of the P.v radical cure programme is currently underway in Cambodia and a decline in reduction in the burden of malaria is being seen, bringing Cambodia a step closer to elimination."

Optimization of Fast PCR protocol using plasmid-based N1 and N2 positive control and synthetic version of human RP was done on Applied Biosystems (ABI) QuantStudioTM5 (conventional), ABI 7500 Fast Dx (designated), and CFX96 Touch Real Time Detection System, Bio-Rad (conventional). Finally, a performance evaluation of Fast PCR was performed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and precision. For a 40-cycle PCR with optimized Fast PCR protocols on QuantStudioTM5, ABI 7500 Fast Dx, and CFX96 Touch (conventional), standard/regular versus Fast PCR run times (min) were 84 vs. 49, 96 vs. 48, and 103 vs. 61, thereby saving 35, 48, and 43 min, respectively. For each thermal cycler, Standard and Fast PCR generated identical shapes of fluorescence curves, Ct values, and (3) R2 (0.95 to 0.99) for 5 10-log dilution panels of each positive control. The fast PCR approach generated results with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Median test comparisons between standard PCR and Fast PCR Cts of COVID-19 samples did not produce significance (p>0.5), suggesting that Fast PCR and Standard PCR were comparable. Also, the median and mean of each target had closely-related values, further suggesting that the two approaches were comparable. That is, there is an equivalency between Conventional and Fast PCR instruments for detection of COVID-19."

The literature consistently reports a robust association between periodontal disease and systemic diseases. However, it is not fully known if physicians in Saudi Arabia are aware of the oral-systemic disease links. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate physicians' awareness of the oral-systemic disease links and their association with patients' referral to dentists and patients' access to oral care.This cross-sectional study was conducted (June 2019-January 2020) on physicians working in private and public hospitals in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia. The physicians (n = 333) responded to a paper-based self-administered and pilot-tested questionnaire which inquired about their awareness of oral-systemic disease links and patient referral to dentists. The reliability of items of oral-systemic disease links was evaluated by calculating Cronbach's alpha (0.84).Most participants (92.8%) agreed/strongly agreed that oral health is associated with systemic health. Half of the sample (50.8%) referred patients to dentists during the last month. Almost 80.5% believed that more patients will be referred to the dentists because of their awareness of the oral-systemic disease links and 84% believed that more patients will access oral care services if patients were aware of the oral-systemic disease links. The participants who referred patients to the dentists during the last month (P = 0.038), believed that more patients will be referred (P = 0.001), and believed that more patients will access oral care (P = 0.003) demonstrated significantly higher oral-systemic disease links awareness score. The adjusted model showed patients' referral to dentist (OR = 1.96.10, P = 0.006) and believing in more patients accessing oral care (OR = 2.05, P = 0.044) were associated with significantly increased awareness of the oral-systemic disease links.Most physicians in the study were aware of the oral-systemic disease links. Increased awareness of the oral-systemic disease links was significantly associated with the referral of patients to dentists and belief in improved patients' access to oral care services."
https://openalex.org/W4306897026,"The Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) is a recently proposed intelligent optimization algorithm based on mass balance equation. It has a novel principle to deal with global optimization. However, when solving complex numerical optimization problems and engineering problems, the algorithm will get stuck into local optima and degrade accuracy. To address the issue, an improved Equilibrium Optimizer (IEO) based on multi-strategy optimization is proposed. First, Tent mapping is used to generate the initial location of the particle population, which evenly distributes the particle population and lays the foundation for diversified global search process. Moreover, nonlinear time parameter is used to update the position equation, which dynamically balances the exploration and exploitation phases of improved algorithm. Finally, Lens Opposition‑based Learning (LOBL) is introduced, which avoids local optimization by improving the population diversity of the algorithm. Simulation experiments are carried out on 23 classical functions, IEEE CEC2017 problems and IEEE CEC2019 problems, and the stability of the algorithm is further analyzed by Friedman statistical test and box plots. Experimental results show that the algorithm has good solution accuracy and robustness. Additionally, six engineering design problems are solved, and the results show that improved algorithm has high optimization efficiency achieves cost minimization."
https://openalex.org/W4306897044,"A number of influential linguistic analyses hold that African American English (AAE) has no verbal– s , the– s that, for example, turns drink into drinks in more mainstream English varieties.On such accounts, sentences like Mary drinks coffee are ungrammatical in AAE. Previous behavioral studies suggest that in addition to being ungrammatical, AAE speaking children find these sentences cognitively demanding, and that their presence in mathematical reasoning tests can depress scores. Until now, however, no online sentence processing study nor investigation of neurophysiological markers has been done to support these findings. Aimed at addressing this gap in the literature, the auditory ERP experiment described herein revealed two different processes associated with AAE speaking 2nd graders listening to this type of sentence: a morphosyntactic structure building problem, reflected in a bilateral early anterior-central negativity; and an increase in working memory load, indicated by a bilateral late long-lasting anterior-central negativity. Study participants also took an orally administered test of math word problems. Consistent with previous findings, results showed they answered fewer questions correctly when those questions contained verbal– s than when they did not."
https://openalex.org/W4306941866,"Abstract Quantum mechanical tunnelling describes transmission of matter waves through a barrier with height larger than the energy of the wave 1 . Tunnelling becomes important when the de Broglie wavelength of the particle exceeds the barrier thickness; because wavelength increases with decreasing mass, lighter particles tunnel more efficiently than heavier ones. However, there exist examples in condensed-phase chemistry where increasing mass leads to increased tunnelling rates 2 . In contrast to the textbook approach, which considers transitions between continuum states, condensed-phase reactions involve transitions between bound states of reactants and products. Here this conceptual distinction is highlighted by experimental measurements of isotopologue-specific tunnelling rates for CO rotational isomerization at an NaCl surface 3,4 , showing nonmonotonic mass dependence. A quantum rate theory of isomerization is developed wherein transitions between sub-barrier reactant and product states occur through interaction with the environment. Tunnelling is fastest for specific pairs of states (gateways), the quantum mechanical details of which lead to enhanced cross-barrier coupling; the energies of these gateways arise nonsystematically, giving an erratic mass dependence. Gateways also accelerate ground-state isomerization, acting as leaky holes through the reaction barrier. This simple model provides a way to account for tunnelling in condensed-phase chemistry, and indicates that heavy-atom tunnelling may be more important than typically assumed."
https://openalex.org/W4306655489,"The high heterogeneity and mutation rate of cancer cells often lead to the failure of targeted therapy, and therefore, new targets for multitarget therapy of tumors are urgently needed. Aberrantly expressed glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) have been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis and are promising new targets. Recently, the GAG-binding domain rVAR2 of the Plasmodium falciparum VAR2CSA protein was identified as a probe targeting cancer-associated chondroitin sulfate A-like epitopes. In this study, we found that rVAR2 could also bind to heparin (Hep) and chondroitin sulfate E. Therefore, we used rVAR2 as a model to establish a method based on random mutagenesis of the GAG-binding protein and phage display to identify and optimize probes targeting tumor GAGs. We identified a new probe, VAR2HP, which selectively recognized Hep by interacting with unique epitopes consisting of a decasaccharide structure that contains at least three HexA2S(1–4)GlcNS6S disaccharides. Moreover, we found that these Hep-like epitopes were overexpressed in various cancer cells. Most importantly, our in vivo experiments showed that VAR2HP had good biocompatibility and preferentially localizes to tumors, which indicates that VAR2HP has great application potential in tumor diagnosis and targeted therapy.

Targeted therapies have been recognized as the most promising therapeutic strategy for cancers because they can directly alter cell signaling events through the use of inhibitors and indirectly deliver antineoplastic drugs to cancer cells through tumor-targeting molecules (1Allen T.M.

However, the high heterogeneity and mutation of cancer cells are often the main reasons for the failure of targeted therapy (9Lim Z.F. Ma P.C. Emerging insights of tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance mechanisms in lung cancer targeted therapy.J. Hematol. Oncol. 2019; 12: 134Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of tumor-associated neoantigens/neoepitopes is urgently needed for the diagnosis and multitargeted therapy of cancers (10Papiez M.A. Krzysciak W. Biological therapies in the treatment of cancer-update and new directions.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22: 11694Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), linear negatively charged heteropolysaccharides composed of repeating hexosamine-containing disaccharide units, are ubiquitously expressed in all mammalian tissues. GAGs are classified into four categories according to the type of disaccharide composition and linkage between disaccharide units: chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate (DS), heparin (Hep)/heparan sulfate (HS), hyaluronan, and keratan sulfate. GAGs participate in various physiological and pathological processes including tumorigenesis (11Mizumoto S. Sugahara K.

Aberrantly expressed GAGs in structure and/or quantity are involved in the proliferation, invasion, adhesion, and migration of tumor cells and therefore have the potential to be used as targets for the diagnosis and therapy (15Morla S.

Some GAG-based neoantigens/neoepitopes have been identified as promising therapeutic targets in cancers. For example, a HS motif (GlcNS6S-IdoA2S)3 recognized by the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody NS4F5 is upregulated in ovarian cancer (17Smits N.C. Kurup S. Rops A.L. ten Dam G.B.

Another scFv antibody, HS20, inhibits the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vitro and in vivo by binding to the HS chains of glypican-3 to block Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling, which recognizes HS structures containing IdoA2S and GlcNS6S (18Gao W.

Notably, all these studies were based on the development and application of anti-GAG antibodies selected from established semisynthetic scFv libraries (26Ahuva N. Heenie R.H. Ian M.T. Greg F.

Considering the high complexity of GAG chains, however, it is necessary to develop new approaches to specifically screen novel probes and identify their GAG-based epitopes in cancer cells. Recently, a CS-A-like epitope rich in GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate), which is exclusively expressed in the placenta, has been found in a various of malignant cells and can be specifically targeted by a recombinant fragment ID1-DBL2X-ID2a (rVAR2) of the Plasmodium falciparum VAR2CSA protein (27Salanti A.

Chem. 2011; 286: 15908-15917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In a preliminary study, we found that rVAR2 expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) could interact with not only CS-A but also Dosidicus gigas cartilage-derived CS-E (30Peng C. Wang Q. Jiao R. Xu Y. Han N. Wang W. et al.A novel chondroitin sulfate E from Dosidicus gigas cartilage and its antitumor metastatic activity.Carbohydr. Polym. 2021; 262: 117971Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and porcine intestinal mucosa-derived Hep (Fig. S1), indicating that rVAR2 has the potential to recognize other GAG-based epitopes. In this study, we used rVAR2 as a template and cancer cell-derived GAGs as targets to identify new probes that specifically recognize GAG-based epitopes, by performing random mutation and using phage display technology. A novel probe, VAR2HP, with high selectivity for Hep was obtained and shown to target Hep-like epitopes with unique structural features in various cancer cells. This study provides strategy for development and identification of novel GAG-based epitopes and their specific probes. The gene of ID1-ID2a (VAR2) domain was codon-optimized and synthesized based on the previously reported protein sequence (29Dahlback M. Jorgensen L.M. Nielsen M.A. Clausen T.M. Ditlev S.B. Resende M. et al.The chondroitin sulfate A-binding site of the VAR2CSA protein involves multiple N-terminal domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 15908-15917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), cloned into pET-22b (+) vector, and then expressed by E. coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant VAR2 (rVAR2) was purified to >95% purity by nickel affinity chromatography coupled with gel filtration (Fig. S2A) and tested for its binding ability to various GAGs using a binding assay. The results showed that the obtained rVAR2 could not only strongly interact with CS-A but also significantly interact with CS-E and Hep (Figs. 1A and S2C), and especially a surface plasmon resonance binding analysis showed that rVAR2 bond to Hep with a high affinity (KD ∼ 61 nM) (Fig. 1B). Notably, the interaction of rVAR2 with Hep and CS-E has not been investigated in previous studies, which may limit knowledge about the selectivity of rVAR2 binding to GAGs. The binding of rVAR2 to CS-E may be due to the high proportion (>80%) of 4-O-sulfated GalNAc residues in CS-E (Table S1). In contrast, the possible reason for the binding of rVAR2 to Hep is unclear, but previous studies have shown that rVAR2 binds to CS-A through a positively charged groove (31Wang K. Dagil R. Lavstsen T. Misra S.K. Spliid C.B. Wang Y. et al.Cryo-EM reveals the architecture of placental malaria VAR2CSA and provides molecular insight into chondroitin sulfate binding.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 32Ma R. Lian T. Huang R. Renn J.P. Petersen J.D. Zimmerberg J. et al.Structural basis for placental malaria mediated by Plasmodium falciparum VAR2CSA.Nat. Microbiol. 2021; 6: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which may also involve in the interaction with the highly negatively charged Hep. Anyway, this finding provides us with the opportunity and possibility to use it as a template to screen Hep-selective probes. To screen novel probes for the GAG-based epitopes of tumors, rVAR2 was exploited as a starting template, and then, random mutation was combined with phage display technology to screen probes that directly target cancer cell GAGs. As shown in Figure 1C, HCC HepG2 cell-derived GAGs (HepG2-GAGs) containing 95.88% of Hep/HS and 4.12% of CS/DS (Fig. S3 and Table S2) were biotinylated, preincubated with avidin, and then immobilized on carboxyl-modified magnetic beads. Then, a library of rVAR2 mutants was constructed via random mutations and expressed in a phage display. After multiple rounds of biopanning with the HepG2-GAGs-modified magnetic beads, recombinant phages carrying the targeting protein were retained. The genes encoding the target proteins were cloned into E. coli, the monoclonal bacteria were selected, and the selectivity of the recombinant proteins was analyzed by binding assay after heterologous induced expression. Finally, six clones (GAG-1 to GAG-6) with significant binding capacity to HepG2-GAGs were obtained (Fig. S2B), among which GAG-4 with the highest binding ability to HepG2-GAGs, named VAR2HP, was selected for further study. After sequencing, the var2hp gene was shown to consist of 1953 bp with a GC content of 51.56% and to encode a protein containing 651 amino acids with an isoelectric point (PI) of 8.10, and a calculated molecular weight of 73.07 kDa using the peptide mass tool on the ExPASy server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Compared with the sequence of rVAR2, VAR2HP has eleven extra amino acids, including a fragment L292C293Y294T295D296K297L298E299L300 N301 and an N312 residue (Fig. 2A). Then, the above obtained E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pET22b-var2hp were expanded and induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, and after sonication and centrifugation, the VAR2HP protein was purified from the resulting lysis supernatant by a nickel affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE showed VAR2HP was purified as a single band at approximately 70 KDa (Fig. 2B), which was consistent with the theoretical calculated value. The VAR2HP protein was preserved in PBS buffer for the following study. To investigate the selectivity of VAR2HP, binding assay was performed to analyze the binding capacity of VAR2HP to various GAGs (Table S1). Under optimal conditions (Fig. S4), the results showed that VAR2HP significantly bound to Hep but not to the other GAGs (Fig. 3A) and to Hep at a level comparable to that of rVAR2 to CS-A (Fig. S2C). Additionally, no obvious binding to CS-A or HS was detected with increasing concentrations of VAR2HP (Fig. S5), suggesting that VAR2HP, unlike rVAR2, is a Hep-selective probe. To further investigate the roles of two mutation sites (L292C293Y294T295D296K297L298E299L300 N301) and N312 in VAR2HP binding to Hep, three mutants were recombinantly constructed and expressed using specifically designed primers (Table S3): VAR2HP-T, which was truncated VAR2HP (Glu226 to Asn395) containing the two mutation sites; VAR2HP-noAsn, which was a mutant of VAR2HP with N312 deleted; and VAR2-Asn, which was a mutant of VAR2 with an inserted Asn in the position corresponding to N312 of VAR2HP (Figs. 3, B–D and S2C). Binding assays showed that VAR2HP-T bound to no GAGs (Fig. 3B), indicating that the inserted fragment L292C293Y294T295D296K297L298E299L300 N301 and residue N312 together do not determine the binding capacity of VAR2HP to Hep. On the other hand, compared with VAR2HP, the mutant VAR2HP-NoAsn showed decreased binding to Hep and weak but significant binding to other GAGs (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the inserted N312 residue plays a key role in the selectivity of VAR2HP to Hep. However, the assay showing the binding of VAR2-Asn to GAGs indicated that the insertion of Asn312 alone did not meaningfully change the GAG-binding features of rVAR2, although a slight increase in binding activity to DS was observed (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results suggested that the insertions of both fragment L292C293Y294T295D296K297L298E299L300 N301 and residue N312 resulted in a dramatic change in template rVAR2 GAG-binding properties and endowed the mutant VAR2HP with strict selectivity for Hep. Surface plasmon resonance showed that VAR2HP strongly interacts with Hep (KD-value of 38 nM), although the affinity is slightly lower than that (KD ∼ 30 nM) with HepG2-GAGs (Fig. 3, E and F). Although VAR2HP was selected by using HepG2-GAGs as targets, it is usually very difficult to prepare enough GAGs from tumor cells for detailed structural analyses. Therefore, as an alternative, commercially available Hep was used to investigate the structural characteristics of epitopes recognized by VAR2HP. First, a series of unsaturated even-numbered oligosaccharides from disaccharides to hexadecasaccharides (UDP2 to UDP16) with various disaccharide compositions (Table S4 and Fig. S6) were prepared through the partial digestion of Hep with heparinase II (Hepase II) (33Zhang Q. Cao H.Y. Wei L. Lu D. Du M. Yuan M. et al.Discovery of exolytic heparinases and their catalytic mechanism and potential application.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and used as inhibitors to investigate the Hep motif required for binding by VAR2HP through a competitive inhibition assay under the optimized inhibitor amount of 0.1 μg (Figs. 4A and S7). The results showed that the oligosaccharides exhibited increased activity with increasing molecular size. Notably, the inhibitory effects of the UDP4 to UDP8 oligosaccharides were much weaker than those of the decasaccharide (UDP10) and larger oligosaccharides, which showed effects similar to those of polysaccharide Hep (Fig. 4B). These results showed that decasaccharide is the essential motif with binding affinity for VAR2HP, similar to Hep polysaccharide. The sulfation pattern of the Hep chain also plays a key role in Hep interaction with specific target proteins (34Soares da Costa D. Reis R.L. Pashkuleva I. Sulfation of glycosaminoglycans and its implications in human health and disorders.Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2017; 19: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 35Meneghetti M.C. Hughes A.J.

Robert J.L. Heparin-protein interactions.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 390-412Crossref Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). To further characterize the structure of the Hep motif recognized by VAR2HP, the Hep UDP10 was subfractionated by anion-exchange HPLC (Fig. S8), and the main subfractions (P10-1 to P10-11) were pooled for the competitive inhibition assay. From the general trend, the inhibitory activity increased with the increasing anion strength of decasaccharides eluted with higher concentrations of salt (Figs. 4C and S8), indicating the importance of oligosaccharide charge intensity in the interaction. In detail, the inhibitory activity in subfractions P10-3, P10-4, and P10-7 showed stepwise increases (Fig. 5C), indicating the subtle influence of oligosaccharide structure on the interaction. Moreover, in contrast to the decasaccharides P10-1 to P10-3 with low activity levels, all the highly active decasaccharides (P10-4 to P10-11), contained at least three trisulfated disaccharides on average (Table S5). Interestingly, the inhibitory activity of subfractions P10-4 to P10-11 were not always positively correlated with their charge intensity, for example, the charge intensity of oligosaccharides from P7 to P11 increased obviously but their inhibitory capacity did not increase significantly (Fig. 4C and Table S5), indicating that the binding capacity of these Hep oligosaccharides to VAR2HP depends not only on their charge intensity but also on their structure, such as their sequences/sulfation patterns. To further investigate the structural characteristics of the Hep motifs recognized by VAR2HP, subfraction P10-7, which showed inhibitory activity similar to that of the Hep polysaccharide (Fig. 4C), was repurified through gel filtration, and the main fraction was preliminarily sequenced with an enzymatic method that we recently developed (33Zhang Q. Cao H.Y. Wei L. Lu D. Du M. Yuan M. et al.Discovery of exolytic heparinases and their catalytic mechanism and potential application.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The results showed that it contained three types of disaccharides: HexA(1–4)GlcNS, HexA(1–4)GlcNS6S, and HexA2S(1–4)GlcNS6S at a ratio of 1:1:3 (Fig. S9). In terms of sequence, these three trisulfated HexA2S(1–4)GlcNS6S disaccharides were discontinuous in the oligosaccharide chain (Fig. 4D), which differed from the HS motif (GlcNS6S-IdoA2S)3 recognized by the scFv antibody NS4F5 (17Smits N.C. Kurup S. Rops A.L. ten Dam G.B. Massuger L.F. Hafmans T. et al.The heparan sulfate motif (GlcNS6S-IdoA2S)3, common in heparin, has a strict topography and is involved in cell behavior and disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41143-41151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the Hep-like epitopes recognized by VAR2HP are expressed on cells other than HepG2 cells, VAR2HP was first biotinylated (VAR2HP-Bio) as described previously (37Wang W. Han N. Xu Y. Zhao Y. Shi L. Filmus J. et al.Assembling custom side chains on proteoglycans to interrogate their function in living cells.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 5915Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). After verifying the selectivity of VAR2HP-Bio to Hep and optimizing the corresponding assay conditions (Fig. S10), the cell binding assay results showed that VAR2HP-Bio very strongly bound to human HCC HuH-7 cells and that the binding was mostly disrupted by treatment with Hepase I, II, and III (Hepases), but not by chondroitinase ABC (CSase ABC), and was dose dependently inhibited by Hep rather than other GAGs (Figs. 5A and S11, D–F). Similar results were observed in the binding assay of VAR2HP-Bio to HepG2 cells, human cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa cells and 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma cells (Fig. S11, A–C). These results indicated that other cancer cells can also express Hep-like epitopes recognized by VAR2HP. To quantitatively analyze the expression of these Hep-like epitopes on various cells, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled VAR2HP (VAR2HP-FITC), which had been shown to retain selective binding activity to Hep (although its emission wavelength was slightly redshifted compared to FITC (Fig. S12), was used as a probe to detect Hep-like epitopes on various living cancer and normal cells by flow cytometry. The results showed that the binding of VAR2HP-FITC was highly cell-type dependent and that it preferentially bound certain cancer cells, including human HCC HuH-7, HepG2, and Hep3B2.1--7 (Hep3B) cells, lung carcinoma A549 cells, and HeLa cells, as well as 4T1 cells (Fig. 5B). In contrast, normal HEK 293T cells, TC-1 cells, HaCaT cells, and human colon adenocarcinoma HT29 cells were very weakly stained by VAR2HP-FITC (Fig. 5B), suggesting that they likely express very low levels of VAR2HP-targeted epitopes compared with the aforementioned highly stained cancer cells. Unsurprisingly, the staining of various cells by VAR2HP-FITC was strongly inhibited by pretreatment with Hepases but not with CSase ABC (Fig. 5B), confirming the expression of Hep-like epitopes on various cells. Based on the structural properties of the Hep epitopes targeted by VAR2HP, we speculate that the content of HexA2S(1–4)GlcNS6S in HS chains on the cell surface is one of key factors for the binding of VAR2HP. Disaccharide composition analysis showed that HS chains extracted from all test cells contained HexA2S(1–4)GlcNS6S residues (Figs. 5B, S3A and S13; Tables S2 and S6). Consistent with their highest VAR2HP-binding capacity among all the tested cells (Fig. 5B), HuH-7 cells have the highest percentage (12.34%) and content (208.43 pmol) of HexA2S(1–4)GlcNS6S in 1 mg of dry cells. In contrast, HCC Li-7 cells express much lower amount of HexA2S(1–4)GlcNS6S (30.69 pmol) than HCC HuH-7 cells (208.43 pmol) and HepG2 cells (173.90 pmol) (Tables S2 and S6), which may explain why Li-7 cells showed much lower VAR2HP-binding ability than HuH-7 and HepG2 cells. Similarly, the very low binding of VAR2HP to HT29 and HEK 293T cells should be due to the rare expression of HexA2S(1–4)GlcNAcS6S (8.68 pmol and 9.42 pmol, respectively) on these cells (Table S6 and Fig. 5B). Clearly, the amount of trisulfated HexA2S(1–4)GlcNAcS6S expressed on cells is one of important factors in determining the VAR2HP-binding capacity of cells. However, it should be noted that 4T1 cells express a lower content (28.23 pmol) and proportion (4.81%) of HexA2S(1–4)GlcNAcS6S than Li-7 cells (30.69 pmol, 7.14%) but show a higher VAR2HP-binding capacity, indicating that the content of HexA2S(1–4)GlcNAcS6S expressed on cells is not the only key factor for VAR2HP-binding. Undoubtedly, the most important thing is that these trisulfated disaccharides can efficiently form the VAR2HP-binding epitopes in the HS chains. Finally, to investigate the localization of VAR2HP on cells, HuH-7 cells were stained with VAR2HP-Bio and visualized by confocal microscopy. The results showed that VAR2HP-Bio (green) clearly bound to the cell membrane, and the staining was eliminated by treatment with Hepases but not CSase ABC (Fig. 5C), further confirming that VAR2HP bound to HS/Hep but not to CS/DS chains on the cell surface. To further explore the possibility of application in vivo, the targeting of VAR2HP to organs in vivo was first investigated by injecting VAR2HP-FITC into mice through the tail vein. VAR2HP-FITC mainly targeted the intestine, stomach, and liver and could remain in these organs for at least 6 h (Fig. 6A), indicating that VAR2HP has good biocompatibility, which led to delayed immune clearance, similar to its template protein rVAR2 (27Sal"
https://openalex.org/W4306682825,"The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/angiotensin 1-7/MAS axis and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic signaling system have both been shown to have the dual potential to improve insulin resistance (IR) and hepatic steatosis associated with obesity in the liver. Recent studies have demonstrated that ACE2 can regulate the GABA signal in various tissues. Notwithstanding this evidence, the functional relationship between ACE2 and GABA signal in the liver under IR remains elusive. Here, we used high-fat diet-induced models of IR in C57BL/6 mice as well as ACE2KO and adeno-associated virus-mediated ACE2 overexpression mouse models to address this knowledge gap. Our analysis showed that glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)67/GABA signaling was weakened in the liver during IR, whereas the expression of GAD67 and GABA decreased significantly in ACE2KO mice. Furthermore, exogenous administration of angiotensin 1-7 and adeno-associated virus- or lentivirus-mediated overexpression of ACE2 significantly increased hepatic GABA signaling in models of IR both in vivo and in vitro. We found that this treatment prevented lipid accumulation and promoted fatty acid β oxidation in hepatocytes as well as inhibited the expression of gluconeogenesis- and inflammation-related genes, which could be reversed by allylglycine, a specific GAD67 inhibitor. Collectively, our findings show that signaling via the ACE2/A1-7/MAS axis can improve hepatic IR by regulating hepatic GABA signaling. We propose that this research might indicate a potential strategy for the management of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4306682974,"The heterodimerization of WT Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), and mutant SOD1 might be a critical step in the pathogenesis of SOD1-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Rates and free energies of heterodimerization (ΔGHet) between WT and ALS-mutant SOD1 in mismatched metalation states-where one subunit is metalated and the other is not-have been difficult to obtain. Consequently, the hypothesis that under-metalated SOD1 might trigger misfolding of metalated SOD1 by ""stealing"" metal ions remains untested. This study used capillary zone electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to track heterodimerization and metal transfer between WT SOD1, ALS-variant SOD1 (E100K, E100G, D90A), and triply deamidated SOD1 (modeled with N26D/N131D/N139D substitutions). We determined that rates of subunit exchange between apo dimers and metalated dimers-expressed as time to reach 30% heterodimer-ranged from t30% = 67.75 ± 9.08 to 338.53 ± 26.95 min; free energies of heterodimerization ranged from ΔGHet = -1.21 ± 0.31 to -3.06 ± 0.12 kJ/mol. Rates and ΔGHet values of partially metalated heterodimers were more similar to those of fully metalated heterodimers than apo heterodimers, and largely independent of which subunit (mutant or WT) was metal-replete or metal-free. Mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis demonstrated that mutant or WT 4Zn-SOD1 could transfer up to two equivalents of Zn2+ to mutant or WT apo-SOD1 (at rates faster than the rate of heterodimerization). This result suggests that zinc-replete SOD1 can function as a chaperone to deliver Zn2+ to apo-SOD1, and that WT apo-SOD1 might increase the toxicity of mutant SOD1 by stealing its Zn2+."
https://openalex.org/W4306683268,"NOTCH1 is a transmembrane receptor that initiates a signaling pathway involved in embryonic development of adult tissue homeostasis. The extracellular domain of NOTCH1 is composed largely of epidermal growth factor-like repeats (EGFs), many of which can be O-fucosylated at a specific consensus sequence by protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1). O-fucosylation of NOTCH1 is necessary for its function. The Notch pathway is deregulated in many cancers, and alteration of POFUT1 has been reported in several cancers, but further investigation is needed to assess whether there is deregulation of the Notch pathway associated with mutations that affect O-fucosylation in cancers. Using Biomuta and COSMIC databases, we selected nine NOTCH1 variants that could cause a change in O-fucosylation of key EGFs. Mass spectral glycoproteomic site mapping was used to identify alterations in O-fucosylation of EGFs containing the mutations. Cell-based NOTCH-1 signaling assays, ligand-binding assays, and cellsurface analysis were used to determine the effect of each mutation on Notch activation. Two variants led to a gain of function (GOF), six to a loss of function (LOF), and one had minimal effects. Most GOF and LOF were associated with a change in O-fucosylation. Finally, by comparing our results with known NOTCH1 alterations in cancers from which our mutations originated, we were able to establish a correlation between our results and the known GOF or LOF of NOTCH1 in these cancers. This study shows that point mutations in N1 can lead to alterations in O-fucosylation that deregulate the Notch pathway and be associated with cancer processes."
https://openalex.org/W4306896959,"Optimal placement of deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy for treating movement disorders routinely relies on intraoperative motor testing for target determination. However, in current practice, motor testing relies on subjective interpretation and correlation of motor and neural information. Recent advances in computer vision could improve assessment accuracy. We describe our application of deep learning-based computer vision to conduct markerless tracking for measuring motor behaviors of patients undergoing DBS surgery for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Video recordings were acquired during intraoperative kinematic testing (N = 5 patients), as part of standard of care for accurate implantation of the DBS electrode. Kinematic data were extracted from videos post-hoc using the Python-based computer vision suite DeepLabCut. Both manual and automated (80.00% accuracy) approaches were used to extract kinematic episodes from threshold derived kinematic fluctuations. Active motor epochs were compressed by modeling upper limb deflections with a parabolic fit. A semi-supervised classification model, support vector machine (SVM), trained on the parameters defined by the parabolic fit reliably predicted movement type. Across all cases, tracking was well calibrated (i.e., reprojection pixel errors 0.016–0.041; accuracies &gt;95%). SVM predicted classification demonstrated high accuracy (85.70%) including for two common upper limb movements, arm chain pulls (92.30%) and hand clenches (76.20%), with accuracy validated using a leave-one-out process for each patient. These results demonstrate successful capture and categorization of motor behaviors critical for assessing the optimal brain target for DBS surgery. Conventional motor testing procedures have proven informative and contributory to targeting but have largely remained subjective and inaccessible to non-Western and rural DBS centers with limited resources. This approach could automate the process and improve accuracy for neuro-motor mapping, to improve surgical targeting, optimize DBS therapy, provide accessible avenues for neuro-motor mapping and DBS implantation, and advance our understanding of the function of different brain areas."
https://openalex.org/W4306896963,"Objective Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an uncommon, but potentially morbid, complication following foot and ankle fractures. Current standard is to not administer thromboprophylaxis to patients with such injuries. Nonetheless, patient and fracture factors might affect this risk/benefit consideration. The goal of this study was to determine what patients are most at risk. Methods The M53Ortho Pearldiver database was used to identify patients with fractures isolated to the foot and ankle that were treated non-operatively or operatively. Patients with pilon, other appendicular fractures remote from the foot and ankle, and other traumatic injuries were excluded. The 90-day occurrence of VTE was identified based on codes for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Characteristics of those patients who did and did not have VTEs were compared using chi-square analyses. Multivariate logistical regression was then performed to determined factors independently associated with VTE. Finally, timing of VTE relative to fracture was analyzed. Results A total of 298,886 patients with isolated foot or ankle fractures were identified, of which 1,661 (0.56%) had VTE in the 90 days following fracture. In terms of timing, 27.3% occurred in the first week, and 49.8% occurred in the first three weeks. Independent risk factors for VTE included (in decreasing order):prior VTE (odd ratio [OR] = 25.44), factor V Leiden (OR = 24.34), active cancer (OR = 1.84), specific fracture relative to metatarsal fracture (multiple fractures [OR: 1.51], ankle fracture [OR = 1.51], and calcaneus fracture [OR = 1.24]), surgical treatment (OR = 1.41), male sex (OR = 1.19), greater Elixhauser index (OR = 1.05), and increasing age (OR:1.05 per decade) (p&lt;0.05 for each). Conclusions The present study found that, although only 0.56% of isolated foot and ankle fractures had a VTE within ninety days. Defined risk factors, such as Factor V Leiden, prior VTE, surgical treatment, active cancer, specific fracture patterns, and surgical treatment significantly affected the odds of their occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W4306897105,"Madagascar is a major hotspot of biodiversity in the Western Indian Ocean, but, as in many other regions, coral reefs surrounding the island confront large-scale disturbances and human-induced local stressors. Conservation actions have been implemented with encouraging results for fisheries, though their benefit on coral assemblages has never been rigorously addressed. In this context, we analyzed the multiscale spatial variation of the composition, generic richness, abundance, life history strategies, and cover of coral assemblages among 18 stations placed at three regions around the island. The potential influences of marine protected areas (MPAs), algal cover, substrate rugosity, herbivorous fish biomass, and geographic location were also analyzed. Our results highlight the marked spatial variability, with variation at either or both regional and local scales for all coral descriptors. The northeast coastal region of Masoala was characterized by the high abundance of coral colonies, most notably of the competitive Acropora and Pocillopora genera and stress-tolerant taxa at several stations. The southwest station of Salary Nord was distinguished by lower abundances, with depauperate populations of competitive taxa. On the northwest coast, Nosy-Be was characterized by higher diversity and abundance as well as by high coral cover (~42-70%) recorded at unfished stations. Results clearly underline the positive effects of MPAs on all but one of the coral descriptors, particularly at Nosy-Be where the highest contrast between fished and unfished stations was observed. Biomass of herbivorous fishes, crustose coralline algae cover, and substrate rugosity were also positively related to several coral descriptors. The occurrence of reefs with high diversity, abundance, and cover of corals, including the competitive Acropora, is a major finding of this study. Our results strongly support the implementation of locally managed marine areas with strong involvement by primary users, particularly to assist in management in countries with reduced logistic and human resources such as Madagascar."

Therefore, we investigated the impact of a telephone-based intervention on PA in patients with subacute stroke. This pre-post study included patients who participated in an education program for stroke rehabilitation before being discharged to home, with a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of ≤ 3. Patients hospitalized in 2020 (intervention group) received a nurse-led telephone-based intervention with a PA measurement once monthly during the 3 months after discharge. Those hospitalized in 2019 (historical controls) only received a PA measurement 3 months after discharge. Physical activity was assessed via a questionnaire by phone. In addition, demographics, medical history, smoking, mRS scores, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 data were collected. The study included 139 participants (73 in intervention, 66 in control). The intervention group had a higher proportion of patients with mRS of 0–1 and a shorter length of hospital stay than the historical controls. Three months post-discharge, a significantly higher proportion of participants were physically active in the intervention group (48 [71.6%] vs. control group, 25 [34.7%]). In addition, the intervention group had a significantly higher median energy expenditure (924 vs. 297 MET-min/week) than the control group. The OR of the intervention for achieving ‘physically active’ individuals was 4.749 (95% CI, 2.313–9.752) before and 5.222 (95% CI, 1.892–14.419) after adjusting for possible confounders.

Presently it has not been accepted as a routine examination in the postoperative follow-up of thoracic surgical patients. The present study aimed to compare thoracic ultrasonography with chest X-ray for detecting and clinical relevance of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and lung consolidation and determine whether ultrasonography could replace chest X-ray as the standard examination after surgery.In this blinded, prospective, single-center study, lung ultrasound images were obtained within 2 hours of post-operative routine chest X-ray. A severity score was given to each examination in each technique. Lung ultrasound and chest X-ray results were compared by three methods: absolute comparison of normal to abnormal, the degree of pathology, and the clinical findings' relevance.Eighty patients were enrolled from 2013 to 2017, and 215 ultrasonography images were obtained. For pneumothorax, the precise overlap was found in 129/180 (72%) images. In 24% of examinations, X-ray missed ultrasonography findings. There was an agreement between studies in 80/212 (38%) images for pleural effusion. 60% of pleural effusions were missed by chest X-ray and detected by ultrasonography, and only 2.4% were missed by ultrasound, all very small. Clinically relevant fluid accumulation found a precise match in 80%, and 20% were found only by lung ultrasound. For lung consolidation, a 100% overlap was found with both methods.Our results suggest that lung ultrasound may replace chest X-ray as the standard examination in the postoperative care of patients undergoing thoracic surgical procedures."

Together with activity studies, our data are in line with dehydration proceeding via substrate assisted catalysis, with the enol pyruvyl group of chorismate acting as catalytic base. Surprisingly, structures of the mutant Asn17Asp with copurified ligand suggest that the enzyme converts to a hydrolase by serendipitous positioning of the carboxyl group. All complex structures presented here exhibit a closed Venus flytrap fold, with the enzyme exploiting the characteristic ligand binding properties of the fold for specific substrate binding and catalysis.

Forest musk deer (FMD) is a first-class protected species in China and listed endangered in the IUCN Red List. The captive breeding population is not only an important source for restocking of wild resources, but also a necessary way to supply the market with legal musk. So far, there is no scientific basis for the appropriate separation time of FMD females and their infants. Therefore, we used metagenome sequencing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to study changes in the fecal cortisol concentration, as well as the intestinal microbiome composition and function of females and fawns at three different separation times, i.e., after 80 days, 90 days and 100 days. The results showed that the increment of the cortisol concentration in female FMD increased with increasing lactation time. The increment of cortisol concentration in infant FMD was highest in the 80 days weaning group, but there was no significant difference between the 90 days and the 100 days separation time. Based on the annotation results of COG, KEGG and CAZy databases, the abundance of different functions annotated by the intestinal microbiome of mothers and fawns of the 90 days weaning group changed slightly after separation. Based on the above results, the separation of mother and infant FMD is recommended after 90 days, i.e., the separation time that triggered the lowest rate of weaning stress and that supported a relatively stable gastro-intestinal physiology."

https://openalex.org/W4306897014,"Background Mitochondrial diseases/disorders (MDs), for decades, have been identified as a key underlying condition for many chronic diseases globally. However, data on the knowledge and prevalence of MDs in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa are lacking. This study assessed the knowledge, and awareness, of MDs among senior medical doctors in the five tertiary hospitals in Ghana. Method Data were collected from one hundred and twenty-eight (128) medical doctors in the five Tertiary Hospitals in Ghana using both closed and open-ended questionnaires and analysed using descriptive statistics. Results Of the 128 respondents, 70.32% were senior medical officers and above, 87% of them indicated that they were aware of MDs and over 90% said physicians do not often diagnose MDs in Ghana. About 81% indicated that MDs are associated with chronic illnesses whilst 72% said the disease is diagnosed in both males and females. About 45% of the respondents alluded to the fact that MDs are difficult to diagnose, are associated with mutations in both the mitochondrial and the nuclear DNA, and are non-infectious diseases. Approximately 85% said nervous system dysfunction and muscle weakness are some of the symptoms associated with MDs whilst 77% said fatigue is also one of the symptoms. About 38% of the respondents specified that they encounter myopathies. A majority (70%) did not know about the availability of any consensus or standard diagnostic procedure and/or drugs for MDs. Conclusion There is a high level of knowledge and awareness of MDs among the respondents. However, there is a low disease encounter, which could be due to a lack of diagnostic protocols or a low disease prevalence. It is, therefore recommend that a patient perspective study, which looks at clinical records and laboratory data be conducted to fully ascertain the prevalence of MDs in Ghana and that appropriate educational strategies and interventions aimed at improving the diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases in Ghana be put in place."
https://openalex.org/W4306897038,"This study aims to produce digital maps showing the physical and hydraulic soil properties of the Al-Ahsa Oasis in Saudi Arabia by employing the capabilities of the GIS technique. These maps can display the pattern distribution of different physical and hydraulic properties of soil accurately and accessibly. Recently developed local pedotransfer function (PTF) models were applied to the basic soil data of earlier research covering 566 points. An analysis was conducted using a spatial interpolation technique of the GIS program. Maps of spatial patterns described essential soil physical and hydraulic properties such as sand%, silt%, clay%, bulk density ( ρ ), saturation (θ s ), field capacity (FC), wilting point (WP), and soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) fitting parameters b , c , d . Sand dominates most of the study area, particularly in the northeast near Hufof. This may be attributed to the deposition of drifting sand and dune movement. Silt and clay increased in other locations. Bulk density ρ was positively increased with sand and negatively with silt and CaCO 3 content. Soil hydraulic properties (θ, FC, WP, and SWCC fitting parameters b , c , d ) were positively correlated with silt and ρ and negatively with sand content. This digital map can be employed for a general overview investigation, for the whole studied area, for agricultural expansion and for environmental studies."
https://openalex.org/W4306897048,"The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in image analysis is an intensively debated topic in the radiology community these days. AI computer vision algorithms typically rely on large-scale image databases, annotated by specialists. Developing and maintaining them is time-consuming, thus, the involvement of non-experts into the workflow of annotation should be considered. We assessed the learning rate of inexperienced evaluators regarding correct labeling of pediatric wrist fractures on digital radiographs. Students with and without a medical background labeled wrist fractures with bounding boxes in 7,000 radiographs over ten days. Pediatric radiologists regularly discussed their mistakes. We found F1 scores-as a measure for detection rate-to increase substantially under specialist feedback (mean 0.61±0.19 at day 1 to 0.97±0.02 at day 10, p<0.001), but not the Intersection over Union as a parameter for labeling precision (mean 0.27±0.29 at day 1 to 0.53±0.25 at day 10, p<0.001). The times needed to correct the students decreased significantly (mean 22.7±6.3 seconds per image at day 1 to 8.9±1.2 seconds at day 10, p<0.001) and were substantially lower as annotated by the radiologists alone. In conclusion our data showed, that the involvement of undergraduated students into annotation of pediatric wrist radiographs enables a substantial time saving for specialists, therefore, it should be considered."
