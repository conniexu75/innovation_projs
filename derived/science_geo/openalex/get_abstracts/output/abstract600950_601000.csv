https://openalex.org/W2775345247,"Background Anemia is defined as a condition in which there is less than the normal hemoglobin (Hb) level in the body. During pregnancy; iron deficiency is associated with multiple adverse outcomes for both mother and infant. Most of the studies conducted in Ethiopia on anemia during pregnancy were conducted at institution level and associated factors are not well studied and documented. Independent factors like, food security status, dietary diversity and intestinal parasites infection were considered by only a few of them. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of anemia and associated factors among pregnant women in Lemo District, Southern Ethiopia. Methods Community based cross- sectional study was conducted from May-June 2015. Multistage sampling was used to include 507 study participants. Anaemia was diagnosed using HemoCue HB 301 and haemoglobin concentration <11 g/dl was classified as anaemic. Stool examinations were also done. Structured questionnaire was used as a tool to collect sociodemographic characteristics, individual dietary diversity and level of household food security data. Multivariate logistic regression model was employed to determine the effect of explanatory variables like level of education, level of household food security, dietary diversity, trimester of pregnancy, family planning before pregnancy, deworming, gravidity, iron intake in current pregnancy and soil transmitted helminthes on dependent variable anemia. Results The prevalence of anemia was 23.2% (95% CI: 19.5%-26.9%). Factors associated with anemia were: low socio-economic status (AOR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.11–3.69), trimester second (AOR = 3.09, 95%CI: 1.41–6.79) and third (AOR = 3.68, 95% CI: 1.67–8.08), gravidity three to five (AOR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.03–3.07) and six and above (AOR = 2.59, 95%CI: 1.37–4.92), not supplemented with iron (AOR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.02–2.91), low dietary diversity score (AOR = 3.18, 95% CI: 1.37–7.37) and hookworm infection (AOR = 2.69, 95%CI: 1.34–5.39). Conclusion Anemia has moderate public health significance in the area. Community-based interventions should be enhanced considering the identified associated factors."
https://openalex.org/W2773694050,"The white blood cell differential count of the bone marrow provides information concerning the distribution of immature and mature cells within maturation stages. The results of such examinations are important for the diagnosis of various diseases and for follow-up care after chemotherapy. However, manual, labor-intensive methods to determine the differential count lead to inter- and intra-variations among the results obtained by hematologists. Therefore, an automated system to conduct the white blood cell differential count is highly desirable, but several difficulties hinder progress. There are variations in the white blood cells of each maturation stage, small inter-class differences within each stage, and variations in images because of the different acquisition and staining processes. Moreover, a large number of classes need to be classified for bone marrow smear analysis, and the high density of touching cells in bone marrow smears renders difficult the segmentation of single cells, which is crucial to traditional image processing and machine learning. Few studies have attempted to discriminate bone marrow cells, and even these have either discriminated only a few classes or yielded insufficient performance. In this study, we propose an automated white blood cell differential counting system from bone marrow smear images using a dual-stage convolutional neural network (CNN). A total of 2,174 patch images were collected for training and testing. The dual-stage CNN classified images into 10 classes of the myeloid and erythroid maturation series, and achieved an accuracy of 97.06%, a precision of 97.13%, a recall of 97.06%, and an F-1 score of 97.1%. The proposed method not only showed high classification performance, but also successfully classified raw images without single cell segmentation and manual feature extraction by implementing CNN. Moreover, it demonstrated rotation and location invariance. These results highlight the promise of the proposed method as an automated white blood cell differential count system."
https://openalex.org/W2772416492,"There is considerable insight into pathways and genes associated with heat-stress conditions. Most genes involved in stress response have been identified using mutant screens or gene knockdowns. Yet, there is limited understanding of the temporal dynamics of global gene expression in stressful environments. Here, we studied global gene expression profiles during 12 hours of heat stress in the nematode C. elegans. Using a high-resolution time series of increasing stress exposures, we found a distinct shift in gene expression patterns between 3–4 hours into the stress response, separating an initially highly dynamic phase from a later relatively stagnant phase. This turning point in expression dynamics coincided with a phenotypic turning point, as shown by a strong decrease in movement, survival and, progeny count in the days following the stress. Both detectable at transcriptional and phenotypic level, this study pin-points a relatively small time frame during heat stress at which enough damage is accumulated, making it impossible to recover the next few days."
https://openalex.org/W2774183946,"Background The Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis. EBV is highly prevalent lymphotropic herpesvirus and has been linked to several malignancies. Transmission is generally by oral secretions, but can be through blood transfusions and organ transplantations. This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence, viremia rates, and circulating genotypes of EBV in healthy blood donors in Qatar. Methods Blood samples from 673 blood donors of different nationalities residing in Qatar (mainly Qatar, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Pakistan, and India) were collected and tested for anti-EBV capsid (VCA; IgG & IgM), nuclear (EBNA; IgG), and early (EA-D; IgG) antigens. Avidity testing was determined when active infection was suspected. DNA was extracted from the buffy coat and subjected to EBV-DNA quantification using qRT-PCR. Genotyping was performed using nested-PCR targeting EBV-EBNA2 gene, and phylogeny by sequence analysis of the LMP-1 gene. Results 97.9% (673/659) of the samples were seropositive as indicated by the presence VCA-IgG, while 52.6% (354/673) had detectible EBV-DNA. EBV seroprevalence and viremia rates increased significantly with age. Genotyping of 51 randomly selected samples showed predominance of Genotype 1 (72.5%, 37/51) as compared to genotype 2 (3.5%), and mixed infections were detected in 4% of the samples. Sub-genotyping for these samples revealed that the Mediterranean strain was predominant (65.3%), followed by B95.8 prototype and North Carolina strains (12.2% each), and China1 strain (6%). Conclusion As a first study to evaluate EBV infection in highly diverse population in Qatar, where expatriates represent more than 85% of the population, our results indicated high seroprevalence and viremia rate of EBV in different nationalities, with genotype 1 and Mediterranean strain being predominant. Clinical significance of these finding have not been investigated and shall be evaluated in future studies."

In this paper, an automatic retinal vessel segmentation method utilizing matched filter techniques coupled with an AdaBoost classifier is proposed. The fundus image is enhanced using morphological operations, the contrast is increased using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) method and the inhomogeneity is corrected using Retinex approach. Then, the blood vessels are enhanced using a combination of B-COSFIRE and Frangi matched filters. From this preprocessed image, different statistical features are computed on a pixel-wise basis and used in an AdaBoost classifier to extract the blood vessel network inside the image. Finally, the segmented images are postprocessed to remove the misclassified pixels and regions. The proposed method was validated using publicly accessible Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE), Structured Analysis of the Retina (STARE) and Child Heart and Health Study in England (CHASE_DB1) datasets commonly used for determining the accuracy of retinal vessel segmentation methods. The accuracy of the proposed segmentation method was comparable to other state of the art methods while being very close to the manual segmentation provided by the second human observer with an average accuracy of 0.972, 0.951 and 0.948 in DRIVE, STARE and CHASE_DB1 datasets, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2775465960,"Our ability to perform arithmetic relies heavily on working memory, the manipulation and maintenance of information in mind. Previous research has found that in adults, procedural strategies, particularly counting, rely on working memory to a greater extent than retrieval strategies. During childhood there are changes in the types of strategies employed, as well as an increase in the accuracy and efficiency of strategy execution. As such it seems likely that the role of working memory in arithmetic may also change, however children and adults have never been directly compared. This study used traditional dual-task methodology, with the addition of a control load condition, to investigate the extent to which working memory requirements for different arithmetic strategies change with age between 9–11 years, 12–14 years and young adulthood. We showed that both children and adults employ working memory when solving arithmetic problems, no matter what strategy they choose. This study highlights the importance of considering working memory in understanding the difficulties that some children and adults have with mathematics, as well as the need to include working memory in theoretical models of mathematical cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2775370699,"African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is an important oil crop grown in tropical region and sensitive to low temperature along with high tolerance to salt and drought stresses. Since the WRKY transcription factor family plays central roles in the regulation of plant stress tolerance, 95 genes belonging to the WRKY family were identified and characterized in oil palm genome. Gene structure analysis showed that EgWRKY genes have considerable variation in intron number (0 to 12) and gene length (477bp to 89,167 bp). Duplicated genes identification indicated 32 EgWRKY genes originated from segmental duplication and two from tandem duplication. Based on transcriptome data, most EgWRKY genes showed tissue-specific expression patterns and their expression could be induced under cold stress. Furthermore, six EgWRKY genes with more than two-folded increased expression level under cold stress were validated by RT-qPCR, which has higher expression level in cold, drought and high salinity treatment. The identification and characterization of WRKY gene family showed that EgWRKY were associated with a wide range of abiotic stress responses in Elaeis guineensis and some EgWRKY members with high expression levels could be selected for further research in analyzing their functions in the stress response in African oil palm."
https://openalex.org/W2772426150,"Infertility and subfertility negatively impact the economics and reproductive performance of cattle. Of note, significant pregnancy loss occurs in cattle during the first month of pregnancy, yet little is known about the genetic loci influencing pregnancy success and loss in cattle. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) with large effects associated with early pregnancy loss, Angus crossbred heifers were classified based on day 28 pregnancy outcomes to serial embryo transfer. A genome wide association analysis (GWAA) was conducted comparing 30 high fertility heifers with 100% success in establishing pregnancy to 55 subfertile heifers with 25% or less success. A gene set enrichment analysis SNP (GSEA-SNP) was performed to identify gene sets and leading edge genes influencing pregnancy loss. The GWAA identified 22 QTL (p < 1 x 10-5), and GSEA-SNP identified 9 gene sets (normalized enrichment score > 3.0) with 253 leading edge genes. Network analysis identified TNF (tumor necrosis factor), estrogen, and TP53 (tumor protein 53) as the top of 671 upstream regulators (p < 0.001), whereas the SOX2 (SRY [sex determining region Y]-box 2) and OCT4 (octamer-binding transcription factor 4) complex was the top master regulator out of 773 master regulators associated with fertility (p < 0.001). Identification of QTL and genes in pathways that improve early pregnancy success provides critical information for genomic selection to increase fertility in cattle. The identified genes and regulators also provide insight into the complex biological mechanisms underlying pregnancy establishment in cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2979256558,"The aim of the study is to screen the significant sonographic features by logistic regression analysis and fit a model to diagnose thyroid nodules. A total of 525 pathological thyroid nodules were retrospectively analyzed. All the nodules underwent conventional ultrasonography (US), strain elastosonography (SE), and contrast -enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). Those nodules’ 12 suspicious sonographic features were used to assess thyroid nodules. The significant features of diagnosing thyroid nodules were picked out by logistic regression analysis. All variables that were statistically related to diagnosis of thyroid nodules, at a level of p < 0.05 were embodied in a logistic regression analysis model. The significant features in the logistic regression model of diagnosing thyroid nodules were calcification, suspected cervical lymph node metastasis, hypoenhancement pattern, margin, shape, vascularity, posterior acoustic, echogenicity, and elastography score. According to the results of logistic regression analysis, the formula that could predict whether or not thyroid nodules are malignant was established. The area under the receiver operating curve (ROC) was 0.930 and the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 83.77%, 89.56%, 87.05%, 86.04%, and 87.79% respectively."

They also observed decreases in ionization within regions shaded from the Sun by the rings. Science , this issue p. 66"
https://openalex.org/W2772729317,"Stroke still has a high incidence with a tremendous public health burden and it is a leading cause of mortality and disability. However, biomarkers for early diagnosis are absent and the metabolic alterations associated with ischemic stroke are not clearly understood. The objectives of this case-control study are to identify serum biomarkers and explore the metabolic alterations of ischemic stroke.Metabonomic analysis was performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis was employed to study 60 patients with or without ischemic stroke (30 cases and 30 controls).Serum metabolic profiling identified a series of 12 metabolites with significant alterations, and the related metabolic pathways involved glycerophospholipid, sphingolipid, phospholipid, fat acid, acylcarnitine, heme, and purine metabolism. Subsequently, multiple logistic regression analyses of these metabolites showed uric acid, sphinganine and adrenoyl ethanolamide were potential biomarkers of ischemic stroke with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.941.These findings provide insights into the early diagnosis and potential pathophysiology of ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2773546245,"Tissue-engineered constructs (TECs) hold great promise for treating large bone defects. Incorporated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can facilitate the vascularization of TECs. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism remains ambiguous. Here we analyzed the roles of C-X-C chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) and its downstream signal pathways in MSC-induced endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) migration. Transwell assays and immunofluorescence staining were performed for cell migration analysis in vitro and in vivo, respectively. A series of signal inhibitors and short hairpin RNA was used for screening essential signaling molecules. We found that blockade of CXCR2 abolished the migration of EPCs toward MSCs as well as subsequent vascularization and bone repair in TECs. Moreover, screening results suggested that steroid receptor coactivator (Src) acted as a predominant downstream effector of CXCR2. Further molecular biologic and histomorphological experiments revealed that the action of Src required the phosphorylation of ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Racl), which was pivotal for the development of lamellipodia and filopodia. The phosphorylation and colocalization of paxillin kinase linker (PKL) and vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (Vav2) were essential for the activation of Racl. Therefore, we demonstrated that MSCs promoted EPC migration via activating CXCR2 and its downstream Src-PKL/Vav2-Rac1 signaling pathway. These findings unveiled the molecular mechanism in the vascularization of TECs and were expected to provide novel targets for efficacy improvement.— Li, Z., Yang, A., Yin, X., Dong, S., Luo, F., Dou, C., Lan, X., Xie, Z., Hou, T., Xu, J., Xing, J.

https://openalex.org/W2771127244,"Increasing evidence indicates that many small secretory preproteins can undergo post-translational translocation across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Although the cellular machinery involved in post-translational translocation of small secretory preproteins has begun to be elucidated, the intrinsic signals contained within these small secretory preproteins that contribute to their efficient post-translational translocation remain unknown. Here, we analyzed the eukaryotic secretory proteome and discovered the small secretory preproteins tend to have a higher probability to harbor the positive charge in the n-region of the signal peptide (SP). Eliminating the positive charge of the n-region blocked post-translational translocation of newly synthesized preproteins and selectively impaired translocation efficiency of small secretory preproteins. The pathophysiological significance of the positive charge in the n-region of SP was underscored by recently identified preproinsulin SP mutations that impair translocation of preproinsulin and cause maturity onset diabetes of youth (MODY). Remarkably, we have found that slowing the polypeptide elongation rate of small secretory preproteins could alleviate the translocation defect caused by loss of the n-region positive charge of the signal peptide. Together, these data reveal not only a previously unrecognized role of the n-region's positive charge in ensuring efficient post-translational translocation of small secretory preproteins, but they also highlight the molecular contribution of defects in this process to the pathogenesis of genetic disorders such as MODY."
https://openalex.org/W2774073712,"Imidacloprid is a neonicotinoid insecticide that is effective against house fly, Musca domestica L., which is a major pest with the ability to develop resistance to insecticides. In the present study, we investigated the inheritance mode, the cross-resistance pattern and the mechanisms of resistance to imidacloprid. A near-isogenic house fly line (N-IRS) with 78-fold resistance to imidacloprid was used to demonstrate the mode of inheritance. The overlapping confidence limits of LC50 values and the slopes of the log concentration-probit lines between the reciprocal F1 and F1’ progenies suggest that imidacloprid resistance is inherited autosomally in the house fly. There was incomplete dominant inheritance in the F1 and F1’ progenies, based on dominance values of 0.77 and 0.75, respectively. A monogenic inheritance model revealed that imidacloprid resistance is governed by more than one factor. Compared to the field strain (CFD), the N-IRS strain developed more cross-resistance to chlorfenapyr and no cross-resistance to chlorpyrifos and acetamiprid, but showed negative cross-resistance to beta-cypermethrin and azamethiphos. Three synergists, diethyl malate (DEM), s,s,s-tributylphosphorotrithioate (DEF), and piperonyl butoxide (PBO), showed significant synergism against to imidacloprid (4.55-, 4.46- and 3.34-fold respectively) in the N-IRS strain. However, both DEM and PBO had no synergism and DEF only exhibited slight synergism in the CSS strain. The activities of carboxylesterase (CarE), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and cytochrome P450 in the N-IRS strain were significantly higher than in the CSS strain. But similar synergistic potential of DEF to imidacloprid between the CSS and N-IRS strain suggested that GSTs and cytochrome P450 played much more important role than esterase for the N-IRS strain resistance to imidacloprid. These results should be helpful for developing an improved management strategy to delay the development of imidacloprid resistance in house fly."
https://openalex.org/W2772738112,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMO) are important redox enzymes produced by microorganisms for the degradation of recalcitrant natural polysaccharides. Heterobasidion irregulare is a white-rot phytopathogenic fungus that causes wood decay in conifers. The genome of this fungus encodes 10 putative Auxiliary Activity family 9 (AA9) LPMOs. We describe the first biochemical characterization of H. irregulare LPMOs through heterologous expression of two CBM-containing LPMOs from this fungus (HiLPMO9H, HiLPMO9I) in Pichia pastoris. The oxidization preferences and substrate specificities of these two enzymes were determined. The two LPMOs were shown to cleave different carbohydrate components of plant cell walls. HiLPMO9H was active on cellulose and oxidized the substrate at the C1 carbon of the pyranose ring at β-1,4-glycosidic linkages, whereas HiLPMO9I cleaved cellulose with strict oxidization at the C4 carbon of glucose unit at internal bonds, and also showed activity against glucomannan. We propose that the two LPMOs play different roles in the plant-cell-wall degrading system of H. irregulare for degradation of softwood and that the lignocellulose degradation mediated by this white-rot fungus may require collective efforts from multi-types of LPMOs."
https://openalex.org/W2771868457,"There is considerable global evidence on the effectiveness of cash transfers in improving health and nutrition outcomes; however, the evidence from South Asia, particularly India, is limited. In the context of India where more than a third of children are undernourished, and where there is considerable under-utilization of health and nutrition interventions, it is opportune to investigate the impact of cash transfer programs on the use of interventions. We study one conditional cash transfer program, Mamata scheme, implemented in the state of Odisha, in India that targeted pregnant and lactating women. Using survey data on 1161 households from three districts in the state of Odisha, we examine the effect of the scheme on eight outcomes: 1) pregnancy registration; 2) receipt of antenatal services; 3) receipt of iron and folic acid (IFA) tablets; 4) exposure to counseling during pregnancy; 5) exposure to postnatal counseling; 6) exclusive breastfeeding; 7) full immunization; and 8) household food security. We conduct regression analyses and correct for endogeneity using nearest-neighbor matching and inverse-probability weighting models. We find that the receipt of payments from the Mamata scheme is associated with a 5 percentage point (pp) increase in the likelihood of receiving antenatal services, a 10 pp increase in the likelihood of receiving IFA tablets, and a decline of 0.84 on the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale. These results provide the first quantitative estimates of effects associated with the Mamata scheme, which can inform the design of government policies related to conditional cash transfers."
https://openalex.org/W2773632595,"Background Birth preparedness and complication readiness aims to reduce delays in care seeking, promote skilled birth attendance, and facility deliveries. Little is known about birth preparedness practices among populations living in hard-to-reach areas in Bangladesh. Objectives To describe levels of birth preparedness and complication readiness among recently delivered women, identify determinants of being better prepared for birth, and assess the impact of greater birth preparedness on maternal and neonatal health practices. Methods A cross-sectional survey with 2,897 recently delivered women was undertaken in 2012 as part of an evaluation trial done in five hard-to-reach districts in rural Bangladesh. Mothers were considered well prepared for birth if they adopted two or more of the four birth preparedness components. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used for analysis. Results Less than a quarter (24.5%) of women were considered well prepared for birth. Predictors of being well-prepared included: husband’s education (OR = 1.3; CI: 1.1–1.7), district of residence, exposure to media in the form of reading a newspaper (OR = 2.2; CI: 1.2–3.9), receiving home visit by a health worker during pregnancy (OR = 1.5; CI: 1.2–1.8), and receiving at least 3 antenatal care visits from a qualified provider (OR = 1.4; CI: 1.0–1.9). Well-prepared women were more likely to deliver at a health facility (OR = 2.4; CI: 1.9–3.1), use a skilled birth attendant (OR = 2.4, CI: 1.9–3.1), practice clean cord care (OR = 1.3, CI: 1.0–1.5), receive post-natal care from a trained provider within two days of birth for themselves (OR = 2.6, CI: 2.0–3.2) or their newborn (OR = 2.6, CI: 2.1–3.3), and seek care for delivery complications (OR = 1.8, CI: 1.3–2.6). Conclusion Greater emphasis on BPCR interventions tailored for hard to reach areas is needed to improve skilled birth attendance, care seeking for complications and essential newborn care and facilitate reductions in maternal and neonatal mortality in low performing districts in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W2771846334,"Grazing areas management is of utmost importance in the Andean region. In the valleys of the Bolivian Cordillera Real near La Paz, pastoralism constitutes the traditional way for people to insure food security and economical sustainability. In these harsh mountains, unique and productive wetlands sustained by glacial water streams are of utmost importance for feeding cattle herds during the dry season. After the colonization by the Spanish, a shift in livestock species has been observed, with the introduction of exotic species such as cows and sheep, resulting in a different impact on pastures compared to native camelid species—llamas and alpacas. Here we explored some of the social-economical and environmental drivers that motivate Bolivian pastoralists to prefer exotic over native livestock species, based on 36 household surveys in the Cordillera Real. We constructed a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model in order to assess the relationships between these drivers. Our results suggest that the access to market influenced pastoralists to reshape their herd composition, by increasing the number of sheep. They also suggest that community size increased daily grazing time in pastures, therefore intensifying the grazing pressure. At a broader scale, this study highlights the effects of some social-economical and environmental drivers on mountain herding systems."
https://openalex.org/W2774615425,"As keystone species, sea stars serve to maintain biodiversity and species distribution through trophic level interactions in marine ecosystems. Recently, Sea Star Wasting Disease (SSWD) has caused widespread mass mortality in several sea star species from the Pacific Coast of the United States of America (USA) and Asterias forbesi on the Atlantic Coast. A densovirus, named Sea Star associated Densovirus (SSaDV), has been associated with the wasting disease in Pacific Coast sea stars, and limited samples of A. forbesi. The goal of this research is to examine the pathogenesis of SSWD in A. forbesi on the Atlantic Coast of the USA and to determine if SSaDV is associated with the wasting disease in this species. Histological examination of A. forbesi tissues affected with SSWD showed cuticle loss, vacuolation and necrosis of epidermal cells, and oedema of the dermis, but no consistent evidence indicating the cause of the lesions. Challenge experiments by cohabitation and immersion in infected water suggest that the cause of SSWD is viral in nature, as filtration (0.22 μm) of water from tanks with sea stars exhibiting SSWD did not prevent the transmission and progression of the disease. Death of challenged sea stars occurred 7–10 d after exposure to infected water or sea stars, and the infectivity crossed species (A. forbesi and Pateria miniata) with equal penetrance. Of the 48 stars tested by quantitative real time PCR, 29 (60%) were positive for the SSaDV VP1 gene. These stars represent field-collected sea stars from all geographical regions (South Carolina to Maine) in 2012–2015, as well as stars exposed to infected stars or water from affected tanks. However, a clear association between the presence of SSaDV and SSWD signs in experimental and field-collected A. forbesi was not found in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2774130235,"Sugarcane is one of the most important crops worldwide and is a key plant for the global production of sucrose. Sugarcane cultivation is severely affected by drought stress and it is considered as the major limiting factor for their productivity. In recent years, this plant has been subjected to intensive research focused on improving its resilience against water scarcity; particularly the molecular mechanisms in response to drought stress have become an underlying issue for its improvement. To better understand water stress and the molecular mechanisms we performed a de novo transcriptomic assembly of sugarcane (var. Mex 69–290). A total of 16 libraries were sequenced in a 2x100 bp configuration on a HiSeq-Illumina platform. A total of 536 and 750 genes were differentially up-regulated along with the stress treatments for leave and root tissues respectively, while 1093 and 531 genes were differentially down-regulated in leaves and roots respectively. Gene Ontology functional analysis showed that genes related to response of water deprivation, heat, abscisic acid, and flavonoid biosynthesis were enriched during stress treatment in our study. The reliability of the observed expression patterns was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Additionally, several physiological parameters of sugarcane were significantly affected due to stress imposition. The results of this study may help identify useful target genes and provide tissue-specific data set of genes that are differentially expressed in response to osmotic stress, as well as a complete analysis of the main groups is significantly enriched under this condition. This study provides a useful benchmark for improving drought tolerance in sugarcane and other economically important grass species."

In this study, we characterized the physicochemical changes, microstructure, and biomechanics of the femurs of female adult rats in response to hindlimb unloading for 21 days. Twenty 6-month-old Wistar female rats were distributed into control (CON) and hindlimb unloading (HLU) groups. Analysis the in vivo bone mineral density (BMD) by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) from the femurs was performed at the beginning and end of the experiment; plasma levels of calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, assessed by spectrophotometry, and estradiol, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was performed after the experiment. We evaluated changes in the trabecular and cortical structure of the femur, after disuse, by micro-computed tomography with high resolution, for analysis of cortical porosity, Raman spectroscopy to measure the amount of physicochemical properties, and the biomechanical test to estimate the changes in biomechanical properties. Our results demonstrated that, after 21 days, HLU animals had decreased femoral BMD, deteriorated bone microarchitecture, particularly in the cortical compartment, with changes in the physicochemical properties and porosity, and reduced deformation capacity of the bone and resistance to the bone stresses. Nevertheless, this study showed the critical role of mechanical stimulation in maintaining the structure of the skeleton in female adults and that disuse, even for a few days, leads to microscopic changes in the structure of the bone matrix, which increases the risk of fracture."
https://openalex.org/W2773081677,"Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are linear tetrapyrrole-binding photoreceptors that sense a wide range of wavelengths from ultraviolet to far-red. The primary photoreaction in these reactions is a Z/E isomerization of the double bond between rings C and D. After this isomerization, various color-tuning events establish distinct spectral properties of the CBCRs. Among the various CBCRs, the DXCF CBCR lineage is widely distributed among cyanobacteria. Because the DXCF CBCRs from the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina vary widely in sequence, we focused on these CBCRs in this study. We identified seven DXCF CBCRs in A. marina and analyzed them after isolation from Escherichia coli that produces phycocyanobilin, a main chromophore for the CBCRs. We found that six of these CBCRs covalently bound a chromophore and exhibited variable properties, including blue/green, blue/teal, green/teal, and blue/orange reversible photoconversions. Notably, one CBCR, AM1_1870g4, displayed unidirectional photoconversion in response to blue-light illumination, with a rapid dark reversion that was temperature-dependent. Furthermore, the photoconversion took place without Z/E isomerization. This observation indicated that AM1_1870g4 likely functions as a blue-light power sensor, whereas typical CBCRs reversibly sense two light qualities. We also found that AM1_1870g4 possesses a GDCF motif in which the Asp residue is swapped with the next Gly residue within the DXCF motif. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that this swap is essential for the light power–sensing function of AM1_1870g4. This is the first report of a blue-light power sensor from the CBCR superfamily and of photoperception without Z/E isomerization among the bilin-based photoreceptors. Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are linear tetrapyrrole-binding photoreceptors that sense a wide range of wavelengths from ultraviolet to far-red. The primary photoreaction in these reactions is a Z/E isomerization of the double bond between rings C and D. After this isomerization, various color-tuning events establish distinct spectral properties of the CBCRs. Among the various CBCRs, the DXCF CBCR lineage is widely distributed among cyanobacteria. Because the DXCF CBCRs from the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina vary widely in sequence, we focused on these CBCRs in this study. We identified seven DXCF CBCRs in A. marina and analyzed them after isolation from Escherichia coli that produces phycocyanobilin, a main chromophore for the CBCRs. We found that six of these CBCRs covalently bound a chromophore and exhibited variable properties, including blue/green, blue/teal, green/teal, and blue/orange reversible photoconversions. Notably, one CBCR, AM1_1870g4, displayed unidirectional photoconversion in response to blue-light illumination, with a rapid dark reversion that was temperature-dependent. Furthermore, the photoconversion took place without Z/E isomerization. This observation indicated that AM1_1870g4 likely functions as a blue-light power sensor, whereas typical CBCRs reversibly sense two light qualities. We also found that AM1_1870g4 possesses a GDCF motif in which the Asp residue is swapped with the next Gly residue within the DXCF motif. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that this swap is essential for the light power–sensing function of AM1_1870g4. This is the first report of a blue-light power sensor from the CBCR superfamily and of photoperception without Z/E isomerization among the bilin-based photoreceptors. Photosynthetic organisms utilize light not only as an energy source but also as a signal. Linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) chromophores are involved in both of these functions, which involve the photosynthetic antenna complex, phycobilisomes, and photoreceptor families of phytochromes and cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs). 2The abbreviations used are: CBCRcyanobacteriochromePCBphycocyanobilinPVBphycoviolobilinGAFcGMP phosphodiesterase/adenylate cyclase/FhlAPASPer/Arnt/SimPHYphytochrome-specificSARspecific absorbance ratioCBBCoomassie Brilliant BlueLOVlight, oxygen, or voltageBLUFblue-light using flavinIAMiodoacetamide. Phycobiliproteins covalently bind phycocyanobilin (PCB), phycoerythrobilin, phycoviolobilin (PVB), and phycourobilin to transfer the light energy to chlorophyll (1Singh N.K. Sonani R.R. Rastogi R.P.

They stably absorb specific light qualities, although phycoerythrocyanin shows unexpected photoconversion in vitro (3Zhao K.-H. Haessner R. Cmiel E. Scheer H.

Conversely, phytochromes and CBCRs covalently bind a linear tetrapyrrole chromophore and show reversible photoconversion that is triggered by Z/E isomerization of the double bond between the C and D rings (4Anders K.

The phytochromes and CBCRs commonly possess a cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenylate cyclase/FhlA (GAF) domain that plays a central role in chromophore incorporation. Only the GAF domain is needed for proper photoconversion of the CBCRs, whereas N-terminal Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS) and/or phytochrome-specific (PHY) domains are also needed for proper photoconversion of the phytochromes (5Ikeuchi M.

Recently identified DXCIP CBCRs that lack the canonical Cys residue but possess the DXCF Cys residue within the highly conserved DXCIP motif show unidirectional photoconversion from a 15Z dark state to a 15E photoproduct in response to green light illumination and dark reversion from the 15E photoproduct to the 15Z dark state (35Fushimi K.

In both cases, the equilibrium between the dark state and the photoproduct is set by two parameters: light intensity and temperature. A higher light intensity and/or lower temperature shift this equilibrium to favor of the photoproduct. In this regard, these photoreceptors can integrate light intensity and temperature signals. Although the red/green CBCRs and DXCIP CBCRs are responsive to red light intensity and green light intensity, respectively, no CBCRs responsive to blue-light intensity have been described.

We expressed these CBCRs in PCB-producing Escherichia coli and analyzed their spectral properties. As a result, blue/green, blue/teal, green/teal, and blue/orange reversible photoconversions were identified. Interestingly, one of the DXCF CBCRs, AM1_1870g4, showed unidirectional photoconversion in response to blue light and fast dark reversion. This is the first report identifying a blue-light power sensor from the CBCR superfamily. There are 82 GAF domains in 47 proteins coded by the A. marina genome. The GAF domain superfamily consists of many families, such as heme-binding, cyclic nucleotide-binding, and linear tetrapyrrole-binding families (39Aravind L. Ponting C.P.

In the case of A. marina, two domains for the cyclic nucleotide-binding family (AM1_1841g1 and AM1_1841g2) and 24 domains for the linear tetrapyrrole-binding family were detected. Among these 24 domains, AM1_1870g1 and AM1_5894g were categorized into the phytochrome subfamily (Fig. 1). The other 22 GAF domains were categorized into the CBCR subfamily. Of these, 15 GAF domains retained the canonical Cys residue and so are likely to covalently bind the linear tetrapyrrole chromophore (Fig. 1).

The control group consisted of 20 healthy patients with a mean age of 17 ± 5 years. RV longitudinal and circumferential strain magnitude was assessed by a dedicated RV tissue tracking software.Fifty patients with images of sufficient quality were included in the analysis. The mean right and left ventricular ejection fractions were 55 ± 5% and 59 ± 4%. The RV global longitudinal strain was -21.88 ± 4.63%. The RV circumferential strain at base, mid-cavity and apex were -13.66 ± 3.09%, -11.31 ± 2.79%, -20.73 ± 3.45%, respectively. There was no statistically significant decrease in right ventricular or left ventricular ejection fraction between patients and controls (p > 0.05 for each). There was no significant difference in RV global longitudinal strain between two groups (-21.88 ± 4.63 versus -21.99 ± 3.58; p = 0.93). However, there was significant decrease in mid-cavity circumferential strain magnitude in pectus patients compared with controls (-11.31 ± 2.79 versus -16.19 ± 2.86; p < 0.001). PE patients had a significantly higher basal circumferential strain (-13.66 ± 3.09% versus -9.76 ± 1.79; p < 0.001) as well as apical circumferential strain (-20.73 ± 3.45% versus -12.07 ± 3.38) than control group.Mid-cavity circumferential strain but not longitudinal strain is reduced in pectus excavatum patients. Basal circumferential strain as well as apical circumferential strain were increased as compensatory mechanism for reduced mid-cavity circumferential strain. Further studies are needed to establish clinical significance of this finding."

Here, we used a NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)-deficient mice (Ncf1-/-) to investigate the role of leukocyte-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mycobacterium-induced granulomatous inflammation. We found poorly controlled mycobacterial proliferation, significant body weight loss, and a high mortality rate after M. marinum infection in Ncf1-/- mice. Moreover, we noticed loose and neutrophilic granulomas and higher levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and neutrophil chemokines in Ncf1-/- mice when compared with those in wild type mice. The lack of ROS led to reduced production of IL-1β in macrophages, whereas neutrophil elastase (NE), an abundant product of neutrophils, may potentially exert increased inflammasome-independent protease activity and lead to higher IL-1β production. Moreover, we showed that the abundant NE and IL-1β were present in the caseous granulomatous inflammation of human TB infection. Importantly, blocking of IL-1β with either a specific antibody or a recombinant IL-1 receptor ameliorated the pulmonary inflammation. These findings revealed a novel role of ROS in the early pathogenesis of neutrophilic granulomatous inflammation and suggested a potential role of IL-1 blocking in the treatment of mycobacterial infection in the lung."
https://openalex.org/W2774556141,"Olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation is a promising strategy for treating spinal cord injury (SCI), as has been demonstrated in experimental SCI models and naturally occurring SCI in dogs. However, the presence of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans within the extracellular matrix of the glial scar can inhibit efficient axonal repair and limit the therapeutic potential of OECs. Here we have used lentiviral vectors to genetically modify canine OECs to continuously deliver mammalian chondroitinase ABC at the lesion site in order to degrade the inhibitory chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans in a rodent model of spinal cord injury. We demonstrate that these chondroitinase producing canine OECs survived at 4 weeks following transplantation into the spinal cord lesion and effectively digested chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans at the site of injury. There was evidence of sprouting within the corticospinal tract rostral to the lesion and an increase in the number of corticospinal axons caudal to the lesion, suggestive of axonal regeneration. Our results indicate that delivery of the chondroitinase enzyme can be achieved with the genetically modified OECs to increase axon growth following SCI. The combination of these two promising approaches is a potential strategy for promoting neural regeneration following SCI in veterinary practice and human patients."

We evaluated pathologic changes, iNOS expression, NF-κB, and p300 contents in diabetic rats. We found that CP inhibited iNOS expression and notably prevented colocalization and binding of NF-κB and p300. CP prevented NF-κB from binding to the inos promoter, especially at the distal site, and reduced bound NF-κB, p300, and H3K9ac. N-terminal plus middle fragment could mostly mimic the antagonizing effects of CP against the pathologic changes of DN and equally suppresses renal iNOS expression as CP. In conclusion, CP prevented NF-κB from recruiting p300 and binding to the inos promoter, and decreased H3K9ac at the binding sites to suppress iNOS expression and antagonize DN, with the effect region identified as N-terminal plus middle fragment.— Li, Y., Li, X., He, K., Li, B., Liu, K., Qi, J., Wang, H., Wang, Y., Luo, W.

https://openalex.org/W2771501655,"Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), a tyrosine kinase receptor, is one of the main tumor markers in different types of cancers. The kinase native state is mainly composed of two populations of conformers: active and inactive. Several sequence variations in EGFR kinase region promote the differential enrichment of conformers with higher activity. Some structural characteristics have been proposed to differentiate kinase conformations, but these considerations could lead to ambiguous classifications. We present a structural characterisation of EGFR kinase conformers, focused on active site pocket comparisons, and the mapping of known pathological sequence variations. A structural based clustering of this pocket accurately discriminates active from inactive, well-characterised conformations. Furthermore, this main pocket contains, or is in close contact with, ≈65% of cancer-related variation positions. Although the relevance of protein dynamics to explain biological function has been extensively recognised, the usage of the ensemble of conformations in dynamic equilibrium to represent the functional state of proteins and the importance of pockets, cavities and/or tunnels was often neglected in previous studies. These functional structures and the equilibrium between them could be structurally analysed in wild type as well as in sequence variants. Our results indicate that biologically important pockets, as well as their shape and dynamics, are central to understanding protein function in wild-type, polymorphic or disease-related variations."
https://openalex.org/W2773571445,"Iron accumulation, oxidative stress and calcium signaling dysregulation are common pathognomonic signs of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson´s and Alzheimer's diseases, Friedreich ataxia and Huntington's disease. Given their therapeutic potential, the identification of multifunctional compounds that suppress these damaging features is highly desirable. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of N-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl)-2-(7-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-4-yl)acetamide, named CT51, which exhibited potent free radical neutralizing activity both in vitro and in cells. CT51 bound Fe2+ with high selectivity and Fe3+ with somewhat lower affinity. Cyclic voltammetric analysis revealed irreversible binding of Fe3+ to CT51, an important finding since stopping Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling in cells should prevent hydroxyl radical production resulting from the Fenton-Haber-Weiss cycle. When added to human neuroblastoma cells, CT51 freely permeated the cell membrane and distributed to both mitochondria and cytoplasm. Intracellularly, CT51 bound iron reversibly and protected against lipid peroxidation. Treatment of primary hippocampal neurons with CT51 reduced the sustained calcium release induced by an agonist of ryanodine receptor-calcium channels. These protective properties of CT51 on cellular function highlight its possible therapeutic use in diseases with significant oxidative, iron and calcium dysregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2773772915,"PKC-potentiated phosphorylation-dependent inhibitory protein of protein phosphatase 1 (CPI-17), an endogenous myosin phosphatase inhibitory protein, is considered a key molecule for Ca2+ sensitization of the contractile apparatus. Here, we have used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/ CRISPR-associated protein 9 to generate CPI-17-deficient [knockout (KO)] and threonine 38 (T38)-phosphoresistant mice [threonine mutant into alanine (TA)], and then effects of CPI-17 on vascular contractility in vitro and mean blood pressure (MBP) in vivo were investigated. In isolated thoracic aorta, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate induced a sustained contraction of wild-type (WT) mice, whereas no contraction showed from TA or KO mice. A high concentration of KCl solution-induced contraction was not different between transgenic and WT mice. In contrast, phenylephrine (PE)-induced contractions in both mutant strains were significantly smaller than those of WT mice in association with a low level of myosin phosphorylation, suggesting that at least part of PE-induced contraction is regulated by phosphorylation of CPI-17 at T38. Finally, the physiologic role of CPI-17 in the regulation of blood pressure was investigated using radio telemetry. MBP was decreased significantly in both transgenic mice, even with a compensatory increase in heart rate. In summary, we generated KO and constitutively phospho-resistant mouse models of CPI-17 for the first time. p-CPI-17 at T38, possibly by PKC, could be important to maintain vascular contractility and blood pressure in vivo.— Yang, Q., Fujii, W., Kaji, N., Kakuta, S., Kada, K., Kuwahara, M., Tsubone, H., Ozaki, H., Hori, M.

https://openalex.org/W2774545335,"Background The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial microorganisms is a particular challenge for the health care systems. Little is known about the occurrence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDRGNB) in patients of palliative care units (PCU). Aim The primary aim of this study was to determine the carriage of MRSA among patients of a PCU at a German University Hospital and to assess whether the positive cases would have been detected by a risk-factor-based screening-approach. Design Between February 2014 and January 2015 patients from our PCU were tested for MRSA carriage within 48 hours following admission irrespective of pre-existing risk factors. In addition, risk factors for MRSA colonization were assessed. Samples from the nostrils and, if applicable, from pre-existing wounds were analysed by standardized culture-based laboratory techniques for the presence of MRSA and of other bacteria and fungi. Results from swabs taken prior to admission were also recorded if available. Results 297 out of 317 patients (93.7%) fulfilled one or more MRSA screening criteria. Swabs from 299 patients were tested. The detection rate was 2.1% for MRSA. All MRSA cases would have been detected by a risk-factor-based screening-approach. Considering the detected cases and the results from swabs taken prior to admission, 4.1% of the patients (n = 13) were diagnosed with MRSA and 4.1% with MDRGNB (n = 13), including two patients with MRSA and MDRGNB (0.6%). The rate of MRSA carriage in PCU patients (4.1%) was elevated compared to the rate seen in the general cohort of patients admitted to our University Hospital (2.7%). Conclusions PCU patients have an increased risk to carry MRSA compared to other hospitalized patients. Although a risk factor-based screening is likely to detect all MRSA carriers amongst PCU patients, we rather recommend a universal screening to avoid the extra effort to identify the few risk factor-negative patients (<7%). As we did not perform a systematic MDRGNB screening, further studies are needed to determine the true prevalence of MDRGNB amongst PCU patients."
https://openalex.org/W2949342628,"Task demands modulate tactile localization in sighted humans, presumably through weight adjustments in the spatial integration of anatomical, skin-based, and external, posture-based information. In contrast, previous studies have suggested that congenitally blind humans, by default, refrain from automatic spatial integration and localize touch using only skin-based information. Here, sighted and congenitally blind participants localized tactile targets on the palm or back of one hand, while ignoring simultaneous tactile distractors at congruent or incongruent locations on the other hand. We probed the interplay of anatomical and external location codes for spatial congruency effects by varying hand posture: the palms either both faced down, or one faced down and one up. In the latter posture, externally congruent target and distractor locations were anatomically incongruent and vice versa. Target locations had to be reported either anatomically (“palm” or “back” of the hand), or externally (“up” or “down” in space). Under anatomical instructions, performance was more accurate for anatomically congruent than incongruent target-distractor pairs. In contrast, under external instructions, performance was more accurate for externally congruent than incongruent pairs. These modulations were evident in sighted and blind individuals. Notably, distractor effects were overall far smaller in blind than in sighted participants, despite comparable target-distractor identification performance. Thus, the absence of developmental vision seems to be associated with an increased ability to focus tactile attention towards a non-spatially defined target. Nevertheless, that blind individuals exhibited effects of hand posture and task instructions in their congruency effects suggests that, like the sighted, they automatically integrate anatomical and external information during tactile localization. Moreover, spatial integration in tactile processing is, thus, flexibly adapted by top-down information—here, task instruction—even in the absence of developmental vision."
https://openalex.org/W2772714421,"Understanding the effects of global climate disruption on biodiversity is important to future conservation efforts. While taxonomic diversity is widely studied, functional diversity of plants, and recently animals, is receiving increasing attention. Most studies of mammals are short-term, focus on temperate habitats, and rely on traits described in the literature rather than generating traits from observations. Unlike previous studies, this long-term field study assessed the factors driving the functional and taxonomic diversity of small-mammal assemblages in dry tropical forests using both traits recorded from literature and a demographic database. We assessed the drivers (abundance and biomass, temperature and rainfall) of taxonomic richness and functional diversity for two rain-driven seasons in two adjacent but distinct forests—upland and lowland (arroyo or riparian) forests. Our analysis found that rainfall, both seasonal and atypical, was the primary factor driving functional and taxonomic diversity of small-mammal assemblages. Functional responses differed between the two types of forests, however, with effects being stronger in the harsher conditions of the upland forests than in the less severe conditions prevailing in the arroyo (riparian) forest. The latter also supports a richer, more diverse, and more stable small-mammal assemblage. These findings highlight the importance of climate to tropical biological diversity, as extreme climate events (hurricanes, droughts and floods) and disruption of rainfall patterns were shown to decrease biodiversity. They also support the need to preserve these habitats, as their high taxonomic diversity and functional redundancy makes them resilient against global climate disruption and local extreme events. Tropical dry forests constitute a potential reservoir for biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide. Unfortunately, these forests are among the most endangered terrestrial ecosystems because of deforestation and the likely impacts of global climate disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2771201745,"Schistosomiasis is one of the major Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) in sub-Saharan Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa, two major human schistosome species namely Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium often occur sympatrically largely affecting children. Recognizing the public health impact of Schistosomiasis, the World Health Organization (WHO) is urging member states to regularly treat at least 75% and up to 100%, of all school-aged children at risk of morbidity. For control strategies based on targeted mass drug administration (MDA) to succeed it is essential to have a simple and sensitive test for monitoring the success of these interventions. Current available diagnostic tests, such as egg detection in stool by Kato-Katz (KK) for S. mansoni and detection of eggs or blood (hematuria) in urine for S. haematobium have reduced sensitivity in low intensity settings. The objective of the study was to evaluate active single or duo schistosome infections in school children following MDA using molecular diagnostics (PCR) on filtered urine samples and comparing that against traditional diagnostic tests. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 111 school children aged 7–15 years in Chongwe and Siavonga Districts in Zambia. Species-specific cell-free repeat DNA fragment were amplified from 111 filtered urine samples. Our approach detected eight times more positive cases (total 77) than by KK (9) for S. mansoni and six times more (total 72) than by hematuria (11) for S. haematobium and even more against urine filtration (77 compared to only 6). The same pattern was observed when stratified for age group and sex specific analysis with 100% sensitivity and specificity devoid of any cross amplification. In addition, 69 individuals (62%) were co-infected by both parasites. We have demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of both species than indicated by the traditional tests and the persistent maintenance of reservoir of infection after MDA. Our approach is an effective means of detecting low intensity infection, which will enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and assess the impact of MDA control programs against schistosomiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2774117764,"Nature conservation and fisheries management often focus on particular seabed features that are considered vulnerable or important to commercial species. As a result, individual seabed types are protected in isolation, without any understanding of what effect the mixture of seabed types within the landscape has on ecosystem functions. Here we undertook predictive seabed modelling within a coastal marine protected area using observations from underwater stereo-video camera deployments and environmental information (depth, wave fetch, maximum tidal speeds, distance from coast and underlying geology). The effect of the predicted substratum type, extent and heterogeneity or the diversity of substrata, within a radius of 1500 m around each camera deployment of juvenile gadoid relative abundance was analysed. The predicted substratum model performed well with wave fetch and depth being the most influential predictor variables. Gadus morhua (Atlantic cod) were associated with relatively more rugose substrata (Algal-gravel-pebble and seagrass) and heterogeneous landscapes, than Melanogrammus aeglefinus (haddock) or Merlangius merlangus (whiting) (sand and mud). An increase in M. merlangus relative abundance was observed with increasing substratum extent. These results reveal that landscape effects should be considered when protecting the seabed for fish and not just individual seabed types. The landscape approach used in this study therefore has important implications for marine protected area, fisheries management and monitoring advice concerning demersal fish populations."
https://openalex.org/W2774436577,"Chronic inflammation results when the immune system responds to trauma, injury or infection and the response is not resolved. It can lead to tissue damage and dysfunction and in some cases predispose to cancer. Some viruses (including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)) can induce inflammation, which may persist even after the infection has been controlled or cleared. The damage caused by inflammation, can itself act to perpetuate the inflammatory response. The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of EBV is a pro-inflammatory factor and in the skin of transgenic mice causes a phenotype of hyperplasia with chronic inflammation of increasing severity, which can progress to pre-malignant and malignant lesions. LMP1 signalling leads to persistent deregulated expression of multiple proteins throughout the mouse life span, including TGFα S100A9 and chitinase-like proteins. Additionally, as the inflammation increases, numerous chemokines and cytokines are produced which promulgate the inflammation. Deposition of IgM, IgG, IgA and IgE and complement activation form part of this process and through genetic deletion of CD40, we show that this contributes to the more tissue-destructive aspects of the phenotype. Treatment of the mice with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant which feeds into the body’s natural redox regulatory system through glutathione synthesis, resulted in a significantly reduced leukocyte infiltrate in the inflamed tissue, amelioration of the pathological features and delay in the inflammatory signature measured by in vivo imaging. Reducing the degree of inflammation achieved through NAC treatment, had the knock on effect of reducing leukocyte recruitment to the inflamed site, thereby slowing the progression of the pathology. These data support the idea that NAC could be considered as a treatment to alleviate chronic inflammatory pathologies, including post-viral disease. Additionally, the model described can be used to effectively monitor and accurately measure therapies for chronic inflammation."

Several studies have demonstrated that cisplatin-based regimen is associated with a high frequency of thromboembolic complications. However, there has been limited investigation directly comparing the risk of thromboembolic events (TEEs) between cisplatin- and carboplatin-treated patients with lung cancer.All lung cancer patients treated with cisplatin or carboplatin at Wilmot Cancer Center, University of Rochester between 2011 and 2014 were included. Patient characteristics including exposure (cisplatin vs. carboplatin) and outcome (TEEs between the time of the first dose of cisplatin or carboplatin and 4 weeks after the last dose) were collected by reviewing electronic medical records. A Fisher's exact test was used to compare the proportion of incident TEEs between cisplatin and carboplatin groups. The risk of TEE associated with carboplatin compared to cisplatin was assessed using multiple logistic regression.Among 415 subjects, 317 patients (76.4%) received carboplatin and 98 (23.6%) patients received cisplatin. In the carboplatin group, 10.9% (33/302) of evaluable patients developed treatment-related TEEs vs. 14.7% (14/95) in the cisplatin group. There was no significant difference in the risk of developing TEEs between the two groups (P = 0.32). However, 15.2% of carboplatin-related TEEs were arterial thromboses compared to none in the cisplatin group.The incidence of carboplatin-related TEEs was high in lung cancer patients without significant difference in the risk of developing TEEs between cisplatin and carboplatin groups.

Increasing IR, but not BMI, was a predictor of shorter critical stop signal delay (cSSD), a measure of the time window during which a go response can be successfully countermanded (R2 = 0.12). This decline was explained by an IR-associated increase in go speed (R2 = 0.13) with little impact of IR or BMI on stop speed. Greater striatal fMRI activation contrast in stop error (SE) compared with stop success (SS) trials (CONSE>SS) was a significant predictor of faster go speeds (R2 = 0.33, p = 0.002), and was itself predicted by greater IR (CONSE>SS vs HOMA-IR: R2 = 0.10, p = 0.04). Furthermore, this impact of IR on striatal activation was a significant mediator of the faster go speeds and greater impulsivity observed with greater IR. These findings suggest a neural mechanism by which IR may increase impulsivity and degrade behavioral self-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2774471116,"We investigated visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) to vanishing parts of continuously present objects by comparing the event-related potentials (ERPs) to infrequently (deviant) and frequently (standard) disappearing parts of the objects. This paradigm both excludes low-level stimulus-specific adaptation differences between the responses to deviants and standards, and increases the ecological validity of the stimuli. In comparison to frequently disappearing parts of the stimulus objects, infrequently vanishing parts elicited posterior negative event-related brain activity (vMMN). However, no vMMN emerged to the reappearance of the same parts of the objects. We compared the ERPs of an older and a younger sample of participants. In the 120–180 ms time period vMMN was similar in the two age groups, but in the 180–220 ms time period vMMN emerged only in the younger participants. We consider this difference as an index of more elaborate automatic processing of infrequent stimulus changes in younger adults."
https://openalex.org/W2772208848,"We aimed to explore the long-term outcomes of back and neck pain and functionality in adult females with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), who had been treated with a Milwaukee brace, in a follow-up study a minimum of 23 years after the completion of the treatment, using radiological, clinical and socio-demographical data. Thirty AIS patients (scoliosis group-SG), were included in the study based on an extensive search of Pediatric Orthopedics and Traumatology Clinic charts. All treatments were successfully completed between 1974 and 1990. In all cases, scoliosis had not been detected before the age of 10 and was not combined with any major spinal deformities at the time when the brace treatment was implemented. In those patients, the Risser sign 4 and minimum two years post-menarche was defined as a maturity, after that time the brace treatment was completed. Patients were excluded from the study if they, at the time of the follow-up examinations, suffered from any other disease leading to trunk deformity. Forty patients met the criteria for inclusion, but due to change some personal details, not all of them were contacted. Finally, 30 women returned for a follow-up evaluation. Patients' follow-up period was mean 27.77 yrs. ± SD 3.30 (range 23-35). Curvature change from the end of the treatment until the present day was mean 9.1 degrees ± SD 7.64 (range 0-27). A control group of 42 healthy females (healthy controls group-HG) matching the age profile of the patient group was randomly selected for comparative purposes.Both SG and HG completed the Polish versions of the Revised Oswestry Lower Back Pain Disability Index (RODI), the Rolland-Morris Questionnaire (RMQ), the Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale (QDS), the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and the Copenhagen Neck Functional Disability Scale (CNFDS). Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographics and baseline questionnaire scores. To determine if the investigated sample sizes are equivalent, the chi-square test was used. The chi-square test was used to compare qualitative features between persons with scoliosis and healthy controls. In addition, a Mann-Whitney test was utilized to compare differences between both groups in regard to quantitative characteristics. To establish relations between quantitative data such as e.g. age, duration of brace application, apical translation, Cobb angle, and questionnaire results, we used Spearman's rank correlation (marked as rS). To determine dependency between quantitative and qualitative characteristics, e.g. between questionnaire numerical data and marital status, place of residence or curve type, ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test was used. A p<0.05 indicates statistical significance. Statistical calculations were performed by Statistica software. In regards to RODI, RMQ, QDS, NDI and CNFDS (both for total scores and particular sub-sections), statistically significant differences (p <0.001) between both samples were found, indicating higher levels of pain and neck and lower back pain-related disability among persons with scoliosis. Associations exist between RODI and RMQ (rS = 0.76) QDS (rS = 0.70), NDI (rS = 0.69) and CNFDS (rS = 0.60). RMQ was associated with QDS (rS = 0.71) and NDI (rS = 0.69), whereas QDS correlated with NDI (rS = 0.80) and CNFDS (rS = 0.60). NDI was also associated with CNFDS (rS = 0.81). Persons with scoliosis treated in adolescence with a Milwaukee brace display significant restrictions in everyday activities, due to lower back pain (LBP) and neck-related disabilities, compared to healthy controls. In addition, back pain is associated with curve progression in long-term follow-up after conservative treatment. Moreover, LBP-related disability coexists with restrictions experienced due to neck pain."
https://openalex.org/W2774691099,"Primordial growth failure has been linked to defects in the biology of cell division and replication. The complex processes involved in microtubule spindle formation, organization and function have emerged as a dominant patho-mechanism in these conditions. The majority of reported disease genes encode for centrosome and centriole proteins, leaving kinetochore proteins by which the spindle apparatus interacts with the chromosomes largely unaccounted for. We report a novel disease gene encoding the constitutive inner kinetochore member CENPT, which is involved in kinetochore targeting and assembly, resulting in severe growth failure in two siblings of a consanguineous family. We herein present studies on the molecular and cellular mechanisms that explain how genetic mutations in this gene lead to primordial growth failure. In both, affected human cell lines and a zebrafish knock-down model of Cenpt, we observed aberrations in cell division with abnormal accumulation of micronuclei and of nuclei with increased DNA content arising from incomplete and/or irregular chromosomal segregation. Our studies underscore the critical importance of kinetochore function for overall body growth and provide new insight into the cellular mechanisms implicated in the spectrum of these severe growth disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2772008713,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of methyl donor supplementation of pregnant animals in the presence or absence of a concomitant lactation on the methylome of the offspring. Twenty Holstein cows, 10 nulliparous (non-lactating while pregnant) and 10 multiparous (lactating while pregnant) were blocked by parity and randomly assigned to an i.m. weekly injections of a placebo (CTRL) or a solution containing methyl donors (MET). After calving, 5 calves randomly selected from each treatment (two born to non-lactating and three to lactating dams) were blood-sampled to determine their full methylome. There were more than 2,000 CpG differentially methylated between calves born to CTRL and those born to MET, and also between calves born to lactating and non-lactating dams. Most of the differences affected genes involved in immune function, cell growth regulation and differentiation, kinase activity, and ion channeling. We conclude that the coexistence of pregnancy and lactation affects the methylome of the offspring, and that supplementation of methyl donors early in gestation has also consequences on the methylome."
https://openalex.org/W2773172408,"As primary p53 antagonists, Mdm2 and the closely related Mdm4 are relevant cancer therapeutic targets. We have previously described a series of cell-permeable stapled peptides that bind to Mdm2 with high affinity, resulting in activation of the p53 tumour suppressor. Within this series, highest affinity was obtained by modification of an obligate tryptophan residue to the non-natural L-6-chlorotryptophan. To understand the structural basis for improved affinity we have solved the crystal structure of this stapled peptide (M011) bound to Mdm2 (residues 6–125) at 1.66 Å resolution. Surprisingly, near identity to the structure of a related peptide (M06) without the 6-chloro modification is observed. Further analysis of linear and stapled peptides comprising 6-Me-tryptophan provides mechanistic insight into dual Mdm2/Mdm4 antagonism and confirms L98 of Mdm4 as a mutable steric gate. The results also highlight a possible role of the flexible hinge region in determining Mdm2/Mdm4 plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2774911675,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder characterized by elevation of serum cholesterol bound to low-density lipoprotein. Mutations in LDLR are the major factors responsible for FH. In this study, we recruited a four-generation Chinese family with FH and identified the clinical features of hypercholesterolemia. All affected individuals shared a novel indel mutation (c.1885_1889delinsGATCATCAACC) in exon 13 of LDLR. The mutation segregated with the hypercholesterolemia phenotype in the family. To analyze the function of the indel, we established stable clones of mutant and wild-type LDLR in Hep G2 cells. The mutant LDLR was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and failed to glycosylate via the Golgi. Moreover, the membrane LDLR was reduced and lost the ability to take up LDL. Our data also expand the spectrum of known LDLR mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2774517911,"Employment discrimination causes problems at the labor market, and is hard to combat. Can increasing the degree of structure when selecting applicants increase fairness? Students were asked to perform a computerized selection task and were either provided with tools for systematizing information about the applicants (structured selection) or no such tools (unstructured selection). We hypothesized and found that a structured process, where employing recruitment tools rather than the recruiter’s impressionistic judgment is key, improves the ability to identify job-relevant criteria and hence selecting more qualified applicants, even when in-group favoritism is tempting (e.g. when the outgroup applicants are more competent). Increasing structure helped recruiters select more competent applicants and reduced ethnic discrimination. Increasing the motivation to carefully follow the structured procedure strengthened these effects further. We conclude that structure pays off, and that motivational factors should be taken into account in order for it to have the optimal effect."
https://openalex.org/W2771501557,"The present study examined the temporal trends in the management of blood pressure, glucose, and lipid levels among middle-aged and elderly patients with type 2 diabetes using data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1998-2014). A total of 3,689 patients with diabetes were included and divided into middle-aged (30-64 years old) and elderly (≥65 years old) groups. Demographic and lifestyle data were obtained using a self-reported questionnaire, and trained medical staff obtained fasting blood samples and blood pressure data. Laboratory testing was performed to determine blood glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. In the multivariable adjusted models, significant decreasing trends in the prevalences of hyperglycemia and hypertension were observed in both age groups during 1998-2014, although no trends were observed for lipid levels. Based on the most recent survey, approximately 50% of patients with diabetes had hyperglycemia, and one-third of patients with diabetes and hypertension did not appropriately manage their blood pressure. In addition, 50% of the patients in both age groups did not manage their lipid profiles, and the management of lipid profiles did not improve in recent years. These results suggest that continuous follow-up is needed to effectively manage metabolic risk factors, especially lipid profiles, among patients with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2772601971,"An association of acetaminophen use and asthma was observed in the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood study. However there are no clear mechanisms to explain an association between acetaminophen use and immunologic pathology. In acidic conditions like those in the stomach and inflamed airway, tyrosine residues are nitrated by nitrous and peroxynitrous acids. The resulting nitrotyrosine is structurally similar to 2,4-dinitrophenol and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, known haptens that enhance immune responses by covalently binding proteins. Nitrated acetaminophen shares similar molecular structure.We hypothesized the acetaminophen phenol ring undergoes nitration under acidic conditions, producing 3-nitro-acetaminophen which augments allergic responses by acting as a hapten for environmental allergens.3-nitro-acetaminophen was formed from acetaminophen in the presence of acidified nitrite, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and assayed by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry. Purified 3-nitro-acetaminophen was reacted with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p1) and analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify the modification site. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells proliferation response was measured in response to 3-nitro-acetaminophen and to 3-nitro-acetaminophen-modified Der p1.Acetaminophen was modified by nitrous acid forming 3-nitro-acetaminophen over a range of different acidic conditions consistent with airway inflammation and stomach acidity. The Der p1 protein-hapten adduct creation was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry proteomics modifying cysteine 132. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to 3-nitro-acetaminophen-modified Der p1 had increased proliferation and cytokine production compared to acetaminophen and Der p1 alone (n = 7; p < 0.05).These data suggests 3-nitro-acetaminophen formation and reaction with Der p1 provides a mechanism by which stomach acid or infection-induced low airway pH in patients could enhance the allergic response to proteins such as Der p1."
https://openalex.org/W2773002002,"Iron deficiency (ID) may impair long-term neurological development when it occurs in young infants. In cohort studies, it is sometimes necessary to evaluate ID with sera kept frozen for several years. To assess ID, learned societies recommend measuring serum ferritin (SF) level combined with C-reactive protein level. The long-term stability of C-reactive protein in frozen samples is well established but not ferritin.We measured SF level (immunoturbidimetric assay; in micrograms per liter) immediately after collection from 53 young adults recruited and followed-up in Porto, Portugal, from 2011 to 2013 (SF1), and then, in 2016 in two aliquots kept frozen at- 80°C for 3 to 5 years: one without (SF2A) and one with (SF2B) intermediate thawing in 2014. We compared SF1 to SF2A then SF2B; statistical agreement was evaluated by the Bland and Altman method and the effect of intermediate thawing by regression modelling.Mean SF2A-SF1 and SF2B-SF1 differences were -2.1 (SD 7.0) and 48.9 (SD 66.9). Values for Bland and Altman 95% limits of agreement were higher for the comparison of SF2B and SF1 than SF2A and SF1: -82.2 to 179.9 and -15.8 to 11.8, respectively; the effect of thawing was highly significant (p <0.001).Agreement between SF values before and after 3 to 5 years of constant freezing at -80°C was in a generally accepted range, which supports the hypothesis of ferritin's stability at this temperature for a long period. In long-term storage by freezing, intermediate thawing induced a major increase in values."
https://openalex.org/W2771656547,"In order to predict the features of non-raiding human warfare in small-scale, socially stratified societies, we study a coalitionary model of war that assumes that individuals participate voluntarily because their decisions serve to maximize fitness. Individual males join the coalition if war results in a net economic and thus fitness benefit. Within the model, viable offensive war ensues if the attacking coalition of males can overpower the defending coalition. We assume that the two groups will eventually fuse after a victory, with ranks arranged according to the fighting abilities of all males and that the new group will adopt the winning group's skew in fitness payoffs. We ask whether asymmetries in skew, group size and the amount of resources controlled by a group affect the likelihood of successful war. The model shows, other things being equal, that (i) egalitarian groups are more likely to defeat their more despotic enemies, even when these are stronger, (ii) defection to enemy groups will be rare, unless the attacked group is far more despotic than the attacking one, and (iii) genocidal war is likely under a variety of conditions, in particular when the group under attack is more egalitarian. This simple optimality model accords with several empirically observed correlations in human warfare. Its success underlines the important role of egalitarianism in warfare."
https://openalex.org/W2774378810,"Economic bubbles are an empirical puzzle because they do not readily fit the notion of an efficient market. We argue that bubbles are associated with a conflict and a gap in the allocation of effort during negotiation by sellers and buyers. We examined 21 experimental asset markets where in one condition players could buy and sell and in the other they could either buy or sell. The results indicated that when making concurrent buying and selling decisions the mean number of asks for sellers was 71% higher than the number of bids for buyers. Similar findings emerge in a re-analysis of data from Lei et al. (2001). Importantly, bubbles only emerged in markets where the number of asks was larger than that of bids. These findings indicate that bubbles are associated with increased negotiation effort when acting as a seller and diminished effort when acting as a buyer."
