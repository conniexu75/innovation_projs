https://openalex.org/W2122938469,"The atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide (p(CO(2))) will almost certainly be double that of pre-industrial levels by 2100 and will be considerably higher than at any time during the past few million years. The oceans are a principal sink for anthropogenic CO(2) where it is estimated to have caused a 30% increase in the concentration of H(+) in ocean surface waters since the early 1900s and may lead to a drop in seawater pH of up to 0.5 units by 2100 (refs 2, 3). Our understanding of how increased ocean acidity may affect marine ecosystems is at present very limited as almost all studies have been in vitro, short-term, rapid perturbation experiments on isolated elements of the ecosystem. Here we show the effects of acidification on benthic ecosystems at shallow coastal sites where volcanic CO(2) vents lower the pH of the water column. Along gradients of normal pH (8.1-8.2) to lowered pH (mean 7.8-7.9, minimum 7.4-7.5), typical rocky shore communities with abundant calcareous organisms shifted to communities lacking scleractinian corals with significant reductions in sea urchin and coralline algal abundance. To our knowledge, this is the first ecosystem-scale validation of predictions that these important groups of organisms are susceptible to elevated amounts of p(CO(2)). Sea-grass production was highest in an area at mean pH 7.6 (1,827 (mu)atm p(CO(2))) where coralline algal biomass was significantly reduced and gastropod shells were dissolving due to periods of carbonate sub-saturation. The species populating the vent sites comprise a suite of organisms that are resilient to naturally high concentrations of p(CO(2)) and indicate that ocean acidification may benefit highly invasive non-native algal species. Our results provide the first in situ insights into how shallow water marine communities might change when susceptible organisms are removed owing to ocean acidification."
https://openalex.org/W2003299661,"Bmi1 plays an essential part in the self-renewal of hematopoietic and neural stem cells. To investigate its role in other adult stem cell populations, we generated a mouse expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre from the Bmi1 locus. We found that Bmi1 is expressed in discrete cells located near the bottom of crypts in the small intestine, predominantly four cells above the base of the crypt (+4 position). Over time, these cells proliferate, expand, self-renew and give rise to all the differentiated cell lineages of the small intestine epithelium. The induction of a stable form of beta-catenin in these cells was sufficient to rapidly generate adenomas. Moreover, ablation of Bmi1(+) cells using a Rosa26 conditional allele, expressing diphtheria toxin, led to crypt loss. These experiments identify Bmi1 as an intestinal stem cell marker in vivo. Unexpectedly, the distribution of Bmi1-expressing stem cells along the length of the small intestine suggested that mammals use more than one molecularly distinguishable adult stem cell subpopulation to maintain organ homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1995192223,"The brain processes objects through a series of regions along the ventral visual pathway, but the circuitry subserving the analysis of specific complex forms remains unknown. One complex form category, faces, selectively activates six patches of cortex in the macaque ventral pathway. To identify the connectivity of these face patches, we used electrical microstimulation combined with simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging. Stimulation of each of four targeted face patches produced strong activation, specifically within a subset of the other face patches. Stimulation outside the face patches produced an activation pattern that spared the face patches. These results suggest that the face patches form a strongly and specifically interconnected hierarchical network."
https://openalex.org/W2058691572,"High lactate generation and low glucose oxidation, despite normal oxygen conditions, are commonly seen in cancer cells and tumors. Historically known as the Warburg effect, this altered metabolic phenotype has long been correlated with malignant progression and poor clinical outcome. However, the mechanistic relationship between altered glucose metabolism and malignancy remains poorly understood. Here we show that inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity contributes to the Warburg metabolic and malignant phenotype in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. PDC inhibition occurs via enhanced expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1), which results in inhibitory phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase α (PDHα) subunit. We also demonstrate that PDC inhibition in cancer cells is associated with normoxic stabilization of the malignancy-promoting transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) by glycolytic metabolites. Knockdown of PDK-1 via short hairpin RNA lowers PDHα phosphorylation, restores PDC activity, reverts the Warburg metabolic phenotype, decreases normoxic HIF-1α expression, lowers hypoxic cell survival, decreases invasiveness, and inhibits tumor growth. PDK-1 is an HIF-1-regulated gene, and these data suggest that the buildup of glycolytic metabolites, resulting from high PDK-1 expression, may in turn promote HIF-1 activation, thus sustaining a feed-forward loop for malignant progression. In addition to providing anabolic support for cancer cells, altered fuel metabolism thus supports a malignant phenotype. Correction of metabolic abnormalities offers unique opportunities for cancer treatment and may potentially synergize with other cancer therapies.

Correction of metabolic abnormalities offers unique opportunities for cancer treatment and may potentially synergize with other cancer therapies. Cancer is a disease whereby genetic mutation results in uncontrolled cell growth combined with malignancy. High lactate accumulation, despite adequate oxygen availability, is a metabolic pattern commonly associated with malignant transformation of the uncontrolled dividing cell. This metabolic phenotype, termed aerobic glycolysis and historically known as the Warburg effect, is characterized by high glycolytic rates and reduced mitochondrial oxidation (1Warburg O.

Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 11-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar), features that may favor cell survival in the hypoxic microenvironments found in tumors. This phenotype also favors the routing of key metabolic intermediates away from oxidative destruction and toward anabolic processes required by rapidly dividing cells (2Deberardinis R.J. Lum J.J.

Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). Hypoxia, HIF-1 activation, and high lactate levels in tumors are all independently correlated with poor clinical outcome for many human cancers (3Harris A.L. Nat. Rev.

Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A causative role for hypoxia and HIF-1 stabilization in tumor formation and progression has been demonstrated (reviewed in Ref. 3Harris A.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). However, the buildup of glycolytic metabolites, such as lactate or pyruvate, in tumors has historically been viewed as a secondary phenomenon, rather than an active contributor to the malignant process (5Walenta S. Schroeder T. Mueller-Klieser W. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recently, several intermediary glucose metabolites have been shown to promote HIF-1 activation independently of hypoxia by interacting with the HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHD 1–3). The PHD enzymes regulate the continuous oxygen-dependent degradation of the HIF-1α subunit (6Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. von Kriegsheim A. Hebenstreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4489) Google Scholar). PHDs require oxygen, iron, ascorbate, and 2-oxoglutarate for their activity. Fumarate and succinate have been shown to inhibit PHDs by competing with 2-oxoglutarate (7Isaacs J.S. Jung Y.J. Mole D.R. Lee S. Torres-Cabala C. Chung Y.L. Merino M. Trepel J. Zbar B. Toro J. Ratcliffe P.J. Linehan W.M. Neckers L.

Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 77-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar), whereas lactate, pyruvate, and oxaloacetate appear to inactivate PHDs in an ascorbate-reversible manner (9Lu H. Dalgard C.L. Mohyeldin A. McFate T. Tait A.S. Verma A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41928-41939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The discovery of these novel signaling actions of metabolites suggests that, like hypoxia, alterations of glucose routing in cancer cells may directly impact malignant progression. This has been demonstrated for the rare familial syndromes of succinate dehydrogenase deficiency and fumarate hydratase deficiency, where the buildup of succinate and fumarate, respectively, may contribute to formation of paragangliomas through sustained HIF-1α stabilization (7Isaacs J.S.

The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) controls pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle and thus sits at the interface between glycolysis and glucose oxidation. The PDC is composed of several enzymatic complexes and their regulatory proteins. Several differentially expressed pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK-1–4) and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases (PDP1,2) tightly regulate PDC activity via reversible inhibitory phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α (PDHα) subunit (10Roche T.E. Hiromasa Y. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 830-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This regulation of PDC activity provides a convenient way for cells to divert pyruvate into anabolic pathways, while favoring oxidation of other fuels. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1) was recently identified as an HIF-1-regulated gene, which directly ties HIF-1 activation to decreased glucose oxidation through PDHα phosphorylation and PDC inhibition (11Kim J.W. Tchernyshyov I. Semenza G.L. Dang C.V. Cell Metab. 2007; 3: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2646) Google Scholar, 12Papandreou I. Cairns R.A. Fontana L. Lim A.L. Denko N.C. Cell Metab. 2007; 3: 187-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that in cancer, by allowing accumulation of glycolytic end products that can stabilize HIF-1α, persistent PDHα phosphorylation may also potentially establish a feed-forward stimulatory loop between glucose metabolites and HIF-1, thereby accelerating malignant progression. We tested this hypothesis in human head and neck cancer cells. Cell Culture and Treatments—Human UM-22A, UM-22B, and JHU-O22 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell (HNSCC) lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) 1× glutamine, high glucose, no pyruvate supplemented with 10% FBS. and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). The UM-22A and UM-22B were kindly provided by Thomas Carey, University of Michigan. Cell lines were maintained in 21% O2, 5% CO2, and 74% N2 in a humidified cell incubator at 37 °C. For hypoxia treatments, culture dishes were sealed in a humidified chamber, incubated at 37 °C and continuously flushed with a gas mixture of 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 for the indicated times. Dichloroacetic acid (DCA), l-ascorbic acid, d(+)-glucose, and pyruvate were purchased from Sigma. MG-132 was purchase from Calbiochem. Cell Number and Viability Determination—Cells were plated in 6-well plates at 0.1–0.25 × 106 cells per well. At various times points, cells were trypsinized and counted. The cell number and viability were performed using the Vi-CELL Series cell viability analyzer (BeckmanCoulter), which determines viability based on the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Colony Formation—Cells (104) from each cell line were placed in 1 ml of DMEM with 0.3% low melting agarose (soft agar) and 10% FBS and overlaid onto 1 ml/well DMEM with 0.5% agarose and 10% FBS. After 18 days, colonies were counted using the Nikon SMZ1500 microscope and photographed with the Nikon DXM camera. Lactate Measurements—At various time points, 50 μl of medium was taken from cells grown in 2 ml of medium in 6-well cell culture plates and frozen until the time of measurement. Measurements were performed using the CMA 600 Analyzer (CMA-Microdialysis). This instrument performs an automated enzymatic conversion of lactate to H2O2. Peroxidase catalyzes a reaction between H2O2 and other substrates to form the red violet-colored quinonediimine. The rate of formation of quinonediimine per min is measured at 546 nm. Preparation of Whole Cell, Nuclear, and Cytoplasmic Extracts—Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions using the NE-PER kit (Pierce). Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cell pellets in RIPA buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, freshly supplemented with 2 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm NaVO4, and 10 mm NaF) for 30–60 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged (4 °C) at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatant was collected for Western blot analysis. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Western Blot Analysis—Western blots were performed by running 50–75 μg of nuclear or 35–50 μg of whole cell or cytoplasmic protein extracts on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by standard procedures. Membranes were blocked with TBS/Tween with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and then either incubated overnight at 4°C or 1 h at room temperature with the respective primary antibody: PDH E1α phosphoserine 293, 1:5000 (Novus Biologicals) 4N.

Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody, 1:10,000 and enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). Densitometry was performed using Image J software (National Institutes of Health). Cell Transfections—Validated plasmids encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for PDK-1, PDK-2, and negative control (SuperArray) were purified for transfection into 22B cells using the QIAfilter maxi plasmid kit (Qiagen Sciences) and introduced into the cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were placed under selective pressure 24 h post-transfection, using 1.5 mg/ml Geneticin® (Invitrogen). PDC Activity Assay—PDC activity was assayed according to previously published methods with minor modifications for use with culture cells (13Jeoung N.H. Sanghani P.C. Zhai L. Harris R.A. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 356: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluency in 100-mm dishes and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (without Ca2+/Mg2+). Extraction buffer (400 μl) was added directly to the plates, and the cells were scraped and pelleted. Samples were homogenized with a motor-driven homogenizer and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min with a tabletop microcentrifuge. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 μm final concentration) was added to the PDC extraction and resuspension buffer just before use. Glucose Oxidation—Glucose oxidation was assayed via 14CO2 capture using uniformly labeled glucose according to previously published methods (14Itoh Y. Esaki T. Shimoji K. Cook M. Law M.J. Kaufman E. Sokoloff L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4879-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) with the exception that Krebs buffer was used as the assay buffer, and protein contents were determined using the Bradford assay. VEGF Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Culture medium VEGF was measured via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according manufacturer’s instructions (R & D Systems). Cells were plated in 6-well dishes, and medium was replaced at the start of the 24-h experiment. At the end point, media samples were taken and frozen to assay VEGF, and cells were trypsinized and counted for normalization. Cell Invasion Assay—Cell invasion experiments were performed using 24-well Biocoat Matrigel™ invasion chambers with an 8-μm pore polycarbonate filter according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences). Regular growth factor Matrigel invasion chambers were used (BD Biosciences). Prior to experimentation all invasion chamber inserts were hydrated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells in the growing phase were trypsinized and suspended at a concentration of 4 × 105 cells/ml. The lower compartment of the plates received 750 μl of serum-free medium and/or the treatment condition designated in each experiment. 2 × 105 cells (for serum-free medium experiments) and 2.5 × 104 cells (for 10% serum medium experiments) were plated in each insert and allowed to invade for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 21% O2. Xenograft of Human Tumors—BALB/c male nude mice were purchased from NCI-Frederick (Frederick, MD) and housed in a pathogen-free room controlled for temperature and humidity. All animal protocols and handling were performed under approved Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences IACUC guidelines. Twenty (22B control shRNA, n = 10, 22B PDK-1 shRNA, n = 10) 6–8-week-old mice were injected subcutaneously in the scruff with 1 × 107 cells in 100 μl of PBS. Tumor bearing mice (9 from each group) were used for the experiment. One week after injection, tumor volume was assessed bi-weekly for 2 months using a digital caliper and calculated using the following formula: volume = (a × b2)/2, where a is the widest diameter of the tumor, and b is the diameter perpendicular to a. The results from individual mice were graphed as average tumor volume over 60 days. 1H NMR Spectroscopy—Six replicate and three replicate flasks were cultured for the 22B control shRNA and 22B PDK-1 shRNA cell lines, respectively. Cells were plated at 70% confluency, and media and cells were collected when cells reached confluency. Cells were rinsed with PBS and then harvested by scraping into 5 ml of PBS and centrifuging for 5 min at 600 × g. PBS was removed, and cells were stored at −80 °C until extraction procedure. CHCl3/Methanol Cell Extraction—Cells were suspended in 200 μl of CHCl3 and 100 μl of methanol on ice and mixed vigorously. The cells were thoroughly mixed with 300 μl of H2O before the resulting suspension was centrifuged at 9500 × g for 10 min. The upper aqueous layer was separated from the lower organic layer and allowed to stand overnight to allow methanol to evaporate before freeze-drying. The resultant aqueous extract was reconstituted for NMR in 500 μl of deuterated 0.1% sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.002% 3,3,3-trimethylsilyl propionate, as an internal reference peak, and 0.02% azide. NMR Data Acquisition—NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer operating at 600.13-MHz 1H NMR frequency and 300 K. 1H NMR spectra of the samples were acquired using a one-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy pulse sequence (RD-90°-t1-90°-tm-90°-acquire), which generates an unedited spectrum with improved solvent peak suppression. For all spectra 256 free induction decays were collected into 32 K complex data points, using a spectral width of 12,019 Hz (20 ppm), with a 2-s relaxation delay between pulses. A water presaturation pulse was applied throughout the relaxation delay. NMR Spectral Data Processing—NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer using the standard one-dimensional pulse sequence and processed as described previously (15Holmes E. Tsang T.M. Huang J.T. Leweke F.M. Koethe D. Gerth C.W. Nolden B.M. Gross S. Schreiber D. Nicholson J.K. Bahn S. PLoS Med. 2006; 3 (1420-1428): e327Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Spectra were referenced internally to the anomeric proton signal of α-glucose at 5.23 ppm. Spectra were normalized to an internal reference peak. Significant differences in resonance intensities were determined using the probabilistic quotient normalization method (16Dieterle F. Ross A. Schlotterbeck G. Senn H. Anal Chem. 2006; 78: 4281-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). All averaged results are presented as mean ± S.D. Differences in means were statistically analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t test. A probability level of 0.05 was considered significant. PDC and HIF-1 in Human HNSCC Cells—To elucidate a possible role for PDHα phosphorylation in the malignant phenotype of cancer cells, we utilized the human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells lines UM-22A, UM-22B, and JHU-O22. Two of these were generated from a primary (UM-22A) and metastatic lesion (UM-22B) in the same patient (17Zou C.P. Youssef E.M. Zou C.C. Carey T.E. Lotan R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6820-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although these cancer cell lines showed comparable anchorage-dependent growth properties (Fig. 1A), the 22B cells displayed much greater anchorage-independent growth in soft agar colony formation assays (Fig. 1B) and twice the lactate accumulation seen with the other cell lines (Fig. 1C). Also, the 22B cells alone accumulated nuclear HIF-1α protein after 12 h in culture under normal oxygen conditions (Fig. 1D). Normoxic or basal HIF-1α expression can be mediated by products of glucose metabolism and is additive with hypoxia-induced HIF-1α accumulation (9Lu H. Dalgard C.L. Mohyeldin A. McFate T. Tait A.S. Verma A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41928-41939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, 22B cells also displayed the highest induction of HIF-1α following 4-h exposures to hypoxia (1% O2) (Fig. 1D). To determine the respective PDHα phosphorylation status of the HNSCC cell lines, we used a PDHα phosphoserine 293 (site 1)-specific antisera since phosphorylation of this site produces nearly complete inhibition of PDC activity (18Patel M.S. Korotchkina L.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody was used to measure total PDHα expression, and densitometry was used to determine the ratio of phospho-PDHα to total PDHα. The highest ratio of phospho-PDHα to total PDHα was observed in the 22B cells (Fig. 1E). Although differential expression of PDK isoforms 1–3 was seen among the head and neck cancer cell lines, we observed the highest basal expression of PDK-1 in 22B cells (Fig. 1E). DCA Treatment in HNSCC Cells—Recent studies with the weak PDK inhibitor DCA have suggested that inhibition of PDHα phosphorylation may activate PDC, shift cancer cell metabolism toward aerobic respiration, promote cancer cell apoptosis, and reduce tumor growth (11Kim J.W. Tchernyshyov I. Semenza G.L. Dang C.V. Cell Metab. 2007; 3: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2646) Google Scholar, 12Papandreou I. Cairns R.A. Fontana L. Lim A.L. Denko N.C.

A. 2007; 104: 9445-9450Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, none of these studies documented direct changes in PDHα phosphorylation or PDC enzymatic activity. Using the phospho-specific antibody, we found that DCA decreased PDHα phosphorylation dose-dependently in 22A cells but was surprisingly without significant effect in 22B cells, even at concentrations up to 20 mm (Fig. 1, F and G). Also, the time- and dose-dependent inhibition of lactate release by DCA observed in 22A cells was absent in 22B cells (Fig. 1, H and I). Moreover, at the high doses required for its effects, DCA produced toxicity in the 22B cells but not the 22A cells (Fig. 1J). In addition to being a weak inhibitor of PDK, DCA also blocks glutathione S-transferase ζ (21Tzeng H.F. Blackburn A.C. Board P.G. Anders M.W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis (22Stacpoole P.W. Greene Y.J. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), promotes oxidative stress (23Hassoun E.A. Ray S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Toxicol. Pharmacol. 2003; 135: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (24Laughter A.R. Dunn C.S. Swanson C.L. Howroyd P. Cattley R.C. Corton J.C. Toxicology. 2004; 203: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both these published observations and our data persuaded us to use more specific strategies for implicating a role for PDHα phosphorylation in cancer biology. PDK Inhibition with shRNA—We therefore utilized shRNA to knock down PDK-1 expression in 22B cells. Cells were transfected with a vector under control of the U1 promoter containing a neomycin-resistant gene, and stably expressing cell lines were selected by antibiotic treatment. Western blot analysis showed the effective reduction of PDK-1 expression in the stably transfected PDK-1 shRNA (shPDK-1) cells when compared with cells transfected with control shRNA (shCt) (Fig. 2A). PDK-2 expression was slightly increased in the shPDK-1 cells, whereas PDK-3 expression remained low in both cell lines (Fig. 2A). Western blotting confirmed reduction of PDHα phosphorylation but not PDHα expression following PDK-1 knockdown (Fig. 2A). Measurement of PDC enzymatic activity in cell lysates showed that shCt cell extracts had 60% lower PDC activity than the shPDK-1 cells. 5N. H. Jeoung, unpublished data. However, after addition of recombinant PDP-1 to maximally dephosphorylate PDHα, and thus fully activate PDC, the shCt cell extracts actually showed greater total activity than the shPDK-1 cell extracts, 5N. H. Jeoung, unpublished data. confirming strong phosphorylation-dependent inhibition. The ratio of active to total PDC was four times higher in the 22B shPDK-1 cells compared with the 22B shCt cells (Fig. 2B). Consistent with this, the shPDK-1 cells were found to oxidize uniformly labeled [14C]glucose to 14CO2 at twice the rate of shCt cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, whereas 22B shCt cells generated similar amounts of medium lactate as the nontransfected 22B cells, lactate secretion by the shPDK-1 cells was decreased to levels similar to the 22A and O22 cell lines (Fig. 2D). To rule out the influence of differential lactate transport rates between the cells, we also analyzed the aqueous component of the cell extracts by 1H NMR spectroscopy. This approach confirmed a pronounced reduction in cellular lactate following PDK-1 knockdown but few other changes in metabolite accumulation patterns (Fig. 2E). Notable other changes were a decrease in glycerophosphocholine and branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, and valine) and a rise in free CH2 and CH3 lipids following PDK-1 knockdown. An unidentified metabolite at corresponding to a singlet at 7.69 ppm was also markedly reduced in the shPDK-1-transfected cells. Comparative analysis of the 1H NMR spectra generated for the culture medium revealed elevated levels of glucose in the medium that contained the PDK-1 shRNA cell lines compared with the controls (p < 0.01), where glucose to lactate ratios were also significantly higher (p < 0.05). The data also suggested elevated levels of branched chain amino acids in the same medium, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.085). 6O. Teahan and T. M. Tseng, unpublished data. Decreased HIF-1α with PDK Inhibition—Many cancer cells are known to have a high level of HIF-1α accumulation under basal as well as hypoxic conditions (9Lu H. Dalgard C.L. Mohyeldin A. McFate T.

Prior work has shown that glucose metabolism contributes to this normoxic HIF-1 activation in cancer cells. Removal of medium glucose or its substitution with nonglycolytic fuel sources has been shown to diminish hypoxia-independent basal HIF-1α accumulation and also to lower HIF-1α stabilization by hypoxia (9Lu H.

To examine whether altering the ratio of glycolysis to glucose oxidation via PDC activation had an impact on HIF-1α stabilization, we measured nuclear HIF-1α accumulation in cells following 16 h of culture with or without exposure to hypoxia (1% O2) for the final 4 h (Fig. 3A). We found that the normoxic and hypoxia-dependent HIF-1α accumulation seen in the parent 22B cells was retained in the shCt cells. However, PDK-1 knockdown eliminated normoxic and reduced h"
https://openalex.org/W1992767102,"Most seizures stop spontaneously; however, the molecular mechanisms that terminate seizures remain unknown. Observations that seizures reduced brain pH and that acidosis inhibited seizures indicate that acidosis halts epileptic activity. Because acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) is exquisitely sensitive to extracellular pH and regulates neuron excitability, we hypothesized that acidosis might activate ASIC1a, which would terminate seizures. Disrupting mouse ASIC1a increased the severity of chemoconvulsant-induced seizures, whereas overexpressing ASIC1a had the opposite effect. ASIC1a did not affect seizure threshold or onset, but shortened seizure duration and prevented seizure progression. CO2 inhalation, long known to lower brain pH and inhibit seizures, required ASIC1a to interrupt tonic-clonic seizures. Acidosis activated inhibitory interneurons through ASIC1a, suggesting that ASIC1a might limit seizures by increasing inhibitory tone. Our results identify ASIC1a as an important element in seizure termination when brain pH falls and suggest both a molecular mechanism for how the brain stops seizures and new therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2118428015,"GDNF is a potent neurotrophic factor that protects catecholaminergic neurons from toxic damage and induces fiber outgrowth. However, the actual role of endogenous GDNF in the normal adult brain is unknown, even though GDNF-based therapies are considered promising for neurodegenerative disorders. We have generated a conditional GDNF-null mouse to suppress GDNF expression in adulthood, hence avoiding the developmental compensatory modifications masking its true physiologic action. After Gdnf ablation, mice showed a progressive hypokinesia and a selective decrease of brain tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) mRNA, accompanied by pronounced catecholaminergic cell death, affecting most notably the locus coeruleus, which practically disappears; the substantia nigra; and the ventral tegmental area. These data unequivocally demonstrate that GDNF is indispensable for adult catecholaminergic neuron survival and also show that, under physiologic conditions, downregulation of a single trophic factor can produce massive neuronal death."
https://openalex.org/W2088400322,"The adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-based vaccine developed by Merck failed to either prevent HIV-1 infection or suppress viral load in subsequently infected subjects in the STEP human Phase 2b efficacy trial. Analogous vaccines had previously also failed in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) challenge-rhesus macaque model. In contrast, vaccine protection studies that used challenge with a chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV89.6P) in macaques did not predict the human trial results. Ad5 vector-based vaccines did not protect macaques from infection after SHIV89.6P challenge but did cause a substantial reduction in viral load and a preservation of CD4+ T cell counts after infection, findings that were not reproduced in the human trials. Although the SIV challenge model is incompletely validated, we propose that its expanded use can help facilitate the prioritization of candidate HIV-1 vaccines, ensuring that resources are focused on the most promising candidates. Vaccine designers must now develop T cell vaccine strategies that reduce viral load after heterologous challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2112986981,"Epithelial organs, including the lung, are known to possess regenerative abilities through activation of endogenous stem cell populations, but the molecular pathways regulating stem cell expansion and regeneration are not well understood. Here we show that Gata6 regulates the temporal appearance and number of bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) in the lung, its absence in Gata6-null lung epithelium leading to the precocious appearance of BASCs and concurrent loss in epithelial differentiation. This expansion of BASCs was the result of a pronounced increase in canonical Wnt signaling in lung epithelium upon loss of Gata6. Expression of the noncanonical Wnt receptor Fzd2 was downregulated in Gata6 mutants and increased Fzd2 or decreased beta-catenin expression rescued, in part, the lung epithelial defects in Gata6 mutants. During lung epithelial regeneration, canonical Wnt signaling was activated in the niche containing BASCs and forced activation of Wnt signaling led to a large increase in BASC numbers. Moreover, Gata6 was required for proper lung epithelial regeneration, and postnatal loss of Gata6 led to increased BASC expansion and decreased differentiation. Together, these data demonstrate that Gata6-regulated Wnt signaling controls the balance between progenitor expansion and epithelial differentiation required for both lung development and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2156542857,"γ-Secretase is an unusual and ubiquitous aspartyl protease with an intramembrane catalytic site that cleaves many type-I integral membrane proteins, most notably APP and Notch. Several reports suggest that cleavage of APP to produce the Aβ peptide is regulated in part by lipids. As γ-secretase is a multipass protein complex with 19 transmembrane domains, it is likely that the local lipid composition of the membrane can regulate γ-activity. To determine the direct contribution of the lipid microenvironment to γ-secretase activity, we purified the human protease from overexpressing mammalian cells, reconstituted it in vesicles of varying lipid composition, and examined the effects of individual phospholipids, sphingolipids, cholesterol, and complex lipid mixtures on substrate cleavage. A conventional γ-activity assay was modified to include a detergent-removal step to facilitate proteoliposome formation, and this increased baseline activity over 2-fold. Proteoliposomes containing sphingolipids significantly increased γ-secretase activity over a phosphatidylcholine-only baseline, whereas the addition of phosphatidylinositol significantly decreased activity. Addition of soluble cholesterol in the presence of phospholipids and sphingolipids robustly increased the cleavage of APP- and Notch-like substrates in a dose-dependent manner. Reconstitution of γ-secretase in complex lipid mixtures revealed that a lipid raft-like composition supported the highest level of activity compared with other membrane compositions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that membrane lipid composition is a direct and potent modulator of γ-secretase and that cholesterol, in particular, plays a major regulatory role. γ-Secretase is an unusual and ubiquitous aspartyl protease with an intramembrane catalytic site that cleaves many type-I integral membrane proteins, most notably APP and Notch.

A major pathogenic feature of AD is the accumulation of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in brain regions serving memory and cognition (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol.

Aβ is generated by sequential proteolytic cleavages of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. γ-Secretase is a unique aspartyl protease that comprises a multiprotein complex composed of presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 (2Kimberly W.T.

Semi-purified and purified γ-secretase preparations have been found to be inactive unless lipids, generally phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), are added to the reaction mixture (21Fraering P.C.

The dependence of γ-secretase activity on cholesterol has been observed in several studies conducted in cultured cells or rodent models, further supporting the notion that γ-secretase activity can be regulated by its surrounding lipid microenvironment (8Wahrle S.

The contribution of individual lipid species has not been thoroughly investigated and the direct effect of lipid composition on γ-secretase activity remains elusive. Although some cellular studies have suggested that particular lipids regulate γ-secretase activity, the complexity of these assays, including potential trafficking/localization issues of the enzyme or substrate due to lipid modulation, pleiotropic effects of the inhibitors used to modulate cellular lipids, and interference of other proteins, make it difficult to determine the direct effect of lipid modulation on γ-secretase. Moreover, in vitro γ-secretase assays to date almost always include detergents, most commonly CHAPSO or digitonin, each of which is compatible with γ-secretase activity but generally incompatible with proteoliposome formation at the concentrations used. It is known that the presence of detergents in activity assays of membrane proteins can interfere with liposome formation and integrity and overall enzymatic activity (23Rigaud J.L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and lipid specificity profiles can be drastically altered in the presence or absence of detergent (24Sandermann Jr., H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 209-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Therefore, in an effort to better understand the role of the lipid microenvironment on γ-secretase activity in a system that supports lipid structure, we have assessed the effect of detergent removal on the activity of purified mammalian γ-secretase and then used a reductionist approach to systematically examine the effects of individual lipids and lipid mixtures directly on proteolytic activity. Reagents—Lipids were purchased from Sigma (PC, PE, and sphingomyelin (SM) from bovine brain) or Avanti Polar Lipids (phosphatidylserine (PS), gangliosides (GS), and cerebrosides (CS) from porcine brain; phosphatidylinositol (PI) from bovine liver, phosphatidic acid (PA) from egg, and complex lipid mixtures from porcine brain, bovine liver, bovine heart, Escherichia coli, and soybean). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin-caged water-soluble cholesterol was purchased from Sigma. Purification of γ-Secretase and Recombinant Substrates—The multistep procedure for the high grade purification of human γ-secretase from the S-1 Chinese hamster ovary cell line (co-expressing human PS1, FLAG-Pen-2, Aph1α2-HA, and NCT-GST) and the purification of recombinant C100FLAG and N100FLAG substrates were performed as described previously (21Fraering P.C. Ye W. Strub J.M. Dolios G. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. van Dorsselaer A. Wang R. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9774-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 25Kimberly W.T.

Reconstitution of γ-Secretase to Form Proteoliposomes—Lipids in chloroform solvent were dried under a stream of nitrogen gas and then hydrated in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl. Lipid hydration was carried out at or above the Tm, with occasional vortexing, and the lipid mixtures were sonicated in a water bath for 10 min. For each reaction, lipids were diluted to 1.25 mg/ml in HEPES buffer, and CHAPSO was added at a final concentration of 4 mm, the concentration that yielded complete liposome solubilization as determined by the nadir of turbidity measurements at 540 nm. The solubilization reaction took place for 10 min at room temperature, at which time we added purified γ-secretase, at a 10-fold dilution from stock (stock = the M2 anti-FLAG-eluted fraction in the purification protocol from S-1 cells (21Fraering P.C. Ye W. Strub J.M. Dolios G. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. van Dorsselaer A. Wang R. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9774-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar)). The mixture was incubated at 32 °C for 30 min and then at room temperature for 10 min. To remove detergent and facilitate proteoliposome formation, Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) were added at a concentration of 25× lipid weight to the protein/lipid mixture, and this mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with gentle rocking. Thereafter, the Bio-Beads were sedimented, and the supernatant was collected and used as the starting material in the following assays. We refer to these assay conditions as “detergent-free” in the article, although addition of substrate (see below) will add trace amounts of detergent to the reaction mixture, i.e. 0.02% Nonidet P-40 final concentration, which has no effect on turbidity measurements. In Vitro γ-Secretase Activity Assays—γ-Secretase/lipid mixtures post-Bio-Bead treatment were incubated with either the C100FLAG or N100FLAG substrates at a final concentration of 1 μm for 4 h at 37 °C. Samples incubated with C100FLAG were assayed for Aβ40 or Aβ42 by ELISA (Invitrogen) or by Western blot for AICD, whereas samples incubated with N100FLAG were assayed by Western blot to detect ICD production. Western Blotting and Antibodies—For Western blot analysis of the purified γ-secretase complex from S-1 cells comprising PS1-NTF, PS1-CTF, Aph1α2-HA, FLAG-Pen-2, and NCT-GST, the samples were run on a 4–20% Tris glycine polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with Ab14 (for PS1-NTF, 1:2000; a gift of S. Gandy), 13A11 (for PS1-CTF, 5 μg/ml; a gift of Elan Pharmaceuticals), 3F10 (for Aph1α2-HA, 50 ng/ml; Roche Applied Science), anti-FLAG M2 (for FLAG-Pen-2, 1:1000; Sigma), or α-GST antibodies (for NCT-GST, 1:3000; Sigma). The biotinylated γ-secretase sample (below) was detected with an antibiotin antibody (1:2000; Sigma). Samples from the γ-secretase activity assays were run on 10–20% Tris-Tricine gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes to detect AICD-FLAG with M2 anti-FLAG antibody. Samples from γ-secretase activity assays with the N100FLAG substrate were run on 4–20% Tris glycine gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes to detect NICD-FLAG with the Notch Ab1744 antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), which is selective for the free N terminus of the NICD. Levels of ICD-FLAG were estimated by densitometry using the Scion Image Program. Electron Microscopy—For EM labeling studies, purified γ-secretase was biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Excess biotin was removed with a desalting column, and the biotinylated γ-secretase preparation was bound to M2 resin, washed extensively with 0.1% digitonin in Tris-buffered saline, and eluted with 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide. The M2-elute 1 protein preparation was used as the starting material in the immunogold EM studies. The γ-secretase sample was adsorbed to a glow-discharged formvar/carbon-coated copper grid for 1 min. Excess liquid was blotted off on a filter paper, and the grid was floated on 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min (blocking). For labeling, an anti-biotin antibody was diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline followed by 10 nm protein A-gold (G. Posthuma, Utrecht, the Netherlands). After labeling, the sample was washed in phosphate-buffered saline and water and stained with uranyl acetate. Images were taken with an AMT 2k CCD camera on a “Tecnai G2 Spirit Bio Twin” transmission electron microscope (FEI). Immunoprecipitation/Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Aβ—Aβ peptides generated in the in vitro γ-secretase assays were immunoprecipitated using monoclonal anti-Aβ antibody 4G8 (Senetek, Maryland Heights, MO) and protein A/G plus-agarose beads (Oncogene) and subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems), as described (26Wang R. Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31894-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The molecular masses were accurately measured and searched against the amino acid sequence of human APP C99 carrying a methionine residue at the N terminus and a FLAG tag sequence at the C terminus (C100FLAG). Statistical Analysis—All quantified data represent an average of at least three independent experiments. Error bars represent mean ± S.E. Data comparing differences between two groups were statistically analyzed using the unpaired, 2-tailed Student’s t test. The Bonferroni correction was used when more than two groups were present. In experiments in which three or more groups were compared against each other, data were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer post-testing. γ-Secretase is a complex of four membrane proteins containing a total of 19 transmembrane domains that cleaves type-I membrane proteins within their transmembrane domains in the lipid bilayer. To date, γ-secretase activity assays with isolated enzyme have been carried out in the presence of detergent, generally CHAPSO or digitonin, both of which are compatible with detectable cleavage activity of the enzyme (21Fraering P.C. Ye W. Strub J.M. Dolios G. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. van Dorsselaer A. Wang R. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9774-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, there is strong evidence that the presence of detergent can affect enzymatic activity, alter the lipid specificity profile in activity assays (24Sandermann Jr., H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 209-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), interfere with the process of proteoliposome formation, and increase proteoliposome permeability (23Rigaud J.L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 27Rigaud J.L. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of detergent removal on activity assays carried out with purified γ-secretase in the presence of 0.1% PC and 0.025% PE (w/v), a lipid composition that was previously reported to allow robust γ-secretase cleavage in vitro (21Fraering P.C. Ye W. Strub J.M. Dolios G. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. van Dorsselaer A. Wang R. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9774-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We used Bio-Beads, polystyrene beads that remove detergent through hydrophobic adsorption, as a very efficient tool for proteoliposome reconstitution (27Rigaud J.L. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Levy D. Bluzat A. Seigneuret M. Rigaud J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1025: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Bio-Beads were added to reaction mixtures containing lipids and the purified enzyme prior to substrate addition. Inclusion of this detergent-removal step led to a marked increase in the turbidity of the γ-secretase reaction mixture (measured at 540 nm), which is consistent with the formation of lipid vesicles (23Rigaud J.L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To visualize the effect of the detergent-removal step on lipid vesicle structure, we performed negative stain electron microscopy (EM) on these samples. In the samples containing 0.25% CHAPSO (i.e. before Bio-Bead treatment), we observed small, irregularly shaped lipid vesicles and, in some cases, what appeared to be irregularly shaped multilamellar liposomes (Fig. 1B, top panel). After detergent removal with Bio-Beads, the structure of the lipids changed drastically, and now numerous spherical liposomes were observed; these ranged from ∼50 to 500 nm in diameter (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). These results indicate that inclusion of a detergent-removal step in the γ-secretase assay protocol allows the formation of variously sized lipid vesicles. Next, we examined the effect of this detergent removal and subsequent liposome formation on γ-secretase activity. We determined that the optimal amount of Bio-Beads to add to the reaction mixture was 25× Bio-Beads/lipids (w/w) (data not shown). γ-Secretase activity assays performed with the C100FLAG substrate after detergent removal/liposome formation had 2.1-fold higher Aβ40 production than the detergent-containing controls (Fig. 1C). Likewise, cleavage of the N100FLAG substrate was also increased 2.2-fold under these new conditions (Fig. 1D). Therefore, modifying the γ-secretase activity assay protocol by including a detergent-removal step yields higher activity than that achieved under the standard published conditions, for both C100FLAG and N100FLAG substrates (23Rigaud J.L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 27Rigaud J.L. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To confirm that the liposomes that formed after detergent removal were in fact proteoliposomes containing γ-secretase, we used immunoelectron microscopy to label γ-secretase-containing liposomes. Because we were working with low concentrations of purified enzyme relative to the concentration of lipid, we wanted to increase the labeling efficiency of γ-secretase within the proteoliposome. To that end, we biotinylated a small sample of a purified γ-secretase preparation, which resulted in specific biotin labeling of all of the γ-secretase components, as seen by Western blotting with an antibody to biotin (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Importantly, the α-biotin blots revealed only the known proteins of the γ-secretase complex, confirming the purity of our γ-secretase preparation. When this biotinylated γ-secretase preparation was used in our lipid reconstitution protocol (see above) and then examined by immuno-EM, the lipid vesicles were specifically labeled with the α-biotin antibody. Although a large percentage of vesicles did not contain γ-secretase due to the low concentration of enzyme used in the reconstitution, the great majority of immunodetected γ-secretase was membrane-associated, with minimal labeling outside vesicles (Fig. 2B). Taken together, our results indicate that whereas standard γ-secretase reaction conditions using 0.25% CHAPSO are compatible with γ-secretase activity, removal of the detergent substantially increases baseline activity and enables proteoliposome formation, which provides a more physiological environment for studying membrane proteins and their regulation by lipids. Phospholipid Dependence of Aβ Formation by Purified γ-Secretase—Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that PC and PE are necessary to reconstitute activity of purified γ-secretase (21Fraering P.C. Ye W. Strub J.M. Dolios G. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. van Dorsselaer A. Wang R. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9774-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Despite the huge diversity of lipid species in biological membranes, the effects of individual phospholipids other than PC and PE on γ-secretase activity have not been described heretofore. To understand the roles of individual lipid species on the activity of γ-secretase in our detergent-free system that supports proteoliposome formation, we examined the effect of various concentrations of PC, PE, PS, PI, and PA on the cleavage efficiency of the C100FLAG substrate by measuring Aβ40 production by ELISA. With the exception of PC, none of these phospholipid species alone supported measurable cleavage activity, as measured by Aβ40 production (Fig. 3A). As PC is generally the most abundant phospholipid in cellular membranes and is well suited to serve as the bulk structural element of membranes, we assessed the effect of various ratios of PC to other membrane phospholipids on the efficiency of C100FLAG cleavage in our detergent-free assay. We found that vesicles containing 90% PC plus 10% of PE, PS, or PA had the greatest increase in Aβ40 production relative to the PC-only control, with a 1.3-fold increase in activity for each of the lipid mixtures (Fig. 3A). When PC was present in the reaction mixtures at 50% (w/w) or less versus PE, PS, or PA, Aβ40 production was reduced compared with the PC-only control, most likely because these lipid compositions may not form functional proteoliposomes, as the bulk structural element, PC, is markedly reduced. Interestingly, we found that vesicles containing PI at any concentration led to a marked decrease in Aβ40 production compared with the PC only control. The results indicate that significant changes in the efficiency of cleavage of APP substrate by the purified γ-secretase complex are induced by altering the ratios of certain membrane phospholipids. Sphingolipid Dependence of Aβ Formation by Purified γ-Secretase—γ-Secretase activity has been reported to be enriched in lipid raft microdomains, which are rich in sphingolipids (19Vetrivel K.S.

https://openalex.org/W2012650972,"Obesity is associated with infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue. Adipose macrophages may contribute to an elevated inflammatory status by secreting a variety of proinflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Recent data suggest that during diet-induced obesity the phenotype of adipose-resident macrophages changes from alternatively activated macrophages toward a more classical and pro-inflammatory phenotype. Here, we explore the effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ activation on obesity-induced inflammation in 129SV mice fed a high fat diet for 20 weeks. High fat feeding increased bodyweight gain, adipose tissue mass, and liver triglycerides. Rosiglitazone treatment further increased adipose mass, reduced liver triglycerides, and changed adipose tissue morphology toward smaller adipocytes. Surprisingly, rosiglitazone markedly increased the number of macrophages in adipose tissue, as shown by immunohistochemical analysis and quantification of macrophage marker genes CD68 and F4/80+. In adipose tissue, markers for classically activated macrophages including IL-18 were down-regulated, whereas markers characteristic for alternatively activated macrophages (arginase 1, IL-10) were up-regulated by rosiglitazone. Importantly, conditioned media from rosiglitazone-treated alternatively activated macrophages neutralized the inhibitory effect of macrophages on 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, suggesting that alternatively activated macrophages may be involved in mediating the effects of rosiglitazone on adipose tissue morphology and mass. Our results suggest that short term rosiglitazone treatment increases infiltration of alternatively activated macrophages in adipose tissue.

The alternatively activated macrophages might play a role in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ-dependent expansion and remodeling of adipose tissue. The global prevalence rate of obesity is rising steadily (1Hill J.O. Endocr. Rev. 2006; 27: 750-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Obesity is linked to several metabolic disturbances that greatly increase morbidity risk, which are collected in the metabolic syndrome and include hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance (2Reaven G.M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2006; 83: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Each serves as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis and associated coronary heart disease. Although the overall negative impact of obesity and metabolic syndrome on morbidity is evident, it has been very difficult to get a handle on why some individuals are obese seemingly without any damaging consequences for health, whereas others are afflicted by a range of metabolic abnormalities. Clearly, our understanding of the chain of events that leads to metabolic syndrome, although growing, is still remarkably scarce. Recent studies suggest an important role for inflammatory processes. Indeed, it has been found that obesity is associated with a state of chronic low grade inflammation which is likely caused by adipocyte hypertrophy together with infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue (3Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 2006; 444: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (6390) Google Scholar). As a result, the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor α and IL-6 3The abbreviations used are:ILinterleukinPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorqPCRquantitative PCRLFDlow fat dietHFDlow fat dietFCSfetal calf serum. from adipose tissue is increased, leading to disruption of normal homeostatic control of metabolism either locally or systemically (4Weisberg S.P.

Why macrophages infiltrate adipose tissue during obesity is currently unclear, although it has been suggested that macrophage localization and infiltration is strongly linked to adipose cell death (7Cinti S. Mitchell G. Barbatelli G. Murano I. Ceresi E. Faloia E. Wang S. Fortier M. Greenberg A.S. Obin M.S. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 2347-2355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been proposed that adipose tissue resident macrophages itself undergo phenotypic changes during obesity. In adipose tissue of mice rendered obese by high fat feeding, macrophages appear to be mainly activated according to “classical activation,” whereas macrophages present in adipose tissue of lean mice are “alternatively activated” (8Lumeng C.N. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). Classically activated macrophages express high levels of pro-inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor α, which may contribute to insulin resistance. In contrast, alternatively activated macrophages are considered anti-inflammatory by expressing genes such as IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and arginase I (9Gordon S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (4782) Google Scholar). interleukin peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor quantitative PCR low fat diet low fat diet fetal calf serum. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ is a ligand-activated transcription factor and member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors. It regulates gene transcription by binding to specific DNA sequences in target genes, leading to chromatin remodeling and activation of gene transcription. PPARγ serves as the molecular target for an important class of anti-diabetic drugs, the thiazolidinediones. In addition, PPARγ binds and is activated by polyunsaturated fatty acids and fatty acid-derived molecules. The expression of PPARγ is highest in adipose tissues, where it plays a pivotal role in the adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage (10Rosen E.D. Sarraf P. Troy A.E. Bradwin G. Moore K.

Target genes of PPARγ identified so far include fatty acid-binding protein 4, GLUT4, glycogen synthase 2, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, lipoprotein lipase, glycerol kinase, and aquaporin 7 (12Lehrke M.

Muller M. Kersten S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 1145-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, PPARγ is the molecular target for the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones, which effectively lower plasma glucose and insulin levels by promoting insulin sensitivity and, thus, stimulating glucose uptake. Thiazolidinediones also reduce plasma free fatty acid concentrations, although this effect is mainly evident in rodents (14Oakes N.D. Thalen P.G. Jacinto S.M. Ljung B. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 15Tan G.D. Fielding B.A. Currie J.M. Humphreys S.M. Desage M. Frayn K.N. Laville M. Vidal H. Karpe F. Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in adipocyte differentiation and glucose metabolism, PPARγ also has potent anti-inflammatory activity. Treatment of mice with rosiglitazone causes a significant decrease in expression of numerous inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor α and IL-6 (16Hammarstedt A. Andersson C.X. Rotter S.V. Smith U. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2005; 73: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In adipose tissue, induction of adipocyte differentiation by PPARγ is paralleled by the appearance of smaller adipocytes (17Okuno A. Tamemoto H. Tobe K. Ueki K. Mori Y. Iwamoto K. Umesono K.

Furthermore, it has been suggested that PPARγ may suppress inflammation associated with diet-induced obesity by lowering the number of macrophages present in adipose tissue (5Xu H. Barnes G.T.

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of rosiglitazone on macrophage infiltration in Sv129 mice rendered obese by chronic feeding of a high fat diet. Our data indicate that short term rosiglitazone treatment increases infiltration of alternatively activated macrophages in adipose tissue. Animal Study—Sv129 male mice were purchased at The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Male mice received a low fat diet (LFD) or low fat diet (HFD) for 21 weeks, providing 10 or 45% energy percent in the form of triglycerides (D12450B or D12451, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ). The lard component in these diets was replaced by palm oil. In the last week of diet intervention, half of the mice receiving the HFD were switched to HFD supplemented with rosiglitazone (0.01% w/w). At the end of the feeding experiment, blood was collected in EDTA-coated tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 × g to collect plasma. Liver and epididymal white adipose tissue were dissected, weighed, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The animal experiments were approved by the animal experimentation committee of Wageningen University. Microarray Analysis, RNA Isolation, and Quality Control—Total RNA was isolated from adipose tissue or 3T3-L1 adipocytes using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Concentrations and purity of RNA samples were determined on a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Isogen, Maarssen, The Netherlands). RNA integrity was checked on an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) with 6000 Nano Chips. Pooled RNA samples from five mice per experimental group were used for microarray analysis. Samples were hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430A arrays. Expression levels were calculated applying the multi-chip modified gamma model for oligonucleotide signal (multi-mgMOS) (20Liu X. Milo M. Lawrence N.D. Rattray M.

Detailed descriptions of the applied methods are available on request. Microarray data were submitted to the NCBI gene expression and hybridization array data repository. The assigned GEO accession number is GSE11295. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) was used to identify the most significantly changed cellular pathways using input criteria of a relative fold change above 2 or below −2 and a p value similar to or below 0.001. Real-time PCR—1 μg of RNA was used for reverse transcription using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR was done with platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and SYBR Green using an iCycler PCR machine (Bio-Rad). Melt curve analysis was included to assure a single PCR product was formed. The primers used are listed in Table 1.

Sections were preincubated with 20% normal goat serum followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with the primary antibody diluted 1:50 in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin. After incubation with the primary antibody, a goat anti-rat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Serotec) was used as a secondary antibody. Visualization of the complex was done using 3,3′-diaminobenzidene for 5 min. Negative controls were used by omitting the primary antibody. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of sections was done using standard protocols. The percentage of F4/80+-expressing cells for each slide was calculated as the sum of the number of nuclei of F4/80+-positive cells divided by the total number of nuclei present in a slide. Four fields per slide were included, and a total of 4 or 5 mice per group were used. Adipocyte Size—Morphometry of individual fat cells was assessed using digital image analysis. Microscopic images were digitized in 24-bit red/green/blue (specimen level pixel size 1.28 × 1.28 um2). Recognition of fat cells was initially performed by applying a region-growing algorithm on manually indicated seed points. If required, results of region growing were interactively corrected. From the resulting regions the area and minimum Feret diameter were calculated. The minimum Feret diameter is useful because fat cells are generally (near) convex objects. For each specimen, all fat cells in 3–5 microscopic fields of view were measured. On average, 465 fat cells were measured per specimen (range 335–591). Differences between groups were studied using one-way univariate analysis of variance. Tukey honestly significant difference post hoc testing was applied for multiple comparison testing. All statistics were performed using SPSS software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Il). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole Staining—To visualize DNA content of adipose tissue, sections were incubated with 300 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at room temperature. Sections were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope. Liver Triglycerides—Liver triglycerides were determined in 10% liver homogenates prepared in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 using a commercially available kit from Instruchemie (Delfzijl, The Netherlands). Plasma Insulin and Leptin—Plasma levels of insulin were measured using a commercially available kit from Linco (LINCO Research Inc., St. Charles, MO). Plasma levels of leptin were measured using a kit from R&D systems (Abingdon, UK). Fractioning of Adipose Tissue—Freshly isolated epididymal adipose tissue was used for the isolation of adipocytes and stromal vascular cells. Minced adipose tissue was digested using collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 5 mg/ml dissolved in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% FCS (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium). Tissues were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C and subsequently filtered through a 250 μm nylon mesh filter. After centrifugation, the floating cells were collected as adipocytes, and the pelleted cells were collected as stromal vascular cells. Both cell fractions were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Cell Culture—Mouse RAW264.7 cells were obtained from the European Council of American Chambers OF Commerce (Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK) and grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% FCS and antibiotics. Cells were treated with IL-4 (5 ng/ml), rosiglitazone (1 μm), or both for 24 h. Medium was removed, and cells were carefully washed using phosphate-buffered saline and re-incubated with fresh medium without the addition of ligands and/or cytokines. 16 h later medium was removed from RAW264.7 cells, centrifuged, and stored at −20 °C until further use. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium plus 10% calf serum and plated for final differentiation in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium plus 10% FCS. Two days after reaching confluence, the medium was changed to macrophage-conditioned medium, and the following compounds were added: isobutyl methylxanthine (0.5 mm), dexamethasone (1 μm), and insulin (5 μg/ml). After 2 days the medium was changed to macrophage-conditioned medium plus 10% FCS and insulin (5 μg/ml). After 4 days the medium was changed to macrophage-conditioned medium plus 10% FCS, which was changed every 2 days. Oil Red O staining of 3T3 adipocytes was performed using a standard protocol. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significant differences were calculated using Student’s t test. The cut-off for statistical significance was set at a p value of 0.05 or below. Rosiglitazone Treatment of Obese Mice Increases Adipose Mass Together with Up-regulation of PPARγ Target Genes—Sv129 mice were fed a LFD or HFD for 20 weeks. Although energy intake was similar (Fig. 1A), mice on HFD showed a significantly higher bodyweight gain compared with mice on LFD (Fig. 1B). Adipose tissue weight at the end of the study was also significantly higher in the HFD animals (Fig. 1D). One week of rosiglitazone treatment of mice fed the HFD further increased adipose tissue weight (Fig. 1D) and plasma leptin concentrations (Fig. 1E). HFD also significantly increased plasma insulin (Fig. 1F), suggesting development of insulin resistance as well as liver triglycerides (Fig. 1G), which were reversed by rosiglitazone. The increase in adipose tissue weight and decrease in liver triglyceride content strongly suggests redistribution of liver fat toward white adipose tissue after rosiglitazone treatment. Rosiglitazone also caused a marked increase in the expression of several PPARγ target genes in adipose tissue including UCP-1 and CPT-1b (Fig. 1H). In line with previous data, an overall change in adipocyte size was observed after rosiglitazone treatment resulting in the appearance of smaller adipocytes (Fig. 1I and J). Rosiglitazone Treatment Promotes Macrophage Infiltration—Besides an increase in adipose mass, rosiglitazone treatment promoted formation of clusters of cells surrounding adipocytes, as revealed by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclear staining, suggesting the presence of cell aggregates (Fig. 2A). The clusters of cells strongly resembled so-called Crown-like structures that are formed by aggregated macrophages in adipose tissue of obese mice (7Cinti S. Mitchell G. Barbatelli G. Murano I. Ceresi E. Faloia E. Wang S. Fortier M. Greenberg A.S. Obin M.S. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 2347-2355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). To analyze if more macrophages were present in adipose tissue after rosiglitazone treatment, immunohistochemical staining using the specific macrophage marker F4/80+ was performed. As shown in Fig. 2B, rosiglitazone increased F4/80+ staining, suggesting more macrophages were present. These results were corroborated by quantitative analysis of the number of macrophages present in adipose tissue (Fig. 2C) and gene expression analysis of F4/80+ and CD68, another macrophage specific gene (Fig. 2D). In agreement with an increased macrophage content, expression of MCP-1 was up-regulated by rosiglitazone in total adipose tissue (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that short term rosiglitazone treatment stimulates macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue of obese mice. Noticeably, plasma concentrations of MCP-1 were not elevated after rosiglitazone treatment and even showed a tendency toward a decrease (data not shown), suggesting that MCP-1 expression is increased only locally. To examine the effect of rosiglitazone and the increased abundance of macrophages on global adipose gene expression, microarray analysis was performed in animals fed HFD with or without rosiglitazone. As expected, rosiglitazone significantly changed genes involved in lipid metabolism and energy production (Fig. 3). More surprisingly, cell cycle, tissue morphology, and connective tissue development were significantly altered after rosiglitazone treatment, suggesting changes in adipose tissue structure and composition. Rosiglitazone Increases Adipose Abundance of Alternatively Activated Macrophages—Macrophages can either be activated by T helper 1-type responses via interferon γ and by alternative activation via T helper 2-type cytokines. The latter response, which is stimulated by IL-4 and IL-13, elicits a macrophage phenotype connected with tissue repair and remodeling and blockage of inflammation (9Gordon S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (4782) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of rosiglitazone on adipose tissue macrophage polarization, the expression of several macrophage markers was determined in adipose tissue (Fig. 4). Strikingly, adipose expression of sIL-1ra, Clec7a, arginase 1, MSR1, and IL-10, which are markers characteristic of alternatively activated macrophages (9Gordon S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (4782) Google Scholar, 22Mills C.D. Kincaid K. Alt J.M. Heilman M.J. Hill A.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6166-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar, 23Martinez F.O. Gordon S. Locati M. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 7303-7311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar), were all significantly increased by rosiglitazone treatment. In contrast, expression of IL-18, a cytokine linked to the classical activation of macrophages via T helper 1 type responses (24Swain S.L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 11-14Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), was decreased by rosiglitazone. Expression levels of fibrinogen, serum amyloid A3, and IL-6 were also down-regulated by rosiglitazone, although the latter failed to reach statistical significance. Rosiglitazone did not alter adipose expression levels of CD11c, suggesting no change in the number of pro-inflammatory classically polarized macrophages (8Lumeng C.N. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the changes in total adipose tissue gene expression were specific for the stromal vascular fraction containing adipose tissue macrophages, adipose tissue from was fractionated into stromal vascular cells and adipocytes. As expected, leptin was predominantly expressed in the adipocyte fraction (Fig. 5A). In the stromal vascular fraction, rosiglitazone significantly up-regulated expression of arginase I and sIL-1ra (Fig. 5B). In contrast, rosiglitazone down-regulated expression of IL-18. Thus, changes in expression of markers genes observed in stromal vascular cells mirrored those in white adipose tissue. Taken together, these data suggest that rosiglitazone increases the presence of alternatively activated macrophages in adipose tissue. It has been reported that alternatively activated macrophages stimulate cell proliferation (9Gordon S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (4782) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, global analysis of gene expression by microarray indicated that rosiglitazone altered expression of genes related to cell cycle, proliferation, and tissue morphology (Fig. 3). Therefore, we analyzed expression levels of cyclin A2 and cyclin B in total white adipose tissue. Remarkably, expression of both genes was significantly increased by rosiglitazone, suggesting increased cell cycle progression in adipose tissue of obese mice after PPARγ activation (Fig. 5C). Conditioned Medium from Alternatively and PPARγ-activated Macrophages Deactivates the Inhibitory Effect of Macrophages on Adipogenesis—One week of rosiglitazone treatment was associated with a significant increase in adipose tissue mass yet decreased adipocyte size. To investigate whether the effect of rosiglitazone on adipose tissue morphology and size may be partially mediated via changes in the macrophage population, the effect of alternatively activated macrophages on adipogenesis was explored. The alternatively activated phenotype was elicited in vitro by treating RAW264.7 cells with IL-4, which induced arginase 1 and PPARγ expression (data not shown). In addition, RAW264.7 cells were treated with rosiglitazone. Subsequently, conditioned medium from RAW264.7 macrophages treated with either IL-4 and/or rosiglitazone was added to differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Medium from untreated macrophages strongly inhibited 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and expression of adipogenic marker genes compared with normal medium (data not shown). Remarkably, compared with conditioned medium from untreated RAW264.7 cells, medium from IL-4- or rosiglitazone-treated macrophages markedly enhanced 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 6A). An even more pronounced induction was observed using conditioned medium from macrophages treated with both IL-4 and rosiglitazone. The effect was accompanied by a significant increase in expression of adipogenic marker genes (Fig. 6B). These data suggest that rosiglitazone may deactivate the inhibitory effect of macrophages on adipocyte differentiation via a mechanism involving alternatively activated macrophages. Obesity is associated with the infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue, which may contribute to an elevated inflammatory status by secreting a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor α and IL-6. MCP-1 has been identified as an important chemo-attractant responsible for the recruitment of macrophages into adipose tissue (6Kanda H. Tateya S. Tamori Y. Kotani K. Hiasa K. Kitazawa R. Kitazawa S.

Charo I. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that PPARγ may counteract obesity-induced inflammation in adipose tissue via several mechanisms (26Stienstra R. Duval C. Müller M. Kersten S. PPAR Res. 2007; 2007: 95974-95984Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) including down-regulation of chemo-attractant and proinflammatory genes (5Xu H. Barnes G.T. Yang Q. Tan G. Yang D.

Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 2080-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and changing the morphology of adipose tissue toward smaller adipocytes (27Berthiaume M. Sell H. Lalonde J. Gelinas Y. Tchernof A. Richard D. Deshaies Y. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2004; 287: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast to previous studies, in our study treatment with rosiglitazone was associated with a marked increase in the number of macrophages present in adipose tissue, as evidenced by (immuno)histological staining and measurement of expression of macrophages markers genes. In support of these data, we found that rosiglitazone increased expression of MCP-1 in adipose tissue leading to an influx of monocytes and macrophages. This is in contrast to previously reported data showing a reduction of MCP-1 expression in adipocytes after PPARγ activation (28Bruun J.M. Lihn A.S. Pedersen S.B. Richelsen B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 2282-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). However, results in this study were obtained using isolated human whole adipose tissue. In addition, activation of PPARγ might have differential effects in obese versus lean animals. Whereas treatment of lean mice with rosiglitazone might reduce MCP-1 expression, short term PPARγ activation in obese animals might lead to increased MCP-1 expression and an influx of macrophages. These macrophages are possibly involved in remodeling of adipose tissue to accommodate the PPARγ-dependent influx of triglycerides originating from other tissues. Recently, it was reported that obesity leads to polarization of adipose-resident macrophages toward a M1 phenotype. M1-polarized macrophages secrete higher levels of pro-inflammatory genes and likely contribute to obesity-induced inflammation (8Lumeng C.N. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). The increased expression of arginase I and sIL-1ra and decreased expression of IL-18 in rosiglitazone-treated animals is indicative of re-polarization of adipose macrophages toward an M2 phenotype. In contrast to our results, MCP-1 has been reported to mainly attract M1-polarized macrophages (29Charo I.F. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 96-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it has been suggested that M1 and M2 macrophages can switch from one phenotype to another (9Gordon S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (4782) Google Scholar). The increased adipose expression of MCP-1 after rosiglitazone treatment might indeed lead to a higher influx of M1 macrophages. However, the local environment created by the activation of PPARγ might induce a switch from M1- toward M2-activated macrophages after infiltration of the adipose tissue. In as much as M2 or alternatively activated macrophages possess mainly anti-inflammatory properties, the switch in macrophage phenotype may be partially responsible for the suppression of inflammatory gene expression by rosiglitazone. It can be hypothesized that changes in macrophage population may contribute to PPARγ-dependent remodeling and expansion of adipose tissue. Alternatively activated macrophages have been linked to tissue repair and cell proliferation. Indeed, co-culture experiments have shown that alternatively activated macrophages can positively influence proliferation of neighboring cells (30Song E. Ouyang N. Horbelt M. Antus B. Wang M. Exton M.S. Cell Immunol. 2000; 204: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). According to our data, rosiglitazone altered expression of genes related to cell cycle, proliferation, and tissue morphology, including cyclin A2 and cyclin B. The increase in cell cycle-related genes is probably the result of increased numbers of alternatively activated macrophages in adipose tissue rather than direct stimulation of gene expression by PPARγ. Interestingly, we observed that conditioned medium from alternatively activated macrophages treated with rosiglitazone neutralized the inhibitory effect of conditioned medium from untreated macrophages on 3T3-L1 adipogenesis. Accordingly, it suggests that the rosiglitazone-induced switch from classical to alternatively activated macrophages may underlie the effects of rosiglitazone on adipose tissue remodeling and growth. PPARγ is well expressed in adipocytes and macrophages. From our study it is not possible to derive any conclusions regarding the role of macrophages versus adipocyte PPARγ in mediating the effect of rosiglitazone on total macrophage abundance as well as on macrophage polarization. While this manuscript was in preparation, two reports were published addressing the role of macrophage PPARγ in the development of obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance using macrophage-specific PPARγ knock-out mice (31Odegaard J.I. Ricardo-Gonzalez R.R. Goforth M.H. Morel C.R. Subramanian V. Mukundan L. Eagle A.R. Vats D. Brombacher F. Ferrante A.W. Chawla A. Nature. 2007; 447: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar, 32Hevener A.L. Olefsky J.M. Reichart D. Nguyen M.T. Bandyopadyhay G. Leung H.Y. Watt M.J. Benner C. Febbraio M.A. Nguyen A.K. Folian B. Subramaniam S. Gonzalez F.J. Glass C.K. Ricote M. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 1658-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). However, after HFD feeding the macrophage-specific PPARγ knock-out mice became more obese, fewer macrophages were present in adipose tissue (31Odegaard J.I. Ricardo-Gonzalez R.R. Goforth M.H. Morel C.R. Subramanian V. Mukundan L. Eagle A.R. Vats D. Brombacher F. Ferrante A.W. Chawla A. Nature. 2007; 447: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Supporting our data, expression of markers of alternatively activated macrophages in adipose tissue was strongly decreased in animals lacking PPARγ in macrophages, which likely accounted for the increase in inflammatory gene expression, including IL-6 and Nos2. Importantly, the absence of PPARγ in macrophages aggravated insulin resistance, especially after HFD. These data suggest that macrophage PPARγ plays a major role in determining macrophage polarization in adipose tissue, thereby suppressing production of inflammatory mediators as well as in mediating the effect of thiazolidinediones on insulin sensitivity. In contrast with previous data showing a decrease in adipose tissue macrophage content after long term rosiglitazone treatment due to apoptosis (19Bodles A.M. Varma V. Yao-Borengasser A. Phanavanh B. Peterson C.A. McGehee Jr., R.E. Rasouli N. Wabitsch M. Kern P.A. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 2080-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), our data suggest that short term treatment increases the adipose presence of alternatively activated macrophages. Future studies should address the effects of short versus long term rosiglitazone treatment. Whereas short term exposure to rosiglitazone induces macrophage infiltration, longer treatment might eventually lead to apoptosis of macrophages after successful PPARγ-dependent adipose tissue remodeling and expansion. In conclusion, we show that short term PPARγ activation in the context of HFD-induced obesity promotes macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue while simultaneously reducing inflammatory gene expression. The majority of the newly recruited macrophages is alternatively activated and may play an important role in PPARγ-dependent adipose tissue remodeling and expansion.

https://openalex.org/W2122561587,"Understanding the origins and evolution of synapses may provide insight into species diversity and the organization of the brain. Using comparative proteomics and genomics, we examined the evolution of the postsynaptic density (PSD) and membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK)-associated signaling complexes (MASCs) that underlie learning and memory. PSD and MASC orthologs found in yeast carry out basic cellular functions to regulate protein synthesis and structural plasticity. We observed marked changes in signaling complexity at the yeast-metazoan and invertebrate-vertebrate boundaries, with an expansion of key synaptic components, notably receptors, adhesion/cytoskeletal proteins and scaffold proteins. A proteomic comparison of Drosophila and mouse MASCs revealed species-specific adaptation with greater signaling complexity in mouse. Although synaptic components were conserved amongst diverse vertebrate species, mapping mRNA and protein expression in the mouse brain showed that vertebrate-specific components preferentially contributed to differences between brain regions. We propose that the evolution of synapse complexity around a core proto-synapse has contributed to invertebrate-vertebrate differences and to brain specialization."
https://openalex.org/W2032942434,"George Daley and colleagues show that ectopic Ras activation diverts embryonic stem cells towards trophoblastic fates, and conversely, that inhibition of MAPK signaling reduces trophectoderm outgrowth from embryo explants. These results implicate Ras-MAPK signaling in this early and critical cell fate decision. In blastocyst chimeras, embryonic stem (ES) cells contribute to embryonic tissues but not extraembryonic trophectoderm. Conditional activation of HRas1Q61L in ES cells in vitro induces the trophectoderm marker Cdx2 and enables derivation of trophoblast stem (TS) cell lines that, when injected into blastocysts, chimerize placental tissues. Erk2, the downstream effector of Ras–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, is asymmetrically expressed in the apical membranes of the 8-cell-stage embryo just before morula compaction. Inhibition of MAPK signaling in cultured mouse embryos compromises Cdx2 expression, delays blastocyst development and reduces trophectoderm outgrowth from embryo explants. These data show that ectopic Ras activation can divert ES cells toward extraembryonic trophoblastic fates and implicate Ras-MAPK signaling in promoting trophectoderm formation from mouse embryos."
https://openalex.org/W1971918585,"Our previous data have shown that in L929 mouse fibroblasts the control of methylation pattern depends in part on poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and that ADP-ribose polymers (PARs), both present on poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 and/or protein-free, have an inhibitory effect on Dnmt1 activity. Here we show that transient ectopic overexpression of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) induces PAR accumulation, PARP-1, and CTCF poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the same mouse fibroblasts. The persistence in time of a high PAR level affects the DNA methylation machinery; the DNA methyltransferase activity is inhibited with consequences for the methylation state of genome, which becomes diffusely hypomethylated affecting centromeric minor satellite and B1 DNA repeats. In vitro data show that CTCF is able to activate PARP-1 automodification even in the absence of nicked DNA. Our new finding that CTCF is able per se to activate PARP-1 automodification in vitro is of great interest as so far a burst of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 has generally been found following introduction of DNA strand breaks. CTCF is unable to inhibit DNMT1 activity, whereas poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 plays this inhibitory role. These data suggest that CTCF is involved in the cross-talk between poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and DNA methylation and underscore the importance of a rapid reversal of PARP activity, as DNA methylation pattern is responsible for an important epigenetic code."

Taken together, our analyses illuminate a new pathway by which CHD3 remodelers contribute to repression in eukaryotes. The transition from inert seed to growing seedling marks the culmination of a remarkable transformation in developmental identity and transcriptional programs. During seed formation, numerous genes are expressed that contribute to establishment of the body plan, laying down of storage reserves, and desiccation tolerance (1Girke T. Todd J. Ruuska S. White J. Benning C. Ohlrogge J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1570-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 2Ruuska S.A. Girke T. Benning C. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1191-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Many of these genes are widely expressed in the developing seed only to be silenced by the time the seed germinates, often for the remainder of the life cycle of the plant (3Schmid M. Davison T.S.

Although several key regulators have been identified that activate various seed transcriptional programs, such as the LEAFY COTY-LEDON (LEC) genes and ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3) (4To A.

This repression is critical for subsequent stages of plant development. In particular, continued expression of LEC genes leads to continued expression of seed-specific programs and substantial alteration of seedling development (6Stone S.L. Kwong L.W. Yee K.M.

PICKLE (PKL) has previously been shown to play a significant role in repression of seed-associated genes. In pkl plants, many seed-associated traits continue to be expressed after germination, including accumulation of seed storage reserves and the ability to undergo somatic embryogenesis (9Ogas J.

This complex includes several other proteins, including a methyl CpG-binding protein and a histone deacetylase, suggesting that animal CHD3 proteins play an important role in allowing DNA methylation and histone deacetylation to coordinately contribute to transcriptional repression (17Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Genetic characterization of mutants that are deficient for CHD3 in several model systems is consistent with a role for CHD3 proteins in repression of transcription in animals, often of developmentally regulated genes (18Hall J.A.

In Arabidopsis, loss of PKL leads to elevated expression of seed-specific genes, including the LEC genes LEC1, LEC2, and FUS3, indicating that CHD3 proteins also act to repress transcription in plants (12Ogas J.

Partial inhibition of GA biosynthesis in pkl seedlings substantially enhances expression of embryonic traits, in particular the expression of the pickle root phenotype (9Ogas J. Cheng J.C. Sung Z.R.

Inhibition of GA biosynthesis during the latter portion of germination of pkl seedlings is sufficient to enhance expression of the pickle root phenotype, whereas inhibition immediately after seed wetting or after germination of the seed has no detectable effect (9Ogas J. Cheng J.C. Sung Z.R. Somerville C. Science. 1997; 277: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Similarly, use of a hormone-inducible PKL-GR fusion reveals that activation of PKL during germination is sufficient to repress expression of the pickle root phenotype in PKL-GR seedlings, whereas activation during seed maturation or after seed germination is ineffective (23Li H.C. Chuang K. Henderson J.T. Rider Jr., S.D. Bai Y. Zhang H. Fountain M. Gerber J. Ogas J. Plant J. 2005; 44: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These analyses reveal a specific developmental window during which PKL and GA act concurrently to repress expression of seed-associated developmental programs. gibberellin 5-aza-2-deoxycytosine generalized family wise error rate trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 quantitative reverse transcription chromatin immunoprecipitation histone methyltransferase wild type. A previous microarray analysis of germinating pkl seedlings identified several PKL-dependent genes and suggested that PKL and GA might act together to repress expression of seed-associated genes (20Rider S.D. Henderson J.T. Jerome R.E. Edenberg H.J. Romero-Severson J. Ogas J. Plant J. 2003; 35: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 24Muir W.M. Romero-Severson J. Rider Jr., S.D. Simons A. Ogas J. J. Data Sci. 2006; 4: 323-341PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis was carried out in germinating seedlings well before emergence of the radicle (root). In light of progress in our understanding of when PKL and GA act, we have undertaken a new microarray analysis of gene expression at a later stage of germination of pkl seedlings. This analysis reveals that PKL and GA act synergistically to repress expression of seed-associated genes via separate pathways. Furthermore, comparison of our expression data with data from other genomic analyses reveals a substantial overlap between PKL-dependent genes and genes that are enriched for trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), an epigenetic mark that is thought to play a substantial role in silencing of genes that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner in plants (25Zhang X. Clarenz O. Cokus S. Bernatavichute Y.V. Pellegrini M. Goodrich J. Jacobsen S.E. Plos Biol. 2007; 5: e129Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Analysis of H3K27me3 levels at several loci reveals that this mark is decreased in the absence of PKL, suggesting that PKL plays a role in deposition and/or maintenance of H3K27me3 in plants. Plant Material and Growth Conditions—Wild type and pkl-1 (9Ogas J. Cheng J.C. Sung Z.R. Somerville C. Science. 1997; 277: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) are in the Col background. Seeds used in these studies were obtained from wild-type and pkl plants grown in parallel in a CU36L5 incubator (Percival Scientific) under 24 h of illumination. Seeds were allowed to dry at least a month on the plant prior to collection. No other treatment was applied (i.e. stratification) prior to use of the seeds. For the studies described here, plants were incubated on synthetic media (9Ogas J. Cheng J.C. Sung Z.R. Somerville C. Science. 1997; 277: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and grown in a CU36L5 incubator under 24 h of illumination. Prior to use, seed lots were confirmed to exhibit >98% germination in 3 days and <6 h difference in time to 50% germination under the conditions described above. For all analyses during germination (microarray, qRT-PCR, and ChIP), seeds were sown at a density of 100 mg of seeds (∼3000 seeds) per 150-mm diameter Petri dish. The media were supplemented with 10-8 m uniconazole-P or solvent alone (0.01% methanol final concentration). This concentration of uniconazole-P was selected based on prior dose-response analyses that examined the effect of uniconazole-P on pickle root penetrance and germination rate (9Ogas J. Cheng J.C. Sung Z.R. Somerville C. Science. 1997; 277: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Samples were collected when 50% of the seeds had germinated. Length of time after seed imbibition to achieve 50% germination was 40.8 h for wild-type seeds imbibed in the absence of uniconazole-P, 43.2 h for wild-type seeds imbibed in the presence of uniconazole-P, 40.1 h for pkl seeds imbibed in the absence of uniconazole-P, and 45.5 h for pkl seeds imbibed in the presence of uniconazole-P. Alternatively, whole plants were collected 14 days post-imbibition for both ChIP and expression analysis (Fig. 7). For RNA used for microarray analysis and subsequent qRT-PCR analysis, an aliquot of seeds from each sample was saved so that the extent of germination and pickle root penetrance could be determined for each treatment. Greater than 99% of the seeds germinated for all treatments. Pickle root penetrance increased from 1.9% on MS media to 43.5% on MS media supplemented with uniconazole-P. RNA Isolation and Analysis—Total RNA was isolated as described previously (26Verwoerd T.C. Dekker B.M. Hoekema A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). All subsequent experimental manipulations for microarray analysis were carried out as per the manufacturer’s instructions as described previously (20Rider S.D. Henderson J.T. Jerome R.E. Edenberg H.J. Romero-Severson J. Ogas J. Plant J. 2003; 35: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), with the modifications that Affymetrix ATH1 Gene Chips (Arabidopsis Genome Array, catalog number 900385) were used, and hybridization data were analyzed with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite version 5.0 software. Quantitative PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems), as described previously (23Li H.C. Chuang K. Henderson J.T. Rider Jr., S.D. Bai Y. Zhang H. Fountain M. Gerber J. Ogas J. Plant J. 2005; 44: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotide primer sequences and primer concentrations used and the critical threshold values for the figures presented can be found in the supplemental material. Statistical Analysis and Archiving of Array Data—Experiment-wise type I error rate (false-positives) was controlled using the generalized family-wise error rate methodology, GFWER(k), of Muir et al. (24Muir W.M. Romero-Severson J. Rider Jr., S.D. Simons A. Ogas J. J. Data Sci. 2006; 4: 323-341PubMed Google Scholar) because type II errors (false-negatives) were seen as important as type I. The GFWER(k) is defined as the probability of making k or more type I errors at a given level of p. The GFWER(k) does not attempt to project a false discovery rate, rather, it only sets the maximum number of false-positives under the null hypothesis at a given level of p. We set k = 1 and p = 0.05, allowing a 5% chance of 1 or more false-positives across the experiment. Shannon entropy was calculated based on formulas given by Schug et al. (31Schug J. Schuller W.P. Kappen C. Salbaum J.M. Bucan M. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution and significance of the Hg and Qg statistics were based on 1,000 permutations of the data (27Churchill G.A. Doerge R.W. Genetics. 1994; 138: 963-971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Developmental samples from AtGenExpress (3Schmid M. Davison T.S. Henz S.R. Pape U.J. Demar M. Vingron M. Scholkopf B. Weigel D. Lohmann J.U. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar) used for determination of tissue specificity are found in supplemental Table S10. A 2 × 2 χ2 test was applied to each treatment to determine whether the effects of pkl and uniconazole were independent. The number of genes found significant were classified into four categories as up- or down-regulated by either PKL or uniconazole-P. The expected number in each cell, under the assumption of independence, was found by taking the product of the marginal totals divided by the grand total. The χ2 was then computed as the sum of the squared deviations between the observed and expected numbers divided by the expected. Significance was determined by comparison to the critical value χ2 with 1 degree of freedom. A 2 × 2 χ2 test was similarly applied to determine the independence of the effects of pkl and tissue specificity (Fig. 5), uniconazole-P and tissue specificity (Fig. 5), and pkl and other remodeling pathways (Fig. 6). All values used in these χ2 analyses are found in Tables S11 and S12. The complete array data set has been deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) of NCBI, accession number GSE11852.FIGURE 6Genes that exhibit strongly elevated expression in the absence of PKL are frequently targets of H3K27me3. χ2 analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”) was used to examine the intersection of genes linked to a remodeling pathway (x axis) and genes that exhibit increased expression in response to pkl according to distinct selection criteria (y axis). The percent of genes that exhibit increased expression in pkl plants that are associated with each intersection is represented on the z axis. The expected values category on the y axis indicates the percentage of pkl-dependent genes expected to found in the intersection of the compared sets of genes. A green bar denotes more genes observed in common between the two sets than expected (at p < 1 × 10-4), whereas a red bar denotes fewer genes observed than expected (at p < 1 × 10-4). In x axis categories, C denotes ChIP-chip data, and M denotes microarray-derived expression data.

Many Genes Exhibit Both PKL- and GA-dependent Repression during Late Germination—Although inhibition of GA biosynthesis substantially increases penetrance of the pickle root phenotype (9Ogas J. Cheng J.C. Sung Z.R. Somerville C. Science. 1997; 277: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which this effect occurs has been unclear. Inhibition of GA biosynthesis in pkl seedlings via application of the chemical inhibitor uniconazole-P was previously observed to have no detectable effect on the transcript level of the seed master regulators LEC1 and LEC2 in pkl seedlings (20Rider S.D. Henderson J.T. Jerome R.E. Edenberg H.J. Romero-Severson J. Ogas J. Plant J. 2003; 35: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These prior analyses of LEC1 and LEC2 transcript levels were undertaken early during germination, when the testa (seed coat) had started rupturing, but well before emergence of the radicle (20Rider S.D. Henderson J.T. Jerome R.E. Edenberg H.J. Romero-Severson J. Ogas J. Plant J. 2003; 35: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Given that PKL and GA largely act during later stages of germination to prevent expression of seed traits (9Ogas J. Cheng J.C. Sung Z.R. Somerville C. Science. 1997; 277: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 23Li H.C. Chuang K. Henderson J.T. Rider Jr., S.D. Bai Y. Zhang H. Fountain M. Gerber J. Ogas J. Plant J. 2005; 44: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we examined transcript levels of LEC1 and LEC2 in wild-type and pkl seedlings grown in the absence or presence of 10-8 m uniconazole-P developmentally staged at 50% germination (i.e. such that 50% of the seeds had radicles that protruded through the testa). We undertook this analysis at a point in development rather than a specific time after imbibition in recognition of the fact that inhibition of GA biosynthesis delays germination and the observation that the transcript levels of many genes change as a function of the stage of germination (29Ogawa M. Hanada A. Yamauchi Y. Kuwahara A. Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi S. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). We observed that the transcript levels of LEC1 and LEC2 genes were increased in pkl seedlings by the application of uniconazole-P (Fig. 1). Treatment of wild-type seedlings with uniconazole-P had no detectable effect on expression of these genes. These data were consistent with previous observations that treatment with uniconazole-P could increase the penetrance of the pickle root phenotype in pkl plants, but could not cause expression of the pickle root phenotype in wild-type plants (9Ogas J. Cheng J.C. Sung Z.R. Somerville C. Science. 1997; 277: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These data thus raised the possibility that treatment of germinating pkl seedlings with uniconazole-P results in increased penetrance of the pickle root phenotype as a result of increased transcript levels of LEC1, LEC2, and similar seed-associated transcripts. These results suggested that microarray analysis of gene expression at this point in development could clarify the mechanism by which treatment with uniconazole-P increases pickle root penetrance and identify additional genes that contribute to the expression of embryonic traits in pkl seedlings. We used Affymetrix GeneChip ATH1 arrays to query the transcriptome in pkl and wild-type seeds imbibed in the presence or absence of 10-8 m uniconazole-P. The microarray experimental design thus consisted of four treatments: untreated wild type (WT), untreated pkl mutant (pkl), uniconazole-P-treated wild type, and uniconazole-P-treated pkl mutant. Each treatment was collected when 50% of the seeds in that sample had germinated. We used six biological replicates per treatment, thus allowing us to set a strict criterion by which to call a gene differentially expressed. We analyzed our data using an analysis of variance-based approach, GFWER(k) (24Muir W.M. Romero-Severson J. Rider Jr., S.D. Simons A. Ogas J. J. Data Sci. 2006; 4: 323-341PubMed Google Scholar), and identified differentially expressed genes with the criterion that there was a 95% chance that there was one or fewer false positives included in the entire group. These selection conditions will be referred to subsequently as GFWER(1,0.05). Using this selection criterion, 1026 genes exhibit increased transcript levels in response to the pkl mutation whereas only 695 genes exhibit decreased transcript levels (Fig. 2). We also identified 1301 genes that exhibit increased transcript levels in response to uniconazole-P treatment and 1100 genes that exhibit decreased transcript levels. qRT-PCR analysis was used to confirm that we had identified genes that exhibited increased transcript levels in response to pkl or uniconazole and that that the effect of uniconazole was reversed by application of GA (supplemental Tables S2, S3, and S4). LEC1 and LEC2 were not identified by our array analysis despite the fact that both are represented on the ATH1 array and that both exhibit robust PKL- and uniconazole-dependent expression during this point in development (Fig. 1). LEC2 was identified, however, if array data were sorted on the basis of absence/presence calls as determined by the Affymetrix analysis software (see “Experimental Procedures”). This analysis revealed that LEC2 was called present in all six replicates of pkl treated with uniconazole-P and called absent in all other replicates of all other treatments. This behavior was consistent with our finding that expression of LEC2 was greatest in uniconazole-treated pkl seedlings (Fig. 1). We queried the array data set for genes that were regulated similarly to LEC2 on the basis of absence/presence calls and identified eight other loci that were expressed similarly to LEC2 (Table 1). 7 of these 8 genes, however, were also identified using GFWER(1,0.05) indicating that this approach successfully identified the majority of genes exhibiting this type of expression. In contrast to LEC2, LEC1 was not called present under any condition. Taken together, these observations indicate that our analyses are sufficient to identify some, but not all, of the genes that exhibit PKL-dependent expression, including genes that are expressed at low levels such as LEC2.TABLE 1LEC2 is among 8 genes identified on the basis of absence/presence calls by Affymetrix software 8 genes (identified by AGI code and by common gene name) exhibit the following type of expression behavior: called absent on all six biological replicates of WT, uniconazole-P treated wild type, and pkl and called present on all six biological replicates of upkl. 6 of 8 of these genes are also identified by GFWER(1,0.05).AGIGeneIdentified by GFWER(k)?At1g05510YesAt1g17810β-TIPYesAt1g21520YesAt1g28300LEC2NoAt3g26740CCLYesAt4g04630YesAt4g09610GASA2YesAt5g45690YesAt5g63750No Open table in a new tab PKL and GA Affect Gene Expression through Separate Pathways—It has previously been noted that pkl plants exhibit the phenotypic hallmarks of GA-deficient plants, leading to the proposal that GA acts to promote PKL activity (9Ogas J. Cheng J.C. Sung Z.R. Somerville C. Science. 1997; 277: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 30Henderson J.T. Li H.C. Rider S.D. Mordhorst A.P. Romero-Severson J. Cheng J.C. Robey J. Sung Z.R. De Vries S.C. Ogas J. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 995-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). If this hypothesis is true, one might expect expression of genes to be commonly affected by mutation of PKL and by application of uniconazole-P. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that significantly more genes were commonly up-regulated (χ2 = 1,207.7, p = 1 × 10-264) or down-regulated (χ2 = 579.0, p = 6 × 10-128) by mutation of PKL or by application of uniconazole-P than would have been expected by chance (Fig. 2). In particular, >30% (312 of 1026) of the genes that exhibit increased expression in response to pkl also exhibit increased expression in response to the presence of uniconazole-P, whereas only 5.7% would have been expected by chance. Thus, these data strongly support the idea that PKL and GA act in common to affect expression of genes during germination. Three possible genetic models depicting the effect of PKL and GA on gene expression that are consistent with previous characterization of pkl and GA signaling mutants are shown in Fig. 3. In brief, the ability of GA to affect gene expression could be entirely directed through PKL (model 1), PKL and GA could act through separate pathways to affect gene expression (model 2), or GA could act concurrently through distinct PKL-dependent and PKL-independent pathways to affect gene expression (model 3). We examined the array data to determine how PKL and uniconazole interact to effect gene expression in an effort to distinguish among these three models. It has previously been demonstrated that although pkl-1 is not a protein null, it behaves as a phenotypic null (12Ogas J. Kaufmann S. Henderson J. Somerville C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13839-13844Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 23Li H.C. Chuang K. Henderson J.T. Rider Jr., S.D. Bai Y. Zhang H. Fountain M. Gerber J. Ogas J. Plant J. 2005; 44: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As a result, a strong genetic prediction of model 1 is that the expression levels of genes commonly affected by GA and PKL should be uniconazole-independent in a pkl-1 background. Instead, we found that for all 480 genes commonly up-regulated or down-regulated by pkl and uniconazole-P, the application of uniconazole-P to pkl seedlings resulted in enhanced differential expression relative to wild type in comparison with untreated pkl seedlings (supplemental Table S5). Thus these data rule out model 1 and indicate that PKL and GA act through separate pathways to affect gene expression. Additional support for separate pathways was provided by analysis of synergistic interactions between PKL and uniconazole-P. A t test for intera"

MCF-7 breast tumor cells express little or no sigma-1R and were used here to investigate the effect of receptor overexpression and the role of its N- and C-terminal segments in function. We stably expressed intact sigma-1R (amino acids (aa) 1–223; lines 11 and 41), N-fragment (aa 1–100; line K3), or C-fragment (aa 102–223; line sg101). C-fragment expressed as a peripheral membrane-bound protein that was removable from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by chaotropic salt wash, consistent with lack of a putative transmembrane domain. The expressed sigma-1R, N-fragment, and C-fragment exhibited normal, low affinity, and no [3H](+)-pentazocine binding activity, respectively. All transfected lines showed constitutive enhancement of bradykinin (BDK)-induced calcium release, because of a decrease in BDK ED50 values. Interestingly, sigma-1R and C-fragment had high activities, whereas the N-fragment was much less active. The antagonist BD1063 behaved as an inverse agonist in sigma-1R cells, whereas C-fragment was insensitive to ligand regulation. Like BDK, vasopressin- and ATP-induced calcium release was enhanced with the same pattern in cell lines. Anti-IP3R-3 immunoprecipitates from cells expressing sigma-1R or C-fragment contained significantly less ANK 220 compared with untransfected or N-fragment cells, indicating a higher amount of ankyrin-free IP3R-3. Anti-ankyrin B immunoprecipitates contained sigma-1R or C-fragment, with markedly lower levels of N-fragment present. These results suggest that sigma-1R overexpression drives sigma agonist-independent dissociation of ANK 220 from IP3R-3, resulting in activation. The C-terminal segment plays a key role in the interaction.

Sigma receptors comprise a unique, pharmacologically defined family of proteins that bind psychotropic agents from a variety of structural classes (1Sharkey J. Glen K.A. Wolfe S. Kuhar M.J. Eur. J.

Sigma receptors are not only expressed in the brain and central nervous system, but are also expressed in peripheral tissues, including liver, kidney, heart, gut, and tissues of the immune and endocrine systems (6Walker J.M. Bowen W.D. Walker F.O. Matsumoto R.R. de Costa B.R. Rice K.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1990; 42: 355-402PubMed Google Scholar). They are also highly expressed in tumor cell lines derived from various tissues (7Vilner B.J. John C.S. Bowen W.D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 408-413PubMed Google Scholar). Sigma receptors have thus far been divided into sigma-1 and sigma-2 subtypes (4Quirion R. Bowen W.D. Itzhak Y. Junien J.L. Musacchio J.M. Rothman R.B. Su T.-P. Tam S.W. Taylor D.P. Trends Pharmacol.

They are noted for having high affinities for haloperidol and other typical antipsychotic agents, but they can be distinguished pharmacologically by differential affinity for dextrorotary benzomorphans, with sigma-1 receptors having high affinity and sigma-2 receptors having low to negligible affinity for these compounds (8Hellewell S.B.

Sigma-1 receptors are 25-kDa proteins that have been cloned and are distant homologs to the sterol isomerase enzyme of yeast and other fungi (10Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Flandorfer A. Knaus H.G. Striessnig J. Kempner E. Glossmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Although lacking enzymatic activity, sigma-1 receptors share some pharmacology with this enzyme. No endogenous ligands have been conclusively demonstrated for sigma receptors. However, there is significant evidence that such substances exist and that they may be related to sterols (2Su T.-P. London E.D. Jaffe J.H. Science. 1988; 240: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Calcium ion (Ca2+) serves as an important intracellular signal for myriad cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation, regulation of gene expression, and cellular stimulus-secretion coupling (11Clapham D.E.

It is also known that calcium ion is toxic to cells and is involved in the triggering of events leading to apoptosis in various cell types (13Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P.

Therefore, a coordinated control of the processes that alter the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) 2The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]i, cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3R, IP3 receptors; IP3R-1, IP3 receptor type 1; IP3R-3, IP3R type 3; ANK, ankyrin B; BDK, bradykinin; PTZ, (+)-pentazocine; empty vector, pcDNA3.1(–) vector without insertions; BD1063, 1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-4-methylpiperazine; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; aa, amino acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SBDL, steroid binding domain-like; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptors; RT, reverse transcription. is necessary to maintain cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Ca2+ can be released from intracellular storage pools by certain signals such as electrical stimulation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and by activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum. Stimulation of G protein-coupled hormone or neurotransmitter receptors activates phospholipase-C, which catalyzes production of IP3 and diacylglycerol. IP3 binds to IP3 receptors (IP3R) and mediates Ca2+ release from the intracellular Ca2+ stores in endoplasmic reticulum (11Clapham D.E.

The IP3R is regulated by a vast number of interacting proteins, including calmodulin, CaBP1, kinases, phosphatases, and components of the cytoskeleton (16Bezprozvanny I. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have shown that sigma receptors are involved in the regulation of [Ca2+]i. Sigma ligands from various structural classes produce a dual modulation of [Ca2+]i as follows: release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and blockade of depolarization-dependent influx of Ca2+ (17Vilner B.J. Bowen W.D. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1995; 21: 1608Google Scholar, 18Vilner B.J. Bowen W.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 900-911PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhang H. Cuevas J. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 2867-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Sigma-1 receptor ligands affect intrasynaptosomal free Ca2+ levels and protein phosphorylation in rat brain (20Brent P.J. Herd L. Saunders H. Sim A.T. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2201-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Exposure of cardiac myocytes to sigma ligands was found to affect contractility, Ca2+ influx, and beating rate (21Ela C. Barg J. Vogel Z. Hasin Y. Eilam Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 269: 1300-1309PubMed Google Scholar). Ankyrins are a family of membrane adaptor proteins required for the localization of diverse ion channels, transporters, calcium-release channels, and cell adhesion molecules to specialized membrane domains (22Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). The ankyrin family is composed of ankyrin R, ankyrin B, and ankyrin G. Ankyrin B is required for the localization of the IP3 receptor, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, and Na/K-ATPase to transverse-tubule/sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes in heart (23Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Le Marec H. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Ankyrin has high affinity binding to the C terminus of IP3R, with a Kd of 0.2 nm. The binding of ankyrin inhibits IP3 binding and IP3-induced internal Ca2+ release (24Bourguignon L.Y. Jin H. J. Biol.

Neuropsychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 1989; 1: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) in NG-108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells (26Hayashi T. Su T.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Sigma-1 agonists such as (+)-pentazocine and PRE-084 caused the dissociation of an ankyrin B isoform (ankyrin B 220) from IP3R-3, thus relieving the IP3R inhibition and enhancing calcium release induced by a given concentration of bradykinin (BDK), a phosphoinositide agonist that generates IP3 in these cells (26Hayashi T. Su T.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This was blocked by a sigma-1 antagonist, which correlates excellently with mediation by sigma-1 receptors (26Hayashi T. Su T.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular architecture of the trimeric complex of sigma-1 receptor, ankyrin B, and IP3R-3. Aydar et al. (27Aydar E. Palmer C.P. Klyachko V.A. Jackson M.B. Neuron. 2002; 34: 399-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) recently proposed a model for the sigma-1 receptor that includes two transmembrane domains, an extracellular loop, and intracellular N and C termini with the C-terminal region being a large soluble domain. The second transmembrane domain and the putative cytoplasmic C-terminal domain contain residues important for binding of the agonist (+)-pentazocine (28Yamamoto H. Miura R. Yamamoto T. Shinohara K. Watanabe M. Okuyama S. Nakazato A. Nukada T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Based on this structural model, we are investigating the functional domains of the sigma-1 receptor by making deletions of large segments of the receptor, transfecting cells to create stably expressing lines, and subsequently probing the ability of sigma-1 agonists and antagonists to modulate BDK-induced calcium release. Human MCF-7 breast tumor cells do not normally express sigma-1 receptors or express at very low levels but do express BDK receptors coupled to phosphoinositide turnover (7Vilner B.J. John C.S. Bowen W.D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 408-413PubMed Google Scholar, 29Greco S. Storelli C. Marsigliante S. J. Endocrinol. 2006; 188: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Frey B.M. Reber B.F.X. Vishwanath B.S. Escher G. Frey F.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2235-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used this as a model system in which to investigate sigma-1 receptor structure-function relationships. We made two deletion constructs where the C-terminal portion or the N-terminal portion was deleted, and we compared the function of these constructs to that of the wild-type sigma-1 receptor. Construction of Expression Vectors Harboring Intact Sigma-1 Receptor or Truncated Sequences—All sequences were for the human sigma-1 receptor (GenBank™ accession number BC004899.2). Two constructs were used for the intact sigma-1 receptor. Construct 11 (to produce cell line 11) is the wild-type sequence identical to the human sigma-1 sequence (aa 1–223). Construct 41 (to produce cell line 41) is the wild-type sequence with a Kozak modification for enhanced expression, where glutamine at position 2 is replaced by glutamic acid (31Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). Two deletion constructs were used. Construct K3 (to produce cell line K3) is an N-terminal construct, containing the Kozak modification and with the C-terminal region deleted (aa 1–100). Construct sg101 (to produce cell line sg101) is a C-terminal construct with the N-terminal region deleted (aa 102–223). The predicted topographies of the products of the constructs are shown schematically in Fig. 1, based on the model of Aydar et al. (27Aydar E. Palmer C.P. Klyachko V.A. Jackson M.B. Neuron. 2002; 34: 399-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Vectors containing the human sigma-1 DNA sequence were purchased from ATCC (catalog number MGC-3851). Sigma-1 DNA sequences were amplified by PCR (iCycler, Bio-Rad) using the specific 5′- and 3′-primers of sigma-1 receptor sequence shown in Table 1. PCR was run using 1 μl of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), 10 pmol of the appropriate 5′- and 3′-primers, 1 μl of dNTPs (10 mm for each nucleotide) in a final volume of 50 μl of regular buffer reaction mixture under the following conditions: preincubation at 94 °C for 4 min, run for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 1 min, extension at 68 °C for 10 min. The PCR amplification products were purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen), digested with XhoI and BamHI (New England Biolabs), and separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel. The DNA was isolated from the gel bands using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The digested DNA segments were ligated with the purified XhoI- and BamHI-digested pcDNA3.1(–) vector (Invitrogen) in the sense orientation. One Shot® Top10 chemically competent Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with the constructs described above and the vectors amplified. The inserted parts of the plasmids were sequenced to verify that the copies of the target sigma-1 DNA sequences were completely identical to those in the GenBank™ data base for the given segment of the receptor.TABLE 1Primers used for amplifying wild-type or truncated DNA sequences of the human sigma-1 receptorCell line5′-Primer3′-Primer115′-GCCCCTCGAGATGCAGTGGGCCGTG3′5′-GCCTGGATCCTCAAGGGTCCTGGCCAAAG3′415′-GCCCCTCGAGATGGAGTGGGCCGTG3′5′-GCCTGGATCCTCAAGGGTCCTGGCCAAAG3′K35′-GCCCCTCGAGATGGAGTGGGCCGTG3′5′-GCCTGGATCCTCACAGCGAGGCGTGCAGAAG3′sg1015′-GCCACTCGAGATGGAGTATGTGCTGCTCTTCG3′5′-GCCTGGATCCTCAAGGGTCCTGGCCAAAG3′ Open table in a new tab Cell Culturing and Production of Stably Transfected Cell Lines—Human MCF-7 breast tumor cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 1.5 g/liter NaHCO3, 10% fetal bovine serum, insulin (10 mg/liter), and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/100 μg/ml). All cell culture processes were carried out in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. To develop stably expressing cell lines, cells were plated at a density of 3 × 103 cells in 3 ml of growth medium in 35 × 10-mm Petri dishes, without antibiotics, and incubated overnight. Cells were then transfected overnight with 2.4 μg of the linearized pcDNA3.1(–) vector containing the target sigma-1 DNA sequence, as per standard protocol using Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM® I medium without serum (Invitrogen). Vector-expressing cells were selected using geneticin by the following procedure. After transfection, cells were placed in normal DMEM growth medium. After 3 days, cells were detached with trypsin and replated into DMEM containing geneticin (350 μg/ml) and cultured for 25 days. Surviving cell clones were picked out and propagated separately in 35-mm dishes in the same medium, with 175 μg/ml geneticin. To suppress reversion of the phenotype, all subsequent cell culture was carried out in DMEM as described above, supplemented with 175 μg/ml geneticin. Screening Transfected Cell Lines for Expression of Target Sigma-1 Receptor Sequences—Total RNA was extracted from cells by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (32Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. McDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Quality was controlled by running 1 μg on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel. Two μg of DNA-free total RNA, together with 10 pmol of 3′-primer complementary to parts of sigma-1 DNA sequence (5′-GCCTGGATCCTCAAGGGTCCTGGCCAAAG-3′ for mRNA derived from cell lines 11, 41, and sg101; 5′-AGCGAGGCGTGCAGAAG-3′ for that from cell line K3) in a 12-μl volume was denatured at 70 °C for 10 min and then chilled on ice for 2 min. Two μl of first-strand buffer, 0.1 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 1 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, and 1 μl of dNTPs were added. Transcription was started by adding 1 μl of reverse transcriptase (SuperScript™ II, Invitrogen) per reaction, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 5 min and then 50 °C for 45 min. Finally, the reaction was inactivated by heating samples to 70 °C for 15 min. For PCR, 2 μl of reverse-transcribed cDNA and 1 μl of dNTPs (10 mm for each nucleotide) were added to 47 μl of conventional buffer mixture containing 10 pmol of the appropriate 5′ and 3′ cDNA primers as shown in Table 2, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Promega). PCR was carried out by iCycler (Bio-Rad) as follows: preincubate at 94 °C for 4 min, run for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Ten μl of each PCR were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel.

Cells were then harvested by centrifuging, then resuspended with cold 1× PBS buffer, and harvested again. The supernatant was removed, and 0.5 ml of CelLytic™ cell lysis reagent (Sigma) per flask was added. The cells were homogenized by probe sonication for 3–5 s in an ice bath. The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,515 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and stored at –80 °C until use. Protein was determined using BCA assay (Pierce). About 30 μg of total proteins was loaded on duplicate 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subsequently blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Following blocking in 5% milk in PBS-T buffer (PBS with 0.2% Tween 20) for 2 h, each blot was incubated with one of the following two goat polyclonal anti-sigma receptor antibodies for 2.5 h. Goat anti-sigma-1 receptor antibody directed against a C-terminal epitope was used to probe for the intact sigma-1 receptor and the C-terminal fragment (Santa Cruz Biotechnology S-18; epitope within aa 140–200). This antibody was used at dilution 1:1000 to detect intact sigma-1 receptor and 1:100 to detect the C-terminal fragment. Goat anti-sigma-1 receptor antibody directed against an N-terminal epitope was used to probe for the N-terminal fragment (Santa Cruz Biotechnology L-20; epitope within aa 50–100). This antibody was used at dilution 1:200. The blot was then washed with PBS-T buffer briefly and incubated with a donkey anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 40 min. The Super-Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce) was used to visualize the stained sigma-1 receptor using a Kodak Image Station 2000R. The bands were compared with protein markers of known molecular size run in parallel on the same SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were cultured and harvested as described above and then homogenized in an ice bath by probe sonication for 3–5 s in 500 μl 1% Triton X-100 in IP buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.4)) with a proteinase inhibitor mixture (CytoSignal, Irvine, CA). The homogenate was spun twice at 14,515 × g for 15 min at 4 °C in microtubes, and the supernatant was removed and split into two 100- and 400-μl portions. Mouse anti-ankyrin B antibody or anti-IP3R-3 antibody (5 μg) (Pharmingen) was added to the 400-μl sample but not to the 100-μl sample (preimmunoprecipitate). Samples were incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The immunoprecipitation was processed using an IMMUNOcatcher kit (CytoSignal, Irvine, CA). The immunoprecipitate and the preimmunoprecipitate samples were run on duplicate 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subsequently blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were analyzed by the same procedure described above, except using a mouse anti-IP3R type 3 antibody (1:800) or mouse anti-ankyrin B antibody (1:150) (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), on the anti-IP3R-3 immunoprecipitate. On the anti-ankyrin B immunoprecipitate, one of the two anti-sigma-1 receptor antibodies described above was used to detect the presence of intact sigma-1 receptor and the N- and C-terminal fragments. The C-terminal antibody was used at 1:100, whereas the N-terminal antibody was used at 1:200 dilution. Rabbit preimmune serum was omitted in the anti-ankyrin B immunoprecipitate studies to prevent masking of the sigma-1 receptor by a rabbit serum protein of similar molecular weight. Measurement of Cytosolic Free Calcium Concentration ([Ca2+]i)—For [Ca2+]i measurement, cells were cultured up to 90% confluency, washed with 1× PBS buffer, and dispersed with cell dissociation solution (6 ml/75-cm2 flask; Sigma) for 25 min at 37 °C. Cells were then harvested by centrifuging and resuspending in normal DMEM at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were plated into 96-well black microplates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight. Each well contained about 50,000 cells. The cells were washed twice with HBS buffer (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm glucose, 0.33 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4)). Then the cells were incubated in HBS containing 2.5 μm Fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes) and 0.066% Pluronic F-127 (Sigma). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C in darkness, cells were washed three times with HBS buffer. After washing, wells were supplemented with 100 μl of HBS buffer (as control or for studies without sigma ligands) or HBS containing the indicated concentration of sigma-1 ligands ((+)-pentazocine or BD1063) and allowed to incubate for 16 min before measurement. Cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) measurement was made using a Victor V microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Two excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm were used and the emission was measured at 510 nm. The 510 nm emission ratio after rapid excitation at 340 and 380 nm (emission 340/380) was calculated by Dell computer. Calcium concentrations were determined by comparison to a standard curve. The standard curve was generated by using various concentrations of Ca2+ in the presence of 2.5 μm Fura-2 (calcium calibration buffer kit, Molecular Probes). Basal cell [Ca2+]i was measured for 20 s without any additions. Then agonist was rapidly added by pump injector to the target final concentration, usually by injecting 5 μl to a final volume of 105 μl in the well. The resultant changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored for 45 s. Basal [Ca2+]i levels were 50–100 nm. Cells with basal levels >100 nm were not used for study. BDK was routinely added to a final concentration of 60 nm from a stock solution of 1.26 μm made up in 0.05% acetic acid. The final concentration of acetic acid was 0.0024% and did not affect the pH or calcium signal. Where indicated, experiments were conducted with various concentrations of BDK to establish dose-response curves. Vasopressin was added to a final concentration of 800 nm from a stock solution of 16.8 μm prepared with sterile double distilled H2O containing 0.025% SDS. The final concentration of SDS was 0.0012%, and injection of vehicle had no effect on calcium level. ATP was added to a final concentration of 50 μm from a stock solution of 1.05 mm prepared fresh with sterile double distilled H2O. Membrane Preparation and Radioligand Binding—Cells were cultured to 85–90% confluency as described above in 150-cm2 flasks (Costar). Total membranes were prepared as described previously (7Vilner B.J. John C.S. Bowen W.D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 408-413PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, medium was removed, and cells were rinsed two times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were detached by incubation with cell dissociation solution (Sigma) at 37 °C for 25 min and pelleted. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), containing 0.32 m sucrose (0.5 ml/flask), and homogenized with 15 hand-driven strokes in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (Teflon pestle). The homogenate was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet (representing the total membrane fractions of the cell) was resuspended in ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) to a total protein concentration of 15–20 mg/ml, and the crude membrane preparation was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C until use. Protein was measured by the BCA assay kit (Pierce). Sigma-1 receptors were labeled using [3H](+)-pentazocine (23.4 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (9Hellewell S.B. Bruce A. Feinstein G.

https://openalex.org/W1974105812,"Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin, have each been shown to play an important role in neuroinflammation. However, whether these signaling molecules interact to coordinate immune/inflammatory processes and neurodegeneration has not been investigated. Here, we show that exogenous application of IL-1β (10 ng/ml) recruited calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) activation in primary astrocyte-enriched cultures within minutes, through a pathway involving IL-1 receptors and L-type Ca2+ channels. Adenovirus-mediated delivery of the NFAT inhibitor, VIVIT, suppressed the IL-1β-dependent induction of several inflammatory mediators and/or markers of astrocyte activation, including tumor necrosis factor α, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and vimentin. Expression of an activated form of calcineurin in one set of astrocyte cultures also triggered the release of factors that, in turn, stimulated NFAT activity in a second set of “naive” astrocytes. This effect was prevented when calcineurin-expressing cultures co-expressed VIVIT, suggesting that the calcineurin/NFAT pathway coordinates positive feedback signaling between astrocytes. In the presence of astrocytes and neurons, 48-h delivery of IL-1β was associated with several excitotoxic effects, including NMDA receptor-dependent neuronal death, elevated extracellular glutamate, and hyperexcitable synaptic activity. Each of these effects were reversed or ameliorated by targeted delivery of VIVIT to astrocytes. IL-1β also caused an NFAT-dependent reduction in excitatory amino acid transporter levels, indicating a possible mechanism for IL-1β-mediated excitotoxicity. Taken together, the results have potentially important implications for the propagation and maintenance of neuroinflammatory signaling processes associated with many neurodegenerative conditions and diseases.

IL-1 sets in motion a number of positive feedback cycles between astrocytes, microglia, and neurons underscored by the extensive interplay of multiple cytokine species (12Lee S.C. Dickson D.W. Brosnan C.F. Brain Behav. Immun. 1995; 9: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13Griffin W.S. Sheng J.G. Royston M.C. Gentleman S.M. McKenzie J.E. Graham D.I. Roberts G.W. Mrak R.E.

Anat. 2005; 207: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Activated astrocytes, in particular, release numerous inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and S100B, to name a few (6Dong Y. Benveniste E.N. Glia. 2001; 36: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 16Eddleston M. Mucke L. Neuroscience. 1993; 54: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar, 17Ridet J.L.

Neuroglia in the Aging Brain. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 157-178Google Scholar). These factors can cause further activation of local neuroglia and therefore perpetuate immune/inflammatory signaling cycles if not brought in check by endogenous or exogenous anti-inflammatory agents.The intracellular cascades resulting in cytokine production in astrocytes may be similar to those in other immunocompetent cells, such as B and T lymphocytes. Astrocytes, for instance, express AP-1, the nuclear factor κB (NFκB), and several different MAPK pathway constituents, which have been shown to control transcriptional activity and to respond vigorously to increased IL-1β levels (15Moynagh P.N. J. Anat. 2005; 207: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Astrocytes also express the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CN) (19Vinade L. Goncalves C.A. Wofchuk S. Gottfried C. Rodnight R. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 104: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Hashimoto T. Kawamata T. Saito N. Sasaki M. Nakai M. Niu S. Taniguchi T.

J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2004-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but unlike the MAPK- and NFκB-dependent pathways, CN-mediated immune/inflammatory signaling in astrocytes has received little attention until recently.In neural tissue, CN is perhaps best known for its actions in neurons, where it regulates a diverse set of processes including cytoskeletal reorganization (22Halpain S. Hipolito A. Saffer L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9835-9844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), synaptic plasticity and cognition (23Mansuy I.M. Shenolikar S. Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 679-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and apoptosis (24Wang H.G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that CN isoforms appear at high levels in astrocytes in response to brain injury, aging, and/or amyloidosis (20Hashimoto T. Kawamata T. Saito N.

Chen K.C. Thibault V. Porter N.M. Landfield P.W. Kraner S.D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4649-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In astrocytes, the expression of activated CN (aCN) appears to initiate many of the same processes associated with elevated IL-1β levels, including astrocyte activation and the induction of numerous immune/inflammatory signaling molecules (25Norris C.M. Kadish I. Blalock E.M. Chen K.C. Thibault V. Porter N.M. Landfield P.W. Kraner S.D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4649-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 26Fernandez A.M. Fernandez S. Carrero P. Garcia-Garcia M. Torres-Aleman I. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8745-8756Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, blockade of IL-1 signaling and CN activity each helps to reduce glial activation and neuroinflammation following neural injury (27Yoshiyama Y. Higuchi M. Zhang B. Huang S.M. Iwata N.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6470-6474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In lymphocytes and other cell types, CN regulates cytokine production primarily through the direct activation of a family of transcription factors called NFATs (nuclear factor of activated T cells) (31Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). In fact, most cytokines released by activated T cells are expressed from genes that encode multiple NFAT-binding elements (32Serfling E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Chuvpilo S. Jankevics E. Klein-Hessling S. Twardzik T. Avots A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Typically, NFATs regulate cytokine gene expression by coupling with other transcription factors, such as AP-1 or NFκB (33Macian F. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Rao A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), which, as mentioned, are present in astrocytes and responsive to IL-1β.Although IL-1β stimulates Ca2+ elevations in astrocytes (34Pita I. Jelaso A.M. Ide C.F. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1999; 17: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 35Beskina O. Miller A. Mazzocco-Spezzia A. Pulina M.V. Golovina V.A. Am. J.

Here, we show that CN/NFAT activity in rat primary astrocyte cultures is strongly recruited by the exogenous application of IL-1β. Moreover, blockade of CN/NFAT activity in astrocytes inhibited IL-1β-dependent cytokine expression, interfered with positive feedback interactions between astrocytes, and ameliorated the deleterious effects of IL-1β on neuronal function and viability. The results may have important implications for the initiation and progression of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPrimary Cell Cultures—All cell cultures were kept at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator until use. Primary astrocyte-enriched cultures (∼95% pure) were prepared from cortical tissue of embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley rat pups, as described previously (40Keller J.N. Steiner M.R. Mattson M.P. Steiner S.M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2300-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, tissue was harvested and suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution before mechanical dissociation by trituration. Cells were then plated in culture flasks in minimal essential medium, buffered by NaHCO3, and supplemented with KCl, l-glutamine, pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. At 80–90% confluence (typically 7–10 days), microglia were removed by vigorously shaking the flasks at room temperature (2Tuppo E.E. Arias H.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 3Van Eldik L.J. Thompson W.L. Ralay Ranaivo H. Behanna H.A. Watterson M.D. Int. Rev.

When necessary, this step was repeated to remove essentially all microglia. Cells were then trypsinized and removed from flasks and plated on 35-mm culture dishes for experiments. Astrocyte cultures were grown to confluence (usually for 12–14 days) prior to use, and medium was changed every 7 days.Primary microglial cultures were established from medium extracted from astrocyte cultures following the shaking step described above. Cells were plated in 35-mm dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml. After cell attachment (usually 24 h), culture medium was exchanged for Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with l-glutamine and 25 mm HEPES. Medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic-antimitotic mix (Invitrogen). Medium was changed every 4–5 days until cells were used.Mixed hippocampal cultures of neurons and astrocytes were prepared from embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley rat pups as described previously (41Norris C.M. Blalock E.M. Thibault O. Brewer L.D. Clodfelter G.V. Porter N.M. Landfield P.W. J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 2488-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 42Porter N.M. Thibault O. Thibault V. Chen K.C. Landfield P.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociated neurons and astrocytes (∼4 × 105/ml) were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated 35-mm dishes with 10% fetal bovine and 10% horse serum. At 3 days in vitro, culture medium was supplemented with 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine (15 μg/ml) to inhibit proliferation of nonneuronal cells.Primary enriched cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley rat pups in a similar manner as described previously (43Mohmmad Abdul H. Sultana R. Keller J.N. St Clair D.K. Markesbery W.R. Butterfield D.A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 1322-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Dissociated cortical tissue was passed several times through a glass pipette and subjected to a 3-min incubation at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Cells were then filtered through a 0.22-μm nylon mesh (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and centrifuged at 272 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed three times in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (20 μl/ml), penicillin/streptomycin/neomycin (20 μl/ml) and glutamax-1 (10 μl/ml). Isolated cortical neurons were then diluted in 1 ml of neurobasal medium (2 × 106 cell/ml) and plated on poly-l-lysine-coated 35-mm dishes. After cells were attached, cell culture medium was exchanged for fresh neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, antibiotics, and Glutamax. Cells were used for viability assays at between 14 and 21 days in vitro.Replication-deficient Adenovirus—Adenovirus encoding an NFAT-dependent luciferase reporter construct (Ad-NFAT-Luc), which encodes nine copies of an NFAT binding site (from the IL-4 promoter) and an additional minimal promoter upstream of a luciferase sequence, was kindly provided by Dr. Jeff Molkentin (University of Cincinnati) and has been described in detail elsewhere (44Wilkins B.J. Dai Y.S. Bueno O.F. Parsons S.A. Xu J. Plank D.M. Jones F. Kimball T.R. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Ad-LacZ-GFP which encodes β-galactosidase driven by a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter as well as a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag expressed from an internal ribosomal entry site was kindly provided by Dr. Rita Balice-Gordon (University of Pennsylvania). Where necessary, this virus was used as a control for nonspecific viral effects. A truncated, constitutively active CN A fragment was amplified from the pTJ66 vector (45Friday B.B. Horsley V. Pavlath G.K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Grace Pavlath (Emory University), and subcloned into the polylinker site of a hybrid pCI vector containing IRES2-DsRed-Express (Clontech). The potent NFAT nuclear translocation inhibitor, VIVIT, was kindly provided by Dr. Anjana Rao (Harvard University) as a fusion construct (pCMV-VIVIT-EGFP), which has been described elsewhere (46Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). VIVIT-EGFP was extracted by restriction digestion and subcloned into a pCI vector. Both CMV-aCN-DsRed and CMV-VIVIT-EGFP were subcloned into adenoviral shuttle vectors (pAd-Link) and recombined with dl327 wild-type adenoviral cDNA in human embryonic kidney 293 cells via Ca2+-phosphate transfection. The pAdLink vector and dl327 adenovirus were obtained from the Vector Core at the University of Pennsylvania. Adenoviruses were purified on CsCl gradients and titered using the Adeno-X Rapid Titer kit (Clontech). Viruses were added to cultures at a multiplicity of infection of ∼100.Drugs—Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma) was added to microglial cultures at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. Rat IL-1β (Pierce) was delivered to cultures at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. Several pharmacological agents were added independently to cell cultures at ∼1 h prior to administration of IL-1β. These included cyclosporin A to inhibit CN activity (Sigma), the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), nifedipine (Sigma) to antagonize L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCCs), and ω-conotoxins GVIA and MVIIC (Sigma) to antagonize N- and P-/Q-type VSCCs, and MK-801 (Sigma) to inhibit NMDA receptor activity.NFAT-luciferase Reporter Assays—At ∼24 h before treatment with inflammatory mediators or active CN adenovirus, astrocyte culture dishes were infected with Ad-NFAT-Luc (see above). At a multiplicity of infection of 100, more than 90% of all astrocytes are infected within each dish, ensuring uniform distribution of the NFAT-reporter construct across treatment groups. After exposure to IL-1β (∼3 h), each culture dish was washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were scraped free and pelleted at 13,000 rpm. Supernatants from each 35-mm dish were removed and replaced with CAT buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), and pellets were stored at –20 °C until use. Samples were freeze/thawed twice, resuspended, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm, and supernatants were collected. As a further control for potential between-group variability in NFAT-luciferase expression, all sample volumes were normalized to the same protein concentration using the Lowry method. Luciferase expression was quantified using a luciferase detection kit (luc Screen; Tropix, Bedford, MA) and a plate reader. Typically, six or more dishes were analyzed per treatment condition, resulting in a well powered experimental design.NFAT Translocation—The pHA-NFAT1-(1–460)-GFP vector was kindly provided by Dr. Anjana Rao and has been described elsewhere (47Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This vector encodes the first 460 amino acids of the mouse NFAT1 isoform fused to EGFP and driven by a CMV promoter. Astrocyte cultures were transfected with pHA-NFAT1-(1–460)-GFP using Lipofectamine LTX and PLUS transfection reagents (Invitrogen). At 24–48 h after transfection, culture dishes were transferred to the stage of a Nikon E600 microscope, and EGFP expression was detected with appropriate filters using a ×40 Fluor objective. Following treatment with inflammatory mediators, cells were imaged once every 5 min for 35 min using a Nikon CoolSnap ES digital camera.Western Blot—Cells plated on 35-mm dishes were scraped free into ice-cold sucrose buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 0.75 m NaCl, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.02 m EDTA, 0.02 m EGTA), supplemented with protein phosphatase and protease inhibitor mixtures (Calbiochem). Within each treatment condition, material from six plates was combined and pelleted at 4 °C by spinning at 3500 rpm for 5 min. Approximately two-thirds of the supernatant was removed, and pellets were resuspended with a handheld homogenizer before the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 1%. Samples were then heated to 65 °C for 15 min and stored at –80 °C until use. The Lowry method was used to determine protein levels, and each sample was diluted 25% with running buffer. Samples were loaded into individual lanes of a gradient gel with protein concentrations held constant across lanes. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for quantitative Western blot. Membranes were incubated at 4 °C overnight in I-Bloc (Tropix) along with primary antibodies, which included rabbit anti-CN Aα (1:1000; Millipore, Billerica, MA), rabbit anti-EAAT1 and rabbit anti-EAAT2 (both at 1:5000), and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:5000) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Primary antibodies were tagged with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, diluted in I-Block at 1:10,000, and detected using the ECL-plus Western kit (GE Healthcare). Protein levels were quantified using a Storm 860 molecular imager.Real Time RT-PCR—Cells in 35-mm culture dishes were lysed in 800 μl of Trizol reagent (Sigma) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min before storage at –80 °C until use. RNA was chloroform-extracted from lysates and then further isolated and purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA concentration and quality was determined using a spectrophotometer and agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA was made from RNA samples using a Superscript III kit from Invitrogen. All samples were equilibrated by adding 1 μg/ml of RNA as determined by pilot studies. cDNA samples were diluted by a factor of 10 and stored at –80 °C until use.RT-PCR experiments were performed using the Superarray RT-2 SyBr Green system and were read on an ABI Mx3000 Multiplex RT-PCR instrument. All primer sets and the reaction mix were purchased from Superarray. Samples underwent 40 cycles of RT-PCR (95 °C, 10 min; 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s). Results were analyzed using Multiplex software. The amount of target message in each reaction was determined from the detection threshold cycle number (Ct), which is inversely correlated with the abundance of the message's initial level. The Ct was then converted to relative quantity by normalizing to a standard curve.Medium Exchange Experiments—For experiments involving the use of microglial conditioned medium (i.e. Fig. 1, C and D), primary microglia cultures were treated with or without the inflammatory factor LPS for 3–4 h, after which cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and placed in serum-free medium and returned to the incubator. Twenty-four hours later, this conditioned microglia medium was transferred to primary astrocyte cultures preloaded with the NFAT-luciferase reporter construct. In other experiments (i.e. Fig. 3, E and F), astrocytes were infected with adenoviruses containing a control construct (i.e. LacZ (β-galactosidase)), aCN, or aCN plus VIVIT. Additional control cultures were left uninfected. After 4 h of viral incubation, cultures were washed three times, placed in serum-free medium, and returned to the incubator. Twenty-four hours later, conditioned medium from these cultures was applied to naive astrocytes preloaded with the NFAT-luc construct.FIGURE 3CN/NFAT activity is required for IL-1β-mediated induction of inflammatory markers and governs positive feedback interactions among astrocytes. A–D, real time RT-PCR was used to analyze mRNA levels for TNFα (A), GM-CSF (B), S100B (C), and vimentin (D) in primary astrocyte cultures treated for 3 h with IL-1β (IL) in the presence or absence of VIVIT (n = 5–6 cultures/condition). mRNA levels are expressed as -fold change (mean ± S.E.) relative to control (CT). The actions of IL-1β on each mRNA species, except S100B, were inhibited by VIVIT, suggesting the critical involvement of NFAT-dependent transcriptional regulation. E, experimental protocol for medium exchange experiments. On day 1, astrocyte cultures were incubated for 4 h with control adenovirus (LacZ) or adenovirus encoding activated CN (aCN) with or without (±) VIVIT. Cultures were then washed (three times) and incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h. Some cultures were left untreated (UT). In parallel, separate cultures (i.e. reporter cultures) were preloaded with NFAT-luc (n = 6–8 cultures/condition). On day 2, conditioned medium from untreated and LacZ- and aCN-treated cultures (±VIVIT) were transferred to reporter cultures. NFAT-luciferase activity was quantified on day 3 and is shown in F as the mean ± S.E., relative to the untreated condition. Conditioned medium from aCN-expressing cultures, but not from LacZ-expressing cultures, stimulated NFAT-luc activity in reporter cultures. Medium from aCN-expressing cultures co-treated with VIVIT did not stimulate NFAT activity in reporter cultures. a, p < 0.05; b, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Neuronal Death Assay—For these experiments, sandwich cultures of neurons and astrocytes were used. Astrocyte-enriched cultures, prepared as described above, were plated on 25-mm diameter Thermanox plastic coverslips (Nunc, Naperville, IL). On day 1 of these experiments, astrocytes were incubated with adenovirus for 4 h and washed three times in culture medium and returned to the CO2 incubator. On day 2, astrocyte coverslips were flipped, cell side down, onto 30-mm diameter permeable membranes (0.4-μm diameter pores) and placed into 35-mm dishes of cortical neurons, prepared as described above. The permeable membrane was used to prevent any large cellular debris (e.g. membrane fragments) from contacting neurons. On day 3, sandwich cultures were treated with IL-1β at 10 ng/ml. Final conditions included Ad-LacZ-GFP with or without IL-1β, Ad-VIVIT-EGFP with or without IL-1β, and Ad-aCN-DsRed2 with or without IL-1β. On day 5, astrocyte-containing coverslips were removed from cortical neurons, and neuronal cultures were assayed for the presence of dead cells using the LIVE/DEAD cell toxicity assay (Invitrogen). In this assay, cells incorporating ethidium homodimer-1 (i.e. dead cells) are identified using fluorescence microscopy (E600 Nikon with appropriate filters) and a ×10 objective. Cells were counted and averaged wi"

We compared their nongenomic signaling and functional actions in GH3/B6/F10 rat pituitary tumor cells. All hormones caused prolactin release at 1 min; the lowest effective concentrations were 10(-11) M E(2), 10(-10) M E(1), and 10(-7) M E(3). All estrogens increased the oscillation frequency of calcium (Ca) spikes, with the same time delay (approximately 200 s) at all levels (10(-15) to 10(-9) M). At some concentrations, E(1) and E(3) provoked more Ca-responding cells than E(2). The amplitude and volume of Ca peaks were elevated by all hormones at > or = 10(-15) M. All hormones caused cell proliferation, with the lowest effective concentrations of E(2) (10(-15) M) > E(1) (10(-12) M) > E(3) (10(-10) M); E(2) caused higher maximal cell numbers at most concentrations. All estrogens caused oscillating extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activations, with relative potencies of E(1) and E(2) > E(3). All estrogens were ineffective in activation of ERKs or causing proliferation in a subline expressing low levels of membrane estrogen receptor-alpha. Dose-response patterns were frequently nonmonotonic. Therefore, the hormones E(1) and E(3), which have been designated ""weak"" estrogens in genomic actions, are strong estrogens in the nongenomic signaling pathways and functional responses in the pituitary."

For several acid/base-coupled membrane carriers it has been shown that the catalytic activity of CA supports transport activity, an interaction coined “transport metabolon.” We have reported that CA isoform II (CAII) enhances lactate transport activity of the monocarboxylate transporter isoform I (MCT1) expressed in Xenopus oocytes, which does not require CAII catalytic activity (Becker, H. M., Fecher-Trost, C., Hirnet, D., Sültemeyer, D., and Deitmer, J. W. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 39882-39889). Coexpression of MCT1 with either wild type CAII or the catalytically inactive mutant CAII-V143Y similarly enhanced MCT1 activity, although injection of CAI or coexpression of an N-terminal mutant of CAII had no effect on MCT1 transport activity, demonstrating a specific, nonenzymatic action of CAII on lactate transport via MCT1. If the H+ gradient was set to dominate the rate of lactate transport by applying low concentrations of lactate at a high H+ concentration, the effect of CAII was largest. We tested the hypothesis of whether CAII helps to shuttle H+ along the inner face of the cell membrane by measuring the pH change with fluorescent dye in different areas of interest during focal lactate application. Intracellular pH shifts decayed from the focus of lactate application to more distant sites much less when CAII had been injected. We present a hypothetical model in which the effective movement of H+ into the bulk cytosol is increased by CAII, thus slowing the dissipation of the H+ gradient across the cell membrane, which drives MCT1 activity.

Transport of acid/base equivalents across cell membranes plays a crucial role both for pH regulation and cellular import and export of metabolites. Many Na+-dependent and Na+-independent transport modes of metabolites (e.g. neurotransmitter substances) also transport H+, OH-, or HCO3− as co- or counter-substrate. The energetic compounds lactate and pyruvate are primarily transported by monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) 2The abbreviations used are: MCT, monocarboxylate transporter; AE1, anion exchanger isoform I; AOI, area of interest; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′bis(2carboxyethyl)5(and6)carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester; CA, carbonic anhydrase; NBCe1, electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter isoform I; EZA, ethoxyzolamide; WT, wild type. in an electroneutral 1 proton-1 organic anion transport mode. Members of the MCT family, which belong to the human gene family SLC16 which comprise 14 isoforms, are expressed in most tissues, in particular those with a large energy consumption like muscle and brain (1Bergersen L.H. Neuroscience. 2007; 145: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2Halestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). In the brain MCT1 is located mainly in glial cells, where it facilitates the export of lactate, which is then taken up by neurons via the high affinity MCT2; thereby the two isoforms are believed to shuttle lactate from glial cells to neurons which seems to be pivotal for brain energy metabolism (3Bouzier-Sore A.K.

In muscle, MCT1 is highly expressed in oxidative type I fibers, where it mediates import of lactate that is released by glycolytic muscle cells via MCT3 and MCT4 (7Hashimoto T. Masuda S. Taguchi S. Brooks G.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 567: 121-129Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8Juel C. Eur. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 86: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Brooks G.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 120: 89-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). MCT1, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, operates with a Km value of 3.5 mm for lactate influx and of 6.4 mm for efflux of lactate. Both the rate and the amplitude of the lactate-induced acidification strongly depend on the extracellular H+ concentration (10Galic S. Schneider H.P. Broer A. Deitmer J.W. Broer S. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 413-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Broer S. Schneider H.P. Broer A. Rahman B. Hamprecht B. Deitmer J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Expressed in frog oocytes, MCT1 has been shown to cooperate with the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter NBCe1 (12Becker H.M. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol.

Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39882-39889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the support of MCT1 activity by CAII was independent of the catalytic activity of the enzyme, which catalyzes the equilibrium of CO2, H+, and HCO3− (14Becker H.M. Fecher-Trost C.

CAII binds to, and enhances the activity of various acid/base transporters like the chloride/bicarbonate exchanger AE1 (15McMurtrie H.L. Cleary H.J. Alvarez B.V. Loiselle F.B. Sterling D. Morgan P.E.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36085-36091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In muscle cells, coexpression of CAII and acid/base-transporting proteins like NBC, NHE1, and also the MCTs have been found to be pivotal in acid/base homeostasis (20Juel C. Lundby C. Sander M. Calbet J.A. Hall G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 548: 639-648Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that extracellular carbonic anhydrase activity facilitates lactic acid transport in rat skeletal muscle fibers (21Wetzel P. Hasse A. Papadopoulos S. Voipio J. Kaila K. Gros G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 531: 743-756Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the brain CAII is highly expressed in astrocytes where it plays a supportive role in pH regulation (22Deitmer J.W. Rose C.R. Prog. Neurobiol. 1996; 48: 73-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and supports the lactate shuttle from astrocytes to neurons (23Svichar N. Chesler M. Glia. 2003; 41: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present study we have focused on the mechanism by which MCT1 activity is enhanced by nonenzymatic proton handling of CAII. Our results suggest that CAII, presumed to accumulate exclusively at the inner face of the cell membrane, accelerates the disposal of protons away from the MCT1 domain at the inner face of the cell membrane into the bulk cytosol. This would help to prevent local proton microdomains developing at the pore of the transporter and, thus, maintain a proton gradient which allows a sustained lactate flux via MCT1. Constructs, Oocytes, and Injection of cRNA and Carbonic Anhydrase—The human CAII cDNA (CAII-WT) as well as the N-terminal mutant CAII-HEX with mutations of the amino acids at position H3P, H4Q, L9A, H10K, H15K, and H17S were kindly provided by Dr. Reinhart Reithmeier, Toronto, CA (24Vince J.W.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11054-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The two constructs were subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pGEM-He-Juel, which contains the 5′ and the 3′ untranscribed regions of the Xenopus β-globulin flanking the multiple cloning site. Rat MCT1 cDNA (MCT1) cloned in oocyte expression vector pGEM-He-Juel was kindly provided by Dr. Stefan Bröer, Canberra, Australia (28Broer S. Rahman B. Pellegri G. Pellerin L. Martin J.L.

Plasmid DNA was transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (mMessage mMachine, Ambion Inc.) as described earlier (13Becker H.M. Broer S. Deitmer J.W. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Xenopus oocytes of the stages V and VI were injected with 5 ng of MCT1-cRNA dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-H2O. Control oocytes were injected with an equivalent volume of diethyl pyrocarbonate-H2O. Measurements were carried out 3-6 days after injection of cRNA. CAII was either injected as protein or coexpressed with the MCT1. For injection of protein, 2, 10, 50, or 200 ng of CAII, isolated from bovine erythrocytes (C3934, Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), and CAI, isolated from human erythrocytes (C4396, Sigma-Aldrich), respectively, dissolved in 25 nl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-H2O, were injected 20-24 h before electrophysiological measurement. Control oocytes were injected with 25 nl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-H2O. For coexpression of CAII, 12 ng of CAII-cRNA were injected either alone or together with the MCT1-cRNA. The oocyte saline had the composition 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm HEPES, titrated with NaOH to the desired pH. In lactate-containing saline NaCl was replaced by an equivalent amount of Na-l-lactate. In the bicarbonate-containing saline, NaCl was replaced by an equivalent amount of NaHCO3, and the solution was aerated with 5% CO2. Application of lactate was carried out in HEPES-buffered solution at pH 7.0 in the nominal absence of CO2/HCO3− containing around 0.008 mm of CO2 from air and, hence, a HCO3− concentration of around 0.06 mm. Intracellular pH Measurements—For measurement of intracellular pH and membrane potential, double-barreled microelectrodes were used; the manufacture and application have been described in detail previously (13Becker H.M. Broer S. Deitmer J.W. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29Deitmer J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 637-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, for double-barreled microelectrodes, two borosilicate glass capillaries of 1.0 and 1.5 mm in diameter were twisted together and pulled to a micropipette. The ion-selective barrel was silanized with 5% tri-N-butylchlorosilane in 99.9% pure carbon tetrachloride, backfilled into the tip. H+-sensitive mixture (Fluka 95291, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) was backfilled into the tip of the silanized ion-selective barrel and filled up with 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.0. The reference barrel was filled with 3 m KCl. To increase the opening of the electrode-tip, it was beveled with a jet stream of aluminum powder suspended in H2O. Calibration of the electrodes was carried out in oocyte saline by changing the pH by 0.6 units. As described previously (11Broer S. Schneider H.P. Broer A. Rahman B. Hamprecht B. Deitmer J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), optimal pH changes were detected when the electrode was located near the inner surface of the plasma membrane. This was achieved by carefully rotating the oocyte with the impaled electrode. All experiments were carried out at room temperature. Calculation of [H+]i—The measurements of intracellular pH were stored digitally using homemade PC software based on the program LabView (National Instruments Germany GmbH, München, Germany) and were routinely converted into intracellular H+ concentration, [H+]i. This should provide changes in the [H+]i, which take into account the different pH base line, as e.g. measured in HEPES- and CO2/HCO3−-buffered saline (12Becker H.M. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28057-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The rate of change of the measured [H+]i was analyzed by determining the slope of a linear regression fit using the spread sheet program OriginPro 7 (OriginLab Corp., Northampten, MA). Voltage Clamp Recording—A borosilicate glass capillary 1.5 mm in diameter was pulled to a micropipette and backfilled with 3 m KCl. The resistance of the electrodes measured in oocyte saline was around 1 megaohms. For voltage clamp, the electrode was connected to the head-stage of an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Oocytes were clamped to a holding potential of -40 mV. Fluorescent Staining of MCT1 and CAII in Oocytes—Frog oocytes, either injected with cRNA for MCT1 and CAII, as well as native control oocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Oocytes were treated with 100% methanol and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Unspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and 1% normal goat serum. The cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing the primary antibodies (chicken anti-MCT1 polyclonal antibody (1:300) and rabbit anti-carbonic anhydrase II polyclonal antibody (1:1000), Chemicon International, Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. Oocytes were then incubated with the secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat chicken IgG and Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Molecular Probes, Inc.). The stained oocytes were analyzed with a laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss GmbH, Oberkochem, Germany) using whole oocytes through which cross-sectional optical planes were laid or the cell surface was viewed. Additionally, oocytes were embedded in 2% agarose and sectioned into 300-μm thick slices with a microtome (752M Vibroslice, Campden Instruments Ltd.). Imaging of Cytosolic H+ Changes in Oocytes—MCT1-expressing oocytes either injected with 200 ng of CAII or H2O were stained with 7 μm 2′,7′bis(2carboxyethyl)5(and6) carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) ester (B-1170, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) for 45 min at 18 °C in oocyte saline, pH 7.8. Oocytes were placed into a cavity 1 mm in diameter in a bath with the vegetative (white) hemisphere faced up. Cells were continuously perfused with oocyte saline, pH 7.0. A class micropipette with a tip diameter of 20 μm was filled with 100 mm lactate in oocyte saline, pH 6.0, and connected to a pressure applicator (PDES-02D pneumatic drug ejector, npi electronic GmbH). The tip was placed close to the oocyte membrane, and lactate was focally applied with a pressure of 0.2 bar for 20 s against the direction of perfusion to wash lactate away from the cell to exclude global lactate application. Changes in the fluorescence intensity were measured using an imaging system (TILL Photonics, Munich-Martinsried, Germany). BCECF-loaded oocytes were excited by monochromatic wavelengths of 440 and 490 nm. The fluorescence emissions were continuously recorded at 2 Hz. After calculation of the ratio, areas of interest (AOI) with a size of 40 μm × 40 μm were chosen with respect to the position of the application pipette. For each AOI the rate of rise in fluorescents intensity during application of lactate was calculated and plotted against the relative position of the AOI from the application pipette. The change in fluorescence ratio refers to changes in intracellular pH according to a modified Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, yielding a nonlinear correlation between changes in fluorescent intensity and intracellular pH over a wide pH range (30Nett W. Deitmer J.W. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 394-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31James-Kracke M.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, because the expected changes in pH, as calculated from measurements with ion-selective electrodes, range between pH 7.2 and 6.8, where a nearly linear relationship between the fluorescent signal and intracellular pH is found, changes in the fluorescent signal can directly account for changes in intracellular H+ concentration. To determine the rate of rise in fluorescence intensity, the slope of a linear regression fit was calculated for the time course during lactate application for every AOI. Determination of CAII Activity—Activity of CAII was determined by monitoring the 18O depletion of doubly labeled 13C18O2 through several hydration and dehydration steps of CO2 and HCO3− at 25 °C (32Sültemeyer D.F. Fock H. Canvin D.T. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 33Silverman D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 732-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The reaction sequence of 18O loss from 13C18O18O(m/z = 49) over the intermediate product 13C18O16O(m/z = 47) and the end product 13C16O16O(m/z = 45) was monitored with a quadrapole mass spectrometer (MSD 5970; Hewlett Packard, Waldbronn, Germany). The relative 18O enrichment was calculated from the measured 45, 47, and 49 abundance as a function of time according to the following equation: log enrichment = log(49 × 100/(49 + 47 + 45)). For the calculation of the CAII activity of the sample, the rate of 18O degradation was obtained from the linear slope of the log enrichment over the time using the spreadsheet analyzing software OriginPro 7. The rate was compared with the corresponding rate of the noncatalyzed reaction. Enzyme activity in units was calculated from these two values as defined by Badger and Price (34Badger M.R. Price G.D. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). From this definition, 1 unit corresponds to 100% stimulation of the noncatalyzed 18O depletion of doubly labeled 13C18O2. For the experiments, the cuvette was filled with 8 ml of oocyte saline with a pH of 7.25 according to the mean intracellular pH of CAII-injected oocytes at 25 °C. To determine the catalytic activity, oocytes either expressing or injected with CAII were pipetted into the cuvette in a batch of 20. For calibration, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 μg of CAII from bovine erythrocytes were directly added to the cuvette and compared with the activity as measured in oocytes which either expressed CAII or were injected with CAII. Calculation and Statistics—Statistical values are presented as the means ± S.E. For calculation of significance in differences, Student's t test or, if possible, a paired t test was used. In the figures shown, a significance level of p ≤ 0.05 is marked with *, p ≤ 0.01 with **, and p ≤ 0.001 with ***. CAII-mediated Support of MCT1 Activity—Expression of the proteins used in this study was checked via fluorescence staining using antibodies against MCT1 and CAII. Optical cross-sections (Fig. 1, A, C, E, G, I, and J) and surface views (Fig. 1, B, D, F, and H) of oocytes were taken with confocal microscopy. Staining for MCT1 (Fig. 1, C and D), the wild type form of CAII (CAII-WT; Fig. 1, A and B), the catalytically inactive mutant CAII-V143Y (Fig. 1I), and the N-terminal mutant CAII-HEX (Fig. 1J) were observed at the plasma membrane, whereas no staining was evident in the cytoplasm. Specificity of the antibodies for MCT1 and CAII was checked by double labeling of a native control oocyte, which showed no visible staining (Fig. 1, G and H). To confirm that cytosolic CAII was only localized at the plasma membrane but not in the cytosol and that the fluorescence was not quenched when optical slices were taken from intact oocytes, a CAII-injected oocyte was sectioned into 300-μm thick slices. The confocal image of the upper part of the slice shows that CAII is only found at the surface of the oocyte plasma membrane but not in the cytosol (Fig. 1K). Injection of CAII into MCT1-expressing oocytes resulted in an increase in MCT1 transport activity during application of lactate (14Becker H.M. Fecher-Trost C. Hirnet D. Sültemeyer D. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39882-39889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Blocking the catalytic center of the enzyme by application of ethoxyzolamide (EZA, 10 μm) had no effect on the interaction between MCT1 and CAII. To exclude an involvement of the catalytic activity in the enhancement of MCT1 activity, we coexpressed MCT1 either with the wild type form of CAII (CAII-WT) or with the catalytically inactive mutant CAII-V143Y. Transport activity of the MCT1 was determined with pH-sensitive microelectrodes as the rate of rise of intracellular H+ concentration during application of 3 and 10 mm lactate in oocytes either expressing MCT1 alone and in oocytes coexpressing MCT1 with either CAII-WT or CAII-V143Y in voltage clamp at a holding potential of -40 mV (Fig. 2A). As previously shown, injection of CAII into MCT1-expressing oocytes leads to no changes in the oocyte buffer capacity (14Becker H.M. Fecher-Trost C. Hirnet D. Sültemeyer D. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39882-39889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). With no changes in the intracellular buffer capacity, the rate of changes in intracellular H+ concentration is directly linked to changes in acid/base flux (13Becker H.M. Broer S. Deitmer J.W. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because changes in H+ concentration, in contrast to changes in pH, also account for changes in the pH base line, we used the changes in intracellular pH instead of changes in acid/base flux for calculation of changes in the MCT1 transport activity. Coexpression of MCT1 with CAII-WT and the catalytically inactive CAII-V143Y increased transport activity of MCT1 equally by a factor of about 2.5 at both lactate concentrations (p ≤ 0.001, Fig. 2B). To completely rule out any influence of CAII catalytic activity on the enhancement of MCT1 activity, we also applied lactate in the presence of 10 μm EZA. Application of EZA had no effect either for MCT1 or for MCT1 + CAII-WT- and MCT1 + CAII-V143Y-coexpressing oocytes on the rate of rise in intracellular H+ concentration during application of 3 and 10 mm lactate (Fig. 2B). The catalytic activity of CAII was checked by measuring the rate of rise of the intracellular acidification induced by application of 5% CO2, 10 mm HCO3− (Fig. 2C). Coexpression of CAII-WT resulted in a 7-fold increase in the rate of rise as compared with oocytes coexpressing MCT1 and CAII-V143Y or expressing MCT1 alone (p ≤ 0.001, Fig. 2D). The increase in the rate of rise of acidification in oocytes coexpressing MCT1 and CAII-WT could be suppressed after inhibition of CAII activity by 10 μm EZA (p ≤ 0.001, Fig. 2D). In the presence of EZA, similar rates of acidification were obtained by CO2/HCO3− application in all three types of oocytes. These results clearly indicate that CAII can increase transport activity of the MCT1 even without its catalytic activity. To determine the dependence of the CAII-induced augmentation in MCT1 activity on the concentration of intracellular CAII, we monitored transport activity after the injection of different amounts of the enzyme into MCT1-expressing oocytes (Fig. 3A). Activity of MCT1 was measured by determining the rate of change in intracellular H+ concentration during application (black triangles, acidification) and removal (white triangles, alkalinization) of 3 and 10 mm lactate in oocytes injected with 2, 10, 50, or 200 ng/oocyte of CAII or with no CAII injected (Fig. 3C). Amounts of CA were chosen from the lowest concentration where CA activity could be determined by pH-sensitive electrodes up to the maximal concentration that could be injected without causing severe damage to the oocytes. Both influx and efflux of protons during application and removal of lactate were accelerated with increasing intracellular concentration of CAII. Up to a concentration of 10 ng CAII/oocyte, only a small increase in MCT1 activity could be observed, whereas at higher CAII concentrations a steep increase in transport activity was measured. Even at a concentration of 200 ng of CAII/oocyte, the effect of CAII on MCT1 activity showed no signs of saturation. The results also indicate that CAII facilitates both influx and efflux of H+ (and lactate) via the MCT1; influx and efflux occurred with similar rates and show the same dependence on the intracellular CAII concentration. The rate of rise in intracellular H+ concentration as induced by application of 5% CO2, 10 mm HCO3− showed a typical saturation curve (Fig. 3E). CAII increased the rate of the CO2-induced acidification but also accelerated the alkalinization during removal of CO2. For the rate of the CO2-induced acidification, an EC50 of 6.7 ± 1.0 ng CAII/oocyte and a Vmax of 519 ± 20 nm H+/min was obtained. For the rate of alkalinization during removal of CO2/HCO3−, an EC50 of 4.8 ± 3.5 ng of CAII/oocyte and a Vmax of 354 ± 30 nm H+/min were determined. Interestingly, the efflux of CO2, as indicated by the rate of change in H+i was larger during addition, as compared with during removal of CO2/HCO3−. This might be attributable to different kinetics of CAII activity and CO2 efflux, caused by a limited supply of CO2 in the oocyte cytosol as compared with the large reservoir of CO2 in the bulk solution. To check for the specificity of CA isoform II for the interaction with MCT1, we also injected 2, 10, 50, or 200 ng of CA isoform I isolated from human erythrocytes into MCT1-expressing oocytes. Transport activity of MCT1 was again determined by monitoring the change in intracellular H+ concentration during application of 3 and 10 mm lactate (Fig. 3B). Injection of CAI had no effect on the rate of rise in intracellular H+ concentration during application of lactate or at the alkalinization during removal of the substrate (Fig. 3D). Catalytic activity of CAI, as determined by the rate of rise in intracellular H+ concentration induced by application of 5% CO2, 10 mm HCO3−, was lower than the activity of CAII but still induced a significant increase in the rate of CO2-induced acidification and also showed a typical saturation curve (Fig. 3F). For the rate of the CO2-induced acidification, an EC50 of 11.0 ± 1.6 ng CAI/oocyte and a Vmax of 349 ± 14 nm H+/min was obtained. For the rate of alkalinization during removal of CO2/HCO3−, an EC50 of 9.6 ± 1.9 ng CAI/oocyte and a Vmax of 217 ± 27 nm H+/min was determined. These findings illustrate that enhancement of MCT1 activity is not per se due to an increased amount of any protein near the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the results suggest that enhancement of MCT1 activity requires a feature of CAII that appears to be absent in CAI. CAI is a homologous isoform to CAII possessing 60% sequence identity. Nevertheless, it has been shown that CAI, in contrast to CAII, does not bind to AE1 (24Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5527-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2002094130,"The dynamic interaction between positive and negative signals is necessary for remodeling of postsynaptic structures at the neuromuscular junction. Here we report that Wnt3a negatively regulates acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering by repressing the expression of Rapsyn, an AChR-associated protein essential for AChR clustering. In cultured myotubes, treatment with Wnt3a or overexpression of β-catenin, the condition mimicking the activation of the Wnt canonical pathway, inhibited Agrin-induced formation of AChR clusters. Moreover, Wnt3a treatment promoted dispersion of AChR clusters, and this effect was prevented by DKK1, an antagonist of the Wnt canonical pathway. Next, we investigated possible mechanisms underlying Wnt3a regulation of AChR clustering in cultured muscle cells. Interestingly, we found that Wnt3a treatment caused a decrease in the protein level of Rapsyn. In addition, Rapsyn promoter activity in cultured muscle cells was inhibited by the treatment with Wnt3a or β-catenin overexpression. Forced expression of Rapsyn driven by a promoter that is not responsive to Wnt3a prevented the dispersing effect of Wnt3a on AChR clusters, suggesting that Wnt3a indeed acts to disperse AChR clusters by down-regulating the expression of Rapsyn. The role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in dispersing AChR clusters was also investigated in vivo by electroporation of Wnt3a or β-catenin into mouse limb muscles, where ectopic Wnt3a or β-catenin caused disassembly of postsynaptic apparatus. Together, these results suggest that Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a negative role for postsynaptic differentiation at the neuromuscular junction, probably by regulating the expression of synaptic proteins, such as Rapsyn.

AChR clusters underneath nerve terminals are stabilized by Agrin, a motor neuron-derived glycoprotein, and the AChR-associated protein Rapsyn (1McMahan U.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

On the other hand, motor neurons release negative signals to disperse non-innervated clusters and refine clusters at the synapses (4Lin W. Dominguez B. Yang J. Aryal P. Brandon E.P. Gage F.H.

The dynamic interactions between positive and negative signals are thought to be necessary for AChR cluster remodeling to better match nerve terminals and to form perforated or pretzel-like structures (2Sanes J.R.

Recently, we show that Rapsyn stabilizes AChR clusters by inhibiting calpain, a calcium-dependent protease activated by the cholinergic stimulation and involved in the dispersion of AChR clusters (8Chen F.

Thus, it is valuable to investigate the role of Wnt signaling during vertebrate neuromuscular synaptogenesis.

Several members of Wnt proteins have been shown to regulate presynaptic differentiation (21Lucas F.R. Goold R.G. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Salinas P.C. J.

Although several components of Wnt signaling pathway, including Dishevelled and adenomatous polyposis coli, have been shown to regulate AChR clustering at vertebrate neuromuscular junctions (25Luo Z.G.

Here we show that Wnt canonical signaling plays a negative role for the assembly of the postsynaptic apparatus at the vertebrate NMJ. Treatment with Wnt3a, a canonical Wnt, or up-regulation of β-catenin inhibited Agrin-induced formation of AChR clusters in cultured muscle cells. In addition, treatment with or forced expression of Wnt3a, in cultured muscle cells or mouse limb muscles, respectively, caused dispersion of AChR clusters. Furthermore, we investigated possible mechanisms underlying Wnt3a regulation of AChR clustering. Reagents—Antibodies against Rapsyn and MuSK were described in the previous studies (8Chen F. Qian L. Yang Z.H. Huang Y. Ngo S.T. Ruan N.J. Wang J. Schneider C. Noakes P.G. Ding Y.Q. Mei L. Luo Z.G.

Other antibodies were from Chemicon (β-actin), Invitrogen (GFP), Clontech (β-catenin and AChRα), R&D (Wnt1, -3a, -4, -5a, -7a, -8a, and -11), and Sigma (HA, myosin heavy chain, and pancadherin). Tetramethylrhodamine-α-bangarotoxin (R-BTX) was purchased from Molecule Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Recombinant rat C-terminal Agrin, recombinant mouse Wnt3a, and DKK1 were from R&D. Constructs—The BAC clone (RP23-147D3) containing the Rapsyn gene was purchased from the BACPAC (bacterial artificial chromosome P1-derived artificial chromosome) Resource Center at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute and used as template for the amplification of the Rapsyn 5′-flanking region. Primers for the 5′-flanking region were 5′-AGGCA GAGGC AATGG GATGC T-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTCC CACAG CCTGG CCACT-3′ (antisense). The PCR products were subcloned into pGL2-basic to generate Rapsyn5k-firefly luciferase (R5k-Luc). Vector-based siRNAs were encoded by pSUPER vectors, with the following sequences: β-catenin, 1 (5′-ACCAC CCTGG TGCTG ACTA-3′), 2 (5′-CATGC AGAAT ACAAA TGAT-3′), and 3 (5′-ACATA ATGAG GACCT ACAC-3′); Rapsyn, 233 (5′-ATGCT GACTT CCTGC TCGA-3′) and 616 (5′-GCCAT GAGCC AGTAC CACA-3′). The siRNA that does not target any known mammalian gene (5′-TTCTC CGAAC GTGTC ACGT-3′) was cloned into pSUPER as a control. Site mutations were introduced into Rapsyn encoding sequence to generate the constructs that were resistant to siRNA knockdown, referred to hereafter as Rap-res. Wnt3a was subcloned into pCAG-EYFPCAG vector, which has dual CAG promoters driving enhanced yellow fluorescent protein and target gene, respectively (28Zhang X. Zhu J. Yang G.Y. Wang Q.J. Qian L. Chen Y.M. Chen F. Tao Y. Hu H.S. Wang T. Luo Z.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—The Wnt3a-expressing cell line was purchased from ATCC and cultured as instructed. C2C12 muscle cells were cultured as described (25Luo Z.G. Wang Q. Zhou J.Z. Wang J. Luo Z. Liu M. He X. Wynshaw-Boris A. Xiong W.C. Lu B. Mei L. Neuron. 2002; 35: 489-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Myoblasts in 50% confluence were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), FuGene HD (Roche Applied Science), or Genejuice (Novagen), following the manufacturer's instructions, and then exposed to differentiation medium. Fully differentiated myotubes transfected with testing plasmids or treated with various reagents were subjected to immunoblotting, immunostaining, or luciferase assay. Cell lysates were prepared in the Nonidet P-40 buffer, including protease inhibitors, and then resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting. Luciferase assays were performed using the dual luciferase kit (Promega). The firefly luciferase activity was normalized by Renilla luciferase activity encoded by co-transfected pRL-TK. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—The mRNA samples from C2C12 myotubes treated with LiCl or NaCl were prepared using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using oligo(dT) primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed with a SYBR Premix Ex Taq™ kit (TaKaRa) and carried out in an Mx3000P Real Time PCR instrument (Stratagene). The housekeeping gene GAPDH was used as the reference for quantification. Primer sequences are as follows: Rapsyn, 5′-ATATC GGGCC ATGAG CCAGT AC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCACA ACACT CCATG GCACT GC-3′ (reverse); GAPDH, 5′-TGAAG CAGGC ATCTG AGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGAAG GTGGA AGAGT GGGAG-3′ (reverse). Immunohistochemistry—Mice muscles or muscle cells in culture were stained with the indicated antibodies, washed, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody and together with R-BTX to label the AChR (29Luo Z.G. Je H.S. Wang Q. Yang F. Dobbins G.C. Yang Z.H. Xiong W.C. Lu B. Mei L. Neuron. 2003; 40: 703-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Images were collected with a Zeiss confocal microscope or Nikon fluorescence microscope. The total length of all AChR clusters or number of clusters was quantitatively analyzed following the method described previously (8Chen F. Qian L. Yang Z.H. Huang Y. Ngo S.T. Ruan N.J. Wang J. Schneider C. Noakes P.G. Ding Y.Q. Mei L. Luo Z.G. Neuron. 2007; 55: 247-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Sometimes, AChR clusters were classified into different groups according to cluster sizes (1-5 μm, 5-10 μm, and >10 μm), and the number of different sized clusters was quantified. Electroporation of DNA into Mouse Skeletal Muscles—Mice operations in this study were approved by the Animal Administration Committee of the institute. 6 μg of testing plasmids were mixed with fast green and injected into the tibialis anterior muscles of anesthetized 6-week-old male BALB/c mice. Plaque electrodes (1 cm2) were then placed on each sides of the leg, and eight pulses (duration 20 ms with field strength 200 V/cm at 2 Hz) were applied to the injected muscle. The muscles were dissected out 6 weeks after electroporation and analyzed for AChR clusters by whole mount staining with R-BTX (see Ref. 29Luo Z.G. Je H.S. Wang Q. Yang F. Dobbins G.C. Yang Z.H. Xiong W.C. Lu B. Mei L. Neuron. 2003; 40: 703-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Wnt3a Inhibits Formation of AChR Clusters in Cultured Muscle Cells—To investigate the role of Wnt in postsynaptic differentiation, we examined the expression of different members of Wnt proteins in the mouse limb muscle. There are 19 isoforms of Wnt in mice (19Woodgett J.R. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : RE12Google Scholar, 20Moon R.T. Bowerman B. Boutros M. Perrimon N. Science. 2002; 296: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Among them, Wnt1, -4, -5a, -7a, -8a, and -11 were barely detectable (data not shown), whereas Wnt3a, although barely detectable at embryonic day 12 (E12), gradually increased in developing skeletal muscles and peaked at embryonic day 17 (E17) (Fig. 1A), a pattern coinciding with the period of postsynaptic differentiation at the NMJ in vivo (30Lin W. Burgess R.W. Dominguez B. Pfaff S.L. Sanes J.R. Lee K.F. Nature. 2001; 410: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Next we investigated the role of Wnt3a in AChR clustering in cultured muscle cells. We treated C2C12 myotubes with Wnt3a-conditioned medium containing ∼40 ng/ml Wnt3a, a concentration sufficient to increase cytosolic β-catenin (Fig. 3, A and B) for 30 h, followed by treatment with Agrin for another 6 h to induce the formation of AChR clusters. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, compared with cultures treated with L cell-conditioned medium, cultures treated with Wnt3a showed marked reduction in the total length of AChR clusters induced by Agrin. We classified AChR clusters into three groups according to cluster size and found that the number of small clusters (1-5 μm in length) was increased, whereas the number of large clusters (>10 μm in length) was decreased by Wnt3a treatment (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that Wnt3a inhibits the formation of full-size AChR clusters. Further, we determined the effect of other Wnts on AChR clustering. Due to the difficulty in the purification of most Wnt proteins, we chose to overexpress these proteins in C2C12 muscle cells (with co-transfected GFP to mark cell morphology) (supplemental Fig. S1A). After transfection, the fully differentiated C2C12 cells were treated with Agrin (5 ng/ml) for 6 h, and AChR clusters were analyzed. We found that overexpression of Wnt1 or Wnt3a, two canonical Wnts, but not other Wnts (Wnt5a, -7a, or -11), caused a reduction in total length of AChR clusters induced by Agrin (supplemental Fig. S1B). In contrast, transfection with DKK1, an antagonist of canonical Wnt signaling (31Deardorff M.A. Tan C. Conrad L.J. Klein P.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2687-2700PubMed Google Scholar), caused an increase in the length of AChR clusters (supplemental Fig. S1B). Thus, canonical Wnt signaling may play a negative role in regulating the formation of AChR clusters. Wnt3a Promotes Dispersion of AChR Clusters in Cultured Muscle Cells—Next, we determined the effect of Wnt3a on the stability of AChR clusters. C2C12 myotubes were first treated with Agrin for 6 h to induce the formation of AChR clusters and subsequently switched to Agrin-free medium containing either Wnt3a-conditioned medium or DKK1 or both of them for the next 12 h (Fig. 2A). We found that Wnt3a significantly decreased the total length of AChR clusters (Fig. 2, B and C) and cluster numbers in all sizes (Fig. 2D), suggesting that Wnt3a treatment induced declustering of AChRs. The reduction in AChR cluster size and number by Wnt3a was ameliorated in DKK1-treated cells (Fig. 2, B-D) with the effect of DKK1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C), suggesting the specificity of the Wnt3a effect. Interestingly, under the condition without Wnt3a, DKK1 treatment caused a mild, but significant, increase in the size and number of AChR clusters (Fig. 2, B and D), suggesting a role of endogenous Wnt in AChR cluster dispersion. These observations are in line with the notion that Wnt3a acts as a negative factor for the stabilization of AChR clusters. Wnt Signaling Down-regulates the Level of Rapsyn—Given the finding that Wnt3a inhibits and destabilizes AChR clusters, we further investigated the mechanism of Wnt3a action. It is known that Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates target gene expression (32Willert K. Nusse R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar); we thus hypothesized that Wnt/β-catenin signaling may regulate AChR clustering by modulating expression of synaptic genes at the NMJ. To test this hypothesis, C2C12 myotubes were treated with Wnt3a-conditioned medium (containing ∼40 ng/ml Wnt3a) or LiCl (20 mm), an inhibitor of GSK3β, both of which activate Wnt canonical pathway and stabilize β-catenin. As expected, treatment with either Wnt3a or LiCl caused an elevation of β-catenin in muscle cells (Fig. 3, A, B, and D). Interestingly, these treatments caused a reduction of Rapsyn (Fig. 3, A, C, and D) without altering the levels of other synaptic proteins, such as AChR or MuSK (Fig. 3A). The effect of Wnt3a or LiCl on Rapsyn levels was not due to the influence on muscle differentiation, since myosin heavy chain, which is a marker for differentiated myotubes, was not affected by Wnt3a or LiCl (Fig. 3, A and D). That LiCl down-regulates Rapsyn suggests a mechanism by which LiCl prevents Agrin from inducing the formation of AChR clusters, as shown in a previous report (33Sharma S.K. Wallace B.G. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 54: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that Wnt/β-catenin signaling negatively regulates AChR clustering, probably by down-regulating the expression of Rapsyn. Up-regulation of β-Catenin Inhibits the Formation of AChR Clusters—Since Wnt3a treatment resulted in elevation of β-catenin (Fig. 3) and inhibited AChR clustering (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1), we investigated the role of β-catenin in AChR clustering. C2C12 myotubes were transfected with plasmid encoding constitutively stabilized β-catenin, a mutated form of β-catenin with four serine/threonine residues (Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, and Ser45) changed to alanine, which is believed to be resistant to proteasome-mediated degradation (34Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar), and then treated with Agrin to induce the formation of AChR clusters (Fig. 4A). In comparison with cells transfected with empty vector and EGFP, the cells overexpressing β-catenin exhibited reduced responsiveness to Agrin stimulation, since the total length of AChR clusters or cluster number was decreased in these cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, up-regulation of β-catenin inhibits AChR clustering. Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Inhibits Rapsyn Gene Expression—Given the finding that Wnt3a or LiCl treatment decreased the protein level of Rapsyn in muscle cells (Fig. 3), we further examined whether Wnt/β-catenin signaling affects transcription of Rapsyn by using quantitative PCR or promoter reporter assays. We found that the level of Rapsyn mRNA was decreased in C2C12 myotubes treated with LiCl (Fig. 5A), a GSK3β inhibitor that increased β-catenin levels (as shown in Fig. 3D) and is believed to inhibit AChR clustering (33Sharma S.K. Wallace B.G. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 54: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To further investigate the negative role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in Rapsyn expression, we generated a reporter construct, R5k-Luc, that contains the 5605-nt 5′-flanking region of the Rapsyn gene and the downstream cDNA encoding firefly luciferase. The relative luciferase activity of the reporter over co-transfected Renilla luciferase encoded by pRL-TK was measured in C2C12 myotubes. Cultured myotubes transfected with R5k-Luc and pRL-TK (10:1) were treated with Wnt3a-conditioned medium for 36 h or LiCl for 12 h, respectively, and then lysed for reporter assay. We found that both Wnt3a and LiCl showed an inhibitory effect on Rapsyn promoter activity (Fig. 5, B and C). Similarly, transfection of C2C12 cells with active β-catenin also caused a reduction in Rapsyn promoter activity, with an effect in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5D). In contrast, transfection with β-catenin siRNAs, which were shown to knock down the expression of co-transfected β-catenin (Fig. 5E), caused an increase in Rapsyn promoter activity (Fig. 5F). Normally, β-catenin functions as a co- transcription factor for T-cell-specific transcription factor (TCF)-directed transcription (35Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar). As expected, transfection of β-catenin caused a marked increase in the reporter activity of Top Flash, an indicator for Wnt canonical signaling (35Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of the dominant negative form of TCF, DN-TCF, which loses responsiveness to β-catenin, inhibited β-catenin-induced reporter activity of Top Flash (Fig. 5H). However, under our experimental conditions, neither wild-type TCF nor DN-TCF appeared to have any effect on Rapsyn promoter activity (Fig. 5, D and G). Expression of DN-TCF had no effect on β-catenin-mediated suppression of Rapsyn promoter activity (Fig. 5G). To further determine whether the suppression effect of β-catenin is through the TCF-binding motifs in the Rapsyn promoter, we generated mutations on these sites. There are three consensus TCF-binding sites (TCAAAG) in the 5605-nt 5′-flanking region of the Rapsyn gene (supplemental Fig. S2A). We found that Rapsyn reporter constructs with the deletion of individual or all three TCF-binding sites had similar responsiveness to β-catenin up-regulation (supplemental Fig. S2B). Together, these results suggest the TCF-independent activity of β-catenin in inhibiting Rapsyn gene expression. In line with this notion, expressing DN-TCF in C2C12 myotubes had no effect on Agrin-induced formation of AChR clusters (supplemental Fig. S3). Wnt3a Acts through Down-regulating Rapsyn Expression to Disperse AChR Clusters—The expression of Rapsyn is shown above to be inhibited by Wnt3a and β-catenin. To further examine whether the dispersing effect of Wnt3a is indeed caused by the reduction of Rapsyn expression, we reconstituted the expression of Rapsyn driven by a promoter that does not respond to Wnt regulation in cells with Rapsyn knockdown. We took advantage of Rapsyn-siRNA that has been shown to knock down the expression of Rapsyn (8Chen F. Qian L. Yang Z.H. Huang Y. Ngo S.T. Ruan N.J. Wang J. Schneider C. Noakes P.G. Ding Y.Q. Mei L. Luo Z.G. Neuron. 2007; 55: 247-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). As expected, transfection of Rapsyn-siRNA prevented Agrin from inducing the formation of AChR clusters (Fig. 6B). To reconstitute the expression of Rapsyn in cells with Rapsyn knockdown, we generated an HA-tagged construct harboring a mutated DNA sequence of Rapsyn that was resistant to siRNA knockdown, hereafter referred as Rap-HA-res233 (Fig. 6A, lane 3). Overexpression of Rap-HA-res233 partially prevented the failure in the formation of AChR clusters caused by Rap-siRNA233 (Fig. 6C, compare rows 2 and 3 from the top). However, wild-type of Rapsyn had no rescue effect, presumably due to the effectiveness of siRNA in down-regulating Rapsyn expression. The apparent reduction in both total length and number of AChR clusters in cells co-transfected with Rap-HA-res and Rap-siRNA compared with cells transfected with vehicle plasmids (Fig. 6, D and E) was probably due to the aberrant stoichiometry between exogenous Rapsyn and endogenous AChRs. It is believed that the 1:1 stoichiometry of AChR and Rapsyn in muscle cells is important for AChR cluster formation (36LaRochelle W.J. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5270-5274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Yoshihara C.M. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both decreased and notably increased expression of Rapsyn have been shown to disrupt AChR clustering in myotubes (37Yoshihara C.M. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 169-179Crossref Pub"

The alveolar epithelium is responsible for maintaining effective gas exchange and is composed of two morphologically distinct types of cells referred to as type 1 (AT1) 2The abbreviations used are:AT1alveolar type 1AT2alveolar type 2ENaCepithelial sodium channelECLE. crista-galli LectinpSpicosiemensCFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorPBSphosphatebuffered salineDHEdihydroethidiumHSChighly selective channelsNSCnon-selective channels. 2The abbreviations used are:AT1alveolar type 1AT2alveolar type 2ENaCepithelial sodium channelECLE. crista-galli LectinpSpicosiemensCFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorPBSphosphatebuffered salineDHEdihydroethidiumHSChighly selective channelsNSCnon-selective channels. and type 2 (AT2) cells. AT1 cells are believed to be terminally differentiated squamous cells and cover >95% of the alveolar surface with extensive flattened processes. In the past type 1 cells have been thought to be predominantly responsible for gas exchange and possibly water permeability. Our research efforts, however, reveal that type 1 cells play a more complex role in the alveoli. Type 2 cells are easily discernable from the long, flask-shaped type 1 cells in the alveolar epithelium because they tend to be located at the corners of the alveoli (covering only 2-5% of the alveolar surface) and are cuboidally shaped. In addition to contributing to net fluid transport, type 2 cells are responsible for surfactant synthesis (14Fehrenbach H. Respir. Res. 2001; 2: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) and are considered to be progenitors of AT1 cells (3Cheek J.M. Evans M.J. Crandall E.D. Exp.

Together the two cell types (AT1 and AT2 cells) provide an effective barrier against leakage of water and solutes into the airspace by maintaining a thin fluid layer on the luminal surface of the alveoli, promoting proper gas exchange. The thickness of the fluid layer must be maintained within very narrow limits to allow for proper oxygenation of the blood. We and others have shown that epithelial sodium channels play a critical role in maintaining lung fluid clearance under both normal conditions and in the event of lung injury. For instance, α-ENaC subunit knock-out mice die within 40 h of birth due to an inability to clear lung fluid (21Hummler E. Barker P. Gatzy J. Beermann F. Verdumo C. Schmidt A. Boucher R. Rossier B.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of normal transepithelial Na+ transport in the neonatal lung. Moreover, we have shown that therapeutic agents, such as dopamine (18Helms M.N. Chen X.J. Ramosevac S. Eaton D.C. Jain L. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2006; 290: 710-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Helms M.N. Self J. Bao H.F. Job L.C. Jain L. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol.

Physiol. 2002; 282: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (all commonly used to treat respiratory illnesses) have significant effects on lung ENaC function. Hence, a better understanding of lung ENaC regulation will lead to a greater understanding of how the alveoli maintain a clear breathing space. In addition to actively transporting salt, AT1 and AT2 cells must be able to sense and immediately respond to changes in oxygen tension as well as harmful pollutants such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in inspired air. Therefore, it is particularly important to understand redox signaling in the alveoli, especially as it relates to normal ENaC function. Several studies have indeed suggested that ENaC activity may be regulated by changes in oxygen tension or by the associated increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (such as the superoxide anion, O2.¯) after an increase in oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial activity. For example, at birth an increase in O2 tension contributes to increased Na+ reabsorption, which helps clear the newborn lung of excess fluid (for review, see Ref. 12Elias N. O’Brodovich H. NeoReviews. 2006; 7: e88-e94Crossref Google Scholar)). O’Brodovich and co-workers (29Rafii B. Tanswell A.K. Otulakowski G. Pitkanen O. Belcastro-Taylor R. O’Brodovich H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L764-L770PubMed Google Scholar) and Matalon co-workers (31Thome U.H. Davis I.C. Nguyen S.V. Shelton B.J. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2003; 284: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have shown experimentally that maintaining rat fetal distal lung cells in high (20%) O2 concentrations increased ENaC mRNA (29Rafii B.

Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2003; 284: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) expression. In fetal lung cells, a switch from low PO2 to high PO2 environments increases amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current and also increases total ENaC protein expression (1Baines D.L. Ramminger S.J.

Physiol. 2003; 284: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Conversely, in adult rat alveolar type 2 cells, hypoxic culture conditions decreases amiloride-sensitive 22Na+ influx as well as α,β- and γ-ENaC mRNA expression and α-ENaC protein levels (28Planes C. Escoubet B. Blot-Chabaud M. Friedlander G. Farman N. Clerici C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, oxygen signaling is important in ENaC regulation; however, it remains unclear whether the regulation results from direct changes in PO2 or the associated increases in O2.¯ production after elevated oxygen tension. In our present study we successfully made single channel recordings from alveolar type 2 cells from live lung tissue (as we have recently done in type 1 cells) using cell-attached patch clamp to further investigate redox signaling in the alveoli. In addition to allowing us to make comparisons between ENaC regulatory processes in AT1 and AT2 cells, this novel approach also allows us to validate the standard use of cultured cells as models for type 1 and 2 cell transport properties. By examining the individual transport properties of each cell type as would naturally occur in tissue slices, we gain a better understanding of how type 1 and 2 cells work together in the alveoli to regulate net ion transport and balance lung fluid levels. Our results indicate that type 1 and 2 cells share similar biophysical properties yet display distinctly different cellular responses to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Lung Tissue Preparation—We have recently recorded single channel activity from live rat lung tissue (19Helms M.N. Self J. Bao H.F. Job L.C. Jain L. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2006; 291: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Using similar methodologies, we have characterized the single channel properties and redox response of alveolar type 1 and 2 cells in slices of rat lung tissue. Briefly, we housed male Sprague-Dawley rats with access to standard rat diet and water ad libitum. Between weeks 8 and 12, animals were anesthetized and killed for experimentation in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines. All animal protocols conform to National Institutes of Health animal care and use guidelines and were approved by Emory University IACUC. After lung perfusion via the pulmonary artery with 75 ml of PBS, 2% low melting point agarose in PBS (kept warm in a 35 °C water bath) was intratracheally instilled into the lungs to expand airspaces and to provide support for the tissue during the slicing process. Excised lungs were removed en bloc and iced to solidify the agarose before mounting onto a vibratory microtome (model VT1000S, Leica Microsystems). The Vibratome blade was set to high frequency, slow forward advancement, and 250-300 μm for lung slice preparations. Immediately after the lung slice procedure, tissue for patch clamp recordings was placed in 50:50 ice-cold Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 (containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 μm dexamethasone, 84 μm gentamicin, and 20 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin). Lung slices were treated and patched within 6 h of the initial tissue preparation. Single-channel Patch Clamp Analysis of Na+ Channels in Alveolar Cells—Lung slices were thoroughly washed in patch clamp solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Alveolar epithelial cells on the top surface of lung tissue slices were brought into focus using a Nikon inverted microscope with Hoffman modulation contrast under a 40× objective. Gigohm seals were formed on type 1 or 2 cells using a fire-polished glass microelectrode back-filled with patch solution, and lung slices were kept immersed in the same patch solution. An Axopatch 1-D (Molecular Devices) amplifier interfaced through an analog-to-digital board to a personal computer collected single-channel data. Channel currents were recorded at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz with a low-pass Bessel filter. For cell attached patches, voltages are given as the negative of the patch pipette potential (-Vp), which is the displacement of the patch potential from the resting potential. Positive potentials represent depolarizations, and negative potentials represent hyperpolarization of the cell membrane away from the resting potential. We used the product of the number of channels (N) and the single-channel open probability (Po) as a measure of ENaC activity within a patch as described in Yu et al. (33Yu L. Bao H.F. Self J.L. Eaton D.C. Helms M.N. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). NPo was calculated using FETCHAN and Clampfit 10.1 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Chemicals Used in Patch Clamp Analysis—The nitric oxide donor, l-propanamine 3,2-hydroxy-2-nitroso-1-propylhidrazino (PAPA-NONOate) rapidly releases 2 m NO per mol of parent compound and is available commercially from Caymen Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Local concentrations of O2.¯ were increased in alveolar type 2 cells with 1 μg/ml Ethiolat, a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase inhibitor purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Fluorescent Microscopy—Alveolar type 2 cells were positively identified by labeling lung slice preparations either with surfactant protein A-specific antibody (purchased from Chemicon, Billerica, MA), rat type II antibody developed by Dr. Leland Dobbs (10Dobbs L.G. Pian M.S. Maglio M. Dumars S. Allen L. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 1997; 273: 347-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or LysoTracker Red (available commercially from Invitrogen), which recognizes the lamellar bodies in type 2 cells that are not present in alveolar type 1 cells (as described in Refs. (13Fang X. Song Y. Zemans R. Hirsch J. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2004; 287: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Haller T. Ortmayr J. Friedrich F. Volkl H.

Physiol. 2002; 282: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)). When used to label AT2 cells for single-channel recording purposes, Lysotracker Red was diluted 1:1000 directly into the patch solution in which the lung tissue was immersed. For immunolocalization of type 2 cells, lung slices were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min at room temperature) and then labeled with a 1:1000 dilution (in PBS-bovine serum albumin with 3% goat serum) of surfactant protein A or 1:100 dilution of rat type 2 antibody. Lung slices were then incubated in goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 568 (1:20,000 dilution; Molecular Probes) for 30 min. Fluorescein-labeled lectin from the crybaby tree Erythrina crista-galli Lectin (ECL; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used to label AT1 cells in lung slice preparations as well as transdifferentiated “AT1-like” cells. Detailed methods for labeling of type 1 cells using ECL can be found in Helms et al. (19Helms M.N. Self J. Bao H.F. Job L.C. Jain L. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2006; 291: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All tissue samples were mounted onto a glass slide with ProLong antifade reagent (Molecular Probes) and imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope (model 510 NLO META, Carl Zeiss, Maple Grove, MN). Measurement of O2.¯ Release—Dihydroethidium (DHE; purchased from Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) is a fluorescent probe that intercalates into DNA and has an excitation wavelength of 520 nm and an emission of 610 nm. We have recently established that 2-hydroxyethidium production from DHE can be used as a quantitative measure of O2.¯ production in epithelial monolayers (33Yu L. Bao H.F. Self J.L. Eaton D.C. Helms M.N. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Additionally, other groups have shown that DHE measurements can be used to measure changes in intracellular O2.¯ levels in cultured cells and frozen tissue sections (8Dikalov S. Griendling K.K. Harrison D.G. Hypertension. 2007; 49: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 27Munzel T. Afanas’ev I.B. Kleschyov A.L. Harrison D.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1761-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In this study alveolar type 2 cells were isolated using methodologies described in Dobbs et al. (9Dobbs L.G. Gonzalez R. Williams M.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 134: 141-145PubMed Google Scholar) and Jain et al. (24Jain L. Chen X.J. Ramosevac S. Brown L.A. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: 646-658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in culture for up to 7 days in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12-50/50 media with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 20 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 84 μm gentamycin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 10 ng/ml keratinocyte growth factor/fibroblast growth factor-7 growth factors for O2.¯ measurements. Before O2.¯ levels were measured, cells were rinsed with PBS and then incubated with 2 μm DHE in PBS solution for 30 min in a light-protected humidified 5% CO2 chamber maintained at 37 °C. After DHE labeling, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and sealed between a glass slide and coverslip with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) mounting medium. DHE fluorescence was detected and quantified with a Zeiss LSM 510 NLO META laser scanning confocal microscope and compatible LSM 5 Image Browser software. Western Blot Analysis—Standard Western blot analysis was used to demonstrate that alveolar type 2 cells cultured on plastic begin to express proteins that are specific for type 1 cells as early as 72 h in culture. Briefly, protein lysate was electrophoresed on a 7.5% acrylamide gel under denaturing conditions and then transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 70 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween) with 5% dry milk and then incubated with rat type I-40 specific antibody (obtained from Dr. Leland Dobbs (11Dobbs L.G. Williams M.C. Gonzalez R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 970: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and used at 1:100-fold dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. IgG-alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary antibody (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was added at a concentration of 1 μg/10 ml of TBST and incubated for another 1 h at room temperature. After being washed thoroughly, alkaline phosphatase (AP) signal was detected using CDP-Star chemiluminescent substrate for AP (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Blots were analyzed on a Kodak Image Station 2000MM (Carestream Molecular Imaging, New Haven, CT) and compatible Kodak MI software. Methods for Statistical Analysis—ENaC Po values were examined before and after the redox state of the cell had been pharmacologically altered in either alveolar type 1 or type 2 cells. Therefore, the same patch clamp recording before drug treatment could be used as its own control, and statistical significance could be determined by paired t test analysis, with p values <0.05 considered significant. Statistical significance for O2.¯ release was determined using one-way analysis of variance and the post hoc Holm-Sidak test, with p ≤ 0.05 assumed to be statistically significant. Immunolocalization of Alveolar Cells for Patch Clamp Analysis—We have recently reported epithelial Na+ transport properties of alveolar type 1 cells in lung tissue slices, which represent a novel and physiologically relevant model for studying the ion transport mechanism responsible for lung fluid balance. Here, we report for the first time ion transport properties of type 2 cells in the same model. We positively identified type 2 cells in lung slices by labeling type 2 cells with either polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 1, A and C) or vital cell-permeable dyes. Our immunohistochemical data identified the cuboidal cells, located at the junction of type 1 cells, for patch clamp analysis. Fig. 1A shows that the cells identified are indeed secreting surfactant protein A, an essential protein for lung compliance produced only by type 2 cells. LysoTracker Red (Fig. 1, B, 40× magnification, and D, 100× magnification) is a vital dye that can permeate the cell membrane and binds to spherical organelles with low internal pH or surfactant-producing lamellar bodies in type 2 cells (not found in type 1 cells). In Fig. 1C, we additionally verified that type 2 cells were indeed immunoreactive with specific rat type II-70 (RTII-70) antibody, which has been extensively characterized by others as a type 2-specific marker. Alongside each panel of labeled alveolar type 2 cells (using either LysoTracker Red, surfactant protein A, or rat type II-70 antibodies in 1A-C), we also counter-labeled alveolar type 1 cells with ECL to contrast the distinct morphology and localization of type 1 and type 2 cells. Single Channel Activity in Alveolar Type 2 Cells in Lung Slices—We have measured for the first time single channel activity from type 2 cells in situ and found that type 2 cells indeed have functional epithelial sodium channels with highly selective and non-selective transport properties when accessed from live lung tissue. A representative single channel trace is shown in Fig. 2A at −60 through +60 mV (-Vp) holding potentials. Figs. 2, B and C, shows current-voltage relationships that are typical of highly selective channels (HSC) and non-selective channels (NSC), respectively. For clarity, we enlarged a portion of the recording taken at −80 mV (-Vp) in Fig. 2D highlighting both the smaller conducting HSC as well as the larger NSC, found within the same patch of cell surface membrane. Additionally, in Fig. 2E we generated an all-points histogram (and fitted the data to a Gaussian function) from the representative trace in Fig. 2D to show that, indeed, HSCs and NSCs are present in alveolar type 2 cells patch-clamped from our lung slice model, and on occasion are both opened simultaneously. We also observed channels that have the electrophysiological properties commonly associated with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channels in our cell-attached recordings. Fig. 2F shows a representative patch clamp recording of anion channels in type 2 cells (using the same conditions used to examine Na+ current). In this trace the downward deflections likely represent Cl- movement across the cellular membrane. The gating of this channel, with quick bursts of activity interrupted by brief flickering closures, is not different from the normal channel characteristics of CFTR that have been described by others (23Yue H. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10030-10034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Sheppard D.N. Gray M.A. Gong X. Sohma Y. Kogan I. Benos D.J.

The conductance of this anion channel is shown in Fig. 2G; there are three open levels fit by gaussian distributions, with a calculated conductance of 10 pS that is also characteristic of CFTR. We estimate that these channels occur in less than 5% of total cell recordings. Distribution of Conductances Recorded from Lung Cells—To compare the distribution of conductances between AT1 and AT2 cells, we generated a histogram of conductances in the two cell types using the same intervals and then fitted the histograms to two Gaussian functions. In Fig. 3 the normal distribution of Na+ channel conductances obtained from type 2 cells is compared with the conductances of cation channels found in type 1 cells (19Helms M.N. Self J. Bao H.F. Job L.C. Jain L. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2006; 291: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The conductances were calculated from the linear portion of the I-V curves (between −20 and −80 mV) measured in type 1 and 2 cells under control conditions. The fits show that both type 1 and type 2 cells have HSC and NSC channels with similar conductances in lung slices. The ratios of HSC:NSC are 1.5 ± 0.16 and 0.95 ± 0.19 for type 2 and 1 cells, respectively. Seemingly, HSCs occur more frequently in type 2 cells, and both types of channels are present with equal frequency in alveolar type 1 cells. In a recent review we describe amiloride-sensitive channels with high, moderate, or no selectivity for Na+ over K+ in the apical membranes of epithelial cells (26Matalon S. Lazrak A. Jain L. Eaton D.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 93: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Hence, reports of NSCs and HSCs in cultured and primary cell models previously reported are not different from what we currently describe in alveolar type 1 and type 2 cells patch clamped from lung tissue. Reactive Nitrogen Signaling in the Alveolar Epithelium—Our previous research has identified nitric oxide as a negative regulator of Na+ channel function in cultured cells (20Helms M.N. Yu L. Malik B.

However, nitric oxide signaling in type 1 cells has not been examined at a single channel level. It is important to test the effect of nitric oxide on sodium transport properties of all cells that make up the alveolar epithelium in live tissue slices, as inhibition of ENaC may lead to undesirable effects related to lung edema clearance. This is also particularly important since inhaled NO is currently being used to treat pulmonary hypertension in newborns and older patients. Fig. 4, A and B, shows that PAPA-NONOate significantly decreased sodium transport in AT2 cells patched from lung slices but failed to alter ENaC NPo in AT1 cells. In 18 independent patch clamp studies of type 2 cells accessed in situ, 1.5 μm PAPANONOate significantly decreased ENaC NPo from control values of 1.38 ± 0.26 to 0.82 ± 0.16 (p < 0.05). Higher concentrations of the NO donor (500 μm) further decreased ENaC NPo values to 0.37 ± 0.22 in type 2 cells. In type 1 cells, however, ENaC NPo values did not differ from control values of 0.63 ± 0.12 when either 1.5 or 500 μm nitric oxide donor was applied to the bath media. We show segments of the single channel recordings from more than 20 min of recording after nitric oxide treatment in AT2 and AT1 cells in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Fig. 5 shows that before 1.5 μm nitric oxide application to the patch clamp bath, the probability of seeing HSC and NSC channels in AT2 cells is greater than after NO treatment. Approximately 20 min after the initial application of 1.5 μm nitric oxide treatment, ENaC activity was still detectable albeit significantly lower than untreated levels in several AT2 cell recordings (data not shown). Therefore, we increased the concentration of nitric oxide releasing compound to 500 μm ∼22 min into the recording time (where indicated in Fig. 5). Increasing the concentration of nitric oxide treatment by 100-fold led to a further significant decrease in ENaC activity in type 2 cells. Interestingly, however, neither 1.5 nor 500 μm nitric oxide treatment changed ENaC NPo in alveolar type 1 cells (shown in Fig. 6). Together, these results indicate that nitric oxide signaling mechanisms in alveolar type 1 and type 2 cells differ considerably.FIGURE 5AT2; nitric oxide decreases lung ENaC activity in alveolar type 2 cells patched from lung slice preparation.

A host of proteins, including Gα subunits, Ric-8, AGS3, regulators of G-protein signalings, and scaffolding proteins, coordinate this vital cellular process. Ric-8A, acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, catalyzes the release of GDP from various Gα·GDP subunits and forms a stable nucleotide-free Ric-8A:Gα complex. AGS3, a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), binds and stabilizes Gα subunits in their GDP-bound state. Because Ric-8A and AGS3 may recognize and compete for Gα·GDP in this pathway, we probed the interactions of a truncated AGS3 (AGS3-C; containing only the residues responsible for GDI activity), with Ric-8A:Gαil and that of Ric-8A with the AGS3-C:Gαil·GDP complex. Pulldown assays, gel filtration, isothermal titration calorimetry, and rapid mixing stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy indicate that Ric-8A catalyzes the rapid release of GDP from AGS3-C:Gαi1·GDP. Thus, Ric-8A forms a transient ternary complex with AGS3-C:Gαi1·GDP. Subsequent dissociation of AGS3-C and GDP from Gαi1 yields a stable nucleotide free Ric-8A·Gαi1 complex that, in the presence of GTP, dissociates to yield Ric-8A and Gαi1·GTP. AGS3-C does not induce dissociation of the Ric-8A·Gαi1 complex, even when present at very high concentrations.

Studies of fertilized eggs from Caenorhabditis elegans show that mutational inactivation of Gα subunits GOA-1 and GPA-16 leads to defective astral microtubule motion, indicating that these two proteins are vital for the proper positioning of the mitotic spindle (19Bringmann H.

Biochemical characterization of Ric-8 and GPR/GoLoco motif proteins indicate that they respectively exhibit GEF and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitory (GDI) activity toward Gα. The mammalian 60-kDa protein Ric-8A, identified as a Gα-binding protein by yeast two-hybrid analysis, has been shown in vitro to bind to resting state (GDP-bound) Gαi1, Gαq, and Gαo and catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP (and slowly hydrolyzing analogs of GTP) (32Tall G.G. Krumins A.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8356-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Ric-8A forms a stable complex with nucleotide-free Gαi1 that dissociates in the presence of GTP, releasing Gαi1·GTP (32Tall G.G. Krumins A.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8356-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although the action of Ric-8A on Gα subunits resembles that of a G-protein-coupled receptor, Ric-8A does not directly compete with the receptor for Gαi1·GDP as it does not recognize Gαi1·GDP in a Gβγ-bound heterotrimeric state (32Tall G.G. Krumins A.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8356-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, human embryonic kidney cells (292T) transfected with Ric-8A-specific short interfering RNA exhibited a suppression of Gαq-coupled/receptor-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, indicating that Ric-8A may also potentiate Gαq-mediated signaling (33Nishimura A.

A recently identified class of regulators, typified by “activator of G-protein signaling 3” (AGS3), which bears four GPR/GoLoco signature motifs, has been shown to possess GDI activity similar to that of Gβγ subunits (34Peterson Y.K.

The N-terminal portion of AGS3 consists of seven tetratricopeptide repeats that are implicated in cellular trafficking of protein binding partners (34Peterson Y.K. Bernard M.L. Ma H. Hazard III, S.

An N-terminally truncated variant of AGS3 produced by alternative or trans-mRNA splicing, comprising only the GPR/GoLoco motifs of AGS3, has been found in mammalian heart (39Pizzinat N. Takesono A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16601-16610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This variant of AGS3 possesses the C-terminal three GPR/GoLoco motifs but encodes only half of the first GPR/GoLoco motif present in the full-length AGS3. For this work, we have used a synthetic short form of AGS3 (AGS3-C) that encodes all four GPR/GoLoco motifs (35Natochin M. Lester B. Peterson Y.K. Bernard M.L. Lanier S.M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40981-40985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Earlier thermodynamic studies have shown that all four GPR/GoLoco motifs of AGS3-C bind cooperatively to Gαi1·GDP and form a stable AGS3-C:[Gαi1·GDP]4 complex (40Adhikari A. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51825-51832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For simplicity, we henceforth refer to this complex as AGS3-C:Gαi1·GDP. The structure of the complex between the GPR/GoLoco peptide of RGS14 and Gαi1·GDP reveals that GPR/GoLoco motifs function as GDIs by interacting with the switch II regions and the α3 helix of the Gαi1 Ras-like domain (41Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The arginine residue located in the highly conserved Asp-Gln-Arg (DQR) triad in the GPR/GoLoco motif inserts into the GDP-binding site and interacts with the β-phosphate of GDP, thereby preventing the release of GDP from Gαi1 subunits. The interplay between the GEF activity of Ric-8A and the GDI effect of GPR/GoLoco proteins on Gα subunits was recently demonstrated (42Tall G.G. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16584-16589Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). LGN, a paralog of AGS3, and microtubule-binding nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) were shown to interact with and stabilize Gαi1·GDP in a Gαi1·GDP:LGN:NuMA complex (43Du Q. Macara I.G. Cell. 2004; 119: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The Gαi1·GDP subunits in this complex are proposed to be substrates for the GEF activity of Ric-8A. Although this study provides evidence that Ric-8A forms a transient complex with Gαi1·GDP:LGN:NuMA, it does not preclude the possibility that Ric-8A is a direct competitor of LGN for a common binding site on Gαi1·GDP. These alternative models could have different implications for the roles of Ric-8A and GPR/GoLoco proteins in the putative receptor-independent regulatory events mediated by Gα (42Tall G.G. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16584-16589Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this biophysical study we show that Ric-8A acts catalytically on Gαi1·GDP complexed with AGS3-C to effect nucleotide exchange. We utilize fluorescence labeling and thermodynamic and enzyme kinetic analysis to show that Ric-8A forms a transient multimeric complex with AGS3-C:Gαi1·GDP. This intermediate then decays to a stable, nucleotide-free Ric-8A·Gαi1 heterodimer after liberating AGS3-C and GDP. The inhibitory effect of AGS3-C on the interaction between Ric-8A and Gαi1·GDP is not strong enough to abrogate Ric-8A GEF activity. Further experiments indicate that AGS3-C cannot reassociate with the nucleotide-free Ric-8A·Gαi1 complex, indicating that this reaction pathway proceeds in a unidirectional manner.

The expression vector was transformed into Escherichia coli Bl21(DE3)-RIPL cells and grown in LB media containing ampicillin (120 mg/liter) and induced with 300 μm of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 °C. After overnight growth at 20 °C, cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 2 mm PMSF) and lysed in a French press (Avanti cell disrupter). The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation and loaded onto a packed column containing 5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare). After extensive washing with lysis buffer, Ric-8At was cleaved from the resin overnight at 4 °C using a quantity of TEV protease corresponding to 10% of the total GST fusion protein estimated to be on the resin. TEV-digested protein was eluted from the GST-Sepharose 4B resin with elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, and 2 mm PMSF) and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialysate was loaded onto a UNO-Q matrix (Bio-Rad) and eluted with a 0–500 mm NaCl gradient on an AKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare). Pure Ric-8At eluted from the matrix at 165–175 mm of NaCl. The protein was later found to be pure by SDS-PAGE analysis. The open reading frame of rat Gαi1 was amplified by PCR using attB-modified forward primer, encoding a TEV site N-terminal to the Gαi1 sequence, 5′-GGGGACAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTACGAAAACCTATACTTTCAGGGATGTACTCTTTCTGCTGAA-, and 3′-TTTTTATTAGAATTTCTAACACCAGAAAAAACTCTGGGTCGAAAGAACATGTTTCACCAGGGG-5′ as reverse primer. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the pDEST-15 destination vector to be expressed as a GST fusion protein using the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). Expression and TEV digestion protocols were similar to those used for Rat Ric-8At except that Gαi1 eluted at 130–140 mm of NaCl from the UNO-Q matrix. Hexahistidine-tagged Gαi1 encoded in a pQE60 vector was expressed in E. coli strain JM-109 and purified as described earlier (44Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The (W211A)Gαi1 mutant was generated using the QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene) using the pQE60 vector harboring wild type Gαi1 as a template. After sequencing to confirm the presence of the mutation, (W211A)Gαi1 was expressed and purified using the protocol developed for the wild type protein. Gαi1 and the (W211A)Gαi1 mutant proteins were utilized in nonmyristoylated form for all subsequent experiments. AGS3-C, comprising residues 465–650 of rat AGS3, was cloned into the pDEST-15 destination vector as a GST fusion protein using the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). A tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site was inserted between coding regions for GST and AGS3-C regions. AGS3-C was purified as described earlier (40Adhikari A. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51825-51832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was appended onto the 5′ end of human M19T Ric-8A by PCR sewing and inserted into the E. coli expression vector, pET28a (Novagen). This construct contained the following features: 5′-His6-NheI-YFP-EcoRI-Ric-8A-NotI-3′. His6-YFP-Ric-8A protein was expressed in E. coli similarly to Ric8-At (above). The protein was purified by successive nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen), Hi-trap Q, and Superdex gel filtration chromatographies (GE Biosciences). To synthesize the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-AGS3-C fusion protein, DNA encoding the C-terminal four GPR/GoLoco domains of rat AGS3 were amplified by PCR using the pDEST-15 vector that encoded AGS3 residues 465–650 (40Adhikari A. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51825-51832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The PCR product was cloned into the NotI/XbaI sites following the CFP coding region of CFP pCDNA3.1. A 24-amino acid linker was engineered between the CFP and AGS3-C sequences. The regions encoding CFP, the linker, and residues 465–650 of AGS3 were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pDEST-15 destination vector for expression as a GST fusion protein using the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). A tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site was inserted between coding regions of GST and CFP. The expression vector was transformed into Bl21DE3.RIPL cells, grown in LB media containing ampicillin (120 mg/liter), and expression was induced with 500 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 22 °C. After overnight growth, the cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 5 mm PMSF), lysed by sonication, and pelleted. The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a packed column containing 5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) resin. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, TEV protease corresponding to 10% of the GST fusion protein was added to the resin. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 4 °C overnight. The TEV-digested protein was eluted and dialyzed against buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, and 50 mm NaCl) to remove excess salt. The resulting CFP-AGS3-C was used for FRET assays without further purification. AGS3-C:Gαi1·GDP and AGS3-C:His6-Gαi1·GDP complexes were purified as described previously using a tandem Superdex 200/75 gel filtration matrix using an AKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare) (40Adhikari A. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51825-51832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Nucleotide-free Ric-8At:Gαi1 complex was generated by incubating equimolar concentrations of Ric-8At (500 μl of 150 μm protein) with Gαi1·GDP (500 μl of 150 μm protein) overnight in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 5 mm EDTA) containing 50 μl of immobilized alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) to hydrolyze released nucleotide, and gently rocked at 4 °C. The immobilized alkaline phosphatase was removed by centrifugation, and Ric-8At:Gαi1 complex was gel-filtered over tandem Superdex 200/75 gel filtration columns pre-equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min using an AKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare). [35S]GTPγS Binding Assays—Binding of [35S]GTPγS to Gαi1 or (W211A)Gαi1 was performed using a filter binding method (32Tall G.G. Krumins A.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8356-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Ric-8At or YFP-Ric-8A-catalyzed [35S]GTPγS binding reactions included 250 nm Ric-A8t or YFP-Ric-8A. AGS3-C or CFP-AGS3-C-inhibited binding reactions included 75 nm AGS3-C or CFP-AGS3-C. GTP binding reaction mixtures contained [35S]GTPγS at a final concentration of 10 μm. Binding reactions were initiated by addition of Gαi1 to a final concentration of 250 nm. Aliquots were quenched with ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm GTP, and 0.02% C12E10, applied to BA85 nitrocellulose filter, and subjected to scintillation counting. Control experiments were performed without the addition of Gαi1 to quantify nonspecific binding of [35S]GTPγS to Ric-8At and AGS3-C. All experiments were conducted using proteins purified from single batches of E. coli cells. Competition Assays—To assay displacement of AGS3-C from the AGS3-C:His6-Gαi1·GDP complex by Ric-8At, gel-filtered AGS3-C:His6-Gαi1·GDP complex (25 μm, dissolved in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT, and 50 μm GDP) was incubated for 2 h at 20°C with Ric-8At (100 μm) in a total volume of 150 μl and then allowed to bind to 50 μl of Ni2+ IMAC resin (Bio-Rad). The beads were washed three times with 400 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT, and 50 μm GDP), boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Samples of purified Ric-8At, AGS3-C, AGS3-C:His6- Gαi1·GDP, and Ric-8At:Gαi1 were run as standards. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye. To assay displacement of Ric-8At from the Ric-8At:Gαi1 complex by AGS3, gel-filtered Ric-8At:Gαi1 (25 μm suspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT, and 50 μm of GDP) complex was incubated for 2 h at 20 °C with AGS3-C (25 μm or 250 μm) and analyzed as described above. Gel Filtration Assays—AGS3C:Gαi1·GDP complex (14 μm complex in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 10 μm of GDP) was incubated for 2 h at 20 °C with Ric-8At (100 μm) in a total volume of 1 ml and loaded on a tandem Superdex 200/75 gel filtration matrix pre-equilibrated with running buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT). The column was run at a constant flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and fractions were collected. In a separate experiment, Ric-8At:Gαi1 complex (100 μm, suspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT) was incubated with AGS3-C (200 μm) in a total volume of 1 ml for 2 h at 20 °C and gel-filtered under the same conditions. Peak fractions of both runs were boiled with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye. Isothermal Titration Calorimery (ITC)—ITC experiments were performed using a VP-ITC (MicroCal) instrument. Fixed aliquots (8 μl) of Gαi1·GDP (200 μm) suspended in ITC buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 25 μm GDP) were injected into the calorimeter cell containing 1.43 ml of AGS3-C (6 μm) in ITC buffer, and the heats at binding were recorded. Alternatively, 8-μl aliquots of AGS3-C (350 μm) in ITC buffer were injected into the calorimeter cell containing 1.43 ml of Ric-8At:Gαi1 (10 μm) in ITC buffer. As a control experiment, 8-μl aliquots of Gαi1·GDP (200 μm) or 8-μl aliquots of 350 μm AGS3-C, both in ITC buffer, were injected into the calorimeter cell containing 1.43 ml of ITC buffer to measure the heats of protein dilution. Ric-8At Concentration-dependent Kinetics of Gαi1 Binding to GTPγS—Kinetics of Ric-8At-assisted binding of GTPγS to Gαi1 were followed by monitoring the change in intrinsic fluorescence of Gαi1 at 340 nm upon ex"
https://openalex.org/W2124029579,"The hyaluronic acid (HA) receptor for endocytosis (HARE) is the primary scavenger receptor for HA and chondroitin sulfates in mammals. The two human isoforms of HARE (full-length 315-kDa and a 190-kDa proteolytic cleavage product), which are type I single-pass membrane proteins, are highly expressed in sinusoidal endothelial cells of lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. Their identical HARE cytoplasmic domains contain four candidate AP-2/clathrin-mediated endocytic signaling motifs as follows: YSYFRI2485, FQHF2495, NPLY2519, and DPF2534 (315-HARE numbering). Stably transfected cells expressing 190-HARE(ΔYSYFRI), 190-HARE(ΔFQHF), or 190-HARE(ΔNPLY) (lacking Motifs 1, 2, or 3) had decreased 125I-HA endocytosis rates of ∼49, ∼39, and ∼56%, respectively (relative to wild type). In contrast, 190-HARE(ΔDPF) cells (lacking Motif 4) showed no change in HA endocytic rate. Deletions of motifs 1 and 2 or of 1, 2, and 4 decreased the rate of HA endocytosis by only ∼41%. Endocytosis was ∼95% decreased in mutants lacking all four motifs. Cells expressing a 190-HARE(Y2519A) mutant of the NPLY motif retained 85–90% of wild type endocytosis, whereas this mutation in the triple motif deletant decreased endocytosis to ∼7% of wild type. Tyr in NPLY2519 is thus important for endocytosis. All HARE mutants showed similar HA binding and degradation of the internalized HA, indicating that altering endocytic motifs did not affect ectodomain binding of HA or targeting of internalized HA to lysosomes. We conclude that, although NPLY may be the most important motif, it functions together with two other endocytic motifs; thus three signal sequences (YSYFRI, FQHF, and NPLY) provide redundancy to mediate coated pit targeting and endocytosis of HARE.

HA is found in essentially all vertebrate tissues, is often a major ECM constituent (1McDonald J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4575-4579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and is abundant in young skin, synovial fluid, vitreous humor of the eye, and other tissues (e.g. umbilical cord). The size range of HA (up to ∼107 Da) is much greater than other GAGs (<105 Da). Unlike other cell surface receptors for HA, such as CD44 and CD168, HARE mediates the rapid endocytosis of HA via the clathrin-coated pit pathway (2McGary C.T. Raja R.H. Weigel P.H. Biochem.

Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17341-17350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Despite its simple linear structure (i.e. a polymer of 2-deoxy,2-acetamido-d-glucopyranosyl-β(1,4)-d-glucuronopyranosyl-β(1,3) disaccharide units), HA is a very dynamic molecule, whose synthesis and degradation appear tightly regulated. Mammals degrade and resynthesize about one-third (∼5 g) of their total body HA daily. The metabolic half-life of HA varies from ∼1.5 day in skin (9Tammi R. Saamanen A.-M. Maibach H.I. Tammi M. Investig. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) to 2–3 weeks in cartilage (10Fraser J.R.E. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B.G. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). Similarly, circulating HA has a half-life of 2–5 min, because of its rapid clearance by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (10Fraser J.R.E. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B.G. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar, 11Fraser J.R.E. Laurent T.C. Pertoft H. Baxter E. Biochem. J. 1981; 200: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In mammals, large native HA (∼107 Da) in ECMs throughout the body is partially degraded to fragments of ∼106 Da that are released into lymphatic fluid and flow to lymph nodes where sinusoidal endothelial cells remove and degrade ∼85% of the HA. The remaining HA (∼15%) passes through the lymph nodes, enters the blood, and is removed by the liver via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Although HA turnover is high, HARE in sinusoidal endothelial cells of lymph nodes and liver keeps the steady-state HA concentration in blood low (10–100 ng/ml). A high level of HA in the blood circulation could elevate blood viscosity and impair the microcirculation in capillaries. Full-length hHARE is a 2551-aa type I single transmembrane glycoprotein (∼315 kDa in SDS-PAGE) encoded by the 180.2-kb STAB-2 gene on chromosome 12q23.3; the gene has 69 exons. HARE proteins were first purified from rat liver (12Zhou B. Oka J.A. Singh A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33831-33834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and human spleen (13Zhou B. McGary C.T. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of HARE are present in tissues (e.g. 190- and 315-kDa hHARE). The smaller HARE isoform is derived by proteolysis from the full-length protein (7Harris E.N. Kyosseva S.V. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

Both HARE isoforms are functional membrane receptors that bind and internalize ligands via the clathrin-coated pit pathway, targeting them to lysosomes for degradation (2McGary C.T. Raja R.H.

The 190-HARE (Fig. 1A) has a large extracellular domain (1323 aa), a transmembrane domain (21 aa), and a small (72 aa) COOH-terminal CD (13Zhou B. McGary C.T. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H.

The CD (Tyr2480–Leu2551) contains 17 aa that could be phosphorylated: four Tyr, seven Ser, one His, and five Thr. Only Ser2497, Ser2537, Thr2523, Tyr2519, and Tyr2531 are predicted to be phosphorylated (by NetPhos 2.0). The CD does not contain PEST sequences for rapid protein degradation and turnover or for O-glycosylation with GlcNAc. Endocytic receptors contain either single or multiple targeting sequences that direct the receptor-ligand complexes into a coated pit pathway (5Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 16Clague M.J. Urbe S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3075-3081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sorkin A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). There may be multiple coated pit pathways for internalizing and then creating different microenvironments for different receptor-ligand complexes so they are routed or assemble signaling complexes in different ways appropriate for the particular receptor (6Weigel P.H.

In contrast to single motif receptors, the HARE CD contains five putative endocytic motifs (Fig. 1 and Table 2): YSYF2483, YFRI2485, FQHF2495, NPLY2519, and DPF2534. The first three (YSYF, YFRI, and FQHF) are ΦXXB motifs; where Φ is either Tyr or Phe, X can be any aa, and B is a hydrophobic aa with a bulky side chain. The first two sequences are overlapping, located at the junction between the membrane and CD, and for practical reasons we consider them to be a single motif, YSYFRI2485. The functions of ΦXXB, NPXY, and DP(F/P) motifs in receptor internalization, trafficking, and delivery of ligand to lysosomes have been studied extensively in different receptors (Table 2). Many receptors contain NPXY motifs that facilitate rapid internalization of receptor-ligand complexes from the cell surface.TABLE 2Potential endocytic signals in HARE The candidate endocytic signals (M1–M4) in the HARE CD, their recognition partners, and potential functions are summarized.

Thus, we are interested in how HARE is targeted for internalization and intracellular routing. In this study, our goal was to determine which of the four candidate targeting motifs in the CD of HARE are important or critical for efficient endocytosis of HA by the coated pit pathway. The results indicate that three motifs are important, and thus provide substantial redundancy, for coated pit targeting and internalization.

PCR-assisted Site-directed Mutagenesis—Purified plasmid DNA (pSecTag/FRT/V5 His-TOPO; Invitrogen) containing 190-HARE cDNA (4248 bp) ligated into the BamHI site was used as a template to generate the different cDNA mutants (8Harris E.N. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36201-36209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Primers (Table 1) were designed for deletion or site-directed mutagenesis of coding regions for individual and multiple potential endocytic motifs in WT 190-HARE plasmid DNA. Mutagenesis PCRs were performed for 18 cycles (94 °C for 20 s, 55–65 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 9 min). Parental and newly generated plasmid DNAs were precipitated with 0.1 volume 3 m potassium acetate, pH 5.5, and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol. The DNA pellet was dissolved in 17 μl of water and digested with 5 units of DpnI overnight to eliminate parental DNA. After heat inactivation of DpnI, the DNA solution was used to transform TOP10 E. coli using standard manufacturer protocols. Bacterial colonies were picked, and potential 190-HARE mutant cDNAs were verified by PCR using gene-specific forward (5′-GTTCCATCTACGATCGCCACTGGGCCAG-3′) and vector-specific reverse (5′-CGTAGAATCGAGACCGAGGAG-3′) primers. The complete sequences of the promoter and complete coding regions of cDNAs in the final clones were determined to be correct before use in subsequent experiments. All 190-HARE mutants also contain COOH-terminal V5 and His6 epitopes.TABLE 1Primer sequences used to create mutations in the 190-HARE CD Deletion or substitution mutations were made as described under “Experimental Procedures” using the indicated forward (F) and reverse (R) primers.

Cells were incubated overnight in Growth Medium without hygromycin B, and then washed and fed with fresh Growth Medium for the first 3–4 days and then periodically when required. After 2 weeks, individual isolated colonies were collected and grown in 24-well plates until confluent. Clones were tested for HARE protein expression by SDS-PAGE, using 5% gels, followed by Western blot analysis (23Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar) with anti-V5 Ab. Each clone was also tested for correct insertion of the mutant pSecTag-190-kDa hHARE cDNA uniquely into the Flp-In recombination site by the Flp-In recombinase encoded by pOG44, as described previously (7Harris E.N.

At least 4–6 clones of each mutant were selected and characterized for further experiments. 125I-HA Binding Assays for Cell Surface and Intracellular Receptors—WT 190-HARE, EV, and mutant 190-HARE cell lines were grown to ∼90% confluence in Growth Medium in 12-well tissue culture plates. Cultured cells were washed with 1 ml of sterile PBS and 1 ml of serum-free DMEM and were incubated at 37 °C in 1 ml of serum-free medium for 1 h. After incubation, medium was removed, and the cells were washed with 2 ml of HBSS and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in Endocytosis Medium with 1.5 μg/ml 125I-HA with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled HA to assess nonspecific binding. To determine total HA binding (by cell surface and intracellular receptors), cells were permeabilized with 0.055% (w/v) digitonin (24Weigel P.H. Ray D.A. Oka J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Weigel P.H. McGary C.T. Weigel J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 363: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and incubated with 125I-HA ± unlabeled HA as above for 2 h at 4 °C. Media were aspirated, and the cells were washed rapidly three times with HBSS (2 ml per wash) to remove unbound 125I-HA. Cells were then lysed in 1 ml of 0.3 n NaOH, and radioactivity was measured using a Packard Cobra II gamma counter, and protein was determined by the method of Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using BSA as standard. Data are expressed as fmol/106 cells ± S.E. and normalized for HARE expression relative to WT HARE. Cell number was calculated based on 398 μg of total protein/106 cells (8Harris E.N. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36201-36209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Specific binding was calculated as binding without unlabeled HA (total) minus binding in the presence of unlabeled HA (nonspecific). Experiments were performed with each clone in triplicate. 125I-HA Internalization and Degradation Assays—To assess internalization of 125I-HA, WT 190-HARE, EV, and mutant HARE cell lines were grown to ∼90% confluence, washed, and incubated in serum-free medium as above. Cells were washed with 2 ml of HBSS and incubated at 37 °C in Endocytosis Medium containing 1.5 μg/ml 125I-HA with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled HA to assess nonspecific binding, for 2 or 4 h, unless noted otherwise. Medium was aspirated, and cells were washed three times with HBSS (2 ml each), solubilized with 1 ml of 0.3 n NaOH, and radioactivity and protein content were determined as above. Specific HA endocytosis or degradation was calculated as the mean value (as fmol/106 cells/HARE expression relative to WT HARE) without unlabeled HA (total) minus the value in the presence of unlabeled HA (non-specific). Each experiment was repeated 2–3 times with multiple clones. Degradation of internalized 125I-HA was measured using a cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation assay as described previously (26McGary C.T. Yannariello-Brown J. Kim D.W. Stinson T.C. Weigel P.H. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42802-42811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 0.3 n NaOH, and 100-μl samples were mixed at 22 °C with 47 μl of 0.6 n HCl, 28 μl of distilled water, and 125 μl of 2.0 mg/ml HA in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Cetylpyridinium chloride (300 μl of 6%; w/v) in distilled water was added, and the tubes were mixed by vortexing, and after 10 min, the samples were centrifuged (22 °C, 5 min, 9000 rpm) in a microcentrifuge, using a swinging bucket rotor. A supernatant sample (300 μl) was taken to determine radioactivity, and the rest was removed by aspiration. The tube tip containing the precipitated pellet was cut off and put in a gamma counter tube, and radioactivity was determined. Degradation values were calculated as the time-dependent increase of nonprecipitable radioactivity and are expressed as the percent (with WT as 100%) of specifically internalized 125I-HA that was degraded. Western and Ligand Blot Assays—To analyze and normalize for HARE expression in mutant cell lines, cells at ∼90% confluence in 6-well plates were washed twice with cold PBS and solubilized in Lysis Buffer. Lysates were mixed by vortexing, incubated on ice for 2 h, and centrifuged at 11,250 × g for 5 min to remove debris. Samples (25 μg of protein) were separated in 5% gels by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, followed by electro-transfer to nitrocellulose membranes for 1 h, 4 °C at 110 V in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, pH 7.4, and 20% (v/v) methanol. For Western blot analysis of WT and mutant 190-HARE protein, membranes were treated with TBST/BSA for 1 h, washed, and incubated with anti-V5Ab for 1 h at 22°C. Blots were washed three times (5 min each) with TBST/BSA, incubated with goat anti-rabbit Ab conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (or horse-radish peroxidase), washed three times with TBST/BSA, and incubated with p-nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine-conjugated Ab for color development using alkaline phosphatase. Reactions were stopped by washing the membrane with distilled water. For horseradish peroxidase detection, membranes were incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate and exposed to autoradiography film. For comparison of 190-HARE protein expression levels by mutant cell lines (with replicates of 4–6 clones per group), HARE band intensities in Western blots (with equal total cell protein loads) were quantified by densitometry using a FluoroChem8000 Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Corp, San Leandro, CA). Band intensities were normalized to parallel wild type 190-HARE samples and expressed as a percent of WT HARE expression. For ligand blot assays, the post-transfer membranes were incubated with TBST for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. To reduce nonspecifically bound material, and thus background, solutions of 1.5 μg/ml 125I-HA in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled HA, were first exposed to unused nitrocellulose at 22 °C for 2 h. The protein-containing membranes were then incubated with the treated 125I-HA solutions for 2 h at 4°C, washed five times (5 min each) with TBST, air-dried at 22 °C for 30 min, and bound 125I-HA was detected by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax MS film exposed for 1–15 days at -80 °C. The same membrane was washed with TBST/BSA and then probed with anti-V5 Ab to assess HARE expression. Data Analysis—The assessment of statistical significance for differences between sample se"
https://openalex.org/W2077661852,"Regulation of intracellular cAMP by multiple pathways enables differential function of this ubiquitous second messenger in a context-dependent manner. Modulation of G(s)-stimulated intracellular cAMP has long been known to be modulated by the G(i) and G(q)/Ca(2+) pathways. Recently, the G(13) pathway was also shown to facilitate cAMP responses in murine macrophage cells. We report here that this synergistic regulation of cAMP synthesis by the G(s) and G(13) pathways is mediated by a specific isoform of adenylyl cyclase, AC7. Furthermore, this signaling paradigm exists in several hematopoietic lineages and can be recapitulated by exogenous expression of AC7 in HEK 293 cells. Mechanistic characterization of this synergistic interaction indicates that it occurs downstream of receptor activation and it can be mediated by the alpha subunit of either G(12) or G(13). Our results demonstrate that AC7 is a specific downstream effector of the G(12/13) pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1968580657,"The parvulin peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 catalyzes cis-trans isomerization of p(S/T)-P bonds and might alter conformation and function of client proteins. Since the trans conformation of p(S/T)-P bonds is preferred by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), Pin1 may facilitate PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation. Juglone irreversibly inhibits parvulins and is often used to study the function of Pin1 in vivo. The drug prevents dephosphorylation of mitotic phosphoproteins, perhaps because they bind Pin1 and are dephosphorylated by PP2A. We show here however that juglone inhibited post-mitotic dephosphorylation and the exit of mitosis, independent of Pin1. This effect involved covalent modification of sulfhydryl groups in proteins essential for metaphase/anaphase transition. Particularly cytoplasmic proteins with a high cysteine content were vulnerable to the drug. Alkylation of sulfhydryl groups altered the conformation of such proteins, as evidenced by the disappearance of antibody epitopes on tubulin and the mitotic checkpoint component BubR1. The latter activates the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, which degrades regulatory proteins, such as cyclin B1 and securins, and is required for mitotic exit. Indeed, juglone-treated cells failed to assemble a mitotic spindle, which correlated with perturbed microtubule dynamics, loss of immunodetectable tubulin, and formation of tubulin aggregates. Juglone also prevented degradation of cyclin B1, independently of the Mps1-controlled mitotic spindle checkpoint. Since juglone affected cell cycle progression at several levels, more specific drugs need to be developed for studies of Pin1 function in vivo.

PPIases have been grouped into cyclophilin, FK506-binding protein, and parvulin subfamilies (see Ref. 3Fanghanel J. Fischer G. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 3453-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), for which distinct pharmacological inhibitors are available. The parvulin group is irreversibly inhibited by juglone (4Hennig L. Christner C. Kipping M. Schelbert B. Rucknagel K.P. Grabley S. Kullertz G. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5953-5960Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Pin1 comprises an N-terminal type IV WW domain, which determines phosphorylation-specific protein-protein interactions, and a C-terminal PPIase domain that harbors the catalytic center (see Ref. 5Lu K.P. Zhou X.Z. Nat. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2007; 8: 904-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Pin1 is a unique PPIase, because it preferably binds to side chain-phosphorylated S/T-P moieties in numerous proteins, including crucial cell cycle regulators or proteins that become phosphorylated immediately prior to cell division (6Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P.

Isomerization of the p(S/T)-P peptide bond regulates, for instance, localization and phosphorylation status of Pin1 client proteins (see Ref. 5Lu K.P. Zhou X.Z. Nat. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2007; 8: 904-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Pin1 is therefore a regulator that, in concert with proline-directed kinases, phosphatases, and ubiquitin ligases, controls the cell cycle (see Refs. 5Lu K.P. Zhou X.Z. Nat. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2007; 8: 904-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar and 8Yeh E.S. Means A.R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Pin1 is possibly a cancer target gene, because its overexpression enhances transformed phenotypes induced by oncogenic Ras and Neu (see (5Lu K.P. Zhou X.Z. Nat. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2007; 8: 904-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar)). Pin1 is overexpressed in many human cancers, and its overexpression correlates with poor prognosis of patients (see Ref. 5Lu K.P. Zhou X.Z. Nat. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2007; 8: 904-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). For that matter, down-regulation of Pin1 activity by pharmacological agents might present an attractive opportunity for controlling tumor growth. The function of Pin1, however, is more complicated, since loss of Pin1 can cause a selective growth disadvantage, which suggests that Pin1 may have a protective function in oncogenesis of certain cell types (see Ref. 8Yeh E.S. Means A.R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthalenedione) is a benzoquinone that covalently modifies thiol groups of cysteine residues in parvulin, one of which is essential for PPIase activity (4Hennig L. Christner C. Kipping M. Schelbert B. Rucknagel K.P. Grabley S. Kullertz G. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5953-5960Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It is thought that the inhibition of isomerase activity by juglone is caused by partial unfolding of the PPIase active site (4Hennig L. Christner C. Kipping M. Schelbert B. Rucknagel K.P. Grabley S. Kullertz G. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5953-5960Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Although juglone can inhibit other proteins (9Muto N. Inouye K. Inada A. Nakanishi T. Tan L.

For instance, PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of the Pin1-interacting proteins, Raf-1, Cdc25c, Pim-1, Myc, and Tau, critically relies on Pin1 (15Dougherty M.K. Muller J. Ritt D.A. Zhou M. Zou X.Z.

For that matter, it is thought that cis-trans isomerization of p(S/T)-P bonds by Pin1 regulates dephosphorylation of PP2A targets by facilitating the accessibility of this phosphatase to its substrates (see Ref. 8Yeh E.S. Means A.R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Several Rab GTPases, including endosomal Rab4a, are phosphorylated by Cdk1 on S/T-P sites within their hypervariable region (22Bailly E. Touchot N. Zahraoui A. Goud B. Bornens M.

Biochem. 2007; 76: 629-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and their phosphorylation at the onset of mitosis might be important in the concomitant down-regulation of intracellular transport (22Bailly E.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We previously found that phosphorylated Rab4a binds Pin1 in mitotic cells (25Gerez L. Mohrmann K. van Raak M. Jongeneelen M. Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Van der Sluijs P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2201-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and that PP2A dephosphorylates Rab4a when cells exit prometaphase. 3C. Fila and P. van der Sluijs, unpublished results. 3C. Fila and P. van der Sluijs, unpublished results. During the analysis of Pin1 function in dephosphorylation of Rab4a, we also employed juglone and made a number of unanticipated observations on the target of the drug. Here we show that treatment of mitotic cells with juglone prevented postmitotic dephosphorylation via pathways that did not involve Pin1. Juglone appears to cause this effect by alkylating sulfhydryl groups in proteins critical for metaphase-anaphase transition, which precludes mitotic exit. Reagents and Materials—An antibody against phospho-Ser204-Rab4a (Rab4a(pS204)) was raised in rabbits with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled CRQLRpSPRRTQAPN peptide (where pS represents phosphoserine). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human Rab4a and human Pin1 have been described (23van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Huber L.A. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Gerez L. Mohrmann K. van Raak M. Jongeneelen M. Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Van der Sluijs P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2201-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Other antibodies were from the indicated sources: mouse monoclonals MPM2 and BubR1 and rabbit antibodies against the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) and methylated PP2Ac (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions), mouse monoclonal anti-β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories), mouse monoclonal anti-α- and anti-β-tubulin (Sigma), and mouse monoclonal cyclin B1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). HRP-labeled and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce, Jackson Laboratories, and Molecular Probes. Purified protein phosphatase PP2A1 was from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, SP600125 was from Sigma, and Alexa488-Annexin V and propidium iodide were from Molecular Probes. Cell Lines and Synchronization—The CHO-Rab4a cell line (23van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Huber L.A. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Pin1-/- mice (26Fujimori F. Takahashi K. Uchida C. Uchida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) were described in the references indicated. Spontaneously immortalized Pin1-/- MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and transfected with pFRSV-Rab4a (23van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Huber L.A. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) using calcium phosphate. Clones were selected in the presence of 60 μm methotrexate and were tested for the expression of Rab4a by Western blot. Mitotic CHO and Pin1-/- MEFs were obtained as described (26Fujimori F. Takahashi K. Uchida C. Uchida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were synchronized with 2 mm thymidine. After 15 h, the cells were released from the G1/S block for 2.5 h and then incubated with 40 ng/ml nocodazole. After 5 h, the cells were harvested by shake-off. U2OS cells were arrested in prometaphase by treatment with 250 ng/ml nocodazole for 18 h. In Vitro Phosphatase Assay—An in vitro assay was used to determine PP2A activity and was conducted as per the vendor's instructions (Molecular Probes). Briefly, 0.2 milliunits of purified PP2A1 was incubated with 6,8-difluoro-4-methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate in 100 μl of phosphatase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 μm CaCl2, 1 mm NiCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20) containing either juglone or PP2A inhibitors. Reactions were incubated in a microtiter plate in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescence was measured in triplicate in a standard fluorescence microtiter plate reader using excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm. Postmitotic Dephosphorylation Assay—U2OS cells or Rab4-transfected CHO cells and Pin1-/- MEFs were arrested in prometaphase, released from the mitotic block, and incubated in the presence of various concentrations of juglone (with or without 5 mm l-cysteine) for different periods of time. Cell samples were taken and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, and Roche Complete protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm in a table-top centrifuge. Supernatants were collected, and cell pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS. Fractions were equalized for protein content, resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and analyzed by Western blot. In Vitro Tubulin Polymerization Assay—Phosphocellulose-purified bovine brain tubulin (>99% purity) was generously provided by Marileen Dogterom (Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics, Amsterdam) and diluted to 2.2 mg/ml in 80 mm K-PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol. Tubulin polymerization reactions of 100 μl were prepared in a microtiter plate, and polymerization was started by the addition of 1 mm GTP at 37 °C and followed by A340 readings for up to 30 min. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Mitotic Pin1-/- MEFs were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and incubated for up to 60 min in the presence of 1 μm juglone. Cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol and subsequently processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were labeled for α-tubulin and stained with Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. DNA was visualized with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Coverslips were mounted and dried, and cells were viewed with a Zeiss LSM5 confocal microscope. Flow Cytometry—Interphase CHO cells were treated with increasing concentrations of juglone for 180 min. Cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended at a density of ∼1 × 106 cells/ml in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. Alexa488-Annexin V and propidium iodide were added for 15 min at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were immediately analyzed on a FACSVantage SE cell sorter (Becton Dickinson) using the 488-nm laser. Results were quantitated in Cellquest. Pin1-/- MEFs were treated for 15 h with increasing concentrations of juglone. During the last hour, Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml) was added to stain DNA. Cells were trypsinized, and cell cycle profiles were obtained by cytometric analysis on a FACSVantage SE cell sorter using the UV laser. The number of cells in different cell cycle phases (M1-M4) was evaluated in Cellquest. Rab4a is phosphorylated during mitosis by Cdk1 on Ser204 (23van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Huber L.A. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and dephosphorylated by PP2A when cells exit prometaphase. 4C. Fila and P. van der Sluijs, manuscript in preparation. We here employed the parvulin PPIase inhibitor juglone initially, to analyze a possible role of Pin1 in the dephosphorylation of Ser204. Juglone Titration on CHO Cells—Because high concentrations of juglone affect cell viability (27Rippmann J.F. Hobbie S. Daiber C. Guilliard B. Bauer M. Birk J. Nar H. Garin-Chesa P. Rettig W.J. Schnapp A. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 409-416PubMed Google Scholar, 28Paulsen M.T. Ljungman M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 209: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we performed a titration study to establish an optimal concentration of the inhibitor. CHO cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of juglone and stained with Alexa488-Annexin V to assess the extent of apoptosis and with propidium iodide to distinguish between living and dead cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. As shown in the bar diagram in Fig. 1A, less than 10 μm juglone did not cause apoptosis (R2 and R3) or necrosis (R1 and R2), compared with controls. Concentrations above 10 μm increased the number of both apoptotic and necrotic cells. Most of the Annexin V-labeled cells were also positive for propidium iodide, showing that the majority had already entered late stages of apoptosis. In the subsequent in vivo experiments in CHO cells, we used 7.5 μm juglone, since this concentration did not induce apoptosis or cell death and is close to the minimal concentration that inactivates parvulins in vitro (4Hennig L. Christner C. Kipping M. Schelbert B. Rucknagel K.P. Grabley S. Kullertz G. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5953-5960Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Juglone Prevents Postmitotic Dephosphorylation of Rab4a—Mitotic CHO-Rab4a cells were released from prometaphase arrest and incubated in the presence of 7.5 μm juglone. Nonsynchronized (interphase) cells were treated the same and served as negative control. Timed samples were analyzed by Western blot with an antibody against phosphorylated Ser204 in Rab4a. Within 45 min after release of the mitotic block, more than 90% of Rab4a was dephosphorylated in control cells as shown in Fig. 1B. In contrast, Rab4a remained fully phosphorylated in the presence of juglone. Samples were also probed with the MPM2 antibody, which recognizes a multitude of proteins containing phosphorylated S/T-P sites with a molecular mass between ∼35 and 300 kDa (29Westendorf J.M. Rao P.N. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The entire set of MPM2 antigens was dephosphorylated after 180 min of nocodazole washout in control cells (Fig. 1C). In the juglone-treated cells, MPM2 staining remained at the initial level. We therefore concluded that juglone prevented dephosphorylation of mitotic phosphoproteins, including Rab4a. Similar results were reported for Disabled-2, NHERF-1, and MPM2 antigens and proposed to be caused by inhibition of PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation due to loss of Pin1 function (19Albert A.L. Lavoie S.B. Vincent M. BMC Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20He J. Lau A.G. Yaffe M.B. Hall R.A. J. Biol.

Juglone Does Not Inhibit PP2A—PP2A is a heterotrimer consisting of a scaffolding (A), a regulatory (B), and a catalytic (C) subunit (30Van Hoof C. Goris J. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 105-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Since juglone is known to inhibit proteins other than just parvulins (9Muto N. Inouye K. Inada A.

Bene L. Pieri C. Damjanovich S. Gaspar Jr, R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and since naphtoquinones inactivate protein-tyrosine phosphatases (31Iwamoto N. Sumi D. Ishii T. Uchida K. Cho A.K. Froines J.R. Kumagai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33396-33404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we first investigated the possibility that juglone might act directly on PP2A. We therefore measured the activity of purified heterotrimeric PP2A1 in the presence of juglone in an in vitro assay. The assay measures dephosphorylation of the Ser/Thr phosphatase substrate 6,8-difluoro-4-methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate, which generates fluorescent 6,8-difluoro-4-methyl-umbelliferyl with excitation/emission maxima at 358/452 nm. Whereas established PP2A inhibitors calyculin A and okadaic acid reduced the fluorescence intensity more than 95% with respect to control levels, juglone did not affect PP2A as shown in Fig. 2A. Since maximal activity of PP2A in vivo requires methylation of the C subunit (30Van Hoof C. Goris J. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 105-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we also analyzed in cells whether juglone affected this posttranslational modification. As shown in Fig. 2B, juglone did not inhibit PP2A methylation, as we found by Western blot with a specific antibody against the methylated form of the C subunit of PP2A. Collectively, the assays for PP2A activity and PP2A methylation showed that juglone did not inhibit PP2A directly and that postmitotic dephosphorylation of Rab4a is unlikely to be due to inhibition of the phosphatase. Juglone Blocks Postmitotic Dephosphorylation in Pin1-/- Cells—Having shown that inhibited dephosphorylation of mitotic phosphoproteins (Fig. 1, B and C) is not caused by a direct effect of juglone on PP2A (Fig. 2, A and B), we next investigated whether the block was due to inhibition of Pin1. For that matter, we studied dephosphorylation of mitotically phosphorylated Rab4a in MEFs derived from Pin1-/- mice (26Fujimori F. Takahashi K. Uchida C. Uchida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The cells lacked immunologically detectable Pin1, as evidenced by a Western blot with a polyclonal antibody against Pin1 (Fig. S1). As a consequence of Pin1 deficiency, the cells also contained ∼40% less of the Pin1 client protein β-catenin (Fig. S1), whose stability correlates directly with Pin1 expression levels (32Ryo A. Nakamura M. Wulf G. Liou Y.C. Lu K.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The reduced β-catenin levels in Pin1-/- MEFs also suggested that the cells do not have salvage mechanisms to counteract the loss of Pin1 activity. Pin1-/- MEFs were next released from the mitotic block and incubated in the presence of 7.5 μm juglone for up to 60 min. The cells were then harvested at different periods of time after nocodazole washout, and detergent lysates were analyzed for the amounts of Rab4a(pS204) and total Rab4a. The rate of Rab4a dephosphorylation in the absence of Pin1 was comparable with that in CHO cells (Fig. 3). Even in a genetic model for the loss of Pin1 function, juglone inhibited the dephosphorylation of Rab4a in the Pin1-/- MEFs (Fig. 3). These results showed that the effect of juglone is not caused by a mechanism involving Pin1. Juglone Decreased Tubulin Content in Lysates—Careful analysis of the experiments with the Pin1-/- cells revealed an additional effect of juglone treatment. We found that the amount of α- and β-tubulin decreased during the release of the mitotic block in the presence of juglone (Fig. 3). This observation was also made in interphase cells that were treated for 60 min with juglone, documenting that the cell cycle stage was immaterial to this effect of the drug. The disappearance of α- and β-tubulin was not caused by leakage of cytosolic proteins, because actin levels remained the same throughout the experiment. To account for the loss of α- and β-tubulin from the detergent lysates, we evaluated whether the tubulins were sedimented in the Triton X-100-insoluble pellet that was generated during preparation of cleared lysates. Pellets were solubilized in reducing Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3, the amount of Triton X-100-insoluble (from now on called insoluble) α- and β-tubulin increased in a time-dependent manner in the presence of juglone. Insoluble, presumably aggregated α- and β-tubulin was also detected in the pelleted material of juglone-treated interphase cells (Fig. 3). Thus, juglone rendered tubulin partially insoluble in Pin1-/- MEFs. Although 7.5 μm juglone caused aggregation of tubulin in Pin1-/- MEFs, we did not observe this in CHO cells (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether or not the effect on the Triton X-100 solubility of tubulin (from now on called solubility) was restricted to Pin1-/- MEFs, we performed juglone titrations on CHO cells and Pin1-/- MEFs. Nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells were harvested and incubated for 60 min in medium containing increasing juglone concentrations. Cell lysates were then analyzed for Rab4a(pS204), MPM2 antigens, α-tubulin, and actin. As shown in Fig. 4A, juglone concentrations above 2 μm inhibited dephosphorylation of Rab4a and MPM2 antigens in CHO cells. The amount of soluble α-tubulin only started to decrease at juglone concentrations above 10 μm. The initial experiments with CHO cells in which we found inhibited post-mitotic dephosphorylation (Fig. 1B) were done with 7.5 μm, which did not affect tubulin solubility (Fig. 4A). In Pin1-/- MEFs, the dephosphorylation of phospho-Rab4a was already inhibited by as little as 0.1 μm juglone (Fig. 4B), whereas tubulin became insoluble at juglone concentrations above 2 μm (Fig. 4B). Thus, the dose-dependent effects of the Pin1 inhibitor on dephosphorylation of mitotic phosphoproteins and tubulins were not limited to Pin1-/- MEFs but were also recapitulated in another cell line. The experiments in Figs. 2 and 4 also showed that dephosphorylation of mitotic phosphoproteins is a more sensitive read-out than the generation of insoluble tubulin. Juglone Affects Tubulin Function via Alkylation of SH Groups—Juglone can covalently modify free SH groups of cysteine residues, which is the basis for the inactivation of Pin1 (4Hennig L.

Our laboratory recently reported that Munc18c-syntaxin 4 complexes are further regulated by the competitive binding of the double C2 domain protein Doc2β to Munc18c, although the underlying mechanism for this is unknown. Because the Doc2β binding region of Munc18c contained residue Tyr-219 and this residue becomes phosphorylated in response to glucose stimulation, we hypothesized that the mechanism would involve Munc18c phosphorylation. Coimmunoprecipitation analyses using detergent lysates prepared from pervanadate-treated MIN6 beta cells revealed that the tyrosine phosphorylation of Munc18c corresponded to a 60% decrease in Munc18c-syntaxin 4 association with a coordinate 2-fold increase in Munc18c-Doc2β binding. In vitro binding assays identified syntaxin 4 residues 118-194 as sufficient to confer its interaction with Munc18c; residues 118-194 contain the Hc α-helix and flexible linker region controlling transition of syntaxins between closed and open conformations. When overexpressed in MIN6 cells, this Hc-linker region functioned as a competitive inhibitor of endogenous syntaxin 4-Munc18c binding, increased syntaxin 4 binding to VAMP2, and significantly enhanced glucose-stimulated secretion. Molecular modeling of these new interactions yielded the predictions 1) that Tyr-219 of Munc18c remains buried under basal conditions in a conformation that is favorable for interaction with “closed” syntaxin 4 and 2) that stimulation leads to changes in syntaxin 4 contacts to facilitate exposure of Munc18c Tyr-219 for phosphorylation and Doc2β binding.

Evidence in favor of Munc18c as a negative regulator of exocytosis is principally based upon over-expression methodologies but was supported by crystallographic and NMR data showing that the neuronal Munc18 protein (nSec1/Munc18-1/Munc18a) held its syntaxin 1 binding partner in a closed conformation in a 1:1 stoichiometric complex (22Misura K.M.

The role of Munc18c as a possible positive regulator in exocytosis is based upon aberrant glucose uptake and insulin secretion from Munc18c heterozygous knock-out mice and peptide interference of endogenous Munc18c-syntaxin 4 association in 3T3L1 adipocytes (13Oh E.

Notably, these recent in vitro studies were conducted using milder detergent conditions than earlier studies that showed Sec1/Munc18 protein binding to monomeric syntaxin in cell lysates (30Pevsner J.

Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). These differing buffer conditions combined with in vitro versus cellular approaches have confounded our ability to designate a clear role for Munc18 proteins. In addition to issues of detergent conditions and methodologies, it remains to be resolved just what contacts of the syntaxin molecule are sufficient to confer its interaction with Munc18. There is a general consensus that the N-terminal 20-30 residues of syntaxins are important for fostering interaction with Munc18 proteins (34Yamaguchi T. Dulubova I. Min S.W. Chen X. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 35Bracher A. Weissenhorn W. J. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and it is suggested that it is through this region that Munc18 proteins remain associated with the SNARE core complex (37Hu S.H. Latham C.F. Gee C.L. James D.E. Martin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8773-8778Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, it has been disputed that this N-terminal region of syntaxin 4 can independently confer binding specificity to the Munc18c isoform, as opposed to binding Munc18a or Munc18b (Munc18a and Munc18b specifically bind syntaxin isoforms 1-3). Thus, it has been suggested there are likely alternate or additional residues required to support and specify the association (37Hu S.H. Latham C.F. Gee C.L. James D.E. Martin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8773-8778Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 38D'Andrea-Merrins M. Chang L. Lam A.D. Ernst S.A. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16553-16566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Consistent with the dissociation model put forth by Zilly et al. (39Zilly F.E. Sorensen J.B. Jahn R. Lang T. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: 1789-1797Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar), Munc18c-syntaxin 4 association can be significantly reduced upon the stimulus-induced phosphorylation of residue Tyr-219 of Munc18c (16Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17624-17634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have since determined that a region of Munc18c containing this particular residue is sufficient to confer binding to the C2 domain-containing protein Doc2β, which is localized at the plasma membrane in islet beta cells and adipocytes (14Ke B. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21786-21797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Syntaxin 4 was excluded from the Munc18c-Doc2β complex, suggesting that some type of “switch mechanism” occurs for transitions between Munc18c-Doc2β and Munc18c-syntaxin 4 complex formation. In the present study we have examined the protein-protein interactions among Munc18c and its binding partners syntaxin 4 and Doc2β to test the validity of such a “switch mechanism” using cell lysates under membrane protein-solubilizing conditions. Our experimental results show that, indeed, Doc2β preferentially bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated Munc18c and may function as an “acceptor” of Munc18c displaced from binding to syntaxin 4. Moreover, we have delineated the region containing the Hc-Linker region (residues 118-194) of syntaxin 4 capable of conferring stable interaction with Munc18c. Molecular modeling of these new contacts in syntaxin 4 with phosphorylation and Doc2β binding sites present in Munc18c provide new insights into the conformational changes incurred in these proteins. Materials—Rabbit anti-Munc18c antibody was generated as previously described (17Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-syntaxin 4 and N-terminal syntaxin 4 peptide (residues 2-23) were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Antibodies raised against SNAP23, VAMP2, and phosphotyrosine (4G10) were obtained from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO), Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany), and Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), respectively. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Doc2β antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Matthijs Verhage (Vrije Universiteit, The Netherlands). Rabbit and mouse anti-GFP antibodies were acquired from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) and Clontech Laboratories (Mountain View, CA), respectively. Protein G plus-agarose was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The MIN6 beta cells were a kind gift from Dr. John Hutton (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center). Goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies and Transfectin lipid reagent were acquired from Bio-Rad. Monoclonal FLAG antibody, radioimmunoassay grade bovine serum albumin, and d-glucose were purchased from Sigma. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and SuperSignal West Femto reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences and Pierce, respectively. The human C-peptide radioimmunoassay kit was purchased from Linco Research Inc (St. Charles, MO). Plasmids—The generation of pcDNA3.1-FLAG-Munc18c, pET28a(+)-His-Munc18c, and pGEX-Munc18c plasmids has been previously described (14Ke B. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol.

The TAP-Munc18c DNA constructs were generated by subcloning a PCR-generated Munc18c fragment into the XhoI and ClaI sites of the pNTAP and pCTAP shuttle vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla CA) for adenoviral particle production by Viraquest (North Liberty, IA). The pGEX-4T1-syntaxin 4-(1-193), -(1-112), and -(1-70) DNA constructs were generated by subcloning PCR-generated rat syntaxin 4 fragments into the SalI and XhoI restriction sites of the pGEX-4T1 expression vector (GE Healthcare). The pGEX-4T1-syntaxin 4-(1-273), -(39-273), -(118-193), -(71-273), and -(113-273) DNA constructs were made by subcloning PCR-generated rat syntaxin 4 fragments into the EcoR1 and Xho1 sites of the pGEX-4T1. The pEGFP-C2-syntaxin 4-(118-193) DNA construct was generated by digesting the fragment from pGEX-4T1-syntaxin 4-(118-193) with EcoR1 and Xho1 and subcloning into the EcoR1 and Sal1 sites of the pEGFP-C2 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech). Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Secretion Assays—MIN6 beta cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 25 mm glucose) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 292 μg/ml l-glutamine, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol as described previously (14Ke B. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21786-21797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MIN6 beta cells at 50-60% confluence were transfected with 40 μg of plasmid DNA per 10-cm2 dish using Transfectin (Bio-Rad) to obtain ∼50% transfection efficiency. After 48 h of incubation cells were washed twice with and incubated for 2 h in freshly prepared modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (MKRBB; 5 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl, 15 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml radioimmunoassay grade bovine serum albumin). Cells were stimulated with 20 mm glucose or 0.1 mm pervanadate for the times indicated in the figures. Cells were subsequently lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 137 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), and lysates were cleared by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C for subsequent use in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. For measurement of human C-peptide release, MIN6 beta cells were transiently co-transfected with each plasmid plus human proinsulin cDNA (a gift from Dr. Chris Newgard, Duke University) using Transfectin with 2 μg of each DNA per 35-mm dish of cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were preincubated for 2 h in MKRBB buffer and stimulated with 20 mm glucose for 1 h, and buffer was collected for quantitation of human C-peptide released. CHO-K1 cell stocks were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 292 μg/ml l-glutamine. At 80-90% confluence, cells were electroporated with 40 μg of DNA as previously described (17Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and incubated for 48 h. Detergent cell lysates were prepared by harvesting in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C for use in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP)—The InterPlay Adenoviral TAP System (Stratagene) was used for precipitation of Munc18c-associated proteins from MIN6 beta cells. NTAP-Munc18c contained two affinity tags, a streptavidin-binding peptide and a calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP). MIN6 beta cells were transduced using pNTAP-Munc18c or pCTAP-Munc18c CsCl-purified adenoviral particles as described previously (40Wang Z. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9536-9546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in the manufacturer's lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 or in this buffer containing additional detergent (1% Triton X-100 final concentration). The cells were subjected to 3 successive rounds of freeze-thawing and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min for collection of supernatant. Supernatants were incubated with streptavidin resin followed by washes with lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100) and elution. Eluates were then subjected to a second purification over calmodulin resin. Column flow-through was collected. Purified TAP-Munc18c and associated proteins were eluted and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractions of beta cells were isolated as described previously (41Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1944-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, MIN6 beta cells at 80-90% confluence were harvested into 1 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate containing the protease inhibitors leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (4 μg/ml), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μm). Cells were disrupted by 10 strokes through a 27-gauge needle, and homogenates were centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min. Plasma membrane fractions (PM) were obtained by mixing the postnuclear pellet with 1 ml of buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and 2 volumes of buffer B (2 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The mixture was overlaid with buffer A and centrifuged at 113,000 × g for 1 h to obtain an interface containing the plasma membrane fraction. Interface was collected and diluted to 2 ml with homogenization buffer for centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was collected as the plasma membrane fraction. Pellets were resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer to solubilize membrane proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—MIN6 beta cells were preincubated in MKRBB for 2 h followed by glucose stimulation or treatment with 0.1 mm pervanadate. Pervanadate was made immediately before use by combining 1 mm sodium orthovanadate with 3 mm hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. Cells were subsequently lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. MIN6 beta cell-cleared detergent lysates (2-4 mg) were combined with primary antibody for 2 h at 4 °C followed by a second incubation with protein G Plus-agarose for 2 h. The resultant immunoprecipitates were subjected to 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblotting. Munc18c and VAMP2 antibodies were used at 1:5000; syntaxin 4, Doc2 β, SNAP23, and 4G10 antibodies were used at 1:1000; FLAG and EGFP antibodies were used at 1:2000 and 1:800, respectively. Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were diluted at 1:5000 for all except for phosphotyrosine, which was used at 1:2000 for visualization by ECL for detection using a Chemi-Doc documentation imaging system (Bio-Rad). Recombinant Proteins and Interaction Assays—The pGEX fusion constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli for expression of all GST fusion proteins and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (42Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Ceresa B.P. Syu L.J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recombinant fragments of syntaxin 4 were obtained after thrombin cleavage and capture (Novagen). Recombinant His-tagged Munc18c was expressed in E. coli and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chelating resin (Invitrogen) under native conditions (50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 m NaCl). Eluted protein was further dialyzed overnight in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol. In vitro GST interaction assays were conducted by incubating GST fusion proteins linked to Sepharose beads with recombinant purified proteins for 2 h at 4 °C in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer followed by three stringent washes with lysis buffer and interacting proteins eluted from the beads and resolved on 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting. The syntaxin accessibility assay using GST-VAMP2 was performed similarly but using cleared detergent cell lysates instead of recombinant protein, as recently described (43Jewell J.L. Luo W. Oh E. Wang Z. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10716-10726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance—The binding kinetics for the interaction between syntaxin 4-(1-273) and syntaxin 4-(118-194) with Munc18c was determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Syntaxin 4-(1-273) and syntaxin 4-(118-194) were diluted in acetate buffer at pH 4.5 and immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip with amine coupling. The surface was activated by injecting a solution containing 0.4 m N-ethyl-N′-dimethylaminopropylcarbodimide (EDC) and 50 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) for a 7-min flow rate of 5 μl/min (44Lofas S. Johnsson B.J. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1990; 21: 1526-1528Crossref Google Scholar). Syntaxin 4 was then injected, and the surface was subsequently blocked with 1 m ethanolamine at pH 8.5 for 7 min. The target for final immobilization levels was 1000 resonance units, corresponding to ∼1 ng of syntaxin 4/mm2 (45Stenberg A. Larsson G. Johnson P. Heimer G. Ulmsten U. Acta Obstet. Gynecol. Scand. 1999; 78: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Munc18c was injected over the flow cell at 30 μl/min for 2 min and allowed to dissociate for 3 min. To determine the association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants, Munc18c was injected at seven concentrations ranging from 0 to 53.3 nm. Between cycles, the surface was regenerated with 10 μl of 0.15 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl. The data were then fitted to a 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model using the BiaEvaluation software. It was found that mass transfer was not a factor in Munc18c binding to syntaxin 4. All experiments were conducted in HBS-EP running buffer (Biacore, Piscataway, NJ) with Munc18c storage buffer added to a 1:50 dilution at 25 °C. Computer Modeling—The three-dimensional structure of the syntaxin 4-Munc18c complex was guided by the crystal structure of the syntaxin 1A/Munc18 complex (PDB code 1DN1) and the crystal structure of Munc18c (PDB code 2PJX). A homology model of syntaxin 4 was constructed using Swiss-Model based on the crystal structure of syntaxin 1a. The syntaxin 4-Munc18c complex was constructed by superimposing these proteins onto their homologs in the syntaxin 1A-Munc18 complex. This was carried out with the computer program PyMol.

Munc18c-Syntaxin 4 Binary Complexes Predominate in Detergent Lysates—Although recent studies show association of Munc18 proteins with ternary SNARE core complexes in vitro, this association of endogenous proteins within cells has yet to be demonstrated. To investigate the binding mode(s) of Munc18c in cells known to require Munc18c for regulated exocytosis, MIN6 beta cells were harvested in 1% Nonidet P-40 membrane protein-solubilizing buffer, and cleared detergent lysates were used in immunoprecipitation reactions with anti-Munc18c, anti-VAMP2, or an IgG control (Fig. 1A). Three independent experiments showed that Munc18c co-immunoprecipitated only syntaxin 4 and not with SNAP23 or VAMP2. Munc18c was never seen to bind to syntaxin 4 when syntaxin 4 was complexed with other SNARES. This was observed using lysates prepared from both unstimulated and glucose-stimulated MIN6 cells. This inability to detect Munc18c association with binary (syntaxin 4-SNAP23) or ternary (syntaxin 4-SNAP23-VAMP2) SNARE complexes was reminiscent of results from some of the original immunoprecipitation studies conducted using detergent cell/tissue lysates (30Pevsner J.

https://openalex.org/W2009139399,"Glutamate transporters play a crucial role in physiological glutamate homeostasis, neurotoxicity, and glutamatergic regulation of opioid tolerance. However, how the glutamate transporter turnover is regulated remains poorly understood. Here we show that chronic morphine exposure induced posttranscriptional down-regulation of the glutamate transporter EAAC1 in C6 glioma cells with a concurrent decrease in glutamate uptake and increase in proteasome activity, which were blocked by the selective proteasome inhibitor MG-132 or lactacystin but not the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquin. At the cellular level, chronic morphine induced the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome Ten)-mediated up-regulation of the ubiquitin E3 ligase Nedd4 via cAMP/protein kinase A signaling, leading to EAAC1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Either Nedd4 or PTEN knockdown with small interfering RNA prevented the morphine-induced EAAC1 degradation and decreased glutamate uptake. These data indicate that cAMP/protein kinase A signaling serves as an intracellular regulator upstream to the activation of the PTEN/Nedd4-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome system activity that is critical for glutamate transporter turnover. Under an in vivo condition, chronic morphine exposure also induced posttranscriptional down-regulation of the glutamate transporter EAAC1, which was prevented by MG-132, and transcriptional up-regulation of PTEN and Nedd4 within the spinal cord dorsal horn. Thus, inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated glutamate transporter degradation may be an important mechanism for preventing glutamate overexcitation and may offer a new strategy for treating certain neurological disorders and improving opioid therapy in chronic pain management.

We used PTEN-deficient U87MG cells to demonstrate that PTEN would be necessary for Nedd4 expression after chronic morphine exposure, although U87 cells do not express the same transporter of EAAC1 as C6 cells. Cells were passaged fewer than 30 times and used between 75 and 85% confluence. There was no evidence for passage-dependent changes in morphology or effects measured in the present study.Immunoprecipitation (IP)—Antibodies used in the IP experiments included EAAC1 (Alpha Diagnostics International (ADI), San Antonio, TX, rabbit polyclonal, 1:100); PTEN (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA, rabbit polyclonal, 1:100); Nedd4, Parkin, and Cbl (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, rabbit polyclonal, 1:200); Mdm2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, rabbit polyclonal, 1:200), and normal rabbit IgG (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY, 1:200). Whole lysates of either control or drug-treated C6, 293T, and U87 cells were prepared in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml of each leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) pre-cleared with 50 μl of anti-rabbit IgG beads (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) at 4 °C for 2 h, incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, and then followed by anti-rabbit IgG bead pulldown at 4 °C for 2 h. After four washes with the lysis buffer, immune complexes were released in 100 μl of 2× reducing sample buffer by boiling at 90-95 °C for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and then subjected to the Western blot analysis.Western Blotting—Western blotting was carried out using the following antibodies: monoclonal ubiquitin and polyclonal PTEN (Cell Signaling, 1:1,000); monoclonal PTEN (Pharmingen, 1:1,000); polyclonal μ-opioid receptor (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA, 1:1,000); EAAC1 (ADI, 1:100); β-actin (Santa Cruz, 1:25,000); polyclonal Nedd4 (Abcam Inc., 1:2,500); and monoclonal α-tubulin (Sigma, 1:1,000). Cell and tissue lysates (30 μg of protein) were subjected to standard SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After being blocked at room temperature for 1 h in a blocking buffer (PBS(-), 5% skim milk, 0.1% Tween 20), the membranes were incubated with antibodies diluted (as described above) in blocking buffer at room temperature for 2 h or at 4 °C overnight. This was followed by three washes in washing buffer (PBS(-), 0.1% Tween 20) and incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000), horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) (Amersham Biosciences), or horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-guinea pig IgG (1:3000) (Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h. Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG TrueBlot (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) was used in the IP experiments. After three washes, the bands were visualized by the ECL Plus Western blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of each protein level was analyzed using ImageJ 1.34s software (National Institutes of Health).In Vitro Glutamate Uptake Assay—An in vitro preparation was used to assess glutamate uptake activity according to a previously published method (5Mao J. Sung B. Ji R.R. Lim G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8312-8323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sung B. Lim G. Mao J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2899-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mitrovic A.D. Maddison J.E. Johnston G.A. Neurochem. Int. 1999; 34: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In brief, C6 cell lysates were homogenized in 500 μl of ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)) and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Pellets were re-suspended in the same homogenization buffer, re-centrifuged as above. Both supernatants were combined and again centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The so-obtained pellets were suspended in 1 ml of Locke's buffer (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and saturated with 95% O2, 5% CO2). Glutamate uptake activity was determined by incubating the preparation (100 μg of protein content) with 0.4 μCi of l-[3H]glutamic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total volume of 1 ml of Locke's buffer for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by filtering the pellets through a Whatman (Maidstone, UK) GF/C 2.4-cm filter presoaked in Locke's buffer. The filter was then washed with 2 ml of ice-cold Locke's buffer three times, air-dried, and transferred into vials containing 10 ml of scintillation mixture (Fisher Scientific). The radioactivity was measured by Liquid Scintillation Analyzer Tri-Carb 2900TR (PerkinElmer). The basal uptake activity in counts per minute (cpm) was measured in the absence of any treatment. -Fold change in glutamate uptake activity was calculated with the following equation: (basal cpm without treatment - cpm with treatment)/(basal cpm without treatment).26 S Proteasome Activity Assay—26 S proteasome activity was measured as described previously (38Glas R. Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS followed with buffer I (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP), and pelleted by centrifugation. Glass beads and homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 250 mm sucrose) were added and vortexed for 1 min. Beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min and 10,000 × g for 20 min. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA protocol (Pierce). One hundred μg of protein of each sample was diluted with buffer I to a final volume of 1,000 μl and the fluorogenic proteasome substrate SucLLVY-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin was added in a final concentration of 50 μm in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide. Cleavage activity was monitored continuously by the detection of free 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin using a Synergy HT Multi-detection Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT) at 380/460 nm and 37 °C. As controls, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (2 μm) was incubated with each agent in buffer I without cell extracts and measurements of proteasome activity were corrected when necessary.Vector-based Short Hairpin RNA Oligomers—The DNA vectors for small interfering RNA (siRNA) constructs, pRNAT-H1.1/Neo/GFP (SD1216), were obtained from GenScript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ). Three short hairpin RNA insert sequences for the rat PTEN (GeneBank™ accession number NM_031606) and one scramble sequence for negative control were selected as follows by using the software siRNA Construct Builder (GenScript Corp.): GGATCCCGTTTATCTCTGGTCCTTACTTCTTCAAGAGAGAAGTAAGGACCAGAGATAAATTTTTTCCAAAAGCTT (75 bp, siPTEN construct 1), GGATCCCGTATACACCTTCAAGTCTTTCTTTCAAGAGAAGAAAGACTTGAAGGTGTATATTTTTTCCAAAAGCTT (75 bp, siPTEN construct 2), GGATCCCGTAATCCAGGTGATTCTTTAACTTCAAGAGAGTTAAAGAATCACCTGGATTATTTTTTCCAAAAGCTT (75 bp, siPTEN construct 3), GGATCCCGTCGCTTACCGATTCAGAATGGTTCAAGAGACCATTCTGAATCGGTAAGCGATTTTTTCCAAAAGCTT (75 bp, scrambled siPTEN construct 4). The four siRNA constructs were transfected into C6 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stable cell clones were obtained with neomycin selection, based on GFP expression. PTEN expression following the transfection was assessed by Western blot and fluorescence microscopy.RNA Interference—Custom SMARTpool siRNA to target the rat Nedd4 and negative control siCONTROL Non-targeting siRNA pool were designed and synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Each siRNA (100 nm) was transfected into C6 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with vehicle, morphine (10 μm, 48 h), morphine plus MG-132 (20 μm added during the last 12 h of the 48-h morphine exposure), or MG-132 alone for the indicated times, followed by relevant assays as described.Immunohistochemistry and Fluorescence Microscopy—Stably transfected siPTEN or scramble siRNA glioma C6 cells (plated on glass cover-slips) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and permeabilized with acetone at -20 °C for 3 min. After being blocked in a blocking solution (10% normal goat serum/PBS) at room temperature for 2 h, cell-plated coverslips were incubated with polyclonal anti-EAAC1 (ADI, 1:100) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., 1:500) in blocking solution at room temperature for 2 h, nuclei were counter-stained with Hoechst (0.5 μg/ml in PBS) for 10 min. Coverslips were washed with PBS between steps. Stained cells were mounted in Vectorshield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and observed under the OLYMPUS 1X71 fluorescence microscope.RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from drug-treated C6 cells and spinal cord dorsal horns. Isolations were performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT-PCR were carried out using Titan One Tube RT-PCR System (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's manual. All primers for rat glutamate transporters, PTEN, Nedd4, and a housekeeping gene were designed by Invitrogen OligoPerfect based on GenBank sequences (EAAC1, NM_013032; PTEN, NM_031606; Nedd4, XM_343427, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), XO 02231) and synthesized by Invitrogen: for EAAC1, forward, 5′-TGGTTCGAGGACACAGTGAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-GATCAGTGGCAGCACTACGA-3′, amplifying 800-base pair products; for PTEN, forward, 5′-ACACCGCCAAATTTAACTGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-AGGTTTCCTCTGGTCCTGGT-3′, amplifying 630-base pair products; for Nedd4, forward, 5′-GATCCTCGGATGCAGAATGT-3′ and reverse, 5′-ATCGCCACTGGATTACAAGG-3′, amplifying 715-base pair products; for GAPDH, forward, 5′-GGTGATGCTGGTGCTGAGTA-3′ and reverse, 5′-GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTCT-3′, amplifying 369-base pair products.RT-PCR was started with incubating the sample (20 ng of total RNA) at 50 °C for 30 min for reverse transcription, followed by one cycle of denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, 10 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 68 °C for 1 min and 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 68 °C for 1 min with cycle elongation of 5 s for each cycle. A 7-min extension at 68 °C was carried out at the end of the final cycle. The samples were then cooled to 4 °C. Ten μl of the RT-PCR product was loaded onto one lane and subjected to electrophoresis at 50 V through 1.8% (w/v) agarose gel containing 0.4 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The RT-PCR product bands and a 100-bp ladder molecular weight marker (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) were visualized under UV light and imaged using the AlphaEaseFC system (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). The intensity of each transporter mRNA level was analyzed using ImageJ 1.34s software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The GAPDH level was used for sample normalization.Reagents—Morphine, naloxone, ddA, H89, RP-8-PCPT-CGMPS, SucLLVY-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (chymotrypsin-like), and 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin were purchased from Sigma; Go6976, MG-132, lactacystin, and chloroquin were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA); LY294002 from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA).Experimental Animals and Intrathecal Drug Delivery—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) weighing 300-350 g were housed in individual cages with water and food pellets available ad libitum. The animal room was artificially illuminated from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. The protocol was approved through our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. A polyethylene-10 intrathecal catheter was implanted in each rat according to a previously described method (39Yaksh T.L. Rudy T.A. Physiol.

The experiment began at 24 h after the intrathecal catheter implantation. Morphine (15 nmol) plus vehicle, MG-132 (5 nmol in 10 μl of saline with 0.4% dimethyl sulfoxide) alone, morphine plus MG-132 (5 nmol), or vehicle (saline with 0.4% dimethyl sulfoxide) alone was administrated (n = 6 rats/group) twice daily for 7 days through the intrathecal catheter in a total volume of 20 μl followed by 10 μl of saline flush to purge the residual from the catheter dead space. Spinal cord tissue samples were taken at the end of the 7-day treatment.RESULTSChronic Morphine Exposure Induces EAAC1 Down-regulation in C6 Glioma CellsExpression of glutamate transporter EAAC1 was examined at 12-, 24-, 48-, and 96-h exposure of C6 glioma cells. Although the EAAC1 expression (Western blot) was not changed within the first 24 h of morphine exposure, the EAAC1 level was dramatically decreased by nearly 90% when examined at 48 h of morphine exposure (Fig. 1A), which lasted up to at least 96 h after morphine exposure. In contrast, no changes of opioid receptor levels were detected at these time points in C6 glioma cells under the same condition (data not shown), indicating that chronic morphine exposure induced a selective down-regulation of glutamate transporter EAAC1.Consistent with the down-regulation of EAAC1 expression, glutamate uptake activity in C6 glioma cells was decreased by nearly 70% at 48 h of morphine exposure (Fig. 1B, p < 0.01), as assessed using an in vitro glutamate uptake assay (5Mao J. Sung B. Ji R.R. Lim G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8312-8323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mitrovic A.D. Maddison J.E. Johnston G.A. Neurochem. Int. 1999; 34: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Co-treatment of morphine with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (1 μm) completely prevented the down-regulation of EAAC1 and the decrease in glutamate uptake activity, whereas naloxone alone did not alter the baseline EAAC1 expression or glutamate uptake activity (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine whether EAAC1 down-regulation occurred at the mRNA level, we examined the EAAC1 mRNA expression (RT-PCR) in C6 glioma cells under the same condition of morphine exposure. The EAAC1 mRNA level did not differ from the baseline when examined at 12, 24, or 48 h of morphine exposure (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that chronic morphine exposure induced the opioid receptor-mediated EAAC1 down-regulation, which occurred at the posttranscriptional level and critically regulated glutamate uptake activity.EAAC1 Down-regulation Is Mediated through Ubiquitin-proteasomal DegradationIt has been shown that proteasome-mediated degradation of cellular proteins including oncoproteins and cell cycle proteins is a critical mechanism for the posttranscriptional regulation of protein turnover (40Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Given that the EAAC1 down-regulation after chronic morphine exposure occurred at the posttranscriptional level, we examined whether proteasomal degradation would play a major role in this process. To our surprise, this chronic morphine-induced EAAC1 down-regulation in C6 glioma cells was completely blocked by co-treatment of morphine with the selective proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (20 μm) or lactacystin (10 μm), when MG-132 or lactacystin was added into the incubation for 12 h beginning at 36 h after the initiation of morphine exposure. In contrast, co-treatment of morphine with chloroquin (50 μm), a lysosome inhibitor, did not prevent morphine-induced EAAC1 down-regulation (Fig. 2A). The MG-132 or lactacystin treatment alone had no effect on the expression of EAAC1 or opioid receptors, nor did the treatment with 50 μm chloroquine alone have detectable cytotoxic effects on C6 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that morphine induced the proteasome-mediated EAAC1 degradation.FIGURE 2Chronic morphine induces ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of EAAC1.

https://openalex.org/W2017626052,"The intracellular signaling pathway by which tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces its pleiotropic actions is well characterized and includes unique components as well as modules shared with other signaling pathways. In addition to the currently known key effectors, further molecules may however modulate the biological response to TNF. In our attempt to characterize novel regulators of the TNF signaling cascade, we have identified transmembrane protein 9B (TMEM9B, c11orf15) as an important component of TNF signaling and a module shared with the interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways. TMEM9B is a glycosylated protein localized in membranes of the lysosome and partially in early endosomes. The expression of TMEM9B is required for the production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by TNF, IL-1β, and TLR ligands but not for apoptotic cell death triggered by TNF or Fas ligand. TMEM9B is essential in TNF activation of both the NF-κB and MAPK pathways. It acts downstream of RIP1 and upstream of the MAPK and IκB kinases at the level of the TAK1 complex. These findings indicate that TMEM9B is a key component of inflammatory signaling pathways and suggest that endosomal or lysosomal compartments regulate these pathways.

Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). TNF plays a pivotal role in several autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis; this is underscored by the clinical success of neutralizing TNF with antibodies or soluble receptors (2Feldmann M. Maini R.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 163-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). A better understanding of intracellular TNF signaling is therefore of high clinical relevance. The two TNF receptors, TNFR1 (p55, TNFRSF1A) and TNFR2 (p75, TNFRSF1B), show high homology in their extracellular domains but less in their intracellular domains. Although soluble TNF binds TNFR1 with higher affinity than TNFR2 and therefore acts primarily via TNFR1, membrane-bound TNF activates equally TNFR1 and TNFR2 (3MacEwan D.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In most tissues TNF signaling is mediated by TNFR1, whereas TNFR2 is restricted to fewer specific tissues, mostly of an immunological nature (3MacEwan D.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, TNFR1 trimerizes and recruits TNF receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD), receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). This first complex acts as a platform at the plasma membrane to activate the NF-κB and MAPK signaling cascades, promoting cell survival and the expression of inflammatory cytokines. In a second step, TNFR1 is internalized into endocytic vesicles together with TRADD and RIP1 and recruits the proapoptotic molecules Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and caspase-8. This complex will initiate the apoptotic cell death program if concurrent anti-apoptotic NF-κB activation is absent (4Muppidi J.R. Tschopp J. Siegel R.M. Immunity. 2004; 21: 461-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complex has a central function in many inflammatory pathways such as the TNFR, interleukin 1β receptor (IL-1R), and several Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (5Banerjee A. Gerondakis S. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2007; 85: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 6Delaney J.R. Mlodzik M. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2852-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This complex contains the catalytic subunit TAK1 and the adaptors TAK1-binding proteins 1, 2, and 3 (TAB1, TAB2, TAB3). Upon TNF stimulation, this complex interacts with TRAF2 leading to ubiquitin-mediated activation of TAK1. TAK1, in turn, phosphorylates and activates IκB kinase α and β (IKKα and IKKβ) and the MAPK kinases (MKK) (7Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). IKK phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor IκB leading to its degradation and to the subsequent release and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. In addition, phosphorylation of MKK4/7 and MKK3/6 by TAK1 leads to the activation of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and of the p38 MAPKs. Activation of NF-κB and MAPK then coordinately promotes the expression of a wide variety of genes such as IL-6 and IL-8 that contribute to the proinflammatory role of TNF (2Feldmann M. Maini R.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 163-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, 8Palanki M.S. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although the understanding of the TNF signaling cascade has advanced, many of the molecular mechanisms that regulate this pathway remain unclear. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel regulator of the TNF pathway, transmembrane protein 9B (TMEM9B, c11orf15). This molecule has been discovered previously as an NF-κB inducer in large scale cDNA overexpression screens (9Matsuda A. Suzuki Y. Honda G. Muramatsu S. Matsuzaki O. Nagano Y. Doi T. Shimotohno K. Harada T. Nishida E. Hayashi H. Sugano S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3307-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). 3F. Dodeller, M. Gottar, D. Huesken, V. Iourgenko, and B. Cenni, unpublished data. The function of TMEM9B and of its closest homolog, TMEM9 (10Kveine M. Tenstad E. Dosen G. Funderud S. Rian E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), is not known. Our results indicate that TMEM9B is a lysosomal transmembrane protein that regulates cytokine production induced not only by TNF but also by IL-1β and several TLR ligands by acting on the shared components RIP1 and TAK1. In contrast, TMEM9B is not involved in proapoptotic signaling of TNFR1 or Fas. Thus, TMEM9B is a new type of regulator of inflammatory signaling cascades. Reagents, Plasmids, and siRNAs—The plasmids pCMV6XL5-TMEM9B and pCMV6XL5-RIPK1 were purchased from OriGene and pNF-κB-Luc and pRL-TK from Clontech and Promega, respectively. The cDNA of TMEM9B was subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) by PCR. All other cDNA were expressed from plasmids constructed in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The pGL3-IL-8 promoter reporter plasmid contains nucleotides 2240–3765 of the human IL-8 promoter (clone AF385628). All siRNAs were synthesized at Novartis. Synthesis of siRNA was performed with standard phosphoramidite chemistry. All siRNAs are 21 oligonucleotides in length with a 19-base pair ribonucleotide duplex region and a two-deoxynucleotide overhang on the 3′-terminus of each strand. The 5′-ends of both strands are unphosphorylated. The following target sequences were used: GAA GCU CUG UCA CAA UCA A (TMEM9B siRNA1), GCA UGU UGU CCU CAG CUA A (TMEM9B siRNA2), CGG CAU UAU UGG AGU GAA A (TNFR1), GGC GAG AGG AGC ACA GAU A (p65), and CUU ACG CUG AGU ACU TCG A (luciferase). Recombinant human TNF and IL-1β were produced at Novartis. TNF was biotinylated overnight at 4 °C with NHS-PEO4-Biotin (Pierce) in a phosphate buffer at pH 6.6 and dialyzed with PBS. The biological activity of biotin-TNF was identical to TNF with regard to IL-6 and IL-8 induction in HeLa cells (data not shown). Tunicamycin and LPS were from Sigma, super-Fas ligand from Alexis, Pam3Cys-SKKK (Pam3Cys) from EMC Microcollections, and poly(I:C) from GE Healthcare. The following antibodies were used: anti-TNFR1 (H-5), anti-GFP (B-2), and anti-p65 (A) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-IKKα (B78-1), anti-RIP1 (G322-2), and anti-TRADD (clone 37) (BD Bioscience); anti-mannosidase II (ab12277, Abcam); anti-early endosomal antigen (EEA1, Alexis); anti-LAMP1 (Sigma); and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Ambion, 6C5). Phospho-specific antibodies anti-MKK4, anti-MKK6, anti-IKKβ, and anti-p38 were from Cell Signaling. The anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 633 were from Invitrogen. The TMEM9B antibody was produced and purified at Eurogentec by immunizing rabbits with the peptide CQEQRKSVFDRHVVLSC coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Cell Culture and Transfection—The cell lines 293-EBNA, ME180 (both from Invitrogen), and HeLa (from ATCC) were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Normal human dermal fibroblasts from neonatal skin (Lonza) were cultured in FGM-2 (Lonza) for less than 10 passages. Unless indicated otherwise, cells were stimulated with TNF at 30 ng/ml, IL-1β at 10 ng/ml, LPS at 10 ng/ml, poly(I:C) at 0.5 μg/ml, and Pam3Cys at 1 μg/ml. For siRNA transfection, HeLa, ME180, or primary human dermal fibroblasts were seeded in 150 μl of culture medium in 96-well plates. Then 50 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 20 nm siRNA and 0.75 μl of HiPerFect (Qiagen) were added to the cells. For transfection of 293-EBNA with DNA, cells were seeded in 100 μl of culture medium, and then 10 μl of Opti-MEM containing 0.8 μl of FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) and 75 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid, 5 ng of pRL-TK, and 120 ng of expression plasmid were added to the cells. For sequential transfection of HeLa cells with siRNA and DNA, cells were seeded in 2 ml of culture medium in 6-well plates and then 100 μl of Opti-MEM containing 120 nm siRNA and 6 μl of HiPerFect were added to the cells. Two days later, cells were trypsinized and replated in a 96-well plate. Four hours later, the culture medium was replaced by 100 μl of Opti-MEM containing 100 ng of plasmid DNA and 1 μl of GenePORTER (Genlantis). Transfection medium was replaced three hours later by DMEM, 2% fetal calf serum. Immunoblotting, Pulldown, and Subcellular Fractionation—For analysis of phosphoproteins, cells were stimulated with TNF for the indicated amount of time, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS. Lysates were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and sonicated, and protein concentration was determined with a bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). Equal amounts of proteins were resolved on 4–12% polyacrylamide NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and analyzed by immunoblotting. For isolation of the TNFR1 complex, HeLa cells were incubated with cold DMEM containing 100 ng/ml biotinylated TNF for 10 min. Excess biotinyl-TNF was washed off with ice-cold PBS, and then the cells were incubated with prewarmed DMEM at 37 °C for the indicated time and rinsed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer A containing 20 mm Tris pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-glycerol-phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After being precleared with protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science), lysates were incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) for 3 h. Beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblot as described above. Nuclei were isolated using NE-PER reagent, and integral membrane proteins were isolated by phase partitioning using the Mem-PER reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce). Cell Surface Biotinylation—HeLa cells were incubated with 0.2 mg/ml NHS-PEO4-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C under gentle rocking. Cells were washed with cold PBS, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with DMEM to quench unreacted biotin, and washed again with cold PBS. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer A and incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads for 2 h. Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblot as described above. IL-6, IL-8, Cell Viability, and Reporter Gene Assay—The concentrations of IL-6 or IL-8 were determined in 10 μl of cell culture supernatant by HTRF® assays as recommended by the manufacturer (Cisbio). Cell viability was assessed with ATPlite 1Step (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Promoter activity of IL-8 and NF-κB reporter plasmids in 293-EBNA cells was assayed with a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The ratio of firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize for transfection variability. Quantitative PCR—For the determination of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels, total RNA was isolated on RNeasy micro-columns (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III (Invitrogen). On aliquots of this cDNA, quantitative real-time PCR was performed simultaneously with primers and probes (TaqMan Assays-on-Demand) for S18 ribosomal RNA (VIC-labeled) and for IL-6 or IL-8 (both FAM-labeled) with the TaqMan Fast Universal PCR mix (all from Applied Biosystems). IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels were normalized to S18 rRNA levels. Confocal Microscopy—HeLa cells stably expressing a TMEM9B-EGFP fusion protein were grown on coverslips and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were permeabilized in 0.1% saponin, 3% horse serum in PBS and then stained sequentially with primary and secondary antibodies and with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml). Images were obtained and processed using an LSM510 fluorescent confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test for two-group comparison and by analysis of variance for multiple group comparison using InStat (Graph-Pad Software). TMEM9B Is a Glycosylated Lysosomal Transmembrane Protein—The amino acid sequence of TMEM9B has been shown to contain an N-terminal signal peptide at positions 1–33 (11Zhang Z. Henzel W.J. Protein. Sci. 2004; 13: 2819-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the signal peptide gives rise to mature TMEM9B (molecular mass, 19.0 kDa), which is predicted to be glycosylated at Asn-60. Incubation of HeLa cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, led to a decrease of the apparent molecular mass of TMEM9B from about 22 to 19 kDa (Fig. 1A), confirming that TMEM9B is an N-glycosylated protein. Sequence analysis indicated that TMEM9B may contain a transmembrane helix located in the signal peptide at position 7–29 and a second transmembrane domain at position 103–125 (TMHMM server v. 2.0 (12Krogh A. Larsson B. Von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar). To determine whether TMEM9B is a membrane spanning protein, HeLa cell proteins were fractionated by phase partitioning and analyzed by immunoblot. A strong enrichment of TMEM9B in the hydrophobic fraction mainly containing membrane proteins could be detected, suggesting that TMEM9B is a membrane protein (Fig. 1B). To determine whether TMEM9B is localized at the plasma membrane and is accessible at the outer membrane leaflet, cell surface proteins were biotinylated. HeLa cells were incubated with amine-reactive hydrophilic biotin, and biotinylated proteins were isolated on streptavidin beads. In contrast to the positive control TNFR1, TMEM9B could not be detected in the bound fraction (Fig. 1C), indicating that TMEM9B is not accessible at the outer plasma membrane but that it is an intracellular membrane protein. To assess whether TMEM9B is a secreted protein, tagged TMEM9B was transiently overexpressed in HeLa cells, and after 24 h supernatant was analyzed by immunoprecipitation for the presence of soluble tagged TMEM9B. No secreted TMEM9B could be detected (data not shown). To investigate its subcellular localization, a stable HeLa cell clone expressing TMEM9B fused to EGFP was analyzed. No TMEM9B-EGFP could be detected at the plasma membrane of live cells by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2A), confirming the result of the cell surface biotinylation assay. A distinct perinuclear and vesicular structure was however revealed by the TMEM9B-EGFP fluorescence (Fig. 2A). To determine the nature of this structure, double staining with markers for lysosomes, early endosomes, and the Golgi apparatus was performed in fixed cells. Fig. 2B shows strong co-localization (in yellow) of TMEM9B with the lysosomal marker LAMP1 and partial colocalization with the early endosomal marker, EEA1. In contrast, no colocalization with the Golgi protein mannosidase could be observed. Taken together, these data show that TMEM9B is a transmembrane protein localized primarily in the lysosome and, to a limited extent, in early endosomes. TMEM9B Is Required for Cytokine Production in Response to Several Inflammatory Stimuli—The two proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 are induced by TNF in many different cell types. To determine whether TMEM9B is involved in the TNF signaling cascade, we first assessed whether the expression of TMEM9B was necessary for the production of IL-6 and IL-8 in HeLa cells. Endogenous TMEM9B was depleted with specific siRNA, and IL-6 and IL-8 were measured in the cell culture supernatant. Two different siRNAs against TMEM9B reduced the production of IL-6 induced by TNF stimulation by 61 and 35% and of IL-8 by 47 and 24% (Fig. 3A). The effect of the siRNAs on cytokine secretion correlated with an efficient reduction of TMEM9B protein expression (Fig. 3B). The role of TMEM9B in the TNF signaling cascade was further confirmed in primary human dermal fibroblasts. Similarly to HeLa cells, an siRNA against TMEM9B inhibited the production of IL-8 induced by TNF by 62% (Fig. 4A) with a concomitant reduction of TMEM9B protein levels (Fig. 4B). We next determined whether TMEM9B was involved in other inflammatory signaling cascades in primary human dermal fibroblasts. Depletion of TMEM9B reduced IL-1β-induced IL-8 by 56% and the IL-8 production induced by ligands of TLR2 (Pam3Cys), TLR3 (poly(I:C)), and TLR4 (LPS) by 58, 68, and 77%, respectively (Fig. 4A). These data show that TMEM9B is required for the production of proinflammatory cytokines not only downstream of the TNFR1 but also downstream of the IL-1 receptor and several TLRs, suggesting that TMEM9B regulates a common proinflammatory signaling module. TMEM9B Is Not Required for TNF or Fas Ligand-induced Apoptosis—In addition to promote the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF also triggers apoptotic cell death. We sought therefore to determine whether TMEM9B regulated TNF-induced apoptosis. The ME180 cell line is sensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis (13Guijarro M.V. Castro M.E. Romero L. Moneo V. Carnero A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 101: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and treatment with TNF resulted in about 20 and 30% dead cells (after 10 and 100 ng/ml TNF, respectively; Fig. 5A). Cell death was TNF-specific, as it was blocked by an siRNA against TNFR1. In contrast, reduction of TMEM9B expression in ME180 cells with an siRNA (Fig. 5B) did not significantly inhibit cell death compared with cells transfected with the control siRNA. The HeLa cell line is not sensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis, but it is sensitive to Fas ligand, a related member of the TNF family. Stimulation with 200 ng/ml hexameric super-Fas ligand killed about 50% of the cells after 16 h (Fig. 5C). Knockdown of TMEM9B did not affect Fas ligand-induced cell death. Together, these data demonstrate that the induction of apoptosis by the TNF family members TNF and Fas ligand is independent of TMEM9B and that TMEM9B is specifically involved in inflammatory cytokine signaling. TMEM9B Regulates Cytokine Expression at the Transcriptional Level—The reduction in cytokine production after TMEM9B depletion could result from a defect in gene transcription, mRNA translation, or protein secretion. We therefore assessed whether cytokine mRNA levels were affected by TMEM9B. The IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels of HeLa cells transfected with TMEM9B siRNA were determined by quantitative PCR. The mRNA expression of both cytokines was rapidly induced upon TNF stimulation, and the maximum was reached after 60 min (Fig. 6A). An siRNA against TMEM9B almost completely abrogated both IL-6 and IL-8 induction. The role of TMEM9B on IL-8 promoter activity was determined by cotransfection of a TMEM9B expression vector and an IL-8 promoter reporter. Overexpression of TMEM9B activated the IL-8 promoter in a dose-dependent manner to a level similar to that observed upon TNF stimulation (Fig. 6B). Together, these data show that TMEM9B is both necessary and sufficient for TNF-induced cytokine gene transcription. TMEM9B Acts Downstream of the TNFR1 Complex and of RIP1—Upon ligand binding, TNFR1 recruits TRADD and RIP1 to form a complex that is internalized into signaling vesicles termed TNF receptosomes (14Schneider-Brachert W. Tchikov V. Neumeyer J. Jakob M. Winoto-Morbach S. Held-Feindt J. Heinrich M. Merkel O. Ehrenschwender M. Adam D. Mentlein R. Kabelitz D. Schutze S. Immunity. 2004; 21: 415-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). To determine whether TMEM9B is recruited to TNF receptosomes, we isolated the active TNFR1 complex using biotinylated TNF. Incubation of HeLa cells with biotinyl-TNF lead to the recruitment of TRADD as well as of polyubiquitinated RIP1 (Fig. 7A). Because TMEM9B could not be detected in the biotinyl-TNF pulldown, it likely is not recruited to the TNFR1 complex but probably acts further downstream of the TNFR1 complex. Polyubiquitinated RIP1 has been shown to serve as a platform to recruit the TAK1 and IKK complexes, leading to the activation of the IKK by TAK1 (15Ea C.K. Deng L. Xia Z.P. Pineda G. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 245-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether TMEM9B acts upstream or downstream of RIP1 and TAK1. Therefore, HeLa cells were sequentially transfected, first with siRNAs against TMEM9B or p65 and then 2 days later with expression plasmids for RIP1 or TAK1 and TAB1. Overexpression of RIP1 or co-expression of TAK1 with TAB1 induced IL-8 production (Fig. 7B). In cells transfected with an siRNA against TMEM9B or p65, IL-8 production was strongly reduced whether it was induced by RIP1 or TAK1/TAB1 overexpression. These data strongly suggest that TMEM9B acts downstream of RIP1 and downstream or at the level of TAK1. TMEM9B Is Required for TNF-induced NF-κB Signaling—Overexpression of TMEM9B has been reported to activate an NF-κB promoter reporter vector (9Matsuda A. Suzuki Y. Honda G. Muramatsu S. Matsuzaki O. Nagano Y. Doi T. Shimotohno K. Harada T. Nishida E. Hayashi H. Sugano S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3307-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In a manner similar to our results with the IL-8 promoter reporter (Fig. 6B), we confirmed the activity on an NF-κB promoter in 293-EBNA cells cotransfected with a TMEM9B expression vector and an NF-κB reporter plasmid (Fig. 8A). We next determined at which level TMEM9B was involved in the NF-κB signaling cascade, first assessing whether TMEM9B was required for the nuclear translocation of p65. TNF stimulation induced nuclear translocation of p65 after 30 min in control cells (Fig. 8B). In cells transfected with a siRNA against TMEM9B, the levels of nuclear p65 were reduced by about 50% compared with controls. As phosphorylation of p65 is necessary for its full transcriptional activation (16Perkins N.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar), we next determined whether depletion of TMEM9B affected the phosphorylation of p65 upon TNF stimulation. The phosphorylation of p65 could be detected within 3 min after TNF stimulation and was sustained for at least 10 min in control cells (Fig. 8C). In cells transfected with an siRNA against TMEM9B, p65 phosphorylation was moderately reduced at 3 min and completely blocked at 10 min. These data suggest that TMEM9B is required for the translocation of p65 and to sustain its phosphorylation after TNF stimulation, and that TMEM9B acts upstream of p65. We therefore analyzed whether TMEM9B acted upstream or downstream of the IKKs by assessing the phosphorylation state of IKKα and IKKβ. Depletion of TMEM9B resulted in a strongly reduced phosphorylation of IKKα/β (Fig. 8C) without affecting the expression level of IKKα and IKKβ (Fig. 8F). This indicates that TMEM9B modulates the NF-κB pathway by acting upstream of the IKKs. TMEM9B Is Required for Activation of the JNK and p38 MAPK Signaling Cascades—In addition to activating the NF-κB pathway, TNF also triggers the p38 and JNK signaling cascades via RIP1 and TAK1. In HeLa cells TNF induced the phosphorylation of the two upstream kinases MKK3 and MKK6 and of p38 and MK2, a p38 substrate. An siRNA against TMEM9B almost completely abrogated phosphorylation of MKK3/6, p38, and MK2 (Fig. 8D) but did not affect the total amount of MKK6 or p38 (Fig. 8F). Similarly, the phosphorylation but not the total amount of MKK4, as well as the phosphorylation of its substrate, and the two JNK isoforms p46 and p54 were strongly reduced (Fig. 8, E and F). Thus, these data show that in addition to its function in the activation of the NF-κB pathway, TMEM9B is also required for the activation of the p38 MAPK and JNK signaling cascades, positioning TMEM9B in a proximal and common position of proinflammatory cytokine signaling pathways. TNF activates a complex signaling network that leads to two major outcomes: cell activation and apoptosis (4Muppidi J.R. Tschopp J. Siegel R.M. Immunity. 2004; 21: 461-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In our attempt to better characterize the TNFR1 cascade, we uncovered a function of TMEM9B as an essential component of several inflammatory pathways. We show that TMEM9B is a lysosomal membrane protein involved in the proinflammatory but not in the apoptotic arm of the TNF signaling cascade at the level of TAK1. The expression of TMEM9B was required for the production of IL-6 and IL-8 induced not only by TNF but also immune stimuli like IL-1β and several TLR ligands. Depletion of TMEM9B resulted in reduced transcriptional activation of the IL-8 promoter via NF-κB and diminished TNF-mediated MAPK signaling. The epistasis experiments performed in this study suggest that TMEM9B acts at the level of TAK1. Indeed, the knockdown of TMEM9B inhibited the cytokine induction by RIP1 or TAK1, indicating interference downstream of RIP1 and TAK1. Because reduction of TMEM9B expression also resulted in a reduction of the phosphorylation of the TAK1 substrates IKKα/β, MKK3/6, and MKK4, TMEM9B very likely acts at the level of TAK1. Further evidence for the role of TMEM9B in TAK1 regulation is that TMEM9B is involved not only in the TNF signaling cascade but also downstream of the IL-1R and several TLRs, mirroring the central role of TAK1 in the very same pathways (17Chen Z.J. Bhoj V. Seth R.B. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Shim J.H. Xiao C.C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T. Rao P. Hayden M.S. Lee K.Y. Bussey C. Steckel M. Tanaka N. Yamada G. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The molecules required for the activation of TAK1 differ between these receptors. Whereas TNFR1 signals via TRAF2 and RIP1, the IL-1R and TLRs require MYD88, IRAK4, and TRAF6 (5Banerjee A. Gerondakis S. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2007; 85: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 19Adhikari A. Xu M. Chen Z.J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3214-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Precisely how TMEM9B controls TAK1 is unclear; TMEM9B may be required either for the phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated activation of TAK1 or for the recruitment of TAK1 substrates to the TAK1-TAB complex. We observed that TMEM9B is localized to vesicular structures of the lysosome. The lack of adequate reagents precluded an analysis of the subcellular localization of endogenous TMEM9B, but a stable low expressing clone of a TMEM9B-EGFP fusion could be used. With this caveat, our data on TMEM9B are reminiscent of the subcellular localization of TMEM9, the closest homolog of TMEM9B, which can be found in lysosomes and late endosomes when overexpressed in COS cells (10Kveine M. Tenstad E. Dosen G. Funderud S. Rian E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The function of TMEM9, however, is unknown, although a role in intracellular transport was suggested. The localization of TMEM9B in lysosomes and early endosomes suggests that these organelles are involved in the regulation of signal transduction downstream of inflammatory receptors. Interestingly, the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) and its downstream substrate, extracellular-signal regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), by epidermal growth factor requires localization of MEK1 and ERK1/2 to the endosome via the endosomal protein p14. Binding of p14 to the scaffold protein MEK partner 1 (MP1) recruits MEK1 (20Teis D. Wunderlich W. Huber L.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that p14 deficiency abrogates late endosomal biogenesis and ERK1/2 activation, leading to a new type of human primary immunodeficiency (21Bohn G. Allroth A. Brandes G. Thiel J. Glocker E. Schaffer A.A. Rathinam C. Taub N. Teis D. Zeidler C. Dewey R.A. Geffers R. Buer J. Huber L.A. Welte K. Grimbacher B. Klein C. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Our data showing the involvement of a lysosomal protein in the activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways suggest by analogy that the lysosomal and/or endosomal compartments may play a central role also in inflammatory signaling. One might speculate that TMEM9B, like p14, could act as an anchor for a signaling complex upstream of NF-κB and p38. Interestingly, the TAK1-TAB complex is associated to a membrane structure in unstimulated cells and translocates to the cytosol upon IL-1β stimulation (22Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Whether the TAK1-TAB complex associates with the lysosomal membrane and whether this is mediated by TMEM9B are currently under investigation. A direct interaction between TMEM9B and TAK1 or any TAB could not be detected (data not shown), suggesting that TMEM9B may modulate TAK1 indirectly. Our observations are compatible with the notion that a first membrane-proximal TNFR1 complex exists that signals to NF-κB and MAPK prior to an internalized TNFR1 receptosome which mediates apoptotic signaling (14Schneider-Brachert W. Tchikov V. Neumeyer J. Jakob M. Winoto-Morbach S. Held-Feindt J. Heinrich M. Merkel O. Ehrenschwender M. Adam D. Mentlein R. Kabelitz D. Schutze S.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1009-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Depletion of TMEM9B did not affect TNF or Fas ligand-induced apoptosis or surface TNFR1 binding to biotinyl-TNF (data not shown). In addition, we did not detect a direct interaction between the TNFR1 complex and TMEM9B. Therefore, our data suggest that TMEM9B is required for the activation of a TAK1 signaling complex that is downstream of the membrane-proximal TNFR1 complex and receptosome and is shared with several inflammatory signals. In summary, we have described TMEM9B as a glycosylated membrane protein located in the lysosome, demonstrating that TMEM9B is required for the activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways by inflammatory stimuli. This is the first report to characterize TMEM9B function and also to indicate the relevance of a lysosomal protein in the signaling cascades of inflammatory receptors. We are grateful to S.

We inactivated metal binding in individual EF-hands of GCAP1 tagged with green fluorescent protein to assess their role in GCAP1 binding to RetGC1 in co-transfected HEK293 cells. When expressed alone, GCAP1 was uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the nuclei of the cells, but when co-expressed with either fluorescently tagged or non-tagged RetGC1, it co-localized with the cyclase in the membranes. The co-localization did not occur when the C-terminal portion of RetGC1, containing its regulatory and catalytic domains, was removed. Mutations that preserved Mg2+ binding in all three metal-binding EF-hands did not affect GCAP1 association with the cyclase in live cells. Locking EF-hand 4 in its apo-conformation, incapable of binding either Ca2+ or Mg2+, had no effect on GCAP1 association with the cyclase. In contrast to EF-hand 4, inactivation of EF-hand 3 reduced the efficiency of the co-localization, and inactivation of EF-hand 2 drastically suppressed GCAP1 binding to the cyclase. These results directly demonstrate that metal binding in EF-hand 2 is crucial for GCAP1 attachment to RetGC1, and that in EF-hand 3 it is less critical, although it enhances the efficiency of the GCAP1 docking on the target enzyme. Metal binding in EF-hand 4 has no role in the primary attachment of GCAP1 to the cyclase, and it only triggers the activator-to-inhibitor functional switch in GCAP1.

In the dark, cGMP keeps a small percentage of the Na+/Ca2+ channels open, and the hydrolysis of cGMP by a light-activated phosphodiesterase, PDE6, generates photoresponses in rods and cones. When light triggers cGMP hydrolysis, it also, through the closure of the channels, lowers the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ from ∼250 nm in the dark to ∼25 nm in the light (9Olshevskaya E.V.

At the same time, free concentrations of Mg2+ in photoreceptors remain near 1 mm, regardless of illumination conditions (13Chen C. Nakatani K. Koutalos Y. J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In response to the light-dependent decrease in free Ca2+ concentrations, GCAPs exchange Ca2+ in their EF-hands for Mg2+ (14Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol.

Of the four EF-hand domains in GCAPs, only three are capable of Mg2+/Ca2+ exchange, whereas the N-proximal EF-hand 1 domain deviates from the consensus sequence and cannot bind metal ions. Instead, this EF-hand is required for GCAPs interaction with their target enzyme, RetGC (16Otto-Bruc A. Buczylko J. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Crabb J.W. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A.

We previously described mutations that can inactivate only Ca2+ or both Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding in all three metal-binding EF-hands of GCAP1 (15Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol.

We have also found that when neither Ca2+ nor Mg2+ is present in EF-hands 2 and 3, activation of RetGC is suppressed. Inactivation of Ca2+ coordination in EF-hand 4 prevented inhibition of RetGC1 by Ca2+ but had no effect on the cyclase activation by Mg2+-liganded GCAP1 (15Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21645-21652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our previous data suggested that divalent cation binding in EF-hand 2 and, to a lesser extent, in EF-hand 3, was required for GCAP1 to stay in complex with RetGC1 in either Mg2+- or Ca2+-liganded forms. Here, we evaluated this hypothesis by monitoring the binding of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged GCAP1 to functional RetGC1 in cultured cells. We demonstrate that elimination of both Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding in EF-hand 2 suppresses compartmentalization of GCAP1 with RetGC1, whereas inactivation of EF-hand 3 reduces the efficiency of the GCAP1 attachment to RetGC1, but does not prevent it. We also demonstrate that cation binding in EF-hand 4 has no role in GCAP1 association with the cyclase. Recombinant GCAP1 and Its Mutants—GFP-tagged bovine GCAP1 was expressed in HEK293 cells from a Clontech pQBI25-fN3 vector. The GCAP1 cDNA was inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI sites, in-frame with the Superglo GFP-coding sequence of the vector and downstream of the CMV promoter, as follows. The GCAP1 sequence was PCR-amplified by Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) from a DNA clone for transgenic expression of wild type bovine GCAP1 in mouse rods (9Olshevskaya E.V. Calvert P.D. Woodruff M.L.

Expression constructs for EF-hand mutants were made by substitution of the BlpI/SfiI fragment in the GCAP1-GFPpQBI25fN3 construct with the corresponding fragment from cDNA coding for the EF-hand mutations described previously (15Peshenko I.V.

To produce GFP-tagged GCAP1 and its mutants in E. coli, the GCAP1-GFP cDNA fragment was inserted into the pET11d vector (Novagen/Calbiochem) in two steps. We first PCR amplified with Pfu polymerase two fragments from the GCAP1-GFP pQBI25fN3, and the expression pET11d vector for wild type GCAP1 (21Dizhoor A.M. Boikov S.G. Olshevskaya E.V. J. Biol.

The two fragments were amplified separately, using two pairs of primers: 5′-GGGGCTAGCGGCAGGGAAAC-3′ and 5′-AGTGTTGGCCAGGGAACAGGCAGT-3′ (pair 1), and 5′-ACTGCCTGTTCCCTGGCCAACACT-3′ and 5′-GAGAGAGGATCCTCAGTTAGTCAATCGATGTTGTACAGTTCATCCA-3′ (pair 2), respectively. The two isolated fragments were spliced together by a second round of PCR, using the first and the last primers only, thus resulting in the BamHI site being placed near the 3′-end of the fusion cDNA. The resultant fusion cDNA was inserted into the SacII/BamHI sites of the modified pET11d vector harboring bovine GCAP1 cDNA, thus placing the GFP sequence in-frame with the GCAP1, followed by the stop codon and the transcription termination site of the pET11d vector. Wild type GCAP1 and its mutants all had a recognition site for a yeast N-myristoyl transferase (23Duronio R.J. Rudnick D.A. Adams S.P. Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10498-10504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant GCAP1-GFP and its mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (20Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recombinant dsRed-tagged RetGC1—Recombinant RetGC1 was expressed in HEK293 cells from a modified pRCCMV vector (Stratagene), as previously described (24Peshenko I.V. Moiseyev G.P. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13796-13804Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fluorescently labeled RetGC1 was produced by inserting in RetGC1 cDNA a DNA fragment coding for a monomeric red fluorescent protein, dsRed (Clontech), PCR-amplified with the BstEII/KpnI restriction sites at the ends. The internal BstEII restriction site in the dsRed cDNA, GGTGACC, was inactivated via a silent substitution, GGTGACT, using PCR splicing by overlap extension. The KpnI site at the 3′ end of the dsRed cDNA fragment was preceded by an additional nucleotide, which truncated the cyclase amino acid sequence by shifting the reading frame after the dsRed coding fragment and thus eliminated the entire intracellular domain of the cyclase. We used this construct, ΔdsRed-RetGC1, as a control for the specificity in co-localization experiments. The reading frame in the ΔdsRed-RetGC1 was shifted back to normal by restriction digest with KpnI, followed by blunting the ends by T4 polymerase and self-ligation. The resultant construct, dsRed-RetGC1, was used to express functional fluorescently tagged RetGC1 in HEK293 cells. All constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Transfection of RetGC1 and GCAP1 into HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). To express RetGC1 for the functional assay in vitro, HEK293 cells were transfected with 40 μg/100-mm culture dish of pRCCMV plasmid containing wild type RetGC1 or dsRed-RetGC1 using Ca2+-phosphate method (a Promega Profection protocol), and the membranes were harvested as previously described (24Peshenko I.V. Moiseyev G.P. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13796-13804Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We also developed a stable neomycin-resistant line expressing GCAP1-GFP selected in the presence of Geneticin (Invitrogen). Co-expression of RetGC1 and GCAP1 in HEK293 Cells and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—Cells were grown in standard glass coverslip chambers (four 2-cm2 chambers per slide) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and were transfected with a mixture of expression constructs using the Ca2+-phosphate method. Routinely, a mixture of 3 μg of pRCCMV plasmid containing wild type RetGC1 cDNA or dsRed-RetGC1 and about 0.02 μg of the GCAP1-GFP pQBI25fN3 plasmid was used per chamber. In 24-32 h, the live cells were either viewed directly or fixed for 15 min with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in a standard Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at room temperature for subsequent anti-RetGC1 staining with an antibody. The cells were gently washed twice with 1 ml of TBS, blocked by 1% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100, for 30 min, incubated with anti-RetGC1 antibody in TBS, 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min, washed three times with the Triton X-100/TBS for 5 min, and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen) for 30 min. The cells were then washed twice with TBS and covered with Vectashield solution (Vector Laboratories). Where indicated, the DNA in nuclei of the cells was counterstained for 10 min with 1 mm TO-PRO-3 iodide stain (Invitrogen) containing 20 μg/ml RNase A (added to the first wash following the incubation with the secondary antibody), and then washed as described above. Where indicated, live cells expressing GCAP1-GFP were treated for 30 min with a fluorescent ER-Tracker™ Red marker (E34250, Invitrogen) to counterstain the endoplasmic reticulum or with a CellMask™ Deep Red stain (C10046, Invitrogen) to counterstain the plasma membrane, all according to the manufacturer's protocols. The cells were viewed using an inverted Olympus IX81 microscope/FV1000 Spectral laser confocal system, and images were collected and analyzed using Olympus FluoView FV10-ASW software. Fluorescence from different spectral markers in the same sample was recorded in a sequential mode, at 40 μs/pixel, typically averaged from three to four repeats, and where indicated, were superimposed on a confocal transmitted light differential interference contrast image of the same cells. The far-red fluorescence emitted from the TO-PRO-3 iodide or the CellMask Deep Red plasma membrane stain was pseudocolored blue or red, respectively. Anti-RetGC1 Antibody—Anti-RetGC antibody was produced in a rabbit against recombinant fragments of a human RetGC1, Met747-Ser1052 (antibody GC1Cat) or Arg540-Asn815 (antibody GC1KHD), expressed in E. coli from pET15b vector (Novagen/Calbiochem). The IgG fraction was purified using Protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The antibodies specifically stained the ∼115-kDa band on immunoblots of HEK293 cells transfected with RetGC1 expressing constructs, but not from non-transfected control cells, and specifically stained membranes in RetGC1-transfected, but not in non-transfected cells. Immunoblotting—The HEK293 cells were washed in TBS, dissolved in a Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and aliquots were separated in 4-12% PAGE (Invitrogen). Following elctroblotting on Immobilon P membrane (Millipore), proteins were probed with the rabbit polyclonal anti-RetGC1 and anti-GCAP1 antibodies and developed using a Pierce Femto Supersignal luminescent peroxidase substrate, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The signal intensity on x-ray film was quantified by densitometry as previously described (9Olshevskaya E.V. Calvert P.D. Woodruff M.L. Peshenko I.V. Savchenko A.B. Makino C.L. Ho Y.S. Fain G.L.

Briefly, the assay mixture (25 μl) contained 30 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2, 60 mm KCl, 4 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm free Mg2+, 2 mm Ca/EGTA buffer, 0.3 mm ATP, 4 mm cGMP, 1 mm GTP, 4 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 units of creatine phosphokinase, 1 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, 0.1 μCi of [8-3H]cGMP, GCAP1, and HEK293 cell membranes. The reaction mixture was incubated for 40 min at 30 °C, stopped by heating for 2.5 min at 95 °C, and aliquots were analyzed by TLC on fluorescent plastic-backed polyethylenimine-cellulose plates (E. Merck) as described previously (2Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13796-13804Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The data shown are representative from three to four independent experiments producing virtually identical results. Statistics—In co-localization experiments, five groups of GCAP1-GFP (wild type and four mutants) expressed in HEK293 cells were compared by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc processed by Bonferroni all-pairs comparison test using a GraphPad QickCalcs calculator (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) and Synergy Kaleidagraph software. The same software was used for a non-paired t test to compare the data for the D64N mutant versus the wild GCAP1-GFP type expressed in the absence of the cyclase. Study of direct binding of GCAPs to the cyclase is very challenging. In contrast to some other proteins, direct binding of GCAPs to RetGC could not be reliably assessed using the membrane binding in vitro assay due to the effect of nonspecific interactions (16Otto-Bruc A. Buczylko J. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Crabb J.W. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Baehr W. Palczewski K.

Chem. 1991; 266: 8634-8637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to tag GCAP1 and its mutants with the enhanced GFP and test their co-localization with the target enzyme in live cells expressing either non-modified or fluorescently tagged dsRed-RetGC1. The Activity of GFP-tagged GCAP1 and dsRed-tagged RetGC1—It was important for the entire line of the study to establish whether or not the fluorescent tags can affect the activity of GCAP1 or RetGC1. We found that the main regulatory properties of GCAP1 were unaltered by its fusion with GFP (Fig. 1, A and B), nor were altered by its tag the properties of the dsRed-tagged RetGC1 (Fig. 1, C and D). There was no difference between the wild type RetGC1 activation by either non-tagged or the GFP-tagged GCAP1 or dsRed-RetGC1 activation by the non-tagged or GFP-tagged GCAP1, except for a minor decrease in the apparent affinity for dsRed-RetGC1 activation by both the tagged and non-tagged GCAP1. Ca2+ sensitivity of both forms of RetGC1 reconstituted with either tagged or non-tagged GCAP1 was the same (see the supplemental Table S1 for more detail). Properties of GFP-tagged GCAP1 EF-hand Mutants—In our previous study, we identified mutations in individual EF-hands that disabled either Ca2+ binding or both Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding altogether (20Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Disabling of metal binding in different EF-hands had profoundly different effects on RetGC1 activation and inhibition (15Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21645-21652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar): inactivation of only Ca2+ binding in all three EF-hands by E75Q/E111Q/E155Q substitutions prevented the cyclase inhibition by Ca2+, but did not affect activation of RetGC1 by the triple mutant in the presence of Mg2+. A complete inactivation of both Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding in EF-hand 4 by a double substitution, D144N/D148G, did not affect it either. However, complete inactivation of Ca2+/Mg2+ binding in EF-hands 2 and 3 by D64N and D100N/D102G mutations, respectively, suppressed activation of the cyclase. The effect was most dramatic in the case of EF-hand 2 (15Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21645-21652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have verified that the corresponding GFP-tagged GCAP1 mutants displayed virtually the same properties as their non-tagged counterparts (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table S2): (a) disabling the EF-hand 2 drastically increased the K½ of GCAP1 for RetGC1; (b) inactivation of EF-hand 3 reduced the apparent affinity of GCAP1 for RetGC1, however, to a lesser extent than EF-hand 2; (c) prevention of both Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding in EF-hand 4 had no effect on RetGC1 activation. Therefore, it was justified to use the fluorescent protein-tagged GCAP1 mutants and RetGC1 in co-expression and co-localization analyses to directly assess their binding to each other. Localization of GCAP1 and RetGC1 in HEK293 Cells—GCAPs have the ability to weakly bind to lipid membranes (16Otto-Bruc A. Buczylko J. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Crabb J.W.

Acta. 2007; 1768: 3171-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but when expressed in HEK293 cells, GCAP1 was uniformly distributed throughout the cell, including the nucleus (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S1A). Only the nucleoli appeared to have lower density of the fluorescent GCAP1 in the nucleus, and only vacuoles were devoid of fluorescence in the cytoplasmic portion of the cells. This pattern remained in all GCAP1-GFP expressing cells, regardless of the overall intensity of the fluorescence (i.e. the levels of GCAP1 expression). We also found no difference in GCAP1-GFP distribution between the cells transiently expressing GCAP1-GFP versus a stable line of GCAP1-GFP expressing cell (data not shown). The uniform cellular distribution of GCAP1 drastically changed when the cells expressed both GCAP1-GFP and RetGC1 (Fig. 3A, panels b and c): GCAP1 fluorescence was depleted from the nuclei and was only observed in the cytoplasm of the cells, where it demonstrated a membrane association pattern, indistinguishable from that of RetGC1 (Fig. 3A, panels a-d, and supplemental Fig. S1B). The intrinsic fluorescence of GCAP1-GFP and immunofluorescence of RetGC1 both displayed a typical shape of “donuts” and “tennis rockets”: the empty nucleus was surrounded by well defined membrane fluorescence, extended along the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Fig. 3, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S2). It should be noted that although RetGC1 expressed in HEK293 cells was active and responsive to GCAP in vitro (Figs. 1 and 2), most of the cyclase was localized to the membranes of the ER (Fig. 3A, panel c and supplemental Fig. S2), and so was GCAP1-GFP, co-expressed with the cyclase. Only a minor portion of the GCAP1 fluorescence appeared to coincide with the marker for the plasma membrane, whereas most of it followed the profile matching that of the ER marker (Fig. 3, B and C). We have also observed co-localization of the GFP-tagged wild type GCAP1 with RetGC1 in non-fixed live cells expressing dsRed-tagged RetGC1 (Fig. 4A, panels a-c). Both fluorescent tags in the non-fixed cells co-localized in the same pattern that was observed in the fixed cells immunostained for RetGC1 (Fig. 3). That argued that co-localization in Fig. 3 was not an artifact of fixation. The distribution of both GCAP1-GFP and dsRed-RetGC1 had the characteristic absence of the signal in the nucleus and a sharp increase in the fluorescence of the surrounding ER membranes (Fig. 4A, panels a-c, the cell marked with an arrow). Such a pattern was not observed in control experiments when we co-expressed the GFP-tagged GCAP1 with the extracellular portion of the cyclase, incapable of binding GCAP1 (29Laura R.P. Dizhoor A.M.

The fluorescently tagged fragment, ΔdsRed-RetGC1, retained the leader peptide sequence for guiding it to the ER (Fig. 4A, panel e), but the distribution of GCAP1-GFP and ΔdsRed-RetGC1 was drastically different (panels d-f): the GCAP1-GFP fluorescence was spread throughout the cell, including the nucleus (same as GCAP1 expressed in the absence of RetGC1 in Fig. 3), and the cyclase fragment was only detected in the ER. Fig. 4B, panels a-d, further demonstrates that the diffuse distribution of GCAP1-GFP co-expressed with the truncated cyclase was not due to much higher GCAP1 expression relative to the ΔdsRed-RetGC1 fragment. We could not use anti-retGC1 antibody for quantitative immunoblotting, because the truncated cyclase lacks the intracellular domains, against which the anti-RetGC1 antibodies were raised. Yet, we took advantage of the same fluorescent tag being present in both the truncated fragment and the non-truncated cyclase. We used the same excitation laser intensity and the photomultiplier gain settings to compare the fluorescence profiles of GCAP1-GFP co-expressed with either dsRed-RetGC1 or ΔdsRed-RetGC1 in the neighboring chambers on the same coverslip. In that case, the relative intensities of the red versus green fluorescence in one group of the cells could be directly compared with the intensities of the corresponding fluorescent tags in the other group (Fig. 4B, panels b and d). The representative results shown in this figure illustrate that GCAP1-GFP failed to co-localize with the ΔdsRed-RetGC1 fragment, even when GCAP1-GFP levels were lower, and the levels of ΔdsRed-RetGC1 were higher than in the cells expressing the non-truncated cyclase. Therefore, the ch"
https://openalex.org/W1968720693,"Ascorbic acid (Asc) is a major antioxidant involved in photoprotection and photosynthetic function in plants. Dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) catalyzes the regeneration of Asc from its oxidized state and serves as an important regulator of Asc recycling. In this work, we used a molecular biochemical approach to investigate how the efficiency of Asc recycling affects non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Suppression of DHAR expression resulted in a lower induction of NPQ that correlated with reductions in chlorophyll and xanthophyll pigments, quantum yield of photosystem II, and CO2 assimilation, whereas the level of reactive oxygen species increased. The quickly reversible component of NPQ decreased and the slowly reversible or irreversible component of NPQ increased following a reduction in DHAR expression. Significant photoinhibition was also observed following exposure to high light. Direct feeding with Asc restored the appropriate induction of NPQ in DHAR-suppressed leaves. In contrast, increasing DHAR expression increased the pool size of xanthophyll and chlorophyll pigments as well as the rate of CO2 assimilation, particularly at high light intensities, whereas the level of reactive oxygen species was reduced. Leaves with increased DHAR expression experienced less photoinhibition than did wild-type plants following exposure to high light. DHAR activity, therefore, can affect the appropriate induction of NPQ and level of photoprotection during exposure to high light."
https://openalex.org/W2111833640,"A missense mutation (Ile 451 to Met) at the tail domain of the muscle-specific intermediate filament protein desmin has been suggested to be a genetic cause of dilated cardiomyopathy. The Ile451Met mutation is located inside a conserved motif in the desmin tail domain, believed to have a potential role in the lateral packing of type III intermediate filaments. Nevertheless, the role of the type III intermediate filament tail domain remains elusive. To further study the role of this domain in the function of cardiomyocytes and in the development of cardiomyopathy, we generated transgenic mice expressing the mutant desmin(I451M) in the cardiac tissue. Analysis of hearts from transgenic animals revealed that mutant desmin loses its Z-disc localization but it can still associate with the intercalated discs, which, however, have an altered architecture, resembling other examples of dilated cardiomyopathy. This is the first report demonstrating a critical role of the desmin head and tail domains in the formation of the IF scaffold around Z discs. It is further suggested that in cardiomyocytes, an interplay between desmin tail and head domains is taking place, which potentially protects the amino terminus of desmin from specific proteases. The fact that the association with intercalated discs seems unchanged suggests that this association must take place through the desmin tail, in contrast to the head domain that is most possibly involved in the Z-disc binding."
https://openalex.org/W2036528609,"Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12 (or metalloelastase) efficiently hydrolyzed the gelatinase-selective α1(V)436-447 fluorescent triple helical peptide (THP) when the substrate was submicromolar. The sequence of this THP was derived from collagen V, a component of collagen I fibrils. The hemopexin domains of MMP-12 and -9 each increased kcat/Km toward this substrate by decreasing Km, just as the hemopexin domain of MMP-1 enhances its triple helical peptidase activity. Non-fluorescent α1(V) THP subtly perturbed amide NMR chemical shifts of MMP-12 not only in the active site cleft but also at remote sites of the β-sheet and adjoining loops. The α1(V) THP protected MMP-12 from the NMR line broadening effects of Gd ·EDTA in the active site cleft and more dramatically in the V-B loop next to the primed subsites. Mutagenesis of the exosite in the V-B loop at Thr-205 and His-206 that vary among MMP sequences established that this site supports the high specific activity toward α1(V) fluorescent THP without affecting general MMP activity. Surprisingly the α1(V) THP also protected novel surfaces in the S-shaped metal-binding loop and β-strands III and V that together form a pocket on the remote side of the zinc binding site. The patterns of protection suggest bending of the triple helical peptide partly around the catalytic domain to reach novel exosites. Partial unwinding or underwinding of the triple helix could accompany this to facilitate its hydrolysis."

In intact cells and in transgenic animal models, PED/PEA-15 overexpression impairs insulin regulation of glucose transport, and this is mediated by its interaction with the C-terminal D4 domain of phospholipase D1 (PLD1) and the consequent increase of protein kinase C-α activity. Here we show that interfering with the interaction of PED/PEA-15 with PLD1 in L6 skeletal muscle cells overexpressing PED/PEA-15 (L6PED/PEA-15) restores insulin sensitivity. Surface plasmon resonance and ELISA-like assays show that PED/PEA-15 binds in vitro the D4 domain with high affinity (KD = 0.37 ± 0.13 μm), and a PED/PEA-15 peptide, spanning residues 1-24, PED-(1-24), is able to compete with the PED/PEA-15-D4 recognition. When loaded into L6PED/PEA-15 cells and in myocytes derived from PED/PEA-15-overexpressing transgenic mice, PED-(1-24) abrogates the PED/PEA-15-PLD1 interaction and reduces protein kinase C-α activity to levels similar to controls. Importantly, the peptide restores insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by ∼70%. Similar results are obtained by expression of D4 in L6PED/PEA-15.

PED/PEA-15 has been found to be an interactor of the human phospholipase D1 (PLD1), an interaction which promotes PLD1 activity. Although the mechanism by which this occurs is still unknown, it has been observed that increasing PED/PEA-15 cellular abundance lengthens PLD1 persistence in the cell rather than increasing its enzymatic activity (9Vigliotta G. Miele C. Santopietro S. Portella G. Perfetti A. Maitan M.A. Cassese A. Oriente F. Trencia A. Fiory F. Romano C. Tiveron C. Tatangelo L. Troncone G. Formisano P. Beguinot F. Mol.

PLD1 is widely distributed in animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria and is implicated in several cellular processes, including receptor signaling, control of vesicular trafficking, and glucose transport (20McDermott M. Wakelam M.J. Morris A.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 225-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phospholipase D catalyzes the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond of glycerophospholipids to generate phosphatidic acid, an intracellular messenger implicated in a wide range of cellular processes. Phosphatidic acid can also be converted to other mediators, such as lysophosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol (21Besterman J.M. Duronio V. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6785-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), with the latter being a major activator of the conventional PKC isoforms. Indeed, in PED/PEA-15 overexpressors, both diacylglycerol concentration (9Vigliotta G. Miele C. Santopietro S. Portella G. Perfetti A. Maitan M.A. Cassese A. Oriente F. Trencia A. Fiory F. Romano C.

It has also been shown that overactivation of PKC-α negatively regulates the activity of PKC-ζ (11Condorelli G. Vigliotta G. Trencia A. Maitan M.A. Caruso M. Miele C. Oriente F. Santopietro S. Formisano P. Beguinot F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1244-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a major controller of insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Therefore, disrupting the interaction between PED/PEA-15 and PLD1 by a cell-penetrating compound may represent a novel strategy for improving insulin sensitivity in target cells. Using a two-hybrid screen, the shortest PED/PEA-15-interacting region of PLD1 (residues 712-1074) has been identified and named D4 (19Zhang Y. Redina O. Altshuller Y.M. Yamazaki M. Ramos J.

Random mutagenesis studies have also revealed that PED/PEA-15 contacting residues are spread over the entire D4 sequence (19Zhang Y. Redina O. Altshuller Y.M. Yamazaki M. Ramos J. Chneiweiss H.

Nevertheless, to date, very little is known about the PED/PEA-15-PLD1 interaction. The impact on insulin sensitivity, for instance, has been only indirectly validated by blocking PED/PEA-15 or PLD1 expression using antisense approaches or PLD1 and PKC-α activities with pharmacological inhibitors (7Condorelli G.

As a proof of principle, using L6 skeletal muscle cells stably overexpressing PED/PEA-15 (L6PED/PEA-15), we show here that, by disrupting PED/PEA-15-PLD1 binding with protein fragments involved in the protein-protein interaction, the PED/PEA-15 downstream signaling and the negative effects on glucose uptake are largely rescued. Indeed, D4 expression in L6PED/PEA-15 reduces the interaction between PLD1 and PED/PEA-15, lowers PKC-α activation, and restores insulin effect on glucose uptake. Consistently, the PED/PEA-15 region entailed in PLD1 recognition and identified following an approach of protein fragmentation and fractionation, when incorporated into L6PED/PEA-15 cells, is capable of displacing the PED/PEA-15-PLD1 interaction and increasing insulin-stimulated glucose transport. pcDNA3 Vector Preparation—Cloning of PED/PEA-15 cDNA in pcDNA3 was previously described (22Condorelli G. Trencia A. Vigliotta G. Perfetti A. Goglia U. Cassese A. Musti A.M. Miele C. Santopietro S. Formisano P. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11013-11018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The D4 cDNA was amplified by PCR from HeLa cells in a reaction mixture with the Taq-Long Expand PCR System (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and with 5′-CGATCAAGCTTCGCTGGAACTTCACAAAAAT-3′ and 5′-CGATCTCTAGAGGATACGAGAATGCGTCAGG-3′ primers. The PCR product (1.1 kb) was cloned into pcDNA3-HA vector carrying HindIII-XbaI restriction sites and sequenced (Primm, San Raffaele Biomedical Science Park, Milan, Italy). A deletion mutant of D4 (named dmD4), spanning residues 929-1030 and with the two cysteines replaced by serines, was used as negative control in all experiments. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, according to the producer's protocol. Mutant oligonucleotides complementary to the single-stranded DNA and encoding the specific mutation were as follows: 5′-GGACTTCGGCTACAGTCCTTTAGGGTTGTCC-3′ and 5′-GGACAACCCTAAAGGACTGTAGCCGAAGTCC-3′, and 5′-GACAAGGTTTTCCGGTCCCTTCCCAATGATGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTCATCATTGGGAAGGGACCGGAAAACCTTGTC-3′. Mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. dmD4 was then subcloned into the pcDNA3-HA expression vector. Cell Culture, Transfections, Western Blot Analysis, Co-immunoprecipitation Assay, and 2-Deoxy-d-glucose Uptake—L6 rat skeletal muscle cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10,000 units/ml penicillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2% l-glutamine (Invitrogen), in a 5% humidified CO2 incubator. Transient transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Stable transfections were performed by selecting positive clones with G418 (Calbiochem) at the effective dose of 0.8 mg/ml. Cellular loading of FITC-conjugated peptides was performed with cationic lipid mixture Pro-Ject™ Protein Transfection Reagent kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Production of rabbit polyclonal PED/PEA-15 antiserum, Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation analyses, and 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake measurement were performed as previously reported (7Condorelli G.

Mouse Primary Fibroskeletal Muscle Cell Culture—Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained after Wt and Tg PED/PEA-15 mice were sacrificed by pentobarbitone overdose, as previously described (25Krämer D.K.

The biopsies were collected in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 1% PeSt (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), dissected, finely minced, and transferred to a digestion solution (0.015 g of Collagenase IV, 8% 10× trypsin, 0.015 g of bovine serum albumin, 1% PeSt, in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10,000 units/ml penicillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2% l-glutamine), then and incubated with gentle agitation at 37 °C for 15-20 min. Thereafter, undigested tissue was allowed to settle, and the supernatant was collected and mixed with DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and 1% PeSt. The remaining tissue was digested for a further 15-20 min at 37 °C with fresh digestion solution. The resultant supernatant was then pooled with the previous cells and centrifuged for 10 at 350 × g. The cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and 1% PeSt and was then seeded and grown in culture flask. After this, medium was again changed to DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% PeSt. Before any experiment, cells were serum-starved for 16 h and stimulated with insulin at specific times and concentrations as indicated. PKC-α Activity Assay—PKC-α activation was measured by evaluating PKC-α Ser-657 phosphorylation. Western blot assay was performed with a specific pPKC-α antibody purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and the intensity of the spots was evaluated by densitometric analysis, using Scion Image Analyzer software. All data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed with StatView software (Abacus Concepts) by one-factor analysis of variance. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. PLD Assay in Intact Cells—PLD activity was evaluated by measuring phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylbutanol levels (26Slaaby R. Du G. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Seedorf K. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with 5 μCi of [14C]palmitic acid for a 60-mm dish and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-enriched, humidified atmosphere. Cells were then washed twice in HHBG buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1.26 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 5.37 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and incubated in 0.3% (v/v) butan-1-ol in HHBG buffer for 20 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were treated with or without 100 nm phorbol myristate acetate for 30 min. After incubation, buffer was removed and 0.5 ml of ice-cold methanol was added to each dish. Cell debris was scraped into a glass vial and kept on ice. Cellular lipids were obtained using the Bligh and Dyer procedure and spotted onto Whatman TLC plates. Labeled products were separated by TLC using the upper phase of a mixture of ethyl acetate/2,2,4-trimethylpentane/acetic acid/H2O in the ratio of 13:2:3:10 (v/v). Positions of the spots corresponding to [14C]phosphatidylbutanol were determined by autoradiography. The area containing phosphatidylbutanol was scraped, and radioactivity was counted. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown onto glass coverslips in 6-well multidishes and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Cells were washed with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 KCl mm, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. After additional washes with PBS, the coverslips were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to identify nuclei and examined under a fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert, Carl Zeiss). PED/PEA-15 Expression and Purification—PED/PEA-15 cDNA, cloned into pETM-30 (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany), was transformed in BL21-star(DE3) cells (Novagen). Expression of GST-His6-PED/PEA-15 was induced in 100 ml of LB with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Inalco), for 3 h at 37 °C. Using a 1-ml His-trap column (GE Healthcare), the fusion protein was eluted and subsequently treated for 16 h at 22 °C in the presence of tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (1:100 TEV:fusion protein). The digested protein was loaded again on the His-trap column, and PED/PEA-15 was recovered in the flow-through. PED/PEA-15 was further purified on a 1-ml Mono Q HR 5/5 column (GE Healthcare) applying a gradient from 0% to 100% NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, buffer. Trx-His6-D4 Expression and Purification—D4 was expressed in pETM20 (EMBL) as Trx-His6-D4 in Escherichia coli Bl21(DE3) pLysS (16 h at 22 °C, 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside). All purifications were performed in 1 mm TCEP-containing buffers. Trx-His6-D4 was purified on a 1-ml His-trap column; excess of imidazole and NaCl was removed by dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP, pH 7.5, buffer, and protein was further purified on a 1-ml Mono Q HR 5/5 column (27Viparelli F. Doti N. Sandomenico A. Marasco D. Dathan N.A. Miele C. Beguinot F. Monti S.M. Ruvo M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 59: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). dmD4 Expression and Purification—dmD4 was expressed using the pETM20 vector in BL21(DE3) (16 h at 22 °C, 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside). After an initial polishing step on a 1-ml His-trap column, Trx-His6-dmD4 was further purified on a 1-ml Mono Q HR 5/5 column (1 ml), with a gradient from 0% to 100% of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m NaCl, pH 8, buffer. Trx-His6 Expression and Purification—100 ng of pETM-20 vector were chemically transformed in E. coli Bl21(DE3) (Novagen), and expression of Trx-His6, fused to a stuffer protein, was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The entire fusion protein was purified on 1 ml of Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare), and Trx-His6 was then separated from the stuffer protein after digestion with TEV protease. A further passage on Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin allowed us to obtain Trx-His6 as the only protein unbound to the resin. PED/PEA-15 Tryptic Digestion—PED/PEA-15 proteolysis was performed by digestion with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 16 h. Tryptic digests were separated into seven fractions on a Phenomenex Jupiter C18 column (1 × 25 cm, 10 μm) and analyzed by using a 50- × 2-mm inner diameter C18 BioBasic column (ThermoFisher). LC-MS was performed using a LCQ DCA XP Ion Trap spectrometer (ThermoElectron). This was equipped with an Opton electrospray ionization source (operating at a needle voltage of 4.2 kV and at a temperature of 320 °C) and a complete Surveyor HPLC system (including an MS pump, an autosampler, and a photo diode array). Mass spectra were recorded continuously between the mass interval 400-2000 atomic mass units in positive mode and data-dependent analysis to fragment the eluted peptides and to obtain sequence information. Fragmentation was induced on selected ions from 400 to 1600 atomic mass units, with a fixed 35% of total energy. Multicharge spectra were then deconvoluted using the BioMass program implemented in the Bioworks 3.1 package provided by the manufacturer. Mass calibration was performed automatically by means of selected multiple charged ions, in the presence of a calibrant (Ultramark, ThermoElectron). All masses were reported as average values. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized using solid phase chemistry on a fully automated peptide synthesizer AAPTECH 348 W (Advanced Chemtech), following standard Fmoc methodology. Protected N-α-Fmoc-amino acid derivatives and coupling reagents for peptide synthesis were from Inbios (Pozzuoli, Italy). All syntheses were carried out on a 50-μmol scale, using a RINK AMIDE resin (substitution, 1.1 mmol/g). After on-resin assembly, peptides were cleaved with a trifluoroacetic acid-H2O-triisopropylsilane mixture (500 μl/100 mg of resin) and purified by RP-HPLC. All peptides were characterized by LC-MS to assess purity and identity. PED-(1-24), -(36-54), and -(72-83) were produced with free acid C termini and obtained by trypsin treatment of the synthetic PED-(1-30), -(33-56), and -(71-92) fragments, respectively. The hydrolyzed peptides were then separated by semi-preparative RP-HPLC. PED-(1-24) and -(79-112) were also N-terminally fluoresceinated synthesized for cellular experiments, utilizing FITC linked to a β-alanine residue. Semi-preparative RP-HPLC was used to obtain highly pure molecules (>95% by RP-HPLC analysis). SPR Analysis—PED/PEA-15 was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using standard amine coupling procedures, as described by the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia Biosensor AB), to obtain a final 11,000 RU immobilization level. All assays were carried out at 25 °C, at a flow rate of 30 μl/min in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP, pH 7.4, buffer. Data were processed using BIAevaluation software, version 4.1 (BIAcore Technologies, Inc.). For competition experiments with fractions derived from trypsin-treated PED/PEA-15, 20 μl of each fraction was preincubated with 1 μm Trx-His6-D4 in a final volume of 100 μl (assuming that 0.13 μmol of each peptide was recovered after fractionation, the theoretical peptide concentration for these experiments was 260 μm) at 25 °C for 30 min and then injected. In the co-injection method, 15 μl of each pool (diluted 1:1 in running buffer) was injected after injection of 60 μl of 1 μm Trx-His6-D4. For competition experiments with the synthetic PED/PEA-15 peptides, 1 μm Trx-His6-D4 was preincubated with 30 μm of each peptide at 25 °C for 30 min before injection. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—All assays were performed using an integrated platform for High-Throughput Screening (Hamilton Robotics) comprising a fully equipped Starlet 8 channel liquid handler, a robotic arm, a washer, and a multiwavelength plate reader. PED/PEA-15 was biotin-labeled using EZ-Link NHS-Biotin reagents, following the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce); LC-MS confirmed biotinylation. 100 μl of a 0.5 μm solution of Trx-His6-D4 was coated onto the wells for 16 h at 4 °C; wells filled with 100 μl of 0.5 μm Trx-His6 were used as blank control. Each data point was in triplicate. After washing with PBS-NaCl buffer (300 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, 0.004% Tween 20, pH 7.4), wells were blocked with a 1% w/v solution of bovine serum albumin in PBS."
https://openalex.org/W1987514572,"Modulation of some Kv3 family potassium channels by protein kinase C (PKC) regulates their amplitude and kinetics and adjusts firing patterns of auditory neurons in response to stimulation. Nevertheless, little is known about the modulation of Kv3.3, a channel that is widely expressed throughout the nervous system and is the dominant Kv3 family member in auditory brainstem. We have cloned the cDNA for the Kv3.3 channel from mouse brain and have expressed it in a mammalian cell line and in Xenopus oocytes to characterize its biophysical properties and modulation by PKC. Kv3.3 currents activate at positive voltages and undergo inactivation with time constants of 150-250 ms. Activators of PKC increased current amplitude and removed inactivation of Kv3.3 currents, and a specific PKC pseudosubstrate inhibitor peptide prevented the effects of the activators. Elimination of the first 78 amino acids of the N terminus of Kv3.3 produced noninactivating currents suggesting that PKC modulates N-type inactivation, potentially by phosphorylation of sites in this region. To identify potential phosphorylation sites, we investigated the response of channels in which serines in this N-terminal domain were subjected to mutagenesis. Our results suggest that serines at positions 3 and 9 are potential PKC phosphorylation sites. Computer simulations of model neurons suggest that phosphorylation of Kv3.3 by PKC may allow neurons to maintain action potential height during stimulation at high frequencies, and may therefore contribute to stimulus-induced changes in the intrinsic excitability of neurons such as those of the auditory brainstem."
https://openalex.org/W1999660388,"The crystal structure of a cold-active aminopeptidase (ColAP) from Colwellia psychrerythraea strain 34H has been determined, extending the number of crystal structures of the M1 metallopeptidase family to four among the 436 members currently identified. In agreement with their sequence similarity, the overall structure of ColAP displayed a high correspondence with leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H), a human bifunctional enzyme that converts leukotriene A4 (LTA4) in the potent chemoattractant leukotriene B4. Indeed, both enzymes are composed of three domains, an N-terminal saddle-like domain, a catalytic thermolysin-like domain, and a less conserved C-terminal α-helical flat spiral domain. Together, these domains form a deep cavity harboring the zinc binding site formed by residues included in the conserved HEXXHX18H motif. A detailed structural comparison of these enzymes revealed several plausible determinants of ColAP cold adaptation. The main differences involve specific amino acid substitutions, loop content and solvent exposure, complexity and distribution of ion pairs, and differential domain flexibilities. Such elements may act synergistically to allow conformational flexibility needed for an efficient catalysis in cold environments. Furthermore, the region of ColAP corresponding to the aminopeptidase active site of LTA4H is much more conserved than the suggested LTA4 substrate binding region.

It is generally accepted that thermal adaptation of proteins is correlated with changes in their overall or local structure flexibility. Indeed, although thermophilic enzymes are characterized by a relatively high rigidity, their psychrophilic homologues display molecular characteristics enhancing their plasticity. The current understanding is that this increased flexibility, by enhancing accommodation and transformation of their substrates, allows psychrophilic enzymes to be active at low temperature.

Microbiol. 2004; 70: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) revealed a high sequence similarity (34% identity and 56% similarity) between cold-active aminopeptidase ColAP and LTA4H. Both enzymes belong to the M1 metallopeptidase family that includes enzymes such as aminopeptidase N (APN), pyroglutamyl-peptidase II, and aminopeptidase A. Interestingly, human LTA4H has the particularity of being bifunctional. Indeed, this enzyme is also an epoxide hydrolase and catalyzes the conversion of leukotriene A4 (LTA4) in LTB4, a chemoattractant implicated in inflammatory mechanisms. Although it is well known that both reactions occur in the same unique active site (2Rudberg P.C. Tholander F. Thunnissen M.M. Haeggstrom J.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1398-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the molecular features that make LTA4H bifunctional, even though their homologues are not, are still unknown. In this article, we report the crystal structure of cold-adapted ColAP. This structure has been compared with the three-dimensional structure of its close mesophilic homologue LTA4H, solved at 1.95 Å (3Thunnissen M.M. Nordlund P. Haeggstrom J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Such a study may help not only to improve our understanding of molecular properties leading to cold-adaptation of this enzyme but also to indicate the structural differences that allow the human enzyme to have a second catalytic function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Purification—Recombinant ColAP was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (4Huston A.L.

Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). Ion pairs were identified as two oppositely charged residues (considering Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg) having their charges located within 4 Å. Structure superimpositions were performed using DEEPVIEW (18Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9467) Google Scholar). All figures have been generated using PyMOL.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverall Structural Comparisons—As expected from the high sequence similarity, the overall fold and the main secondary structures of ColAP are very similar to those of LTA4H (Fig. 1, b and c). The backbone structures of both enzymes can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.21 Å for 509 Cα. These monomeric enzymes are folded into three distinct domains (N-terminal, catalytic, and C-terminal domains) in which the topologies are largely conserved. The N-terminal domain comprises three β-sheets, the major one consisting of seven mixed β-strands and two minor ones consisting of three and four antiparallel β-strands, respectively. Small β-sheets are located under the large sheet at opposite extremities. On the whole, N-terminal domain β-sheets resemble a kind of saddle, presenting its large concave surface to the solvent. As already observed for LTA4H, the architecture of the ColAP catalytic domain is similar to that of thermolysin. It comprises two lobes: one is composed of α-helices only, whereas the other is a mix of α-helices and β-strands. Between the lobes, a depression contains the zinc binding site. The C-terminal domain of ColAP is α-helical. In this domain, eight successive helices are arranged in a right-handed flat spiral. Helices are situated in two layers, five in the inner layer and three in the outer layer, respectively. In the LTA4H enzyme, there is a Pro-rich loop located between the catalytic and C-terminal domains. The sequence of this loop (453LPPIKP458) resembles the Src homology 3-binding domains (XPpXP, where X is an aliphatic residue, P is a conserved proline, and p is sometimes a proline) (19Weng Z. Rickles R.J. Feng S. Richard S. Shaw A.S. Schreiber S.L. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In ColAP, the corresponding sequence is 480LPSYAP485 and thus is moderately conserved. Of the three domains of ColAP and LTA4H, the least conserved is the C-terminal domain. The greatest sequence variations are indeed found in this domain (18% identity for the C-terminal domain versus 38 and 41% for the N-terminal and catalytic domains, respectively) (supplemental Table 1). These differences are reflected in the r.m.s.d. between Cα atoms of the domain structures. Superimposition of the different domains of ColAP and LTA4H gives r.m.s.d. values of 0.83, 1.15, and 1.63 Å based on 716, 920, and 440 involved atoms for the N-terminal, catalytic, and C-terminal domains (supplemental Table 1).Other enzymes share a similar overall fold, such as the Tricorn protease-interacting factor 3 from Thermoplasma acidophilum (20Kyrieleis O.J. Goettig P. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 787-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and the APN from E. coli (21Ito K. Nakajima Y. Onohara Y. Takeo M. Nakashima K. Matsubara F. Ito T. Yoshimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33664-33676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although APN shares the three equivalent domains described for ColAP and LTA4H, Tricorn protease contains an additional small barrel-like β-structure domain located between the catalytic and C-terminal domains. Interestingly, in these two enzymes the major differences are also found in the C-terminal domains. The discrepancies are so significant that backbone superimposition could not be performed with ColAP.Amino Acid Distribution and Cold Adaptation—A comparison of the amino acid composition of the psychrophilic ColAP with its mesophilic human homologue is shown in Table 2. Although the hydrophobic amino acid content is similar for both enzymes, the number of Ala residues is much higher in ColAP. Interestingly, this increase (∼3.2%) seems to compensate for the decrease observed for Ile, Leu, and Pro residues (∼3.1%). Ala is less hydrophobic than Ile and Leu and less constraining for the backbone than Pro, which suggests a global gain in structure flexibility. The high Ala content and the small side chain of this residue may also contribute to the reduction of the global volume of the psychrophilic ColAP.TABLE 2Proportion of residues and computed chemical parameters in the psychrophilic ColAP and in human LTA4HAmino acid compositionAmino acidsColAPaPeptide signal residues were omitted for calculation.LTA4HFrequency in Swiss-ProtbSee ExPASy Web site.No.FrequencyNo.Frequency%%%Asp467.6345.65.3Glu345.6416.76.7Negatively charged residues80cValues in italic type correspond to the sum of amino acids gathered by type.13.27512.312Arg223.6233.85.4Lys386.3406.65.9His152.5162.62.3Positively charged residues75cValues in italic type correspond to the sum of amino acids gathered by type.12.4791313.6Total charged residues155cValues in italic type correspond to the sum of amino acids gathered by type.25.615425.325.6Asn325.3213.44.1Gln264.3264.33.9Ser345.6457.46.8Thr345.6406.65.4Cys00111.81.5Tyr305.0223.63.0Polar residues156cValues in italic type correspond to the sum of amino acids gathered by type.25.816527.024.7Met132.1101.62.4Leu6310.46911.39.6Ile274.5315.15.9Val396.4386.26.7Pro254.1355.74.8Ala579.4386.27.9Phe264.3274.43.9Trp132.1132.11.1Nonpolar residues263cValues in italic type correspond to the sum of amino acids gathered by type.43.526142.842.3Gly315.1304.97.0Total number of residues605610Computed chemical parametersMolecular mass (Da)68,59369,154Theoretical pI5.255.80Aliphatic index86.288.2GRAVY indexTotal−0.339−0.259Strands0.280.17Helices−0.08−0.21Loops−0.75−0.59a Peptide signal residues were omitted for calculation.b See ExPASy Web site.c Values in italic type correspond to the sum of amino acids gathered by type. Open table in a new tab Table 2 also reveals the substitution of glutamic acid by aspartic acid in ColAP. This is in agreement with the trend observed in the whole genome of Colwellia psychrerythraea (22Methe B.A. Nelson K.E. Deming J.W. Momen B. Melamud E. Zhang X. Moult J. Madupu R. Nelson W.C. Dodson R.J. Brinkac L.M. Daugherty S.C. Durkin A.S. DeBoy R.T. Kolonay J.F. Sullivan S.A. Zhou L. Davidsen T.M. Wu M. Huston A.L. Lewis M. Weaver B. Weidman J.F. Khouri H. Utterback T.R. Feldblyum T.V. Fraser C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10913-10918Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). By contrast, the Asp content in thermophilic proteins is low, and it has been shown that Asp has less favorable conformational entropy in stability than Glu (23Lee D.Y. Kim K.A. Yu Y.G. Kim K.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 900-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the high Asp content in ColAP may contribute to its lower stability and higher flexibility. The Pro content is also significantly lower in ColAP. Five of these substituted Pro residues are located in loops, three in α-helices and two in β-strands in the mesophilic homologue LTH4A. In the latter structure, Pro-511 adopts the cis-conformation whereas in ColAP all Pro are in trans-conformation. The replacement of these Pro by residues possessing a larger dihedral angle probably contributes to the increase in backbone flexibility in ColAP.Other variations in the amino acid content can be also influenced by the cold environment. Indeed, ColAP is characterized by a higher Asn content. A similar trend has been observed in the whole genome of another psychrophilic bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 (24Medigue C. Krin E. Pascal G. Barbe V. Bernsel A. Bertin P.N. Cheung F. Cruveiller S. D'Amico S. Duilio A. Fang G. Feller G. Ho C. Mangenot S. Marino G. Nilsson J. Parrilli E. Rocha E.P. Rouy Z. Sekowska A. Tutino M.L. Vallenet D. von Heijne G. Danchin A. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This residue is involved in protein aging, as the Asn side chain is heat-labile and prone to deamination at high temperatures (23Lee D.Y. Kim K.A. Yu Y.G. Kim K.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 900-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In a cold environment, this feature is not under strong selective pressure, which may explain the increased Asn content in the cold-adapted enzyme. The absence of Cys in ColAP may also be related to the environment of C. psychrerythraea. Indeed, cold aerobic environments are more oxidative, as oxygen solubility increases at low temperatures. As ColAP enzyme is secreted in the external medium in a temperature range of -1 to 10 °C, natural selection may have led to the lack of Cys.The GRAVY and aliphatic indexes are computed parameters related to global hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of proteins. These indexes are often lower for cold-adapted enzymes as compared with their mesophilic or thermophilic homologues. Actually, the values obtained from the GRAVY index, isoelectric point, and aliphatic index of ColAP are lower than those for LTA4H. Both of the former parameters can be tentatively related to better interactions with the solvent (25Schiffer C.A. Dotsch V. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas the latter (the aliphatic index) suggests a lower hydrophobic effect stabilizing the core of ColAP.Loop and Secondary Structure Variations—An extension of the enzyme loop regions has been suggested as a possible determinant in cold-adaptation, as their increased lengths and less constrained conformations should lead to an increase in the conformational entropy of psychrophilic proteins (26Siddiqui K.S. Cavicchioli R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 403-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). However, one should keep in mind that the delimitation of secondary structures is also related to the preciseness of the atomic position and, as a consequence, is linked to the resolution of the crystallographic data. From our point of view, such an analysis needs to be considered carefully when comparing two different structures, and only general trends should be interpreted as thermally related parameters. An analysis of ColAP secondary structures revealed a striking increase in the loop content as compared with LTA4H. Indeed, the relative residue content in the loop, helices, and strand was found to be 47 versus 38%, 31 versus 38%, and 22 versus 24% in ColAP versus LTA4H. The additional 9% in loop content, 2, 3, and 4% was found in the N-terminal, catalytic, and C-terminal domains, respectively. Interestingly, although globally the regular secondary structures are shorter in ColAP (with 68 additional residues adopting a loop conformation), the loops conserved in both enzymes are shorter in the human enzyme. This clearly indicates that the increased loop content observed in ColAP corresponds mainly to a shortening of the regular secondary structures and not to insertions in exposed loops. The α-helix content is more affected than the β-strand content; about two-thirds of the residues concerned are situated in α-helices, whereas only one-third are located in β-strands in LTA4H. Interestingly, based on structural genomics studies, the inverse effect has been observed in thermophilic proteins, as a decrease in the overall loop content was found to be correlated to an increase in helical content (27Chakravarty S. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8152-8161Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). As seen from Table 3, the global higher loop content of ColAP is correlated with a larger proportion of loops exposed to the solvent. In ColAP, the total accessible surface of the loops is 9% higher as compared with LTA4H. The GRAVY index of secondary structures (Table 2) indicates that loops tend to be more hydrophilic in ColAP. In addition, the backbones of the exposed loops in ColAP are generally less implicated in hydrogen bonding to each other and therefore favor interactions with water molecules. Altogether, these observations suggest that ColAP, by having a higher loop content exposed to the solvent, has improved the breathing (or microunfolding) of its external shell in comparison with its mesophilic counterpart.TABLE 3Accessible surface area statisticsSolvent-accessible surface areaColAPLTA4HÅ2%Å2%Primary structuresHydrophobicAla, Ile, Phe, Leu, Met, Pro, Val5,21222.855,26322.00PolarNeutral polarAsn, Gln, Cys, Ser, Thr, Trp, Tyr6,34027.806,13225.63Basic residuesArg, Lys, His5,54624.326,11725.57Acidic residuesAsp, Glu5,13722.525,87724.56Charged residues10,68346.8411,99450.13Total17,02374.6418,12675.76Glycine5722.515372.24AromaticPhe, Trp, Tyr1,8918.291,3595.68Secondary structuresα-Helices6,44528.267,81232.65β-Strands3,64715.994,96520.75Loops12,71555.7511,14946.60Total accessible surface22,80723,926 Open table in a new tab In addition to the above mentioned size reduction of α-helices in ColAP, charge stabilization of the helix macrodipole, generated by the helical alignment of polarized peptide bonds, is weakened in the psychrophilic enzyme. Considering for instance the charges present in the first turn and on the N-cap of all helices, ColAP displays nine favorable (negative) and four unfavorable (positive) charges, whereas the human enzyme possesses 11 favorable and only two unfavorable charges at the helix N termini. Such weakening of the macrodipole in ColAP is thought to reduce the compactness of helices, originating from local microdipole alignment.Finally, it should be noted that no electron density was found for the first 13 amino acid residues of ColAP. This suggests that the N terminus of the psychrophilic enzyme has a weakly defined structure in the solvent. As a matter of fact, the N- and C-terminal extremities of cold-adapted proteins are frequently less constrained when compared with their mesophilic or thermophilic homologues (28Riise E.K. Lorentzen M.S. Helland R. Smalas A.O. Leiros H.K. Willassen N.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As these relaxed extremities are preferential sites for unfolding, they may contribute to the global destabilization strategy in psychrophilic enzymes.Molecular Surface Properties—In cold-adapted enzymes, the accessible surface area is frequently characterized by a higher proportion of hydrophobic groups and an excess of negative charges. Although exposed hydrophobic groups are supposed to be entropically unfavorable, the excess of charge may improve interactions with the surrounding medium. However, there are few significant differences in the accessible surface properties of ColAP in terms of global hydrophobicity, polarity, or charge when compared with its mesophilic homologue (Table 3). Although theses surface properties display little correlation with those of other psychrophilic enzymes, it should be noticed that these results are in agreement with global trends observed for proteins modeled from the genome of C. psychrerythraea (22Methe B.A. Nelson K.E. Deming J.W. Momen B. Melamud E. Zhang X. Moult J. Madupu R. Nelson W.C. Dodson R.J. Brinkac L.M. Daugherty S.C. Durkin A.S. DeBoy R.T. Kolonay J.F. Sullivan S.A. Zhou L. Davidsen T.M. Wu M.

By contrast, the nature of the surface residues differs from those of the human enzyme, as ColAP exposes a higher proportion of aromatic residues to the solvent, as seen in several other cold-adapted proteins. Although it is generally accepted that a greater exposure of these groups results in entropic destabilization by weakening the hydrophobic effect, this may be also related to a lower entropic penalty cost at low temperatures. Indeed, at low temperatures, the cost of water structure ordering is reduced, which may favor the enhancement of aromatic and hydrophobic group exposure to the solvent (29Arnorsdottir J. Kristjansson M.M. Ficner R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 832-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Ion Pair Distribution and Complexity—Among the various molecular features suggested as determinants for protein thermal adaptation, electrostatic interaction optimization is considered a key mechanism. Several studies have shown that with increasing environmental temperature, ions pairs become more abundant in proteins and, in parallel, form networks of rising complexity (30Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1503-1516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 31Bell G.S. Russell R.J. Connaris H. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Taylor G.L.

This aspect was investigated here by a survey of the electrostatic interactions in the psychrophilic ColAP and in the mesophilic LTH4A enzyme. Ions pairs were determined using three different criteria: (i) only Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg side chains were considered; (ii) the maximal distance cutoff between charges was 4 Å; and (iii) adjacent residues in the primary structure were not retained if they formed a single ionic pair. Table 4 indicates that, as the number of ion pairs is similar in both enzymes, more difference can be seen in the nature of the residues implicated in these interactions. Although ions pairs are formed mainly by the interaction of Asp with Arg in ColAP, Asp tends to be replaced by Glu residues in the mesophilic enzyme. One should also note that for both enzymes, more than 60% of salt bridges include an Arg residue as the cation partner. Interestingly, the number of complex ion pairs a"

We investigated the expression of adenosine receptors in resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -activated human PMNs, and in PMNs of sepsis patients. Our studies revealed that native human PMNs express almost equal distributions of all four adenosine receptor subtype transcripts, whereas exclusively the A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) was up-regulated in LPS-stimulated PMNs and PMNs of sepsis patients. As a possible mechanism, we identified and fully characterized eight 5'-untranslated region (UTR) splice variants of the A(2A)R gene resulting from alternative transcription and/or splicing of five noncoding exons. We report a differential, activation state-specific expression of 5'-UTR variants within the same cell type, indicating a new mechanism to modulate gene expression: In resting human PMNs, mainly A(2A)R transcripts with long 5'-UTRs are expressed, whereas in stimulated PMNs and PMNs of septic patients, short 5'-UTRs predominate. Transcripts with short 5'-UTRs are more efficiently translated into protein. The correlation between changes of transcript patterns and A(2A)R up-regulation offers interesting clues regarding the course of sepsis."

The G domains of the GTPases are known to dimerize. In the dimeric conformation an arginine contacts the phosphate moieties of bound nucleotide in trans. Kinetic studies suggested that the arginine in itself does not act as an arginine finger of a reciprocal GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Here we investigate the specific function of the residue in two GTPase homologues. Arginine to alanine replacement variants have significantly reduced affinities for dimerization compared with wild-type GTPases. The amino acid exchange does not impact on the overall fold and nucleotide binding, as seen in the monomeric x-ray crystallographic structure of the Arabidopsis Toc33 arginine-alanine replacement variant at 2.0Å. We probed the catalytic center with the transition state analogue GDP/AlFx using NMR and analytical ultracentrifugation. AlFx binding depends on the arginine, suggesting the residue can play a role in catalysis despite the non-GAP nature of the homodimer. Two non-exclusive functional models are discussed: 1) the coGAP hypothesis, in which an additional factor activates the GTPase in homodimeric form; and 2) the switch hypothesis, in which a protein, presumably the large Toc159 GTPase, exchanges with one of the homodimeric subunits, leading to activation.

Takahama Y. Trends Immunol. 2007; 28: 58-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Also at the dimer interface is helix α5(green in Fig. 1A).We investigated how nucleotide recognition and dimerization are linked, as the G loops are located at the interface. We note a change in function of the G4 loop which has lost properties of nucleotide recognition to gain properties in dimerization. Small Toc GTPases have a conserved histidine in the G4 loop (sequence motif THAQ) not present in the G4 loop of canonical small GTPases like the GTPase Ras p21 (sequence motif NKXD (17Sun Y.J. Forouhar F. Li Hm H.M. Tu S.L. Yeh Y.H. Kao S. Shr H.L. Chou C.C. Chen C. Hsiao C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 40Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A.

In psToc34, psHis-163 of the G4 loop is in hydrogen-bonding distance to psTyr-132 in the CB loop of the homodimerization partner in trans (Fig. 1C). psHis-163 further makes a π-stacking interaction with the guanine ring of the base. The Toc34 G4 loop is deprived of a central aspartate residue that in small GTPases normally would specify the nucleotide through direct interaction with N1 and the 2-amino group of the guanine base (Fig. 1, B–D). Consequently, in psToc34 other interactions are responsible for nucleotide recognition; the G5, glutamate contacts guanosine N1 directly and the guanosine 2-amino group via one bridging water (WAT, Fig. 1C). The lack of specificity explains the reported hydrolysis of Xanthosine-5′-triphosphate (42Jelic M. Sveshnikova N. Motzkus M. Horth P. Soll J. Schleiff E. Biol.

Interestingly, the guanosine moiety was fitted in an unusual conformation in which the guanidine group was turned by 150° (16Yeh Y.H. Kesavulu M.M. Li H.M. Wu S.Z. Sun Y.J. Konozy E.H. Hsiao C.D. J.

Given the analysis presented above on incomplete nucleotide recognition by the G4/G5 loops, one might suppose that this unusual nucleotide conformation could occur, even though it would be in disagreement with other GTPase structures.The earlier data prompted us to initiate a crystallographic study with the aim to collect atomic resolution data on atToc33R130A. The expression construct encoded amino acids 1–251 rather than amino acids 1–256 as in the previous study (16Yeh Y.H. Kesavulu M.M. Li H.M. Wu S.Z. Sun Y.J. Konozy E.H. Hsiao C.D. J. Biol.

Furthermore, crystallization conditions were slightly different; we used 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m NH4Cl, pH 7.4, instead of 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 4.8 with added NADH (16Yeh Y.H.

The crystals diffracted to a Bragg spacing below 2 Å using synchrotron light (Table 1). We determined the structure by molecular replacement using the model of native atToc33 (PDB code 3BB3 (25Koenig P. Oreb M. Höfle A. Kaltofen S. Rippe K. Sinning I. Schleiff E. Tews I.

At position 130, no side chain electron density is seen, consistent with the arginine-alanine exchange. All three structures are observed in the GDP-bound form and are highly similar (with respective root mean square deviation values of 0.58 Å over 231 Cα positions and of 1.1 Å over 233 Cα positions for comparison of atToc33R130A with native atToc33 (PDB code 3BB3 (25Koenig P.

In addition, SERCA plays a key role in non-shivering thermogenesis through uncoupled reactions, where ATP hydrolysis takes place without active Ca2+ translocation. Capsaicin (CPS) is a naturally occurring vanilloid, the consumption of which is linked with increased metabolic rate and core body temperature. Here we document the stimulation by CPS of the Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis by SERCA without effects on Ca2+ accumulation. The stimulation by CPS was significantly dependent on the presence of a Ca2+ gradient across the SR membrane.

Several biochemical analyses indicated that CPS stabilizes an ADP-insensitive E2P-related conformation that dephosphorylates at a higher rate than the control enzyme. Under conditions where uncoupled SERCA was specifically inhibited by the treatment with fluoride, low temperatures, or dimethyl sulfoxide, CPS had no stimulatory effect on ATP hydrolysis by SERCA. It is concluded that CPS stabilizes a SERCA sub-conformation where Ca2+ is released from the phosphorylated intermediate to the cytoplasm instead of the SR lumen, increasing ATP hydrolysis not coupled with Ca2+ transport.

Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) rapidly clears [Ca2+]cyt to ensure muscle relaxation. SERCA uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to build up a Ca2+ gradient across the SR membrane that can reach up to 4 orders of magnitude. SERCA is the best-characterized member of the P-type ATPase family (1Kühlbrandt W. Nat. Rev. 2004; 5: 282-295Crossref Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Our understanding of this ion pump was initially based on extensive biochemical and molecular biological studies (e.g. for review, see Refs. 2Andersen J.P. Biosci.

Crystal structures of several SERCA isomers have provided essential structural information and largely exposed the molecular mechanism of this pump (Refs. 4Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H.

An interesting feature in the crystal structures of SERCA is that the cytoplasmic and the transmembrane (TM) domains, which are rigid structures, are interconnected with flexible links (4Toyoshima C.

Nissen P. Sorensen T.L. le Maire M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because of their importance in energy transduction, the functional importance of the flexible links in SERCA has been intensively investigated by mutational analyses (e.g. 11Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Wang G. Danko S. Iizuka H. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39197-39204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Danko S. Suzuki H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 34429-34447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As discussed previously (14Takahashi M. Kondou Y. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5800-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), one of the functional roles of the flexible links could be to generate complex domain movements, possibly allowing the pump to isomerate among several distinct sub-conformations. Indeed, several SERCA isomerization steps have been added as branched reactions in the classical Post-Albers scheme (Scheme 1). Dominance of SERCA isomer(s) not participating in active Ca2+ transport in vivo would likely lead to the modulation of SERCA function (e.g. Ref. 15de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41856-41861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and see below). Hypothetically, hydrolysis of one ATP molecule leads to transport of two Ca2+ ions from the cytoplasm to the SR lumen (17Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, substoichiometric efficiencies of SERCA are commonly observed in the presence of a Ca2+ gradient across the SR membrane. Uncoupling between hydrolysis and transport was shown to occur even in the absence of passive Ca2+ leak and was explained by hydrolytic cleavage of the inorganic phosphate from the phosphorylated intermediate before Ca2+ release to the lumen (18Yu X. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4361-4367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This is associated with Ca2+ release to the cytoplasmic side, the so-called slippage (19Fortea M.I. Soler F. Fernandez-Belda F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12521-12529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The energy from ATP hydrolysis not coupled to Ca2+ transport is presumably dissipated as heat. Definite information on whether SERCA hydrolyzes/synthesizes ATP, transports Ca2+, or generates heat has been obtained by measuring Ca2+ transport and ATP hydrolysis together with pump-mediated heat exchange (20de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Subsequent investigations in this direction accentuated the presence of a regulatory mechanism(s) that would allow SERCA to generate heat at the disbursement of Ca2+ transport (15de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41856-41861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This concept is indeed substantiated by studies showing that binding of sarcolipin (a small regulatory protein that is abundant in the SR of skeletal muscle; for a recent review, see Ref. 21Bhupathy P. Babu G.J. Periasamy M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2007; 42: 903-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) results in uncoupling (22Smith W.S. Broadbridge R. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and increased heat generation (23Mall S. Broadbridge R. Harrison S.L. Gore M.G. Lee A.G. East J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36597-36602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) by SERCA. Hence, interaction of sarcolipin with SERCA shifts its conformational equilibrium toward isomers with an increased tendency to hydrolytic cleavage before translocation to the SR lumen (or Ca2+ release to the cytoplasm followed by hydrolytic cleavage). CPS (Fig. 1A, inset) is the chemical compound that makes chili peppers taste hot. CPS is an agonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1 or VR1), a non-selective cation channel abundantly expressed in sensory neurons (24Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 159-211PubMed Google Scholar). CPS intake has been linked with the suppression of several malignant transformations through a mechanism that is not fully understood. In particular, CPS treatment was reported to significantly slow down the proliferation of prostate cancer cells (25Mori A. Lehmann S. O'Kelly J. Kumagai T. Desmond J.C. Pervan M. McBride W.H. Kizaki M. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3222-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In addition, many studies in the medical literature have linked the consumption of chili-containing meals with increased energy expenditure and fat oxidation (26Diepvens K. Westerp K. Westerterp-Plantega M.S. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2007; 292: 75-85Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In this regard a seeming effect of chili consumption is the rapid increase in body core temperature and subsequent increased heat loss (27Kobayashi A. Osaka T. Namba Y. Inoue S. Lee T.H. Kimura S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R92-R98PubMed Google Scholar). We have been interested in identifying molecular targets for naturally occurring pharmacologically active drugs to understand how these drugs exert their global effects (28Mahmmoud Y.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 145: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29Mahmmoud Y.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 150: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we document that CPS activates ATP hydrolysis by SERCA with almost no effect on its Ca2+ transport function (under the conditions used in this study, see “Experimental Procedures”). Our data are consistent with a model in which CPS increases the steady state concentration of a SERCA isomer in which occluded Ca2+ is released from an E2P-like form to the cytoplasmic side instead of the luminal side of the SR, resulting in uncoupling between ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ transport. Hence, the increase in body metabolism and heat generation after CPS intake is likely a result of, at least in part, the direct effect of CPS on SERCA. Ca2+-ATPase Preparation and Hydrolytic Activity—SR vesicles (a generous gift of J. V. Møller) were prepared as described previously (30de Meis L. Hasselbach W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4759-4763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other experiments unsided membrane fragments prepared by extraction with sodium deoxycholate were used. The hydrolytic activity of SERCA was determined by measuring the Ca2+-dependent inorganic phosphate liberation from ATP after incubation at 37 °C in the presence of different substrate and ligand concentrations. The reaction mixture contained 20 mm MOPS (pH specified in separate figure legends), 130 mm KCl, 2 mm Tris-ATP, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 3 μg of protein in intact SR vesicles or deoxycholate-extracted SR membranes. In some cases ATP hydrolysis in the presence of intact SR vesicles were performed in the presence of 2 μg ml-1 A23187 (unless otherwise indicated) to rapidly dissipate the Ca2+ gradient across the SR membrane. In control samples an excess of EGTA was added to the mixture, bringing the free Ca2+ concentration to about 5–10 nm (thus, SERCA activity in the presence of excess EGTA did not exceed 5% of the maximum ATP hydrolysis measured in the presence of Ca2+). The free Ca2+ concentration was calculated using the program MaxChelator WinmaxC (freely available on the World Wide Web). Liberated inorganic phosphate was determined using a colorimetric method, as described previously (31Baginski E.S. Foa P.P. Zak B. Clin. Chem. 1967; 13: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In other set of experiments the hydrolytic activity at low ATP concentrations was determined in the presence of 200 μm Tris ATP premixed with tracer amounts of [32P]ATP, as described previously (32Lindberg O. Ernster L. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1956; 3: 1-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional experiments were finally performed in which agonists and antagonists to the VR1 were employed to demonstrate the functional absence of passive Ca2+ fluxes through this particular channel during SERCA activity measurements. Phosphoenzyme (EP) Measurements—Enzyme preincubated with either DMSO vehicle or CPS was rapidly mixed with an ice-cold phosphorylation medium producing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0 (unless otherwise indicated), 0.5 mm EGTA, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.08 mg of SR protein/ml. The drug or solvent concentrations were maintained constant after mixing. The free Ca2+ concentrations are mentioned in separate figure legends. Phosphorylation was started by the addition of 10–50 μm Tris-ATP (containing 10–100 μCi [γ-32P]ATP) and quenched at various times with stopping solution consisting of 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate. The acid stable EP was washed twice and collected by centrifugation, and its radioactivity was measured using scintillation counting. In other experiments dephosphorylation was investigated by diluting the phosphorylated enzyme in buffer containing ligands of interest for different time intervals, after which acid quenching, washing, and collection took place. Enzyme phosphorylation from Pi was measured at 24 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, various concentrations of [32P]Pi, and 0.4 mg of SR protein/ml in a total volume of 400 μl. The reaction was acid-quenched after 10 min of incubation by the addition of stopping solution, and the EP was processed as above. Hydrolysis of EP phosphorylated from Pi was performed after 5 min of equilibration at 0 °C. Cleavage with Proteinase K—Intact SR vesicles were incubated in a mixture containing 40 mm MOPS buffer (pH values in Fig. 7), 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm AMP-PCP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.6 mg ml-1 SR protein, 0.028 mg ml-1 proteinase K (PK) in the presence or in the absence of 150 μm CPS. In some cases Ca2+ was added to produce a free Ca2+ concentration of ∼130 μm. The reaction was started with the addition of PK, allowed to proceed for 25 min at 24 °C, and terminated with the addition of equal volume of SDS sample buffer containing 0.5% trichloroacetic acid to ensure complete suppression of the PK action (33Mahmmoud Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1720: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Protein fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein fragments in sample buffer were loaded onto 8% Tricine gels, and electrophoresis took place overnight at 150 V and 11 mA. After electrophoresis the gels were washed and stained with a Coomassie-based EZ blue solution (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Scanning and intensity determination of the dry gels was performed using ImageQuant TL image analysis software (Amersham Biosciences) as previously applied (29Mahmmoud Y.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 150: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Accumulation—Ca2+ accumulation was measured by incubating SR vesicles (10 μg/ml) in a reaction mixture (flux medium) containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7, 80 mm KCl, 25% DMSO, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 16 μm Tris-ATP in the absence or in the presence of 100 μm CPS (added to the vesicles before the assay), and 45CaCl2 to produce a free Ca2+ concentrations of 2.2 μm. The reaction was started with the addition of SR vesicles to the flux medium, and 50 μl were taken at different time intervals and passed through Bio-Rex 70 columns (see Refs. 34Cornelius F. Skou J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 818: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and 35Mahmmoud Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 1757-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Ca2+ entrapped in vesicles was measured using scintillation counting. Control fluxes, which did not exceed 15% of maximum, were measured as above but in the presence of excess EGTA or in the absence of ATP. Statistical Analysis—Mean values are shown, and differences between means were assessed with the unpaired t test. All procedures were taken from Graph Pad Prism. CPS Activation of SERCA and the Effect of Substrates—Results presented in Fig. 1A illustrate the effect of different concentrations of CPS on the steady state ATP hydrolysis by SERCA, measured at neutral pH. Intact SR vesicles as well as deoxycholate-extracted SR membrane fragments were used. In both SERCA preparations CPS significantly stimulated the steady state Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity. The stimulation was more than 3-fold in the case of the intact SR vesicles and about 1.5-fold in the case of the fragmented membranes. After the addition of the necessary substrates to intact SR vesicles, a Ca2+ gradient across the vesicle membrane develops (e.g. Ref. 17Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The establishment of a Ca2+ gradient across the vesicle membrane is likely responsible for the observed difference between the intact vesicles and the membrane fragments. Results shown in Fig. 1B confirmed this prediction and showed that the CPS stimulation of steady state ATP hydrolysis by SERCA significantly diminishes when the membranes of the intact SR vesicles were progressively made leaky by the addition of increasing concentrations of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Indeed, part of the stimulation of SERCA activity by CPS was found to be independent on the presence of a Ca2+ gradient, as indicated by the mild stimulation of activity at concentrations of A23187 more than 1.5 μg ml-1 (a concentration that presumably produces maximum opening of the vesicles; Fig. 1B). This activation likely corresponds to the stimulation observed with the deoxycholate extracted SR membrane fragments (Fig. 1A, filled symbols). CPS, at concentrations up to 300 μm, did not affect the hydrolytic activity of the closely related Na,K-ATPase (data not shown). pH Dependence—The effect of pH on the CPS stimulation of SERCA was investigated. As depicted in Fig. 2A, under conditions allowing Ca2+ accumulation in the SR (intact vesicles), CPS strongly activated ATP hydrolysis by SERCA at the acidic and neutral pH regimes, and the stimulation ceased strongly at alkaline pH. In contrast, in the absence of a Ca2+ gradient (leaky vesicles), CPS mildly stimulates ATP hydrolysis by SERCA in a way that is almost pH-independent (Fig. 2B). ATP Dependence—The activation by various concentrations of ATP of the control and the CPS-treated SR vesicles is depicted in Fig. 3, showing more than 2-fold activation of ATP hydrolysis after CPS treatment. The ATP activation curves were analyzed by comparing two different fitting procedures, which revealed interesting information (see a similar analysis in the supplemental material provided in Mahmmoud (35Mahmmoud Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 1757-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fitting a Michaelis-Menten equation to the data showed that CPS treatment increases the ATP affinity. The analysis was satisfactorily in the case of the control enzyme but gave a bad fit in the case of the CPS-treated enzyme (see the legend to Fig. 3). On the other hand, fitting a two-site activation model to the data gave better fitting for both the control and the CPS-treated curves and revealed distinct effects of the ATP concentration. The nucleotide affinity at the high affinity site strongly decreased (the KD increased from 7.2 ± 0.6 μm for the control enzyme to 27.3 ± 2.4 μm for the CPS-treated enzyme). In contrast, the nucleotide affinity at the low affinity site strongly increased (the KD decreased from 3.70 ± 0.38 mm for the control enzyme to 1.70 ± 0.47 mm for the CPS-treated enzyme). Hence, in the presence of CPS, net ATP hydrolysis increases at higher ATP concentrations. Ca2+ Uptake—ATP-powered Ca2+ transport was measured (see “Experimental Procedures”) in the presence or in the absence of CPS, showing that CPS had no effect on Ca2+ transport into the SR lumen (data not shown). We also determined that CPS does not significantly affect equilibrium Ca2+ binding to the SR membranes in the absence of ATP (data not shown). EP Measurements—When ATP is added to enzyme preincubated with Ca2+, an EP intermediate is rapidly formed and reaches a steady state level, which is dependent on the rates of phosphoryl transfer from ATP and subsequent hydrolytic cleavage of inorganic phosphate from the EP. The Ca2+ dependence of EP formation was measured in the absence or presence of CPS (Fig. 4A), showing that the maximum EP level decreased more than 3-fold after treatment with CPS. The KD for Ca2+ activation of the EP was 1.2 ± 0.11 for the control enzyme and 5.61 ± 0.31 μm for the CPS-treated enzyme. Fig. 4B depicts the time dependence of EP formation measured at a free Ca2+ concentration of 0.2 μm. Fitting one phase exponential association to the data revealed an overall decrease in the rate of EP formation. However, fitting a two-phase exponential association to the data showed distinct effects of CPS on the rate of EP formation; CPS accelerated EP formation in the initial fast phase by about 6-fold, whereas the rate of EP formation in the slower phase slightly decreased (see the legend to Fig. 4B). This significant difference between the control and the CPS-treated vesicles was also demonstrated by blotting the reciprocal of the Y-variable against time, shown in the inset to Fig. 4B. Hence, the CPS-treated enzyme is phosphorylated at a lower final level, but the initial rate of phosphate transfer is faster than that of the control enzyme. That CPS does not interfere with the initial phosphate transfer was also indicated from experiments in which CPS was found to indeed enhance the rate of the E1 → E1P transition. It has previously been shown that reduction of disulfide bonds in SERCA resulted in complete loss of the hydrolytic activity, with complete block of the E1P → E2P transition, without any effect on the E1 → E1P transition (36Daiho T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11060-11064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To this end, the effect of CPS on the time dependence of EP formation of enzyme incubated in the presence of Ca2+/ADP plus 8 mm dithiothreitol (see details in Daiho, T., and Kanazawa (36Daiho T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11060-11064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was investigated. The results showed that CPS treatment resulted in an increase in both the rate and the magnitude of phosphorylation of the dithiothreitol-modified enzyme (Fig. 4C), indicating that the E1 → E1P transition is enhanced after treatment with CPS. The ATP affinity for EP formation was also measured and is depicted in Fig. 5, left panel. ATP stimulated the phosphorylation of the control enzyme with a high affinity (KD = 0.358 ± 0.012 μm), and the maximum EP reached ∼6 nmol·mg-1. Consistent with data in Fig. 4, CPS was found to strongly decrease the steady state EP level (EPmax for the CPS-treated enzyme was ∼2.3 ± 0.11 nmol·mg-1). This decrease was associated with a significant drop in the ATP affinity for phosphorylation (see the legend to Fig. 5). In addition, CPS mildly enhanced the phosphorylation from inorganic phosphate at pH 6.5 (Fig. 5, right panel). No effect was observed at pH 7 (data not shown). After phosphoryl transfer from ATP, an E1(2Ca2+)∼P intermediate is formed. This intermediate is unstable and reacts with ADP to form ATP. Measuring the EP decay after dilution in ADP-containing media can, thus, provide information on the conformational dynamics of the EP. Thus, the enzyme was first phosphorylated on ice for a short time period followed by chasing with 1 mm ADP for different time intervals, after which the EP was quenched with acid. As seen in Fig. 6, the control EP was rapidly dephosphorylated after the addition of ADP. Analysis of the data using a single exponential function gave a decay rate of 0.321 ± 0.023 s-1 for the control enzyme. On the other hand, the EP decay rate was 0.149 ± 0.017 s-1 in the case of the CPS-treated enzyme. This finding demonstrates a CPS-induced shift in the conformational equilibrium of SERCA to an ADP-insensitive isomer. Fitting a linear equation to the slow-decaying component, which provides information on the initial (zero time) level of ADP-insensitive form (28Mahmmoud Y.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 145: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), showed that about 50% of the CPS-stabilized EP is ADP-insensitive. This should be compared with 27% for the control enzyme. EP Decay—The decreased steady state EP level (Fig. 4, A and B, and Fig. 5) together with the increased rate of initial phosphate transfer (Fig. 4C) seen after CPS treatment suggests that the drug increases the rate of EP hydrolysis. Indeed, that CPS increases the rate of hydrolytic cleavage of SERCA was initially indicated from experiments in which the effect of CPS on the activation of SERCA by various concentrations of K+ (which enhances SERCA dephosphorylation; Refs. 37Shigekawa M. Pearl L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6947-6952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Sørensen T.L. Clausen J.D. Jensen A.M. Vilsen B. Møller J.V. Andersen J.P. Nissen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46355-46358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was studied. It was found that the drug increased the affinity of SERCA for K+ by about 2-fold (the K0.5 for K+ activation was 50.1 ± 11.7 mm for the control and 26.5 ± 5.2 mm for the CPS-treated enzyme; data not shown). Hence, we investigated the effect of CPS on the hydrolysis of EP formed either from ATP or from inorganic phosphate. After rapid Ca2+ chelation with a high concentration of EGTA (to prevent further phosphorylation), the enzyme phosphorylated from ATP in the presence of CPS dephosphorylated at a faster rate compared with the control enzyme (Table 1).TABLE 1Dephosphorylation rates of SERCA phosphorylated from either ATP or inorganic phosphate Phosphorylation was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Dephosphorylation was initiated on ice by dilution of the phosphorylation mixture for different intervals producing 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm KCl, or 1 mm adenine nucleotide.

The purified protein polymerized optimally in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP, but differed from conventional actins in its following properties: (i) it did not polymerize in the presence of Mg2+ alone, (ii) it polymerized in a restricted range of pH 7.0-8.5, (iii) its critical concentration for polymerization was found to be 3-4-fold lower than of muscle actin, (iv) it predominantly formed bundles rather than single filaments at pH 8.0, (v) it displayed considerably higher ATPase activity during polymerization, (vi) it did not inhibit DNase-I activity, and (vii) it did not bind the F-actin-binding toxin phalloidin or the actin polymerization disrupting agent Latrunculin B. Computational and molecular modeling studies revealed that the observed unconventional behavior of Leishmania actin is related to the diverged amino acid stretches in its sequence, which may lead to changes in the overall charge distribution on its solvent-exposed surface, ATP binding cleft, Mg2+ binding sites, and the hydrophobic loop that is involved in monomer-monomer interactions. Phylogenetically, it is related to ciliate actins, but to the best of our knowledge, no other actin with such unconventional properties has been reported to date. It is therefore suggested that actin in Leishmania may serve as a novel target for design of new antileishmanial drugs.

It is therefore suggested that actin in Leishmania may serve as a novel target for design of new antileishmanial drugs. Trypanosomatid parasites of the genus Leishmania are the causative agents of several diseases ranging from relatively mild cutaneous lesions to disfiguring mucocutaneous manifestations and fatal visceral leishmaniasis, affecting millions of people worldwide (1Chang K.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. Suppl. 1983; 14: 267-305PubMed Google Scholar). These organisms have a digenic lifecycle and exist in two morphologically distinct forms, viz. promastigotes and amastigotes. Whereas flagellated promastigote forms normally reside and divide in the alimentary tract of the sand fly vector, aflagellated amastigote forms primarily exist within the phagolysosomal complex of the mammalian macrophages (2Killick-Kendrick R. Ann. Parasitol. Hum. Comp. 1990; 65: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The most characteristic structural feature of Leishmania parasites is their flagellar pocket, which is bound by the membrane network devoid of microtubules, and is the only site that is engaged in endocytotic and exocytotic processes (3Balber A.E. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 10: 177-201PubMed Google Scholar, 4Webster P. Russell D.G. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 201-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These processes in the trypanosomatids are essentially required not only for nutrient uptake but also in evasion of host defense (5Engstler M. Pfohl T. Herminghaus S. Boshart M. Wiegertjes G. Heddergott N. Overath P. Cell. 2007; 131: 505-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that depletion of the cytoskeleton protein, actin, in the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei inhibited endocytosis that subsequently resulted in cell death, suggesting that actin is indispensable during this process (6García-Salcedo J.A. Pérez-Morga D. Gijón P. Dilbeck V. Pays E. Nolan D.P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Actin is a ubiquitous cytoskeleton protein in eukaryotes, which exists in monomeric (G-actin) and filamentous (F-actin) forms and plays an important role in several vital cellular processes such as cell motility, cell division, endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, etc. (7Reisler E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 41-47Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although this protein is well characterized in a number of organisms including protozoans, like Entamoeba (8Meza I. Sabanero M. Cazares F. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3936-3941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Tetrahymena (9Hirono M. Kumagai Y. Numata O. Watanabe Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2006; 17: 895-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), little is known about the biochemical properties and cellular functions of actin present in trypanosomatid parasites, such as Leishmania and Trypanosoma (6García-Salcedo J.A. Pérez-Morga D. Gijón P. Dilbeck V. Pays E. Nolan D.P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Sahasrabuddhe A.A. Bajpai V.K. Gupta C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 134: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, it has recently been shown by immunolabeling techniques that actin in Leishmania, besides being present in cortical regions and the flagellar pocket, is also present in the kinetoplast and nucleus, where it appeared to co-localize with DNA (16Sahasrabuddhe A.A. Bajpai V.K. Gupta C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 134: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Raza S. Sahasrabuddhe A.A. Gupta C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2007; 153: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We therefore, envisage that actin in Leishmania may also be involved in other cellular processes such as chromatin/k-DNA remodeling (18Chen M. Shen X. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Earlier attempts to isolate Leishmania/Trypanosoma actin by using a conventional method of DNase-I affinity chromatography were unsuccessful, as this enzyme did not bind to trypanosomatid actin in whole cell lysates (19Mortara R.A. J. Protozool. 1989; 36: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Also, staining with fluorescently labeled phalloidin failed to stain filamentous actin in these organisms (16Sahasrabuddhe A.A. Bajpai V.K. Gupta C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 134: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Mortara R.A. J. Protozool. 1989; 36: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Gull K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 629-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Moreover, no filament-like structures corresponding to mammalian actin filaments (5-7 nm diameter) could be visualized by using electron microscopy (20Gull K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 629-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 21Hammarton T.C. Wickstead B. Mc Kean P.G. Berry D. Mottram J. Acosta-Serrano A. Trypanosomes: After The Genome. Wellcome Centre for Molecular Parasitology, University of Glasgov, Glasgov, UK2007: 239-280Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it was believed that actin may play only a limited role in cellular activities of trypanosomatid parasites, and that this protein is perhaps not a major cytoskeleton protein in these organisms (20Gull K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 629-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 21Hammarton T.C. Wickstead B. Mc Kean P.G. Berry D. Mottram J. Acosta-Serrano A. Trypanosomes: After The Genome.

RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2000; 6: 1069-1076Google Scholar). However, recent work from our laboratory has shown that Leishmania contains abundant quantities of actin, which is mainly present in the form of granules, patches, and filament-like structures (16Sahasrabuddhe A.A. Bajpai V.K. Gupta C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 134: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has further been shown that these filament-like structures are associated with an F-actin-binding protein, coronin (23Nayak R.C. Sahasrabuddhe A.A. Bajpai V.K. Gupta C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 143: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To fully characterize the biochemical properties of Leishmania actin (LdACT), 3The abbreviations used are:LdACTLeishmania actinRbACTrabbit actinTRITCtetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanateHRPhorseradish peroxidaseCccritical concentrationMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidNi2+-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. 3The abbreviations used are:LdACTLeishmania actinRbACTrabbit actinTRITCtetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanateHRPhorseradish peroxidaseCccritical concentrationMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidNi2+-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. we have now overexpressed this protein in the baculovirus-insect cell expression system, purified it to homogeneity, and compared its biochemical properties with the purified rabbit muscle actin (RbACT). Comparative biochemical analysis of the purified protein revealed that LdACT markedly differed from RbACT in its various properties that distinguish LdACT as a novel form of eukaryotic actin.

Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen) were maintained at 27 °C as monolayer cultures in TNM-FH medium (Invitrogen). These cells were routinely subcultured at 3-4-day intervals and were replaced with frozen stocks after every 3 months. The Leishmania donovani strain (DD8) was obtained from the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi (India), and maintained in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s nutrient medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 40 mg/liter gentamycin at 25 °C. pENTR/SD/D-TOPO as a baculovirus entry vector was procured from Invitrogen, whereas p6.5 as an episomal expression vector was a kind gift from Prof. K. P. Chang (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). Monospecific, polyclonal antibodies to Leishmania actin (LdACT) and coronin (LdCORO) were raised in rabbits and mice, respectively, and purified using published procedures (16Sahasrabuddhe A.A. Bajpai V.K. Gupta C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 134: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Nayak R.C. Sahasrabuddhe A.A. Bajpai V.K. Gupta C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 143: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Purified anti-recombinant LdACT and anti-LdCORO antibodies specifically recognized only LdACT and LdCORO, respectively, in the whole cell lysates of Leishmania promastigotes. Antibodies against α,β-tubulins (monoclonals) were procured from ICN, antibodies against GRP78 was a kind gift from Dr. E. Handman, and fluorophore-tagged IgGs were purchased from Molecular Probes. Expression of LdACT in the Baculovirus-Insect Cell System—Genomic DNA from cultured L. donovani promastigotes was isolated using standard protocol (24Ozaki L.S. Cseko Y.M.T. Morel C.M. Genes and Antigens of Parasites, a Laboratory Manual. Fundacao Oswalde Cruz, Rio de Janeiro1984: 165-185Google Scholar). For insect cell transfection, the coding sequence of LdACT was PCR amplified using primers 5′-CACCATGGCTGACAACGAGCAGAGCTCCATCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCGAGTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGAAACACTTGTTATGCACGATGCTCGGCCC-3′ (reverse), which incorporated sequence coding for the His6 tag at the C terminus of the protein, and genomic DNA as the template. The PCR product was subsequently cloned into viral transfer vector pENTR/SD/D-TOPO and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52495) Google Scholar). Entry vector containing LdACT was subjected to in vitro LR recombination with linearized baculodirect genomic DNA at 25 °C (Invitrogen). Recombinant viruses were obtained after 96 h by transfection of LR recombination product into Sf9 cells in the presence of 100 μm ganciclovir as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfected Sf9 cells were assayed 96 h postinfection for the expression of LdACT-His6 (rLdACT) by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using mouse monoclonal antibodies against hexahistidine (Amersham Biosciences) as well as rabbit monospecific polyclonal antibodies against LdACT, followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG/anti-rabbit IgG. Signals were captured by chemiluminescence detection (Millipore) and exposure to x-ray film. Homologous Expression of LdACT in Leishmania Promastigotes—Episomal expression of LdACT in L. donovani promastigotes was made possible by a homologous episomal expression vector p6.5. The construct p6.5-LdACT was generated by PCR amplification of LdACT using primers 5′-GCTAGCATGGCTGACAACGAACAGAGCTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGCTTTCAGAAGCACTTGTTATGCACGATGCT-3′ (reverse) and genomic DNA as the template, and the PCR product was subsequently cloned in p6.5 vector at NheI and HindIII sites (present in the vector multiple cloning site, and forward and reverse primers respectively). The presence of LdACT in the construct was examined by restriction enzyme digestion and the nucleotide sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52495) Google Scholar). 40 μg of both the p6.5-LdACT construct and p6.5 control plasmids were transfected separately into 107 L. donovani promastigotes by electroporation (26Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turcob S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were further selected in the growth medium containing tunicamycin up to 20 μg/ml and maintained in the same conditions. Lysates of both p6.5-LdACT-and p6.5-transfected promastigotes prepared by lysing equal number of cells were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, washed, and blocked, as described previously (16Sahasrabuddhe A.A. Bajpai V.K. Gupta C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 134: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Nayak R.C. Sahasrabuddhe A.A. Bajpai V.K. Gupta C.M. Mol. Biochem.

Signals were captured by chemiluminescence detection and exposure to x-ray film. Band intensities were determined by densitometric analysis. The level of LdACT expression in transfected promastigotes was cross-confirmed by flow cytometry. For this, both p6.5-LdACT- and p6.5-transfected promastigotes (106 cells) were harvested, washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 0.5% glycine, and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then treated with rabbit anti-LdACT antibodies, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and analyzed by using a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer using Cell Quest support software for acquisition and analysis. All the purification steps were performed in cold below 20 °C. Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus (multiplicity of infection 0.8) were harvested at 72 h postinfection and lysed in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.6 m KCl, 0.5 mm Na2ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors containing 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml E64, and 10 μg/ml Nα-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride. Cells lysate was clarified and dialyzed overnight into 15 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm Na2ATP, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysate was then passed through a SP Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) two times and flow through was dialyzed into G-buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 mm Na2ATP). After dialysis it was incubated with Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads for 1 h, preequilibrated with G-buffer. Beads were washed with G-buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, and rLdACT was eluted with G-buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The eluted fraction was concentrated with an Amicon Ultracentrifugal filter device (Millipore) and finally purified on a Superdex 75 HR 10/300 column on AKTA fast performance liquid chromatography (GE Healthcare). The peak fraction was tested for purity by 12% SDS-PAGE and was found to be about 95% pure. Purified rLdACT thus obtained was utilized within 2-3 days for further experiments. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified from rabbit muscle acetone powder as described by Pardee and Spudich (27Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar) and stored in lyophilized form at −80 °C after addition of sucrose (2 mg/mg protein). RbACT was subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 HR 10/300 column on AKTA fast performance liquid chromatography each time after thawing a new frozen vial, and only the peak fractions of monomeric actin were used in the experiments. Sedimentation Assay—Actin polymerization was monitored by ultracentrifugation as reported earlier (28Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Purified rLdACT or RbACT was first incubated in G-buffer for 1 h on ice followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove traces of aggregates, if any. In the supernatant fractions, actin polymerization was initiated by adding 1/10th volume of ×10 F-actin buffer to make the final concentration of 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP and incubated at 25 °C for another 2 h. Although the concentration of ATP used was higher, but ATP in this range has been used earlier for the polymerization of conventional as well as various homologs of actin, without any adverse effect on actin (15Sahoo N. Beatty W. Heuser J. Sept D. Sibley L.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 895-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ikkai T. Kondo H. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 77-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged at 140,000 × g at 25 °C for 2 h. Pellet fractions were washed once with F-actin buffer, resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or transblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and probed with rabbit anti-LdACT antibodies followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and chemiluminescence detection. Fluorescence Quenching and Light Scattering Assay—Actin polymerization was also monitored by measuring the decrease in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence as reported earlier (30Frieden C. Du J. Schriefer L. Buzan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra for actin samples were obtained on a PerkinElmer LS50B Spectroluminescence meter in a 5-mm path length quartz cell. Samples were excited with 290 nm and their respective emissions were scanned from 300 to 500 nm. Actin polymerization was monitored by adding 1/10th volume of ×10 F-actin buffer to the solution containing varying concentrations of protein followed by incubation at 25 °C for 2 h. The critical concentration was determined by plotting the change in fluorescence after adding F-actin buffer to different concentrations of rLdACT or RbACT. The time course of actin polymerization was monitored by recording light scattering at 90° from the axis of incident light of 400 nm wavelength (excitation slit width 1.5 nm, emission slit width 2.5 nm) as described previously (31Wegner A. Engel J. Biophys. Chem. 1975; 3: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) using an RF-540 spectrofluorimeter. DNase-I inhibition assay was performed in the presence of rLdACT and RbACT as described earlier (32Blikstad I. Markey F. Carlsson L. Persson T. Lindberg U. Cell. 1978; 15: 935-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of DNase-I (4 μm) was added to samples containing a range of protein concentrations in G-buffer and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Salmon sperm DNA (6 μl of 10 mg/ml) was added to each sample prior to recording the absorbance at 260 nm in a Shimadzu UV-1650 PC Spectrophotometer. Linear rates of hyperchromicity were monitored for DNase-I activity and plotted in terms of % inhibition of DNase-I activity with increasing concentrations of actin. Additionally, the effect of rLdACT and RbACT on the activity of DNase-I was also compared by adding both the actins separately to the reaction mixture containing DNase-I and salmon sperm DNA followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, as described earlier (33Zeng Z. Parmelee D. Hyaw H. Coleman T.A. Su K. Zhang J. Gentz R. Ruben S. Rosen C. Li Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For this, 100 ng of bovine pancreatic DNase-I (Fermentas) was preincubated with 2 μg/reaction of G-actin (rLdACT or RbACT) in DNase-I buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm CaCl2) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by addition of 3 μg/reaction of salmon sperm DNA and the samples were incubated at room temperature for another 45 min. To terminate the reaction, 25 mm EDTA was added to each reaction and the samples were resolved on a 1% agarose gel and photographed under UV light. Binding of phalloidin with F-actin on the other hand was analyzed using an earlier published procedure (28Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Briefly, rLdACT or RbACT over a range of protein concentrations were polymerized separately in F-actin buffer for 2 h at room temperature. After polymerization, F-actin in each sample was labeled with 2 μm TRITC-phalloidin (sigma) and the increase in fluorescence of TRITC-phalloidin was monitored by measuring fluorescence (λem 585 nm, λex 544 nm) on a PerkinElmer LS50B Spectroluminescence meter. Additionally, binding of the phalloidin to both rLdACT and RbACT was also analyzed by measuring the decrease in tryptophan fluorescence of polymerized actin upon binding with phalloidin. For this, 2 μm rLdACT and RbACT with various replicates were polymerized separately in F-actin buffer at 25 °C for 2 h. After polymerization, increasing concentrations of the ligand (TRITC-phalloidin) were added and the samples were further incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Finally, samples were analyzed for their respective tryptophan fluorescence on a PerkinElmer LS50B Spectroluminescence meter (λem 300-500 nm, λex 290 nm). Leishmania promastigotes and infected Sf9 cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 200 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) at 25 °C for 30 min, and washed two times for 5 min each with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% (w/v) glycine. The washed cells were allowed to adhere on the poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and blocked with 10% (v/v) goat serum (Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. After blocking, the cells were first incubated with primary antibodies (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C and then stained with Oregon Green and/or Texas Red-X-tagged secondary antibodies (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 4 h in the dark. Coverslips were mounted in the mounting medium (Oncogene) and images were collected using a ×63, 1.4 NA (oil) Plan Apochromate lens on a Leica DM5000B fluorescence microscope. Green and red images were collected separately after excitation at 488 and 543 nm, respectively, and merged for presentation. rLdACT and RbACT were polymerized separately in F-actin buffer at 25 °C for 2 h. For each specimen, 6 μl of the samples were allowed to adsorb for 2 min on a freshly glowed carbon-coated copper grid (300 mesh). After blotting off the excess fluid from the grid, staining was done with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate solution. Finally, grids were air dried and observed under a FEI Tecnai-12 Twin Transmission Electron Microscope equipped with a SIS MegaView II CCD camera at 120 kV. Measurements were done using AnalySIS software (SIS, Herzogenrath, Germany). ATP hydrolysis by RbACT and rLdACT during their polymerization was monitored by using the malachite green assay as described earlier (34Geladopoulos T.P. Sotiroudis T.G. Evangelopoulos A.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Polymerization of both RbACT and rLdACT was initiated separately by the addition of ×10 F-actin buffer at 25 °C. At 2-min intervals, the reaction was deproteinized with 1 volume of cold 0.6 m perchloric acid and stored on ice until all samples for the different time points were collected. The samples were centrifuged and their supernatants were removed for inorganic phosphate determination. To each sample 1/4th volume of coloring agent (0.44 g of malachite green, 3% (w/v) ammonium molybdate, 0.2 ml of 11% Tween 20 in 2.6 n H2SO4) was added, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and absorbance measured at 630 nm using a precision microplate reader. The curves were normalized with KH2PO4 standard and a control without protein. Pi produced versus time was plotted for various concentrations of both the actins. The rate of Pi produced at the linear part of each curve was determined and plotted as a function of actin concentration to determine the rate of ATP hydrolysis presented in terms of Pi produced (μm/min). Release of inorganic phosphate during polymerization of RbACT and rLdACT was determined with the EnzChek kit (Molecular Probes) employing a procedure modified from the manufacturer’s instructions because of significant absorbance of light at 360 nm by polymerized RbACT and rLdACT. Parallel reactions were carried out with and without the EnzChek enzyme and reactant components. Both reactions were read in real time at 360 nm in a Shimadzu UV-1650 PC Spectrophotometer. Polymerization of both RbACT and rLdACT were initiated by the addition of ×10 F-actin buffer at 25 °C and the absorbance of RbACT and rLdACT alone were subtracted from those of the complete reactions. A standard curve of Pi concentrations was employed as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Phosphate release curves were overlain onto the 400-nm light scattering curves of parallel polymerization reactions carried out in the RF-540 spectrofluorimeter. The completion phase of each curve was set to 100% and the values of each curve were normalized with the 100% value. Ellipticity spectra were recorded between 200 and 250 nm in a Jasco J810 spectropolarimeter calibrated with ammonium (+)-10-camphorsulfonate. The values obtained were normalized by subtracting the baseline recorded for the buffer having the same concentration of the constituent ions under similar conditions and the results were expressed as mean residual ellipticity. Thermal denaturation was monitored by change in molar ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature on the same spectropolarimeter, equipped with a peltier temperature controller system. Samples were heated at constant rate of 1 °C/min in a 1-mm path length cell. The amino acid sequences of actin from various organisms, viz.

https://openalex.org/W2143636612,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) expression is increased by angiotensin II (Ang II) within paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons of normotensive rats and acts via its intrinsic thiol protein oxidoreductase (TPOR) to counterregulate the central nervous system-mediated pressor action of Ang II. Considering that the PVN-mediated actions of Ang II are enhanced in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and contribute to the development of hypertension in these animals, we investigated this MIF regulatory mechanism in SHRs. Here, we have demonstrated that Ang II failed to increase MIF protein expression in the PVN of SHRs. Furthermore, although basal levels of MIF protein and mRNA were similar in the PVN of SHRs and normotensive rats, immunostaining revealed that MIF was either absent from or diminished in PVN neurons of SHRs. AAV2-mediated increases in MIF expression within PVN neurons of young (8 wk old) SHRs produced a chronic attenuation of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. However, similar AAV2-mediated transduction of [C60S]-MIF, which lacks TPOR activity, did not alter the development of hypertension or cardiac hypertrophy in SHRs. Collectively, these findings suggest that a lack of MIF expression within PVN neurons contributes to the development of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy in SHRs."
https://openalex.org/W2078463367,"The development of therapeutic strategies to inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage in blood vessels has been limited by a lack of specific targets for intervention. Targeting ROS-mediated events in the vessel wall is of interest, because ROS play important roles throughout atherogenesis. In early atherosclerosis, ROS stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth, whereas in late stages of lesion development, ROS induce VSMC apoptosis, causing atherosclerotic plaque instability. To identify putative protective genes against oxidative stress, mouse aortic VSMC were infected with a retroviral human heart cDNA expression library, and apoptosis was induced in virus-infected cells by 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ) treatment. A total of 17 different, complete cDNAs were identified from the DMNQ-resistant VSMC clones by PCR amplification and sequencing. The cDNA encoding PP1cγ1 (catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1) was present in several independent DMNQ-resistant VSMC clones. DMNQ increased mitochondrial ROS production, caspase-3/7 activity, DNA fragmentation, and decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential in VSMC while decreasing PP1cγ1 activity and expression. Depletion of PP1cγ1 expression by short hairpin RNA significantly enhanced basal as well as DMNQ-induced VSMC apoptosis. PP1cγ1 overexpression abrogated DMNQ-induced JNK1 activity, p53 Ser15 phosphorylation, and Bax expression and protected VSMC against DMNQ-induced apoptosis. In addition, PP1cγ1 overexpression attenuated DMNQ-induced caspase-3/7 activation and DNA fragmentation. Inhibition of p53 protein expression using small interfering RNA abrogated DMNQ-induced Bax expression and significantly attenuated VSMC apoptosis. Together, these data indicate that PP1cγ1 overexpression promotes VSMC survival by interfering with JNK1 and p53 phosphorylation cascades involved in apoptosis.

VSMC proliferation and migration are important in the development of atherosclerotic lesions, and VSMC apoptosis is a histologic hallmark of advanced atherosclerosis (1Delafontaine P. Song Y.H. Li Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Additionally, human VSMC isolated from coronary plaques are more susceptible to apoptosis than VSMC isolated from normal arteries (2Bennett M.R. Evan G.I. Schwartz S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Apoptosis of VSMC in atherosclerotic plaques is accompanied by numerous other events that increase the likelihood of plaque rupture. These include decreases in collagen and extracellular matrix protein production, decreased fibrous cap thickness, accumulation of macrophages along the shoulder of the plaque, and increases in the size of the necrotic core and amount of cellular debris within the plaque (3Clarke M.C. Figg N. Maguire J.J. Davenport A.P. Goddard M. Littlewood T.D. Bennett M.R. Nat Med. 2006; 12: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar).

Identifying genes that could protect cells against oxidative stress requires selection of an oxidant and a screening strategy. A number of different approaches have been used to induce oxidative stress in cultured cells and in vivo. The quinones are of particular interest. Quinones are ubiquitous in nature and are also formed as metabolites from a variety of drugs, environmental pollutants, and food derivatives by the action of cytochrome P450 system (4Monks T.J. Hanzlik R.P. Cohen G.M. Ross D. Graham D.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1992; 112: 2-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The redox-cycling 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ) has been proposed as a model quinone compound to study the role of ROS in cell toxicity and apoptosis (5Watanabe N. Forman H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It does not react with free thiol groups and is nonalkylating and nonadduct-forming. One-electron reduction of DMNQ by flavoenzymes, such as NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase or NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, yields a semiquinone radical, which then reacts with oxygen to form superoxide (O2.¯) and, subsequently, the dismutation product H2O2. An obligatory two-electron reducing cytosolic flavoenzyme NADPH oxidoreductase 1, also known as DT-diaphorase, can compete with one-electron reductases for DMNQ to produce a hydroquinone, which can undergo autoxidation to yield H2O2 and the parental quinone. Retroviral cDNA expression library screening has been used successfully to identify novel oncogenes (6Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 704-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and modulators of apoptosis (7Hitoshi Y. Lorens J. Kitada S.I. Fisher J. LaBarge M. Ring H.Z. Francke U. Reed J.C. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P.

Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 754-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The packaging cell lines used in conjunction with retroviral vectors generate high concentrations of infectious virus particles necessary for the efficient infection of large cell populations, including that of primary cells, with a single copy of vector per cell (9Lorens J.B. Sousa C. Bennett M.K. Molineaux S.M. Payan D.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, retroviral delivery systems have the ability to deliver very large libraries to infected cell populations. These properties make retroviral cDNA expression library screening an ideal strategy to identify genes that protect against oxidative stress. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation play an important regulatory role in apoptosis and other cellular processes (10Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar, 11Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 12Gjertsen B.T. Doskeland S.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), 2A (PP2A), 2B (PP2B), and 2C (PP2C) are the four major serine/threonine phosphatases present in eukaryotic cells (13Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). Of these four, PP1 and PP2A account for the majority of cellular phosphatase activity (13Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of PP1 exists in four different isoforms (α, γ1, γ2, and δ), which are targeted to various subcellular compartments by association with distinct regulatory proteins (14Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 15Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of targeting proteins with the catalytic subunit also modulates substrate specificity, enabling unique and independent roles for the various isoforms in regulating discrete cellular processes (15Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A, induces apoptosis in several cells, and this was attributed to its preferential inhibition of one or the other isoform depending on the cell type (16Mellgren G. Vintermyr O.K. Boe R. Doskeland S.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Fernandez-Sanchez M.T. Garcia-Rodriguez A. Diaz-Trelles R. Novelli A.

Biochem. 1998; 257: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid-induced epithelial cell apoptosis and inhibition of PP1 were correlated with increased expression of tumor suppressor gene p53 and proapoptotic gene Bax (19Li D.W. Fass U. Huizar I. Spector A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation in both the carboxyl-terminal and N-terminal domains modulates DNA binding ability and transcriptional activity of p53 (20Takenaka I. Morin F. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5405-5411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 21Turenne G.A. Paul P. Laflair L. Price B.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5100-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that direct dephosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and Ser37 by PP1 affects its stability and transcriptional and apoptotic activities (22Haneda M. Kojima E. Nishikimi A. Hasegawa T. Nakashima I. Isobe K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Li D.W. Liu J.P. Schmid P.C. Schlosser R. Feng H. Liu W.B. Yan Q. Gong L. Sun S.M. Deng M. Liu Y. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3006-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Among the kinases that regulate the p53 pathway are the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) group of mitogen-activated protein kinases. JNKs are activated in cells exposed to various environmental stresses (24Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an integral part in this activation (25Shen H.M. Liu Z.G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 928-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The 10 members of the JNK family are generated by alternative splicing of transcripts from Jnk1, Jnk2, and Jnk3 genes (24Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). Jnk1 and Jnk2 double knock-out cells are resistant to apoptosis induced by UV, anisomycin, or DNA damage (26Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N.

Proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak are necessary for JNK-induced apoptosis, and Bax remains inactive in Jnk-deficient fibroblasts exposed to environmental stress (27Lei K. Nimnual A. Zong W.X.

Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar), which are dephosphorylated by dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (28Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). In this study, we used retrovirus-mediated insertion of a human heart cDNA library into mouse aortic VSMC to create DMNQ-resistant cell clones. The clones contained 17 full-length cDNAs. We chose to investigate the role of PP1cγ1 (catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1) in oxidative stress resistance because the cDNA coding for this protein was present in several independent DMNQ-resistant VSMC clones and because of our continued interest in protein phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism in atherosclerotic disease process in general and VSMC biology in particular. DMNQ treatment induced mitochondrial ROS production and decreased PP1cγ1 activity in VSMC. Overexpression of PP1cγ1 decreased DMNQ-induced phosphorylation of JNK1 and p53 (Ser15) and protected against DMNQ-induced apoptosis. Further, p53 shRNA transfection protected VSMC against DMNQ-induced apoptosis. Together, these results suggest that PP1cγ1 may regulate molecular mechanisms that mediate VSMC apoptosis in atherosclerosis and restenosis. Materials—DMNQ and diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) were obtained from Calbiochem. Rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, oxypurinol, proadifen, phenelzine, indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, leptin, and antimycin A were purchased from Sigma. MitoTracker Green FM, MitoSOX Red, and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate were purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). The antibodies used were anti-PP1cγ1, anti-p53, anti-Bax, and anti-JNK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-p53 (Ser15) (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-β-actin (Sigma). Glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun-(1-79) recombinant protein was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from GE Healthcare. Cell Culture—Aortic VSMC were isolated from 4-month-old male C57BL/6 mice as previously described by us (29Moon S.K. Thompson L.J. Madamanchi N. Ballinger S. Papacon-stantinou J. Horaist C. Runge M.S. Patterson C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2779-H2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) as described previously (30Madamanchi N.R. Li S. Patterson C. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18915-18924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted using VSMC between passages 4 and 11 that were growth-arrested by incubation in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS for 72 h. Quiesced VSMC were treated with 60 μm DMNQ for 16 h. Single cell clones that survived the treatment were isolated by localized trypsinization using cloning cylinders (Sigma) and expanded using the Glasgow modification of Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× nonessential amino acids, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, a 1:1000 dilution of β-mercaptoethanol stock solution (70 μl of β-mercaptoethanol in 20 ml of distilled water), and 500 units/ml of leukocyte-inhibitory factor (Chemicon). Virus Production—A human heart cDNA expression library was constructed in a replication-defective Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vector, pCFB (Stratagene). The unidirectionally oriented cDNA library contained 1 × 106 primary clones and was amplified only once to ensure the best representation. Retrovirus was produced using the MBS mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene). In brief, the ecotropic virus packaging cell line Phoenix-Eco (Orbigen) was transfected with pCFB-human heart cDNA expression library or retroviral plasmid by the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method. Retroviruses secreted by transfected cells were collected from cell supernatant 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection and immediately applied to VSMC or 293T cells without any freezing and thawing steps. The concentration of infectious particles was determined by exposing 293T cells to virus containing the lacZ reporter gene (pFB-Neo-LacZ; Stratagene). In brief, cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate, 16 h prior to virus infection. Infection/transduction was performed in the presence of 10 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were stained for β-galactosidase expression using an in situ β-galactosidase staining kit (Stratagene). The number of blue-stained cells was estimated by light microscopy at ×200 magnification. cDNA Library Screening in VSMC—VSMC (1.0 × 106) were seeded in 15-cm tissue culture dishes. Ten dishes (about 1 × 107 cells) were infected with 2 × 106 infectious particles of human heart cDNA expression library in pCFB retrovirus as described above. 20% infection was achieved as determined by staining for β-galactosidase activity in control cells. Infected cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C to achieve maximal expression of genes (ViraPort XR Plasmid cDNA Library protocol; Stratagene). Then VSMC were treated with 60 μm DMNQ for 16 h. Single cell clones that survived DMNQ treatment were isolated as described above. Isolation and Sequencing of Transduced cDNAs—Genomic DNA from 132 clones was isolated using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen) and was used for PCR recovery of cDNA inserts. A 5′ Retro primer (5′-GGCTGCCGACCCCGGGGGTGG-3′) and 3′ Retro primer (5′-CGAACCCCAGAGTCCCGCTCA-3′) specific for the virus vector sequence flanking cDNA inserts were used for PCR synthesis of cDNAs. PCR was run for 33 cycles (15 s at 94 °C, 4 min at 68 °C) and a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using the above mentioned primers. The PCR products were analyzed on agarose gels to determine the length of the cDNAs. Construction of Recombinant Viruses—To make retroviral and adenoviral constructs encoding PP1cγ1 cDNA, PP1cγ1 was subcloned from pEGFP-C1-PP1cγ1 (kindly provided by Dr. Laura Trinkle-Mulcahy (University of Dundee, Scotland)) into pQCXIP (BD Bioscienses) and pShuttle-CMV, respectively. The sequence of PP1cγ1 constructs was confirmed by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. Retrovirus encoding PP1cγ1 cDNA was generated as described above. Adenovirus encoding PP1cγ1 cDNA was generated after homologous recombination of pShuttle-CMV containing PP1cγ1 cDNA with the adenoviral backbone plasmid pADEasy-1 in BJ5183 Escherichia coli (Stratagene). The recombinant (LE1/E3-deficient) adenoviruses were propagated by the transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). The virus was serially amplified and then purified using the ViraBind adenovirus purification kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc.). A control adenovirus contained an identical adenovirus backbone with green fluorescent protein cDNA (AdGFP). Two mouse pSM2 retroviral shRNAs for p53 and one retroviral scrambled shRNA construct were purchased from Open Biosystems. The sense sequences of p53 shRNA were 5′-ACCAGTCTACTTCCCGCCATAA-3′ (RHS1764-9208347) and 5′-CCCACTACAAGTACATGTGTAA-3′ (RMM1766-98468519). Constructs were transfected into Phoenix-Eco cells for retrovirus packaging and amplification using the MBS mammalian transfection kit. Retrovirus containing supernatant was used to infect VSMC, and transduced cells were selected using puromycin (2.5 μg/ml)-containing medium. Successful suppression of p53 expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Overexpression of PP1cγ1 Using the Adenoviral Infection System—Adenoviral infection of nearly confluent VSMC was performed at a multiplicity of infection of 100 in DMEM containing 2% FBS. After 16 h of incubation, the cells were quiesced in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS for 72 h. Retroviral p53 and Pp1cγ1 shRNA Constructs and Infection of Mouse Aortic VSMC—Mouse retroviral shRNAmir against p53 and Pp1cγ1 was purchased from Open Biosystems. The scrambled shRNA encoded a 19-bp scrambled sequence (5'-GCGCGCTTTGTAGGATTCG) with no significant homology to any mouse gene and was cloned into pSUPER.retro.puro vector. Retroviral infection of VSMC was performed by spreading 3 ml of virus supplemented with 10 μg/ml DEAE-dextran on VSMC seeded in 100-mm plates. After 3 h of incubation, an additional 7.0 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS was added, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 21 h. The infection medium was then replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. For p53 and Pp1cγ1 shRNA expression, puromycin-resistant clones (selected with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin for 10 days) were expanded prior to their use in experiments. Cell Viability Assay—VSMC viability after DMNQ treatment was determined by either crystal violet staining or the trypan blue exclusion method. In the former method, DMNQ-treated VSMC in 96-well plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with 100 μl of crystal violet solution (0.5% (w/v) crystal violet, 1.5% (v/v) formaldehyde, and 1% (v/v) ethanol) for 30 min. After the wells were washed with water, stained cells were lysed with 1% (w/v) deoxycholate solution, and the absorbance was read at 560 nm using a microplate reader. Trypan blue exclusion was determined microscopically by scoring five fields of 100 cells each. Intracellular ROS Measurement—VSMC (8 × 105) were seeded in 24-well glass bottom plates, grown for 48 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS, and quiesced for an additional 24 h in culture medium containing 0.1% FBS. Cells were then treated with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing the H2O2-sensitive fluorophore 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (5 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C in darkness. The cells were treated with fresh 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and DMNQ and incubated for another 30 min. For studying the effect of cellular oxidase inhibitors on DMNQ-induced ROS production, VSMC were pretreated with DPI, oxypurinol, proadifen, phenelzine, indomethacin, or nordihydroguaiaretic acid for 30 min before treatment with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and DMNQ. The fluorescence of DCF was measured using a microplate reader at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 530 nm. Then cells were lysed, and protein content was quantified. Detection of Mitochondrial ROS—VSMC grown in glass bottom dishes were quiesced and treated with 10 μm DMNQ for 30 min. Cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated with 5 μm MitoSOX Red and 1 μm MitoTracker Green FM (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 10 min. Excess stains were removed, and cells were imaged using Olympus FV500 confocal laser-scanning microscopy. MitoTracker Green FM was visualized at an excitation of 490 nm and an emission of 516 nm, whereas MitoSOX Red was visualized at an excitation of 560 nm and an emission of 600 nm. MitoTracker Green FM preferentially translocates to the mitochondria. MitoSOX Red accumulates in mitochondria and exhibits bright red fluorescence upon oxidation and subsequent binding to mitochondrial DNA. Detection of Changes in Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential—Changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential were detected using the MitoCapture apoptosis detection kit (BioVision Research Products), which provides a fluorescence-based method for distinguishing between healthy and apoptotic cells. VSMC, either untreated or treated with 10 μm DMNQ for 15 h, were incubated with diluted MitoCapture solution at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 20 min. The cells were washed with the incubation buffer three times and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Cells were photographed by fluorescent microscopy. Isolation of Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated from 80% confluent VSMC using a Pierce mitochondrial isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions with the addition of complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Igepal, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors), and Western analysis was performed as described previously (30Madamanchi N.R. Li S. Patterson C. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18915-18924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cell lysates containing 50 μg of protein were analyzed in Western blotting experiments. Assessment of Apoptosis—For detection of apoptosis, growth-arrested VSMC were harvested after 16 h of treatment with 10 μm DMNQ. Histone-associated DNA fragmentation in cell lysates was determined using the cell death detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Applied Science) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. A TUNEL apoptosis detection kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was used to measure DNA fragmentation according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, following treatment, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized by incubating with 0.5% Tween 20 and 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 15 min. Then cells were incubated with a reaction mix containing biotin-dUTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase for 60 min. Transfer of biotin-dUTP to the free 3′-OH end of cleaved DNA was visualized by reaction with fluorescein-conjugated avidin (fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin) for 30 min and photographed by fluorescence microscopy. Cells were counterstained with propidium iodide. Apoptosis was also assessed by measuring caspase-3/7 activities using an Apo-ONE™ homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay kit (Promega). Briefly, growth-arrested VSMC were treated with 10 μm DMNQ for 6 h. The cells were lysed using bifunctional cell lysis/activity buffer, which contained a profluorescent caspase-3/7 consensus substrate, rhodamine 110 bis-N-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamyl-l-valyl-aspartic acid amide (Z-DEVD-R110). After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, aliquots (150 μl) were transferred to a 96-well clear bottom plate. Fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm using a WALLAC 1420 Multilabel Counter. Measurement of Pp1cγ1 mRNA Expression—Total RNA from VSMC that were either treated or untreated with DMNQ was extracted using the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using the TaqMan reverse transcription reagents kit (Applied Biosystems). The Pp1cγ1 gene expression assay (catalog number Mm00849631-s1) was purchased from Applied Biosystems. Real time PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detection System and TaqMan PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Sequence Detection System software (version 2.1) (Applied Biosystems) was used for raw data analysis. Pp1cγ1 relative expression was calculated using the Relative Expression Software Tool (31Pfaffl M.W. Horgan G.W. Dempfle L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by normalization to 18 S ribosomal expression. Measurement of PP1cγ1 Activity—PP1cγ1 activity was measured using the fluorescence-based RediPlate 96 EnzChek serine/threonine phosphatase assay kit from Molecular Probes. VSMC were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 132 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates containing 500 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated with anti-PP1cγ1 antibody overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with Protein A-Sepharose beads for another 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 50 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm MnCl2, 125 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 50 μm substrate, 6,8-difluoro-4-methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. 6,8-Difluoro-4-methyl-umbelliferyl fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm, u"
https://openalex.org/W1980856167,"Arf GAPs are a family of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of GTP bound to Arf. Arf GAP1 is one member of the family that has a critical role in membrane traffic at the Golgi apparatus. Two distinct models for the regulation of Arf GAP1 in membrane traffic have been proposed. In one model, Arf GAP1 functions in a ternary complex with coat proteins and is inhibited by cargo proteins. In another model, Arf GAP1 is recruited to a membrane surface that has defects created by the increased membrane curvature that accompanies transport vesicle formation. Here we have used kinetic and mutational analysis to test predictions of models of regulation of Arf GAP1. We found that Arf GAP1 has a similar affinity for Arf1.GTP as another Arf GAP, ASAP1, but the catalytic rate is approximately 0.5% that of ASAP1. Coatomer stimulated Arf GAP1 activity; however, different from that predicted from the current model, coatomer affected the K(m) and not the k(cat) values. Effects of most mutations in Arf GAP1 paralleled those in ASAP1. Mutation of an arginine that aligned with an arginine presumed to be catalytic in ASAP1 abrogated activity. Peptide from the cytoplasmic tail of cargo proteins inhibited Arf GAP1; however, the unrelated Arf GAP ASAP1 was also inhibited. The curvature of the lipid bilayer had a small effect on activity of Arf GAP1 under the conditions of our experiments. We conclude that coatomer is an allosteric regulator of Arf GAP1. The relevance of the results to the two models of Arf GAP1-mediated regulation of Arf1 is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2128123470,"T cell-specific adapter protein (TSAd), encoded by the SH2D2A gene, interacts with Lck through its C terminus and thus modulates Lck activity. Here we mapped Lck phosphorylation and interaction sites on TSAd and evaluated their functional importance. The three C-terminal TSAd tyrosines Tyr280, Tyr290, and Tyr305 were phosphorylated by Lck and functioned as docking sites for the Lck Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. Binding affinities of the TSAd Tyr(P)280 and Tyr(P)290 phosphopeptides to the isolated Lck SH2 domain were similar to that observed for the Lck Tyr(P)505 phosphopeptide, whereas the TSAd Tyr(P)305 peptide displayed a 10-fold higher affinity. The proline-rich Lck SH3-binding site on TSAd as well as the Lck SH2 domain were required for efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of TSAd by Lck. Interaction sites on TSAd for both Lck SH2 and Lck SH3 were necessary for TSAd-mediated modulation of proximal TCR signaling events. We found that 20–30% of TSAd molecules are phosphorylated in activated T cells and that the proportion of TSAd to Lck molecules in such cells is ∼1:1. Therefore, in activated T cells, a considerable number of Lck molecules may potentially be engaged by TSAd. In conclusion, Lck binds to TSAd prolines and phosphorylates and interacts with the three C-terminal TSAd tyrosines. We propose that through multivalent interactions with Lck, TSAd diverts Lck from phosphorylating other substrates, thus modulating its functional activity through substrate competition.

These events may either be promoted or inhibited by adapter proteins, which lack catalytic activity, but serve as molecular bridges mediating protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions (1Simeoni L. Kliche S. Lindquist J. Schraven B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Adapter proteins contain multiple protein interaction motifs and domains that allow these molecules to interact with several proteins simultaneously. They are therefore often referred to as scaffolding proteins.

The majority of intracellular molecules known to be involved in the early stages of T cell activation are already present in the T cell prior to T cell triggering; TCR stimulation results in Lck (lymphoid cell kinase)-mediated phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of the CD3 chains, which form the TCR-CD3 complex together with the TCR α and β chains. Phosphorylated ITAMs are docking sites for the tandem SH2 domains of the Zap-70 (ζ-associated protein of 70 kDa) kinase (2Chan A.C. Irving B.A. Fraser J.D. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

When overexpressed in Jurkat T cells, TSAd inhibits proximal signal transduction events by modulating Lck activity (17Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Granum S. Mustelin T. Andersen T.C. Berge T. Shapiro M.J.

Alonso A. Merlo J.J. Front Biosci. 2002; 7: d918-d969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Csk-mediated phosphorylation of Lck Tyr505 results in an intramolecular interaction between phosphorylated Tyr505 and its SH2 domain (27Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J.

Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar), whereby Lck is kept in an inactive conformation due to blockade of its substrate binding site. Moreover, the SH3 domain of Lck interacts with the linker between the SH2 and kinase domain, which further blocks the kinase activity (30Weil R. Veillette A. J. Biol.

The intramolecular interactions controlling Lck activity are of low affinity (36Ladbury J.E. Lemmon M.A. Zhou M. Green J. Botfield M.C. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), allowing specific ligands with stronger affinity for the Lck SH2 or SH3 domains to compete out the intramolecular interactions and thus activate Lck (37Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Here we dissected the TSAd-Lck interaction by mutational analysis in transfected cell lines as well as by chemical analysis using isothermal calorimetry (ITC) and in vitro kinase assays. We show that Lck phosphorylates and interacts with all three C-terminal tyrosines of TSAd. There is a hierarchy of affinities for the phosphorylated TSAd peptides to the Lck SH2 domain, where the lowest affinity observed was in the same range as the Lck-Tyr505 peptide, and the highest was 10-fold higher. The tyrosine phosphorylation level of TSAd in vivo is dependent on the Lck SH3 interaction site in TSAd (aa 239–256) as well as a functional Lck SH2 domain. Moreover, the TSAd-mediated modulation of Lck activity is dependent on both the Lck SH2 and SH3 ligands on TSAd. Our data suggest that multisite docking of Lck to TSAd leads to efficient phosphorylation of TSAd and concomitant modulation of Lck activity toward other substrates. Plasmids—The full-length TSAd and the TSAd Δ239–334 cDNAs were cloned into the pEF-HA expression vector, as previously reported (14Sundvold V. Torgersen K.M. Post N.H. Marti F. King P.D.

TSAd sequence aa 236–312 was sub-cloned by PCR into the pGEX-6P1 vector (GE Healthcare), and various mutations in the sequence were introduced with QuikChange™ PCR (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Antibodies and Reagents—The following monoclonal antibodies were used: anti-Zap-70 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-HA (Babco, Richmond, CA), anti-human CD3ϵ (OKT3; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), anti-TCR (C305; a generous gift from Art Weiss) anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-Lck (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Lck (clone IF6, a generous gift from Dr. Joseph B.

As secondary antibodies, we used horse peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Recombinant active His-tagged Lck was from Upstate Biotechnology. The kinase inhibitor PP2 were purchased from Sigma. Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—GST fusion proteins of TSAd-aa 236–312 as well as the Lck SH2 domain and the Lck SH3 domain were produced in BL21 Codon plus bacteria (Stratagene), and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For calorimetric analysis of peptide binding to the Lck SH2 domain, isolated Lck SH2 domain was also excised from the glutathione-Sepharose beads using thrombin. Cell Cultures and Transfections—293T cells and Jurkat E6.1 (American Type Culture Collection) or TAg cells (38Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640, 5–10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm nonessential amino acids (all from GIBCOBRL®, Invitrogen, The Netherlands), and antibiotics. Transfections of 5–20 × 106 Jurkat T cells in RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal calf serum with 5–30 μg of plasmid DNA were performed using a BTX electroporator (Genetronix, San Diego, CA) at 200 V and 70 ms or the Amaxa nucleofector with the cell line Nucleofector™ kit (catalog number VCA-1003), using either program S18 or I-10. Transient transfectants were cultured for 16–48 h. 293T cells (2 × 106) were washed with Opti-MEM I medium (GIBCOBRL®) before transfection with a mixture of 0.5–3 μg of DNA and 25 μl of Lipofectin in Opti-MEM I medium. Transfections were terminated after 5–8 h by the addition of 1:1 ml of RPMI 1640 with 20% fetal calf serum. The cells were further propagated for 16–24 h. Human peripheral blood CD4+ T cells were positively or negatively selected from healthy blood donors as previously described (15Kolltveit K.M. Granum S. Aasheim H.C. Forsbring M. Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Dai K.Z. Molberg O. Schjetne K.W. Bogen B. Shapiro V.S. Johansen F.E. Schenck K. Spurkland A. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 2380-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and cultured in either RPMI 1640 or hTC culture medium (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) with 5–10% fetal calf serum. Cell Stimulation, Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot—TSAd protein expression was induced in Jurkat T cells and in peripheral CD4+ T cells by stimulation for various times with OKT3 (5 μg/ml)-coated wells or in peripheral CD4+ T cells by stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads® (1 bead/cell). Jurkat cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended, and stimulated with 5–10 μg/ml anti-CD3 (OKT3) or 1:200 acites anti-TCR (C305) monoclonal antibodies for specific times. Cells were lysed by the addition of an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer (1× lysis buffer: 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.25–1% Igepal, 12.5–50 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucoside, and a 10 μg/ml concentration of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, pepstatin A, chymostatin, and antipain (all from Sigma). 293T cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by the addition of 1× lysis buffer. Lysates were precleared 2–3 times for 45 min with protein A/G-Sepharose™ (Amersham Biosciences) or Dynabeads® protein G (Invitrogen), followed by incubation for 1 h with anti-TSAd or normal rabbit serum followed by a 1-h incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose™ or for 1 h with protein G Dynabeads® precoated with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies as described by the manufacturer. Pull-down experiments with GST-Lck SH2 or GST-Lck SH3 were performed in precleared lysates as described (18Granum S. Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Dai K.Z. Kolltveit K.M. Hilde-brand K. Huitfeldt H.S. Lea T. Spurkland A. BMC. Immunol. 2006; 7: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation or pull-down, beads were washed three times in 1× lysis buffer, and isolated proteins were separated by 7.5–12.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were blotted onto a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) or directly stained in Coomassie Blue solution. Blots were probed with the indicated antibodies in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) with 0.1% Tween (Sigma) plus 3% bovine serum albumin (Biotest, Dreieich, Germany) or 3% skimmed milk (Sigma). Bound antibodies were visualized by incubation with secondary horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies and Super Signal® West Pico stable peroxide solution (Pierce) (18Granum S. Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Dai K.Z. Kolltveit K.M. Hilde-brand K. Huitfeldt H.S. Lea T. Spurkland A. BMC. Immunol. 2006; 7: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the intensities of the bands of interest were quantitated by the use of an Eastman Kodak Co. Image Station 2000R. Phosphotyrosyl Peptides—Peptides corresponding to HMT Tyr(P)324 (PQpYEEI), Lck Tyr(P)505 (GQpYQPQ), TSAd Tyr(P)280 (PIpYNEP), and Tyr(P)290 (AFpYAMG) were synthesized by GenScript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ) to more than 95% purity high pressure liquid chromatography grade. The peptide corresponding to TSAd Tyr(P)305 (NIpYVEV) was made by Pepscan systems (Lelystad, The Netherlands), also more than 95% pure. All of the peptides contained a free N and C terminus. ITC—ITC was performed using the VP-ITC MicroCal instrument (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) (39Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). Recombinant Lck SH2 domain was made as described, and the concentration was determined using the A280 value, with extinction coefficient 9650 m–1 cm–1. The concentration of Lck SH2 domain in the reaction cell typically was 10 mm, and the concentrations of the phosphotyrosine peptides in the ITC syringe were 0.5 mm, all dissolved in a modified MBS buffer (50 mm MOPS, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8) (36Ladbury J.E. Lemmon M.A. Zhou M. Green J. Botfield M.C. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 25 °C. The initiation delay was set to 60 s, and aliquots of 5 μl of peptide solution were injected into the reaction cell at 120-s intervals with a stirring speed of 260 rpm. Typically, 20–25 injections were used to complete the titration. ITC data were collected automatically using the ITC Origin version 7.0 software (MicroCal) accompanying the VP-ITC system. The data were fitted to a single binding site mechanism using the ITC fitting algorithm included with the instrument after correcting for the heat of dilution. All data from the ITC binding reactions fitted well to a single-site binding model, yielding the stoichiometry (n), equilibrium binding association constant (Ka), and enthalpy change (ΔH) of the reaction. The value of n was found to be between 0.9 and 1.1 for all reactions. The changes in reaction free energy (ΔG) and entropy (ΔS) as well as the dissociation constant (Kd) were calculated using the relation ΔG = ΔH – TΔS = –RTlnKa = RTlnKd. Errors in ΔHr and Kd were obtained as S.D. values of three or more experiments. Mass Spectrometry—Recombinant TSAd proteins were subjected to in-solution tryptic digestion as indicated under “Results.” Therefore, 0.5 μg of recombinant proteins were digested by 25 ng of trypsin in 50 mm NH4HCO3 (37 °C, 3 h). The kinase buffer was not removed prior to digestion. Approximately 75 ng of digested recombinant protein were desalted by using C18-stop and go extraction tips (C18-stage tips) and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry in the positive and reflector mode (Ultraflex II; Bruker Daltonics). The observed masses were compared with an artificial tryptic digest of the recombinant TSAd proteins. Tandem mass spectrometry experiments were performed to confirm the peptide sequences and to verify the phosphorylation sites. To further confirm the identity of the detected phosphopeptides, an aliquot of the tryptic digest (150 ng of recombinant TSAd protein) was treated with alkaline phosphatase (2 units) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 (37 °C, 30 min). Half of the sample was desalted and analyzed as described. Since alkaline phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation results in a mass shift of –80 Da per phosphorylation site, this treatment proves the presence and number of phosphogroups in the given peptides. Kinase Assay—In vitro kinase assays were performed using various GST-TSAd constructs diluted in kinase buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 75 mm MgCl2, 15 mm dithiothreitol, and 1–2 μm ATP before recombinant Lck was mixed into the samples. The samples were then immediately put on a heating block prewarmed to 30 °C, aliquots were withdrawn at specific time points, and the kinase assays were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer and incubation at 100 °C for 5 min. Purified, recombinant GST-TSAd constructs were used at an estimated final concentration in the range of 0.175–20 μm, whereas concentrations between 7.5 and 200 nm full-length, active Lck have been used per kinase assay reaction. TSAd Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated by Lck on Several Tyrosines—TSAd has 10 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table 1). We previously reported that TSAd is tyrosine-phosphorylated in stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (12Spurkland A. Brinchmann J.E. Markussen G. Pedeutour F. Munthe E. Lea T. Vartdal F. Aasheim H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4539-4546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and Jurkat T cells (17Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Granum S. Mustelin T. Andersen T.C. Berge T. Shapiro M.J. Shapiro V.S. Spurkland A. Lea T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Co-expression with Lck is required for phosphorylation of TSAd upon tyrosine in 293T cells (17Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Granum S. Mustelin T. Andersen T.C. Berge T. Shapiro M.J. Shapiro V.S. Spurkland A. Lea T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Granum S. Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Dai K.Z. Kolltveit K.M. Hilde-brand K. Huitfeldt H.S. Lea T. Spurkland A. BMC. Immunol. 2006; 7: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4. The C terminus of TSAd aa 239–334 harbors docking sites for both the Lck SH2 and SH3 domains, and this part of TSAd is also required for Lck-dependent phosphorylation of TSAd (18Granum S. Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Dai K.Z. Kolltveit K.M. Hilde-brand K. Huitfeldt H.S. Lea T. Spurkland A. BMC. Immunol. 2006; 7: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6. To determine which of the TSAd tyrosines could be phosphorylated, we made single Tyr to Phe TSAd mutants for all 10 tyrosines and expressed them in 293T cells together with Lck. Immunoprecipitates (IPs) of TSAd from these cells were examined for phosphorylation by immunoblotting using anti-Tyr(P) antibody. Two distinct bands corresponding to phosphorylated TSAd were detected when TSAd IPs were resolved by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1C, all 10 TSAd tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants were tyrosine-phosphorylated in the presence of Lck, showing that more than one tyrosine was phosphorylated. A slower migrating band appeared only in the presence of Tyr290 (Fig. 1C, lane 11). All single Tyr to Phe mutants interacted with Lck SH2 in a GST pull-down assay using the same lysates as in Fig. 1C (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that Lck is able to phosphorylate and interact via its SH2 domain with more than one of the TSAd tyrosines. Lck Phosphorylates and Interacts with the Highly Conserved Tyr280, Tyr290, and Tyr305 of TSAd—Murine TSAd displays 68% sequence identity to human TSAd, with the SH2 domain showing the highest degree of homology (19Rajagopal K. Sommers C.L. Decker D.C. Mitchell E.O. Korthauer U. Sperling A.I. Kozak C.A. Love P.E. Bluestone J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, also in the C terminus, there are highly conserved elements. The region encompassing aa 236–312 has a proline-rich motif, as well as the three C-terminal tyrosines of TSAd, all of which have essentially the same flanking sequences in humans, chimpanzees, cows, mice, and rats (Fig. 2A). The only other tyrosine in the TSAd sequence that has equally well conserved flanking sequence is Tyr117, which is part of the conserved phosphotyrosine binding pocket of the SH2 domain (supplemental Table 1). This degree of conservation of the aa 236–312 in TSAd strongly indicates that this region has functional importance. Accordingly, we and others previously showed that TSAd mutated for its four or three C-terminal tyrosines is not phosphorylated by Lck (18Granum S. Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Dai K.Z. Kolltveit K.M. Hilde-brand K. Huitfeldt H.S. Lea T. Spurkland A. BMC. Immunol. 2006; 7: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Marti F. Garcia G.G. Lapinski P.E. MacGregor J.N. King P.D. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since single mutations of any of the three C-terminal tyrosines were not sufficient to abolish Lck-mediated TSAd phosphorylation or Lck SH2 domain binding to TSAd, we made double or triple Tyr to Phe mutants of the four C-termina"
