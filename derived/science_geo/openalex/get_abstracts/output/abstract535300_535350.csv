https://openalex.org/W1107917109,"Molecular profiles of tumors and tumor-associated cells hold great promise as biomarkers of clinical outcomes. However, existing data sets are fragmented and difficult to analyze systematically. Here we present a pan-cancer resource and meta-analysis of expression signatures from ∼18,000 human tumors with overall survival outcomes across 39 malignancies. By using this resource, we identified a forkhead box MI (FOXM1) regulatory network as a major predictor of adverse outcomes, and we found that expression of favorably prognostic genes, including KLRB1 (encoding CD161), largely reflect tumor-associated leukocytes. By applying CIBERSORT, a computational approach for inferring leukocyte representation in bulk tumor transcriptomes, we identified complex associations between 22 distinct leukocyte subsets and cancer survival. For example, tumor-associated neutrophil and plasma cell signatures emerged as significant but opposite predictors of survival for diverse solid tumors, including breast and lung adenocarcinomas. This resource and associated analytical tools (http://precog.stanford.edu) may help delineate prognostic genes and leukocyte subsets within and across cancers, shed light on the impact of tumor heterogeneity on cancer outcomes, and facilitate the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W1020989877,"Clinical testing of BCR inhibition on DLBCL reveals determinants of response. The two major subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)—activated B cell–like (ABC) and germinal center B cell–like (GCB)—arise by distinct mechanisms, with ABC selectively acquiring mutations that target the B cell receptor (BCR), fostering chronic active BCR signaling1. The ABC subtype has a ∼40% cure rate with currently available therapies, which is worse than the rate for GCB DLBCL, and highlights the need for ABC subtype-specific treatment strategies2. We hypothesized that ABC, but not GCB, DLBCL tumors would respond to ibrutinib, an inhibitor of BCR signaling. In a phase 1/2 clinical trial that involved 80 subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, ibrutinib produced complete or partial responses in 37% (14/38) of those with ABC DLBCL, but in only 5% (1/20) of subjects with GCB DLBCL (P = 0.0106). ABC tumors with BCR mutations responded to ibrutinib frequently (5/9; 55.5%), especially those with concomitant myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) mutations (4/5; 80%), a result that is consistent with in vitro cooperation between the BCR and MYD88 pathways. However, the highest number of responses occurred in ABC tumors that lacked BCR mutations (9/29; 31%), suggesting that oncogenic BCR signaling in ABC does not require BCR mutations and might be initiated by non-genetic mechanisms. These results support the selective development of ibrutinib for the treatment of ABC DLBCL."
https://openalex.org/W1877911682,"Despite recent therapeutic advances, multiple myeloma (MM) remains largely incurable. Here we report results of a phase I/II trial to evaluate the safety and activity of autologous T cells engineered to express an affinity-enhanced T cell receptor (TCR) recognizing a naturally processed peptide shared by the cancer-testis antigens NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1. Twenty patients with antigen-positive MM received an average 2.4 × 10(9) engineered T cells 2 d after autologous stem cell transplant. Infusions were well tolerated without clinically apparent cytokine-release syndrome, despite high IL-6 levels. Engineered T cells expanded, persisted, trafficked to marrow and exhibited a cytotoxic phenotype. Persistence of engineered T cells in blood was inversely associated with NY-ESO-1 levels in the marrow. Disease progression was associated with loss of T cell persistence or antigen escape, in accordance with the expected mechanism of action of the transferred T cells. Encouraging clinical responses were observed in 16 of 20 patients (80%) with advanced disease, with a median progression-free survival of 19.1 months. NY-ESO-1-LAGE-1 TCR-engineered T cells were safe, trafficked to marrow and showed extended persistence that correlated with clinical activity against antigen-positive myeloma."
https://openalex.org/W1042705540,"The Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) is currently the only self-report instrument to measure self-compassion. The SCS is widely used despite the limited evidence for the scale’s psychometric properties, with validation studies commonly performed in college students. The current study examined the factor structure, reliability, and construct validity of the SCS in a large representative sample from the community. The study was conducted in 1,736 persons, of whom 1,643 were included in the analyses. Besides the SCS, data was collected on positive and negative indicators of psychological functioning, as well as on rumination and neuroticism. Analyses included confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), exploratory factor analyses (EFA), and correlations. CFA showed that the SCS’s proposed six-factor structure could not be replicated. EFA suggested a two-factor solution, formed by the positively and negatively formulated items respectively. Internal consistency was good for the two identified factors. The negative factor (i.e., sum score of the negatively formulated items) correlated moderately to strongly to negative affect, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, as well as to rumination and neuroticism. Compared to this negative factor, the positive factor (i.e., sum score of the positively formulated items) correlated weaker to these indicators, and relatively more strongly to positive affect. Results from this study do not justify the common use of the SCS total score as an overall indicator of self-compassion, and provide support for the idea, as also assumed by others, that it is important to make a distinction between self-compassion and self-criticism."

https://openalex.org/W2106589088,"Lakes are a natural source of methane to the atmosphere and contribute significantly to total emissions compared to the oceans. Controls on methane emissions from lake surfaces, particularly biotic processes within anoxic hypolimnia, are only partially understood. Here we investigated biological methane oxidation in the water column of the seasonally stratified Lake Rotsee. A zone of methane oxidation extending from the oxic/anoxic interface into anoxic waters was identified by chemical profiling of oxygen, methane and δ13C of methane. Incubation experiments with 13C-methane yielded highest oxidation rates within the oxycline, and comparable rates were measured in anoxic waters. Despite predominantly anoxic conditions within the zone of methane oxidation, known groups of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea were conspicuously absent. Instead, aerobic gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs were identified as the active methane oxidizers. In addition, continuous oxidation and maximum rates always occurred under light conditions. These findings, along with the detection of chlorophyll a, suggest that aerobic methane oxidation is tightly coupled to light-dependent photosynthetic oxygen production both at the oxycline and in the anoxic bottom layer. It is likely that this interaction between oxygenic phototrophs and aerobic methanotrophs represents a widespread mechanism by which methane is oxidized in lake water, thus diminishing its release into the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W1602088950,"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short, nontoxic peptides with cationic and/or amphipathic properties able to cross the cellular membrane. CPPs are used for the delivery of a wide variety of cargoes, such as proteins, oligonucleotides, and therapeutic molecules. The aim of the present study was to synthesize unusually small novel CPPs targeting mitochondria based on the Szeto-Schiller peptide (SS-31) to influence intramitochondrial processes and to improve the biologic effects. All the peptides used were synthesized manually using 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chemistry. In the first part of the study, HeLa 705, U87, and bEnd.3 cells were used as in vitro delivery model. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 with different concentrations of our peptides. Cell proliferation assay was performed to evaluate cell viability. Biologic effects such as mitochondrial membrane potential and antioxidant activity were evaluated. H2O2 was used as positive control. Uptake studies were performed using peptides conjugated with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (FAM). Fluorescent microscopy was used to determine presence and localization of peptides into the cells. Isolated mitochondria from pretreated cells and mitochondria treated after isolation were used to confirm the targeting ability of the peptide. Uptake of FAM alone was used as negative control. Microscopy studies confirmed the ability of peptides to penetrate cell. Localization analysis showed increase in uptake by 35% compared with SS-31. Mitochondrial CPP 1 (mtCPP-1) had no effect on mitochondrial membrane potential and prevented reactive oxygen species formation in bEnd.3 cells by 2-fold compared with SS-31. No cytotoxicity was observed even at high concentration (100 µM). These data suggest that mtCPP-1 is a mitochondrial CPP and protect mitochondria from oxidative damage due to its own antioxidant activities."
https://openalex.org/W1588280167,"Vinculin is filamentous (F)-actin-binding protein enriched in integrin-based adhesions to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Whereas studies in 2-dimensional (2D) tissue culture models have suggested that vinculin negatively regulates cell migration by promoting cytoskeleton-ECM coupling to strengthen and stabilize adhesions, its role in regulating cell migration in more physiologic, 3-dimensional (3D) environments is unclear. To address the role of vinculin in 3D cell migration, we analyzed the morphodynamics, migration, and ECM remodeling of primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with cre/loxP-mediated vinculin gene disruption in 3D collagen I cultures. We found that vinculin promoted 3D cell migration by increasing directional persistence. Vinculin was necessary for persistent cell protrusion, cell elongation, and stable cell orientation in 3D collagen, but was dispensable for lamellipodia formation, suggesting that vinculin-mediated cell adhesion to the ECM is needed to convert actin-based cell protrusion into persistent cell shape change and migration. Consistent with this finding, vinculin was necessary for efficient traction force generation in 3D collagen without affecting myosin II activity and promoted 3D collagen fiber alignment and macroscopical gel contraction. Our results suggest that vinculin promotes directionally persistent cell migration and tension-dependent ECM remodeling in complex 3D environments by increasing cell-ECM adhesion and traction force generation."
https://openalex.org/W1549435121,"Modified nucleotide 5-methylcytosine (m5C) is frequently present in various eukaryotic RNAs, including tRNAs, rRNAs and in other non-coding RNAs, as well as in mRNAs. RNA:m5C-methyltranferases (MTases) Nop2 from S. cerevisiae and human proliferation-associated nucleolar antigen p120 are both members of a protein family called Nop2/NSUN/NOL1. Protein p120 is well-known as a tumor marker which is over-expressed in various cancer tissues. Using a combination of RNA bisulfite sequencing and HPLC-MS/MS analysis, we demonstrated here that p120 displays an RNA:m5C- MTase activity, which restores m5C formation at position 2870 in domain V of 25S rRNA in a nop2Δ yeast strain. We also confirm that yeast proteins Nop2p and Rcm1p catalyze the formation of m5C in domains V and IV, respectively. In addition, we do not find any evidence of m5C residues in yeast 18S rRNA. We also performed functional complementation of Nop2-deficient yeasts by human p120 and studied the importance of different sequence and structural domains of Nop2 and p120 for yeast growth and m5C-MTase activity. Chimeric protein formed by Nop2 and p120 fragments revealed the importance of Nop2 N-terminal domain for correct protein localization and its cellular function. We also validated that the presence of Nop2, rather than the m5C modification in rRNA itself, is required for pre-rRNA processing. Our results corroborate that Nop2 belongs to the large family of pre-ribosomal proteins and possesses two related functions in pre-rRNA processing: as an essential factor for cleavages and m5C:RNA:modification. These results support the notion of quality control during ribosome synthesis by such modification enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1901206160,"Stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) is a disulfide-bound homodimeric glycoprotein, first identified as a hypocalcemic hormone important for maintaining calcium homeostasis in teleost fish. STC1 was later found to be widely expressed in mammals, although it is not believed to function in systemic calcium regulation in these species. Several physiological functions of STC1 have been reported, although many molecular details are still lacking. We here demonstrate that STC1 is an inhibitor of the metzincin metalloproteinase, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), which modulates insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling through proteolytic cleavage of IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). STC1 potently (Ki = 68 pm) inhibits PAPP-A cleavage of IGFBP-4, and we show in a cell-based assay that STC1 effectively antagonizes PAPP-A-mediated type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R) phosphorylation. It has recently been found that the homologous STC2 inhibits PAPP-A proteolytic activity, and that this depends on the formation of a covalent complex between the inhibitor and the proteinase, mediated by Cys-120 of STC2. We find that STC1 is unable to bind covalently to PAPP-A, in agreement with the absence of a corresponding cysteine residue. It rather binds to PAPP-A with high affinity (KD = 75 pm). We further demonstrate that both STC1 and STC2 show inhibitory activity toward PAPP-A2, but not selected serine proteinases and metalloproteinases. We therefore conclude that the STCs are proteinase inhibitors, probably restricted in specificity to the pappalysin family of metzincin metalloproteinases. Our data are the first to identify STC1 as a proteinase inhibitor, suggesting a previously unrecognized function of STC1 in the IGF system.

https://openalex.org/W1038810220,"In the context of the publication of DSM-5, the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) has been proposed as a new dimensional assessment tool for personality disorders. This instrument includes a pool of 220 items organized around 25 facets included in a five-factor second-order domain structure. The examination of the replicability of the trait structure across methods and populations is of primary importance. In view of this need, the main objective of the current study was to validate the French version of the PID-5 among French-speaking adults from a European community sample (N=2,532). In particular, the assumption of unidimensionality of the 25 facet and the five domain scales was tested, as well as the extent to which the five-factor structure of the PID-5 and the DSM-5 personality trait hierarchical structure are replicated in the current sample. The results support the assumption of unidimensionality of both the facets and the domains. Exploratory factor and hierarchical analyses replicated the five-factor structure as initially proposed in the PID-5."
https://openalex.org/W994412958,"Background Neonatal hypothermia remains a common problem and is related to elevated morbidities and mortality. However, the long-term neurodevelopmental effects of admission hypothermia are still unknown. This study attempted to determine the short-term and long-term consequences of admission hypothermia in VLBW preterm infants. Study Design This retrospective study measured the incidence and compared the outcomes of admission hypothermia in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants in a tertiary-level neonatal intensive care unit. Infants were divided into the following groups: normothermia (36.5–37.5°C), mild hypothermia (36.0–36.4°C), moderate hypothermia (32.0–35.9°C), and severe hypothermia (< 32°C). We compared the distribution, demographic variables, short-term outcomes, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 24 months of corrected age among groups. Results We studied 341 infants: 79 with normothermia, 100 with mild hypothermia, 162 with moderate hypothermia, and 0 with severe hypothermia. Patients in the moderate hypothermia group had significantly lower gestational ages (28.1 wk vs. 29.7 wk, P < .02) and smaller birth weight (1004 g vs. 1187 g, P < .001) compared to patients in the normothermia group. Compared to normothermic infants, moderately hypothermic infants had significantly higher incidences of 1-min Apgar score < 7 (63.6% vs. 31.6%, P < .001), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (58.0% vs. 39.2%, P = .006), and mortality (18.5% vs. 5.1%, P = .005). Moderate hypothermia did not affect neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years’ corrected age. Mild hypothermia had no effect on short-term or long-term outcomes. Conclusions Admission hypothermia was common in VLBW infants and correlated inversely with birth weight and gestational age. Although moderate hypothermia was associated with higher RDS and mortality rates, it may play a limited role among multifactorial causes of neurodevelopmental impairment."
https://openalex.org/W1013057675,"Based on the prodrug principle, aspirin eugenol ester (AEE) was synthesized, which can reduce the side effects of aspirin and eugenol. As a good candidate for new antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory medicine, it is essential to evaluate its preventive effect on thrombosis. Preventive effect of AEE was investigated in κ-carrageenan-induced rat tail thrombosis model. AEE suspension liquids were prepared in 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na). AEE was administrated at the dosage of 18, 36 and 72 mg/kg. Aspirin (20 mg/kg), eugenol (18 mg/kg) and 0.5% CMC-Na (30 mg/kg) were used as control drug. In order to compare the effects between AEE and its precursor, integration of aspirin and eugenol group (molar ratio 1:1) was also designed in the experiment. After drugs were administrated intragastrically for seven days, each rat was injected intraperitoneally with 20 mg/kg BW κ-carrageen dissolved in physiological saline to induce thrombosis. The length of tail-thrombosis was measured at 24 and 48 hours. The blank group just was given physiological saline for seven days without κ-carrageenan administrated. The results indicated that AEE significantly not only reduced the average length of thrombus, PT values and FIB concentration, but also reduced the red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT) and platelet (PLT). The effects of AEE on platelet aggregation and anticoagulant in vitro showed that AEE could inhibit adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation as dose-dependence but no notable effect on blood clotting. From these results, it was concluded that AEE possessed positive effect on thrombosis prevention in vivo through the reduction of FIB, PLT, inhibition of platelet aggregation and the change of TT and PT values."
https://openalex.org/W1670293733,"Biphasic calcium phosphates (BCPs), consisting of hydroxyapatite (HA) and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), exhibit good biocompatibility and osteoconductivity, maintaining a balance between resorption of the biomaterial and formation of new bone. We tested whether the chemical composition and/or the microstructure of BCPs affect osteoclasts (OCs) differentiation and/or their ability to crosstalk with osteoblasts (OBs). To this aim, OCs were cultured on BCPs with HA content of 5, 20 or 60% and their differentiation and activity were assessed. We found that OC differentiation is partially impaired by increased HA content, but not by the presence of micropores within BCP scaffolds, as indicated by TRAP staining and gene profile expression. We then investigated whether the biomaterial-induced changes in OC differentiation also affect their ability to crosstalk with OBs and regulate OB function. We found that BCPs with low percentage of HA favored the expression of positive coupling factors, including sphingosine-kinase 1 (SPHK1) and collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (Cthrc1). In turn, the increase of these secreted coupling factors promotes OB differentiation and function. All together our studies suggest that the chemical composition of biomaterials affects not only the differentiation and activity of OCs but also their potential to locally regulate bone formation."

Essential oils of different biological parts studied demonstrated a differential antiproliferative activity against P815 and BSR cancer cells; P815 cells are the most sensitive to the cytotoxic effect. Leaves and capitulum essential oils are more active than aerial parts. Interestingly, no cytotoxic effect of these essential oils was observed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Our results showed that the chemical composition variability of essential oils depends on the nature of botanical parts of Artemisia herba alba. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the differential cytotoxic effect depends not only on the essential oils concentration, but also on the target cells and the botanical parts of essential oils used."

https://openalex.org/W1912205883,"According to R.A. Fisher, randomization “relieves the experimenter from the anxiety of considering innumerable causes by which the data may be disturbed.” Since, in particular, it is said to control for known and unknown nuisance factors that may considerably challenge the validity of a result, it has become very popular. This contribution challenges the received view. First, looking for quantitative support, we study a number of straightforward, mathematically simple models. They all demonstrate that the optimism surrounding randomization is questionable: In small to medium-sized samples, random allocation of units to treatments typically yields a considerable imbalance between the groups, i.e., confounding due to randomization is the rule rather than the exception. In the second part of this contribution, the reasoning is extended to a number of traditional arguments in favour of randomization. This discussion is rather non-technical, and sometimes touches on the rather fundamental Frequentist/Bayesian debate. However, the result of this analysis turns out to be quite similar: While the contribution of randomization remains doubtful, comparability contributes much to a compelling conclusion. Summing up, classical experimentation based on sound background theory and the systematic construction of exchangeable groups seems to be advisable."
https://openalex.org/W1023952082,"Background and Purpose In the treatment of patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke, increasing evidence suggests the importance of measuring the volume of the irreversibly injured “ischemic core.” The gold standard method for doing this in the clinical setting is diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), but many authors suggest that maps of regional cerebral blood volume (CBV) derived from computed tomography perfusion imaging (CTP) can substitute for DWI. We sought to determine whether DWI and CTP-derived CBV maps are equivalent in measuring core volume. Methods 58 patients with suspected stroke underwent CTP and DWI within 6 hours of symptom onset. We measured low-CBV lesion volumes using three methods: “objective absolute,” i.e. the volume of tissue with CBV below each of six published absolute thresholds (0.9–2.5 mL/100 g), “objective relative,” whose six thresholds (51%-60%) were fractions of mean contralateral CBV, and “subjective,” in which two radiologists (R1, R2) outlined lesions subjectively. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of each method, threshold, and radiologist in detecting infarction, and the degree to which each over- or underestimated the DWI core volume. Additionally, in the subset of 32 patients for whom follow-up CT or MRI was available, we measured the proportion of CBV- or DWI-defined core lesions that exceeded the follow-up infarct volume, and the maximum amount by which this occurred. Results DWI was positive in 72% (42/58) of patients. CBV maps’ sensitivity/specificity in identifying DWI-positive patients were 100%/0% for both objective methods with all thresholds, 43%/94% for R1, and 83%/44% for R2. Mean core overestimation was 156–699 mL for objective absolute thresholds, and 127–200 mL for objective relative thresholds. For R1 and R2, respectively, mean±SD subjective overestimation were -11±26 mL and -11±23 mL, but subjective volumes differed from DWI volumes by up to 117 and 124 mL in individual patients. Inter-rater agreement regarding the presence of infarction on CBV maps was poor (kappa = 0.21). Core lesions defined by the six objective absolute CBV thresholds exceeded follow-up infarct volumes for 81%-100% of patients, by up to 430–1002 mL. Core estimates produced by objective relative thresholds exceeded follow-up volumes in 91% of patients, by up to 210-280 mL. Subjective lesions defined by R1 and R2 exceeded follow-up volumes in 18% and 26% of cases, by up to 71 and 15 mL, respectively. Only 1 of 23 DWI lesions (4%) exceeded final infarct volume, by 3 mL. Conclusion CTP-derived CBV maps cannot reliably substitute for DWI in measuring core volume, or even establish which patients have DWI lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1037115471,"Schizophrenia is a common psychiatric disorder with high heritability and complex genetic architecture. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several significant loci associated with schizophrenia. However, the explained heritability is still low. Growing evidence has shown schizophrenia is attributable to multiple genes with moderate effects. In-depth mining and integration of GWAS data is urgently expected to uncover disease-related gene combination patterns. Network-based analysis is a promising strategy to better interpret GWAS to identify disease-related network modules. We performed a network-based analysis on three independent schizophrenia GWASs by using a refined analysis framework, which included a more accurate gene P-value calculation, dynamic network module searching algorithm and detailed functional analysis for the obtained modules genes. The result generated 79 modules including 238 genes, which form a highly connected subnetwork with more statistical significance than expected by chance. The result validated several reported disease genes, such as MAD1L1, MCC, SDCCAG8, VAT1L, MAPK14, MYH9 and FXYD6, and also obtained several novel candidate genes and gene-gene interactions. Pathway enrichment analysis of the module genes suggested they were enriched in several neural and immune system related pathways/GO terms, such as neurotrophin signaling pathway, synaptosome, regulation of protein ubiquitination, and antigen processing and presentation. Further crosstalk analysis revealed these pathways/GO terms were cooperated with each other, and identified several important genes, which might play vital roles to connect these functions. Our network-based analysis of schizophrenia GWASs will facilitate the understanding of genetic mechanisms of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2163310458,"The cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2) has previously been implicated as a regulator of tumor growth, bone remodeling, and bone pain. However, very little is known about the role of the skeletal CB2 receptor in the regulation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts changes associated with breast cancer. Here we found that the CB2-selective agonists HU308 and JWH133 reduced the viability of a variety of parental and bone-tropic human and mouse breast cancer cells at high micromolar concentrations. Under conditions in which these ligands are used at the nanomolar range, HU308 and JWH133 enhanced human and mouse breast cancer cell-induced osteoclastogenesis and exacerbated osteolysis, and these effects were attenuated in cultures obtained from CB2-deficient mice or in the presence of a CB2 receptor blocker. HU308 and JWH133 had no effects on osteoblast growth or differentiation in the presence of conditioned medium from breast cancer cells, but under these circumstances both agents enhanced parathyroid hormone-induced osteoblast differentiation and the ability to support osteoclast formation. Mechanistic studies in osteoclast precursors and osteoblasts showed that JWH133 and HU308 induced PI3K/AKT activity in a CB2-dependent manner, and these effects were enhanced in the presence of osteolytic and osteoblastic factors such as RANKL (receptor activator of NFκB ligand) and parathyroid hormone. When combined with published work, these findings suggest that breast cancer and bone cells exhibit differential responses to treatment with CB2 ligands depending upon cell type and concentration used. We, therefore, conclude that both CB2-selective activation and antagonism have potential efficacy in cancer-associated bone disease, but further studies are warranted and ongoing."

However, how polyQ expansion of Atx7 affects DUBm function remains elusive. We investigated the effects of polyQ-expanded Atx7 on ubiquitin-specific protease (USP22), an interacting partner of Atx7 functioning in deubiquitination of histone H2B. The results showed that the inclusions or aggregates formed by polyQ-expanded Atx7 specifically sequester USP22 through their interactions mediated by the N-terminal zinc finger domain of Atx7. The mutation of the zinc finger domain in Atx7 that disrupts its interaction with USP22 dramatically abolishes sequestration of USP22. Moreover, polyQ expansion of Atx7 decreases the deubiquitinating activity of USP22 and, consequently, increases the level of monoubiquitinated H2B. Therefore, we propose that polyQ-expanded Atx7 forms insoluble aggregates that sequester USP22 into a catalytically inactive state, and then the impaired DUBm loses the function to deubiquitinate monoubiquitinated histone H2B or H2A. This may result in dysfunction of the SAGA complex and transcriptional dysregulation in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 disease.

https://openalex.org/W2140045333,"Objective To test the ability of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition (ASQ3) to help identify or exclude neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in very preterm-born children at the corrected age of two. Methods We studied the test results of 224 children, born at <32 postmenstrual weeks, who had scores on ASQ3 and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSIDIII) and neurological examination at 22–26 months’ corrected age. We defined NDI as a score of <70 on the cognitive—or motor composite scale of BSIDIII, or impairment on neurological examination or audiovisual screening. We compared NDI with abnormal ASQ3 scores, i.e., < -2SDs on any domain, and with ASQ3 total scores. To correct for possible overestimation of BSIDIII, we also analyzed the adjusted BSIDIII thresholds for NDI, i.e., scores <80 and <85. Results We found 61 (27%) children with abnormal ASQ3 scores, and 10 (4.5%) children who had NDI with original BSIDIII thresholds (<70). Twelve children had NDI at BSIDIII thresholds at <80, and 15 had <85. None of the 163 (73%) children who passed ASQ3 had NDI. The sensitivity of ASQ3 to detect NDI was excellent (100%), its specificity was acceptable (76%), and its negative predictive value (NPV) was 100%. Sensitivity and NPV remained high with the adjusted BSIDIII thresholds. Conclusion The Ages and Stages Questionnaire is a simple, valid and cost-effective screening tool to help identify and exclude NDI in very preterm-born children at the corrected age of two years."
https://openalex.org/W1612798713,"Salivirus was recently discovered in children with gastroenteritis and in sewage. Though a causative role for salivirus in childhood gastroenteritis was suggested in the previous study, the relationship between salivirus and acute gastroenteritis has not yet been clearly clarified. The sewage strain reported by Ng, although represented by incomplete genome sequencing data, was distinct from previously reported saliviruses, and had not previously been detected in humans. A case-control study examining 461 paired stool samples from children with diarrhea and healthy controls (1:1) was conducted in this study. Also, common diarrheal viruses were detected and complete genome of a salivirus was determined. Results showed that salivirus was detected in 16 (3.5%) and 13 (2.8%) of the case and control samples, respectively; no differences in detection rates (p=0.571) or mean values of viral loads (p=0.400) were observed between the groups. Multivariate Cox regression revealed no association between salivirus and gastroenteritis (p=0.774). The data also demonstrated that salivirus infection did not exacerbate clinical symptoms of gastroenteritis in children. Furthermore, complete genome sequence of a salivirus recovered from the feces of a child with diarrhea (i.e., SaliV-FHB) shared a 99% nucleotide identity with the sewage strain. In conclusion, a paired case-control study did not support a causative role for salivirus strains detected in this study with pediatric gastroenteritis. This study also demonstrated that all known saliviruses can be detected in the feces of children with or without gastroenteritis."

We ruled out the possibility that the observed ATP hydrolysis activity might result from a contaminating ATPase by showing that mutation of key active site residues reduced activity to background levels. Finally, we demonstrate that the fluorescent ATP analog 2′/3′-O-(N′-methylanthraniloyl)-ATP (mantATP) binds stoichiometrically to Nbp35 with a KD = 15.6 μm and that an Nbp35 mutant deficient in ATP hydrolysis activity also displays an increased KD for mantATP.

https://openalex.org/W1630179759,"Background Influenza infection is associated with myocardial infarction (MI), suggesting that respiratory viral infection may induce biologic pathways that contribute to MI. We tested the hypotheses that 1) a validated blood gene expression signature of respiratory viral infection (viral GES) was associated with MI and 2) respiratory viral exposure changes levels of a validated platelet gene expression signature (platelet GES) of platelet function in response to aspirin that is associated with MI. Methods A previously defined viral GES was projected into blood RNA data from 594 patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization and used to classify patients as having evidence of viral infection or not and tested for association with acute MI using logistic regression. A previously defined platelet GES was projected into blood RNA data from 81 healthy subjects before and after exposure to four respiratory viruses: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) (n=20), Human Rhinovirus (HRV) (n=20), Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (H1N1) (n=24), Influenza A Virus subtype H3N2 (H3N2) (n=17). We tested for the change in platelet GES with viral exposure using linear mixed-effects regression and by symptom status. Results In the catheterization cohort, 32 patients had evidence of viral infection based upon the viral GES, of which 25% (8/32) had MI versus 12.2% (69/567) among those without evidence of viral infection (OR 2.3; CI [1.03-5.5], p=0.04). In the infection cohorts, only H1N1 exposure increased platelet GES over time (time course p-value = 1e-04). Conclusions A viral GES of non-specific, respiratory viral infection was associated with acute MI; 18% of the top 49 genes in the viral GES are involved with hemostasis and/or platelet aggregation. Separately, H1N1 exposure, but not exposure to other respiratory viruses, increased a platelet GES previously shown to be associated with MI. Together, these results highlight specific genes and pathways that link viral infection, platelet activation, and MI especially in the case of H1N1 influenza infection."

In this study, the nefrotoxicity of a main component of B. leucurus venom called L-aminoacid oxidase (LAAO-Bl) was evaluated by using tubular epithelial cell lines MDCK and HK-2 and perfused kidney from rats. LAAO-Bl exhibited cytotoxicity, inducing apoptosis and necrosis in MDCK and HK-2 cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner. MDCK apoptosis induction was accompanied by Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial dysfunction with enhanced expression of Bax protein levels. LAAO-Bl induced caspase-3 and caspase-7 activation in both cell lines. LAAO-Bl (10 μg/mL) exerts significant effects on the isolated kidney perfusion increasing perfusion pressure and urinary flow and decreasing the glomerular filtration rate and sodium, potassium and chloride tubular transport. Taken together our results suggest that LAAO-Bl is responsible for the nephrotoxicity observed in the envenomation by snakebites. Moreover, the cytotoxic of LAAO-Bl to renal epithelial cells might be responsible, at least in part, for the nephrotoxicity observed in isolated kidney."

Naturally occurring mutations can lead to hyper- or hypocholesterolemia in human. Recently, we reported that PCSK9 was also able to modulate CD81 in Huh7 cells. In the present study, several gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutants as well as engineered mutants of PCSK9 were compared for their ability to modulate the cell surface expression of LDLR and CD81. Although PCSK9 gain-of-function D374Y enhanced the degradation both receptors, D374H and D129N seemed to only reduce LDLR levels. In contrast, mutations in the C-terminal hinge-cysteine-histidine-rich domain segment primarily affected the PCSK9-induced CD81 degradation. Furthermore, when C-terminally fused to an ACE2 transmembrane anchor, the secretory N-terminal catalytic or hinge-cysteine-histidine-rich domain domains of PCSK9 were able to reduce CD81 and LDLR levels. These data confirm that PCSK9 reduces CD81 levels via an intracellular pathway as reported for LDLR. Using immunocytochemistry, a proximity ligation assay, and co-immunoprecipitation, we found that the cell surface level of PCSK9 was enhanced upon overexpression of CD81 and that both PCSK9 and LDLR interact with this tetraspanin protein.

https://openalex.org/W1036385921,"To develop an index of the quality of nutritional care of premature infants based on the change in weight Z score from birth to discharge and to illustrate the use of this index in comparing the performance of different NICUs.Retrospective data analysis was performed to compare the growth of premature infants born in three perinatal centers. Infants with gestational age ≤ 32 weeks who survived to discharge from 2006 to 2010 were included. Weight Z scores at birth and discharge were calculated by the method of Fenton. Using data from one NICU as the reference, a multivariable linear regression model of change in weight Z score from birth to discharge was developed. Employing this model, a benchmark value of change in weight Z score was calculated for each baby. The difference between this calculated benchmark value and the baby's observed change in weight Z score was defined as the performance gap for that infant. The average value of the performance gaps in a NICU serves as its quality care index.1,714 infants were included for analysis. Change in weight Z score is influenced by birth weight Z score and completed weeks of gestation; thus the model for calculating the benchmark change in weight Z score was adjusted for these two variables. We found statistically significant differences in the average performance gaps for the three units.A quality care index was developed based on change in weight Z score from birth to discharge adjusted for two initial risk factors. This objective, easily calculated index may be used as a measurement of the quality of nutritional care to rank the performance of different NICUs."
https://openalex.org/W1037174936,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) has long been thought to block type I interferon signaling. However, IFN-λ, a type III IFN with limited receptor expression in hepatic cells, efficiently inhibits HCV (Hepatitis C virus) replication in vivo with potentially less side effects than IFN-α. Previous studies demonstrated that type I and type III activated Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/STAT) signaling pathway differently, with delayed but prolonged activation by IFN-λ stimulation compared to IFNα/β. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this observation is not well understood. Here, we found that there are distinct differences in SOCS1 expression patterns in Huh-7.5.1 cells following stimulation with IFN-α and IFN-λ. IFN-λ induced a faster but shorter expression of SOCS1. Furthermore, we confirmed that SOCS1 over-expression abrogates anti-HCV effect of both IFN-α and IFN-λ, leading to increased HCV RNA replication in both HCV replicon cells and JFH1 HCV culture system. In line with this, SOCS1 over-expression inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation, attenuated IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) reporter activity, and blocked IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression. Finally, we measured SOCS1 mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with or without IFN-α treatment from 48 chronic hepatitis C patients and we found the baseline SOCS1 expression levels are higher in treatment non-responders than in responders before IFN-α treatment. Taken together, SOCS1 acts as a suppressor for both type I and type III IFNs and is negatively associated with sustained virological response (SVR) to IFN-based therapy in patients with HCV. More importantly, faster but shorter induction of SOCS1 by IFN-λ may contribute to delayed but prolonged activation of IFN signaling and ISG expression kinetics by type III IFN."
https://openalex.org/W1579840564,"Introduction Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are overexpressed in lung cancer and may serve as potential targets for the development of bioactivable probes for molecular imaging. Objective To characterize and monitor the activity of MMPs during the progression of lung adenocarcinoma. Methods K-rasLSL-G12D mice were imaged serially during the development of adenocarcinomas using fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) and a probe specific for MMP-2, -3, -9 and -13. Lung tumors were identified using FMT and MRI co-registration, and the probe concentration in each tumor was assessed at each time-point. The expression of Mmp2, -3, -9, -13 was quantified by qRT-PCR using RNA isolated from microdissected tumor cells. Immunohistochemical staining of overexpressed MMPs in animals was assessed on human lung tumors. Results In mice, 7 adenomas and 5 adenocarcinomas showed an increase in fluorescent signal on successive FMT scans, starting between weeks 4 and 8. qRT-PCR assays revealed significant overexpression of only Mmp-13 in mice lung tumors. In human tumors, a high MMP-13 immunostaining index was found in tumor cells from invasive lesions (24/27), but in none of the non-invasive (0/4) (p=0.001). Conclusion MMP-13 is detected in early pulmonary invasive adenocarcinomas and may be a potential target for molecular imaging of lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1905397439,"Hypertension is the most prevalent cardiovascular disease, and various risk factors are known to be involved in it. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is the most common non-traumatic cause of myelopathy, which displays neurological symptoms and may induce systemic symptoms. To date, it is still unknown whether CSM is associated with hypertension, and if so, whether the decompression operations can attenuate CSM associated hypertension. Here, a total of 309 patients with CSM who received anterior or posterior decompression surgery were enrolled as subjects. Blood pressure measurements were performed before and within one week after the surgery. Among the 309 subjects, 144 (46.6%) of them exhibited hypertension before surgery, a significantly higher ratio than that of the whole population. One week after surgery, blood pressure of 106 (73.6%) patients turned back to normal. Blood pressure of another 37(25.7%) patients decreased with different degrees, although still higher than normal. Moreover, it appears that both approaches were effective in improving blood pressure, while the posterior approach was more effective in decreasing systolic blood pressure. We speculate this type of hypertension might result from hyperactivity of sympathetic nervous system as the heart rate of these patients decreased after surgery as well. Collectively, compression of spinal cord in CSM patients might be associated with hypertension, and decompression surgery largely attenuated this type of hypertension. These findings prove CSM to be a potential associated factor of high blood pressure and may shed light on therapies of hypertension in clinics."

Design A randomized controlled trial with outcome assessment at baseline and after 4 weeks of intervention. Setting Taipei Veterans General Hospital, National Yang-Ming University. Participants Thirty-three subjects with chronic stroke were recruited and randomly assigned to training (n = 16) and control groups (n = 17). Interventions The computer-aided interlimb force coupling training task with visual feedback included different grip force generation methods on both hands. Main Outcome Measures The Barthel Index (BI), the upper extremity motor control Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE), the Motor Assessment Score (MAS), and the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). All assessments were executed by a blinded evaluator, and data management and statistical analysis were also conducted by a blinded researcher. Results The training group demonstrated greater improvement on the FMA-UE (p<.001), WMFT (p<.001), MAS (p = .004) and BI (p = .037) than the control group after 4 weeks of intervention. In addition, a moderate correlation was found between the improvement of scores for hand scales of the FMA and other portions of the FMA UE (r = .528, p = .018) or MAS (r = .596, p = .015) in the training group. Conclusion Computer-aided interlimb force coupling training improves the motor recovery of a paretic hand, and facilitates motor control and enhances functional performance in the paretic upper extremity of people with chronic stroke.

https://openalex.org/W1649488743,"Pleural spread is difficult to treat in malignancies, especially in lung cancer and thymoma. Monotherapy with surgery fails to have a better survival benefit than palliative chemotherapy, the currently accepted treatment. Photodynamic therapy utilizes a photosensitizer to target the tumor site, and the tumor is exposed to light after performing a pleurectomy and tumor resection. However, the benefits of this procedure to lung cancer or thymoma patients are unknown. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with lung cancer or thymoma with pleural seeding who underwent pleural photodynamic therapy and surgery between 2005 and 2013. Eighteen patients enrolled in this study. The mean patient age was 52.9 ± 12.2 years. Lung cancer was the inciting cancer of pleural dissemination in 10 patients (55.6%), and thymoma in 8 (44.4%). There was no procedure-related mortality. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the 3-year survival rate and the 5-year survival rate were 68.9% and 57.4%, respectively. We compared the PDT lung cancer patients with those receiving chemotherapy or target therapy (n = 51) and found that the PDT group had better survival than non-PDT patients (mean survival time: 39.0 versus 17.6 months; P = .047). With proper patient selection, radical surgical resection combined with intrapleural photodynamic therapy for pleural spread in patients with non-small cell lung cancer or thymoma is feasible and may provide a survival benefit."
https://openalex.org/W1600319505,"Regulator of G protein signaling 2 (RGS2) controls G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by acting as a GTPase-activating protein for heterotrimeric G proteins. Certain Rgs2 gene mutations have been linked to human hypertension. Renal RGS2 deficiency is sufficient to cause hypertension in mice; however, the pathological mechanisms are unknown. Here we determined how the loss of RGS2 affects renal function. We examined renal hemodynamics and tubular function by monitoring renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) expression and localization, and pressure natriuresis in wild type (WT) and RGS2 null (RGS2-/-) mice. Pressure natriuresis was determined by stepwise increases in renal perfusion pressure (RPP) and blood flow, or by systemic blockade of nitric oxide synthase with L-NG-Nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Baseline GFR was markedly decreased in RGS2-/- mice compared to WT controls (5.0 ± 0.8 vs. 2.5 ± 0.1 μl/min/g body weight, p<0.01). RBF was reduced (35.4 ± 3.6 vs. 29.1 ± 2.1 μl/min/g body weight, p=0.08) while renal vascular resistance (RVR; 2.1 ± 0.2 vs. 3.0 ± 0.2 mmHg/μl/min/g body weight, p<0.01) was elevated in RGS2-/- compared to WT mice. RGS2 deficiency caused decreased sensitivity and magnitude of changes in RVR and RBF after a step increase in RPP. The acute pressure–natriuresis curve was shifted rightward in RGS2-/- relative to WT mice. Sodium excretion rate following increased RPP by L-NAME was markedly decreased in RGS2-/- mice and accompanied by increased translocation of ENaC to the luminal wall. We conclude that RGS2 deficiency impairs renal function and autoregulation by increasing renal vascular resistance and reducing renal blood flow. These changes impair renal sodium handling by favoring sodium retention. The findings provide a new line of evidence for renal dysfunction as a primary cause of hypertension."

Chongqing, located in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, has been experiencing differences in the occurrence of HFRS from 1997 to 2008. The current study was designed to explore the effects of climate and rodent factors on the transmission of HFRS in Chongqing. Data on monthly HFRS cases, rodent strains, and climatic factors were collected from 1997 to 2008. Spatio-temporal analysis indicated that most HFRS cases were clustered in central Chongqing and that the incidence of HFRS decreased from 1997 to 2008. Poisson regression models showed that temperature (with lagged months of 0 and 5) and rainfall (with 2 lagged months) were key climatic factors contributing to the transmission of HFRS. A zero-inflated negative binomial model revealed that rodent density was also significantly associated with the occurrence of HFRS in the Changshou district. The monthly trend in HFRS incidence was positively associated with rodent density and rainfall and negatively associated with temperature. Possible mechanisms are proposed through which construction of the dam influenced the incidence of HFRS in Chongqing. The findings of this study may contribute to the development of early warning systems for the control and prevention of HFRS in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region."
https://openalex.org/W950936840,"Food intake and energy metabolism are tightly controlled to maintain stable energy homeostasis and healthy states. Thus, animals detect their stored energy levels, and based on this, they determine appropriate food intake and meal size. Drosophila melanogaster putative G protein-coupled receptor, Bride of sevenless (BOSS) is a highly evolutionarily conserved protein that responds to extracellular glucose levels in order to regulate energy homeostasis. To address how BOSS regulates energy homeostasis, we characterized a boss mutant by assessing its food intake and stored energy levels. Boss mutants exhibited increased food intake but decreased stored triacylglyceride levels. Using boss-GAL4 drivers, we found that boss is expressed in select tissues that are involved in nutrient sensing and food intake, in a subset of neurons in brain and chemosensory organs, in fat body, and in endocrine cells in gut (enteroendocrine cells). Flies with tissue-specific boss knockdowns in these tissues had abnormal stored energy levels and abnormal food intake. These results suggest that BOSS in either neurons or peripheral nutrient-sensing tissues affects energy homeostasis in ways that relate to the sensing of nutrients and regulation of food intake."

To investigate the relationship between HPV and chronic inflammation in oropharyngeal carcinogenesis, we collected 140 oral mucous fresh specimens including 50 OPSCC patients, 50 cancer in situ, 30 precancerous lesions, and 10 normal oral mucous. Our data demonstrated that there was a significantly higher proportion of severe chronic inflammation in dysplastic epithelia in comparison with that in normal tissues (P<0.001). The positive rate of HPV 16 was parallel with the chronic inflammation degrees from mild to severe inflammation (P<0.05). The positive rate of HPV 16 was progressively improved with the malignant progression of oral mucous (P<0.05). In addition, CD11b+ LIN- HLA-DR-CD33+ MDSCs were a critical cell population that mediates inflammation response and immune suppression in HPV-positive OPSCC. These indicated that persistent chronic inflammation-related HPV infection might drive oropharyngeal carcinogenesis and MDSCs might pay an important role during this process. Thus, a combination of HPV infection and inflammation expression might become a helpful biomedical marker to predict oropharyngeal carcinogenesis."

The purpose of the work is to identify proteins that are present in the salt gland-enriched tissues. An average of 2189 and 977 proteins were identified from the epidermal peel and mesophyll tissues, respectively. Among these, 2188 proteins were identified in salt gland-enriched tissues and a total of 1032 selected proteins were categorized by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. This paper reports for the first time the proteomic analysis of salt gland-enriched tissues of a mangrove tree species. Candidate proteins that may play a role in the desalination process of the mangrove salt glands and their potential localization were identified.

Therefore, new antiviral targets and new drugs to fight influenza virus infections are needed. Although IAV RNA transcription/replication represents a promising target for antiviral drug development, no assay ideal for high-throughput screening (HTS) application is currently available to identify inhibitors targeting these processes. In this work, we developed a novel HTS assay to analyze the transcription and replication of IAV RNA using an A549 cell line stably expressing IAV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex, NP and a viral mini-genomic RNA. Both secreted Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) and blasticidin resistance gene (Bsd) were encoded in the viral minigenome and expressed under the control of IAV RdRp. Gluc serves as a reporter to monitor the activity of IAV RdRp, and Bsd is used to maintain the expression of all foreign genes.

https://openalex.org/W968539242,"Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a promising treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders. The mechanism of action and the effects of electrical fields administered to the brain by means of an electrode remain to be elucidated. The effects of DBS have been investigated primarily by electrophysiological and neurochemical studies, which lack the ability to investigate DBS-related responses on a whole-brain scale. Visualization of whole-brain effects of DBS requires functional imaging techniques such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), which reflects changes in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses throughout the entire brain volume. In order to visualize BOLD responses induced by DBS, we have developed an MRI-compatible electrode and an acquisition protocol to perform DBS during BOLD fMRI. In this study, we investigate whether DBS during fMRI is valuable to study local and whole-brain effects of hippocampal DBS and to investigate the changes induced by different stimulation intensities. Seven rats were stereotactically implanted with a custom-made MRI-compatible DBS-electrode in the right hippocampus. High frequency Poisson distributed stimulation was applied using a block-design paradigm. Data were processed by means of Independent Component Analysis. Clusters were considered significant when p-values were <0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons. Our data indicate that real-time hippocampal DBS evokes a bilateral BOLD response in hippocampal and other mesolimbic structures, depending on the applied stimulation intensity. We conclude that simultaneous DBS and fMRI can be used to detect local and whole-brain responses to circuit activation with different stimulation intensities, making this technique potentially powerful for exploration of cerebral changes in response to DBS for both preclinical and clinical DBS."
https://openalex.org/W1525971453,"The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis is the most important neuro-endocrine stress response system of our body which is of critical importance for survival. Disturbances in HPA-axis activity have been associated with adverse metabolic and cognitive changes. Humans enriched for longevity have less metabolic and cognitive disturbances and therefore diminished activity of the HPA axis may be a potential candidate mechanism underlying healthy familial longevity. Here, we compared 24-h plasma ACTH and serum cortisol concentration profiles and different aspects of the regulation of the HPA-axis in offspring from long-lived siblings, who are enriched for familial longevity and age-matched controls.Case-control study within the Leiden Longevity study cohort consisting of 20 middle-aged offspring of nonagenarian siblings (offspring) together with 18 partners (controls).During 24 h, venous blood was sampled every 10 minutes for determination of circulatory ACTH and cortisol concentrations. Deconvolution analysis, cross approximate entropy analysis and ACTH-cortisol-dose response modeling were used to assess, respectively, ACTH and cortisol secretion parameters, feedforward and feedback synchrony and adrenal gland ACTH responsivity.Mean (95% Confidence Interval) basal ACTH secretion was higher in male offspring compared to male controls (645 (324-1286) ngl/L/24 h versus 240 (120-477) ng/L/24 h, P = 0.05). Other ACTH and cortisol secretion parameters did not differ between offspring and controls. In addition, no significant differences in feedforward and feedback synchrony and adrenal gland ACTH responsivity were observed between groups.These results suggest that familial longevity is not associated with major differences in HPA-axis activity under resting conditions, although modest, sex-specific differences may exist between groups that might be clinically relevant."
https://openalex.org/W999032731,"For over 50 years, researchers have focused on the mechanisms underlying the important roles of the cytoskeleton in controlling the cell growth direction and cell expansion. In our study, we performed ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenesis on Col-0 background and identified two new CONSTITUTIVE EXPRESSER OF PATHOGENESIS RELATED GENES 1 (CPR1) alleles with pavement cell (PC) morphogenetic defects. Morphological characterizations showed that polar growth initiation and expansion of PCs are seriously suppressed in cpr1. Closer cytoskeleton investigation showed that the directional arrangement of microtubules (MTs) during PC development is defective and the cortical fine actin filaments cannot be aggregated effectively to form actin cable networks in cpr1 mutants. These results suggest that the abnormal PC morphogenesis in cpr1 is accompanying with the aberrant arrangement of cytoskeleton. Site-directed mutagenesis and knockout within the F-box-associated (FBA) domain, which is reported to be a motif for recognizing particular substrates of CPR1, proved that the FBA domain is indispensable for normal CPR1 regulation of the PC morphogenesis. Further genetic analysis indicated that the defects on PC morphogenesis of cpr1 depend on two lipase-like proteins, ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4. Our results provide further insights into the relationship between the cytoskeleton and PC morphogenesis, and suggest that the cytoskeleton-mediated PC morphogenesis control might be tightly linked to plant defense responses."
https://openalex.org/W1021695750,"Background The heat shock response (HSR) is an ancient and highly conserved program of stress-induced gene expression, aimed at reestablishing protein homeostasis to preserve cellular fitness. Cells that fail to activate or maintain this protective response are hypersensitive to proteotoxic stress. The HSR is mediated by the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), which binds to conserved heat shock elements (HSE) in the promoter region of heat shock genes, resulting in the expression of heat shock proteins (HSP). Recently, we observed that hyperactivation of RhoA conditions cardiomyocytes for the cardiac arrhythmia atrial fibrillation. Also, the HSR is annihilated in atrial fibrillation, and induction of HSR mitigates sensitization of cells to this disease. Therefore, we hypothesized active RhoA to suppress the HSR resulting in sensitization of cells for proteotoxic stimuli. Methods and Results Stimulation of RhoA activity significantly suppressed the proteotoxic stress-induced HSR in HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes as determined with a luciferase reporter construct driven by the HSF1 regulated human HSP70 (HSPA1A) promoter and HSP protein expression by Western Blot analysis. Inversely, RhoA inhibition boosted the proteotoxic stress-induced HSR. While active RhoA did not preclude HSF1 nuclear accumulation, phosphorylation, acetylation, or sumoylation, it did impair binding of HSF1 to the hsp genes promoter element HSE. Impaired binding results in suppression of HSP expression and sensitized cells to proteotoxic stress. Conclusion These results reveal that active RhoA negatively regulates the HSR via attenuation of the HSF1-HSE binding and thus may play a role in sensitizing cells to proteotoxic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2098633284,"The molecular mechanisms that regulate invertebrate visual pigment absorption are poorly understood. Studies of amphioxus Go-opsin have demonstrated that Glu-181 functions as the counterion in this pigment. This finding has led to the proposal that Glu-181 may function as the counterion in other invertebrate visual pigments as well. Here we describe a series of mutagenesis experiments to test this hypothesis and to also test whether other conserved acidic amino acids in Drosophila Rhodopsin 1 (Rh1) may serve as the counterion of this visual pigment. Of the 5 Glu and Asp residues replaced by Gln or Asn in our experiments, none of the mutant pigments shift the absorption of Rh1 by more than 6 nm. In combination with prior studies, these results suggest that the counterion in Drosophila Rh1 may not be located at Glu-181 as in amphioxus, or at Glu-113 as in bovine rhodopsin. Conversely, the extremely low steady state levels of the E194Q mutant pigment (bovine opsin site Glu-181), and the rhabdomere degeneration observed in flies expressing this mutant demonstrate that a negatively charged residueat this position is essential for normal rhodopsin function in vivo. This work also raises the possibility that another residue or physiologic anion may compensate for the missing counterion in the E194Q mutant.

This work also raises the possibility that another residue or physiologic anion may compensate for the missing counterion in the E194Q mutant. The visual pigment rhodopsin is a unique G-protein-coupled receptor that is activated by the conformational change of a covalently attached chromophore rather than the binding of a diffusible transmitter, drug or hormone (1Hofmann K.P. Scheerer P. Hildebrand P.W. Choe H.W. Park J.H. Heck M. Ernst O.P. A G protein-coupled receptor at work: the rhodopsin model.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 540-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In both vertebrates and invertebrates, rhodopsin consists of an 11-cis-retinal chromophore that is bound to the opsin apoprotein via a protonated Schiff base (Fig. 1a). Upon light absorption the chromophore isomerizes from 11-cis to all-trans, inducing conformational changes in the opsin that produce activated metarhodopsin (2Smith S.O. Structure and activation of the visual pigment rhodopsin.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2010; 39: 309-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Interactions between the retinal chromophore and amino acid side chains in the opsin protein tune the λmax of the chromophore (Fig. 1b) (3Kochendoerfer G.G. Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Mathies R.A. How color visual pigments are tuned.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 300-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that Glu-113 (bovine position) within the third transmembrane helix serves as the retinylidene Schiff base counterion in vertebrate visual pigments (4Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D.

Determinants of visual pigment absorbance: identification of the retinylidene Schiff's base counterion in bovine rhodopsin.Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9746-9752Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Negatively charged Glu-113 serves to stabilize the protonated Schiff base and allow the delocalization of electrons through resonant structures of the conjugated retinal polyene system, thereby shifting the absorption of the UV absorbing chromophore and UV absorbing protein to longer wavelengths (7Nathans J. The evolution and physiology of human color vision: insights from molecular genetic studies of visual pigments.Neuron. 1999; 24: 299-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Removing the negative charge of the counterion from the binding pocket deprotonates the chromophore and yields a UV absorbing pigment (4Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D.

In contrast, the comparable amino acid in the visible light absorbing invertebrate pigments is Tyr, or Phe in the UV absorbing pigments. In previous work, we demonstrated conclusively that this substitution is not responsible for the difference in absorption between invertebrate UV and visible absorbing pigments, and that the tyrosine present in the visible absorbing pigments is unlikely to function as a counterion (8Salcedo E. Zheng L. Phistry M. Bagg E.E. Britt S.G. Molecular basis for ultraviolet vision in invertebrates.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10873-10878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of squid retinochrome have indicated that a conserved Glu-181 (bovine position) is the counterion for this non-G-protein-coupled receptor retinal photoisomerase (9Terakita A. Yamashita T. Shichida Y. Highly conserved glutamic acid in the extracellular IV-V loop in rhodopsins acts as the counterion in retinochrome, a member of the rhodopsin family.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 14263-14267Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similarly, the same group has also shown that Glu-181 in amphioxus (Branchiostoma belcheri) rhodopsin and peropsin also functions as the counterion in these pigments (10Terakita A. Koyanagi M. Tsukamoto H. Yamashita T. Miyata T. Shichida Y. Counterion displacement in the molecular evolution of the rhodopsin family.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This has led to the proposal that during the course of evolution the location of the counterion has been displaced from Glu-181 to Glu-113 (10Terakita A. Koyanagi M. Tsukamoto H. Yamashita T. Miyata T. Shichida Y. Counterion displacement in the molecular evolution of the rhodopsin family.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This concept is supported by two findings. First, the loss of the counterion at Glu-181 in amphioxus rhodopsin can be substituted by introduction of Glu at Tyr-113 (Y113E,E181Q double mutant, mutants are referred to by the single letter amino acid designation of the wild-type residue followed by its position number followed by the single letter amino acid designation of the introduced residue) (10Terakita A. Koyanagi M. Tsukamoto H. Yamashita T. Miyata T. Shichida Y. Counterion displacement in the molecular evolution of the rhodopsin family.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Second, the counterion of the activated photoproduct of bovine rhodopsin is Glu-181 (11Yan E.C. Kazmi M.A. Ganim Z. Hou J.M. Pan D. Chang B.S. Sakmar T.P. Mathies R.A. Retinal counterion switch in the photoactivation of the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9262-9267Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and the photoproduct counterion of amphioxus rhodopsin is also Glu-181 (10Terakita A. Koyanagi M. Tsukamoto H. Yamashita T. Miyata T. Shichida Y. Counterion displacement in the molecular evolution of the rhodopsin family.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that the counterion in bovine rhodopsin switches from Glu-113 to Glu-181 following photoactivation, whereas in amphioxus the counterion in both rhodopsin and its activated photoproduct is Glu-181. This indicates that whereas either Glu-113 or Glu-181 can function as the amphioxus rhodopsin counterion in the ground state, only Glu-181 serves as a counterion in the activated photoproducts of both amphioxus and bovine rhodopsin. Molecular dynamics studies of the squid rhodopsin structure have suggested that the residue corresponding to Glu-181 functions as the counterion in squid rhodopsin (12Sekharan S. Altun A. Morokuma K. Photochemistry of visual pigment in a Gq protein-coupled receptor (GPCR): insights from structural and spectral tuning studies on squid rhodopsin.Chemistry. 2010; 16: 1744-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Despite the findings of this model, it is uncertain whether the counterion mutagenesis results in amphioxus are applicable to other invertebrate species. The amphioxus opsin that has been characterized in mutagenesis experiments is part of a family of Go-opsins found in ciliary photoreceptors. These cells hyperpolarize in response to light, as the result of the activation of guanylyl cyclase (13Gomez M.P. Nasi E. Light transduction in invertebrate hyperpolarizing photoreceptors: possible involvement of a Go-regulated guanylate cyclase.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5254-5263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that increases cGMP and opens K+ channels (14del Pilar Gomez M. Nasi E.

Nasi E. The light-sensitive conductance of hyperpolarizing invertebrate photoreceptors: a patch-clamp study.J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 939-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). By contrast, the rhabdomeric photoreceptors of Drosophila and many other invertebrates depolarize in response to light, as the result of the activation of a heterotrimeric Gq protein, which activates phospholipase C and two classes of light-sensitive transient receptor potential channels, TRP and TRPL (16Hardie R.C. Raghu P. Visual transduction in Drosophila.Nature. 2001; 413: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) that admit both Na+ and Ca2+. In addition to their functional differences, phylogentic evidence suggests that the Go-opsins diverged from the r-opsins prior to the cnidarian-bilaterian split, over 580 million years ago (Fig. 2a) (17Condon D. Zhu M. Bowring S. Wang W. Yang A. Jin Y. U-Pb ages from the neoproterozoic Doushantuo formation, China.Science. 2005; 308: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 18Erwin D.H.

Phototransduction and the evolution of photoreceptors.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: R114-R124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate that there are substantial functional, structural, and phylogenetic differences between the amphioxus Go-opsin and the visual pigments of Drosophila. To test whether Glu-181 or another conserved negatively charged amino acid may serve as the counterion in the Drosophila visual pigments, we generated a series of mutations in Drosophila rhodopsin 1 (Rh1). 2The abbreviations used are: Rh1rhodopsin 1MSPmicrospectrophotometry. The five mutants (Rh1 D96N, Rh1 D124N, Rh1 D147N, Rh1 E194Q, and Rh1 D203N) correspond to Asp-83, Asn-111, Glu-134, Glu-181, and Asp-190, respectively, in bovine rhodopsin (Fig. 2b). We found that each of these mutant Rh1 pigments is functionally expressed in vivo in transgenic flies. However, none of the mutants display a dramatic shift in color sensitivity to shorter wavelengths, as would be expected for a mutation in a putative counterion. rhodopsin 1 microspectrophotometry. Flies expressing modified forms of Rh1 were generated in a similar manner to that reported previously (8Salcedo E. Zheng L. Phistry M. Bagg E.E. Britt S.G. Molecular basis for ultraviolet vision in invertebrates.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10873-10878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the gene encoding Rh1 was modified by site-directed mutagenesis using inverse PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase, and DpnI digestion of the methylated template (20Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C.

The sequence of the mutagenized fragment was confirmed and the fragment was then subcloned into a 5.4-kb genomic fragment containing the entire Rh1 promoter and coding region. The modified Rh1 was subcloned into the y+ marked P-element vector “C4” obtained from Pam Geyer (University of Iowa) (22Patton J.S. Gomes X.V. Geyer P.K. Position-independent germline transformation in Drosophila using a cuticle pigmentation gene as a selectable marker.Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5859-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The construct was injected into y w; sr ninaE17 mutant embryos, and multiple independent P-element-mediated germline transformants were obtained (23Karess R.E. Rubin G.M. Analysis of P transposable element functions in Drosophila.Cell. 1984; 38: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar).

The immunoreactive proteins were detected with polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated to IRDye® 800CW and polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugated to IRDye® 680CW (both from LI-COR Biosciences). The blots were scanned with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Epon-embedded retinal cross-sections were performed as previously described (25Chou W.H. Huber A. Bentrop J.

Spectral sensitivity was measured as previously described (8Salcedo E. Zheng L. Phistry M. Bagg E.E. Britt S.G. Molecular basis for ultraviolet vision in invertebrates.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10873-10878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electroretinograms and spectral sensitivity recordings were performed on transgenic animals expressing modified forms of rhodopsin in either a ninaE17 background or in a modified norpA; ninaE17 mutant background. The latter strain also contained an additional transgene driving the norpA cDNA in the R1–6 photoreceptor cells under the control of the Rh1 promoter. This background strain allows the activity of the modified pigment to be examined without interference from the R7 and R8 cells that are not affected by the ninaE mutation (26Salcedo E. Huber A.

The protein was embedded in a membrane of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylchlorine with VMD. Full solvation with TIP3 water molecules, neutralization, and addition of sodium and chloride ions with performed with VMD. The resulting model was 93 Å × 94 Å × 97 Å containing 12,525 water molecules. Full particle mesh Ewald calculations for electrostatics were used for all simulations. To relax the system, a 20-ps run was performed with the protein backbone and LYR-319 fixed. This was followed by a 50-ps run with the protein backbone and LYR-319 residue harmonically constrained. Next, a 50-ps run was performed with LYR-319 residue harmonically constrained, and then finally a 2-ns run was performed with no constraints. To test whether Glu-181 or another conserved negatively charged amino acid may serve as the counterion in the Drosophila visual pigments we performed an alignment of the six-well characterized Drosophila opsins and generated a phylogenetic tree to evaluate their relatedness (Fig. 2a). A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of invertebrate pigments has been reported (43Porter M.L. Cronin T.W. McClellan D.A. Crandall K.A. Molecular characterization of crustacean visual pigments and the evolution of pancrustacean opsins.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 253-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Drosophila visual pigments represent almost all of the major classes of visual pigments within the invertebrate lineage including ultraviolet, blue, middle wavelength-sensitive, and long wavelength-sensitive pigments (Fig. 2b). The phylogenetic relationship between pigments of different spectral types is conserved in most other species (e.g. insect UV and blue pigments are derived from the same lineage). In addition to Glu-181, we identified four other conserved sites that contain negatively charged amino acids in all or most of the Drosophila visual pigments. The site corresponding to bovine rhodopsin Asn-111 is the one position that is not conserved in all Drosophila pigments and contains Gln in Rh3 and Rh4 and Glu or Asp in the other opsins. The other three sites, corresponding to bovine opsin Asp-83, Glu-134, and Asp-290, contain Asp in all of the Drosophila visual pigments. Of these sites, mutagenesis of Asp-83 and Glu-181 have demonstrated significant spectral shifts in vertebrate pigments, reviewed in Ref. 44Takahashi Y. Ebrey T.G. Molecular basis of spectral tuning in the newt short wavelength sensitive visual pigment.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6025-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar. To evaluate the structural relationships of these amino acids within the context of the Drosophila Rh1 protein and their relationship with the chromophore and Schiff base-bound lysine residue, we generated a structural model of wild-type Rh1 based on the crystal structure of squid rhodopsin (PDB entry 2z73) (33Murakami M. Kouyama T. Crystal structure of squid rhodopsin.Nature. 2008; 453: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) using molecular dynamics methods. As expected, the overall topology of the structural model is very similar to that of squid rhodopsin upon which it is based. The root mean square deviation, average distance between the atoms of superimposed proteins, for the pairwise structural model comparisons were as follows: wild-type Rh1 versus squid rhodopsin = 3.5 Å, wild-type Rh1 versus bovine rhodopsin = 4.2 Å. Overall, this demonstrates a very close fit between the structures as a whole, although the model of wild-type Rh1 shows a higher degree of overlap with the structure of squid rhodopsin upon which it is based, than with the structure of bovine rhodopsin (PDB entry 1U19) (45Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. The retinal conformation and its environment in rhodopsin in light of a new 2.2-Å crystal structure.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The overall topology of the Rh1 protein model is shown in Fig. 1a along with the positions of the five charged amino acids described above, Asp-96, Asp-124, Asp-147, Glu-194, and Asp-203. The amino acid side chains within 2.5 Å of the retinal chromophore in the model of wild-type Rh1 are shown in Fig. 1b. None of the residues described above are within this distance window. The order of proximity of the closest side chain oxygen of each amino acid to the Schiff base nitrogen in the chromophore: Glu-194 is closest at 6.7 Å; Asp-96 at 13.4 Å; Asp-203 at 14.5 Å; Asp-124 at 15.9 Å; Asp-147 at 29.6 Å. To investigate the role that these amino acid sites may play as a potential Drosophila rhodopsin counterion, we constructed mutant forms of the blue absorbing (Rh1) Drosophila opsin, as previously described (8Salcedo E.

In these mutants, we replaced the charged residue at the site in Rh1 with an uncharged residue (Asn for Asp and Gln for Glu, (i.e. Rh1 D96N, Rh1 D124N, Rh1 D147N, Rh1 E194Q, and Rh1 D203N).

Thus, in this paper, the problem of pedestrian flow control in open outdoor walking facilities in equilibrium condition is investigated using M/M/c/K queuing models. State dependent service rate based on speed and density relationship is utilized. The effective rate of the Poisson arrival process to the facility is determined so as there is no overflow of pedestrians. In addition, the use of the state dependent queuing models to the design of the facilities and the effect of pedestrian personal capacity on the design and the traffic congestion are discussed.

https://openalex.org/W2131463505,"ETS1 is the archetype of the ETS transcription factor (TF) family. ETS TFs share a DNA-binding domain, the ETS domain. All ETS TFs recognize a core GGA(A/T) binding site, and thus ETS TFs are found to redundantly regulate the same genes. However, each ETS TF has unique targets as well. One prevailing hypotheses explaining this duality is that protein-protein interactions, including homodimerization, allow each ETS TF to display distinct behavior. The behavior of ETS1 is further regulated by autoinhibition. Autoinhibition apparently modulates ETS1 DNA binding affinity, but the mechanism of this inhibition is not completely understood. We sought to characterize the relationship between DNA binding and ETS1 homodimer formation. We find that ETS1 interrogates DNA and forms dimers even when the DNA does not contain an ETS recognition sequence. Mutational studies also link nonspecific DNA backbone contacts with dimer formation, in addition to providing a new role for the recognition helix of ETS1 in maintaining the autoinhibited state. Finally, in showing that residues in the DNA recognition helix affect autoinhibition, we define a new function of ETS1 autoinhibition: maintenance of a monomeric state in the absence of DNA. The conservation of relevant amino acid residues across all ETS TFs indicates that the mechanisms of nonspecific DNA interrogation and protein oligomer formation elucidated here may be common to all ETS proteins that autoinhibit.

Promoter-specific transcription of genes in eukaryotes is controlled by the activities of DNA-bound transcription factors. Many of these act in combination with other transcription factors and are capable of regulating the activities of several different genes. These features are key to coordinated, differential regulation of various gene families. The effectiveness of a given transcription factor across the spectrum of its regulated target genes varies. The variation in transcription factor activity is primarily modulated by differences in the affinity of the factor for its specific binding sites. Transcription factor affinity for its DNA binding sites depends on the sequence of the site, its oligomeric state, identity of its DNA binding partners, and/or the activity of autoregulatory elements within the transcription factor. We are interested in exploring how binding site sequence affects oligomeric form and autoinhibitory function together to regulate the DNA binding activities of transcription factors. To this end, because there is an exact correspondence between DNA binding affinity and transcriptional regulatory activity of ETS family members (1Baillat D. Bègue A. Stéhelin D. Aumercier M. ETS-1 transcription factor binds cooperatively to the palindromic head to head ETS-binding sites of the stromelysin-1 promoter by counteracting autoinhibition.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29386-29398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we are investigating the form and function of ETS1, the prototypical ETS protein. ETS proteins are found in metazoan species ranging from invertebrates to humans. Each member of this diverse set of proteins shares a conserved sequence of ∼85 amino acids known as the ETS domain (2Sharrocks A.D. The ETS-domain transcription factor family.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). This domain directs the sequence-specific DNA binding of these proteins. The ETS domain contains a “winged-helix-turn-helix” motif that is comprised of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet scaffold attached to a three-α-helix bundle. All ETS members bind a DNA site that contains an invariant core consensus GGA(A/T) sequence (3Wei G.H. Badis G. Berger M.F. Kivioja T. Palin K. Enge M. Bonke M. Jolma A. Varjosalo M. Gehrke A.R.

Residues in the recognition α-helix H3 of the ETS domain make direct contact with the major groove surface of the guanine and adenine bases in the conserved core sequence. Protein residues located in the turns between α-helices H2 and H3 and between β-strands 3 and 4 contact other regions of the core site and/or the DNA phosphate backbone (4Lamber E.P. Vanhille L. Textor L.C. Kachalova G.S. Sieweke M.H. Wilmanns M.

Although no base-specifying contacts are made to any DNA base outside of the core, the binding site preferences of ETS family members are modulated by the DNA sequence outside of the core consensus (5Hollenhorst P.C.

Biol. 2003; 328: 805-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Full-length ETS1 is not known to bind DNA as a monomer; ETS1 seemingly binds DNA only as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with one of several different partner proteins, including, among others, RUNX1, Pax-5, Pit-1, and NF-κB (7Dittmer J. The biology of the Ets1 proto-oncogene.Mol. Cancer. 2003; 2: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). As a consequence of its interaction with these partners, ETS1 regulates a variety of genes related to functions such as embryonic development, angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and tumor invasion (7Dittmer J. The biology of the Ets1 proto-oncogene.Mol. Cancer. 2003; 2: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an ETS1 splice variant that lacks a region N-terminal to the ETS domain does not autoinhibit and can bind DNA as a monomer (1Baillat D. Bègue A. Stéhelin D. Aumercier M. ETS-1 transcription factor binds cooperatively to the palindromic head to head ETS-binding sites of the stromelysin-1 promoter by counteracting autoinhibition.J. Biol.

The ETS1 homodimer binds DNA sequences comprised of two ETS binding sites (EBS) 2The abbreviations used are: EBSETS binding siteBMOEbismaleimidoethaneTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. facing each other on opposite strands (4Lamber E.P. Vanhille L. Textor L.C. Kachalova G.S. Sieweke M.H. Wilmanns M. Regulation of the transcription factor Ets-1 by DNA-mediated homo-dimerization.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2006-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The head to head arrangement of two EBSs is widespread among ETS1-regulated promoters but is notably found in two particularly well studied cases: the promoter for MMP3, which encodes a matrix metalloprotease, and the promoter for human p53 (8Baillat D. Laitem C. Leprivier G. Margerin C. Aumercier M. Ets-1 binds cooperatively to the palindromic Ets-binding sites in the p53 promoter.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 378: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both EBSs in head to head sites are required for binding and transcriptional regulations by full-length ETS1; deletion of or mutations in either EBS inhibits ETS1 binding and, thereby, promoter transactivation. These findings indicate that, on a head to head site, two monomers of the ETS1 homodimer bind cooperatively to the two EBSs (4Lamber E.P. Vanhille L. Textor L.C. Kachalova G.S. Sieweke M.H.

ETS1 autoinhibition is mediated by the packing of helices within the N-terminal inhibitory domain and C-terminal inhibitory domain onto helix H1 of the ETS domain. These inhibitory helices flank the ETS domain and lower the DNA affinity of ETS1, apparently by decreasing the overall flexibility of the three α-helices in the winged helix motif, although the precise mechanistic implications of the change in flexibility are as yet unknown. The function of ETS1 autoinhibition is thought to be to provide a “graded control” of ETS1 DNA binding affinity (5Hollenhorst P.C. McIntosh L.P. Graves B.J. Genomic and biochemical insights into the specificity of ETS transcription factors.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 437-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Most structural studies of ETS1 autoinhibition have focused on a partially inhibited fragment, and to date no plausible model for monomeric relief of autoinhibition has been proposed. On the other hand, there has been much work involving autoinhibition and homodimer formation, culminating in several x-ray crystallography studies (4Lamber E.P. Vanhille L. Textor L.C. Kachalova G.S.

Despite extensive investigations aimed at delineating how ETS1 DNA binding is regulated, a precise mechanism has not been articulated. Several questions remain: 1) How is ETS1 dimerization regulated? 2) Can full-length ETS1 bind as a monomer in some DNA contexts? 3) Are DNA binding and protein oligomer formation linked, and if so, how? 4) How do ETS1-DNA interactions lead to relief of autoinhibition? In this study we show that ETS1 forms dimers in the presence of either specific EBS-containing DNA or nonspecific DNA that does not contain an EBS core consensus sequence, but not in the absence of DNA. We have also found that ETS1 does not form dimers when the ability to contact a particular DNA phosphate is blocked. Additionally, we found that an ETS1 splice variant lacking the autoinhibitory module self-associates even in the absence of DNA, suggesting that ETS1 autoinhibition modulates DNA binding activity by preventing oligomerization of the ETS domain. Finally, we show that α-helix H3 mutant ETS1 protein also self-associates in the absence of DNA. This result shows that this DNA binding α-helix H3 also has a role in maintaining autoinhibited state. Autoinhibition was previously thought to only involve allosteric hindrance of a separate region of the ETS domain. Plasmids containing the coding sequence for human ETS1Δ280 and ETS1Δ335 were a kind gift from Dr. Matthias Wilmanns (EMBL, Hamburg, Germany). ETS1 derivatives bearing the R394A/Y395A, L337A, and/or the R378C mutations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The primers used for mutagenesis were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The R394A and Y395A mutations were made in one reaction with the following primers: 5′-GAGAAACTGAGCCGTGGCCTAGCCGCCTATTACGACAAAAACATCATCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGATGATGTTTTTGTCGTAATAGGCGGCTAGGCCACGGCTCAGTTTCTC-3′ (reverse). The R378C primers are 5′-GGCCAGGAGATGGGGAAAGTGCAAAAACAAACCTAAGATGAATTATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATAATTCATCTTAGGTTTGTTTTTGCACTTTCCCCATCTCCTGGCC-3′ (reverse). The L337A primers are 5′-GGCAGTGGACCAATCCAGGCGTGGCAGTTTCTTCTGG-3′ (forward) 5′-CCAGAAGAAACTGCCA±CGCCTGGATTGGTCCACTGCC-3′ (reverse). The R394A/Y395A and R378C primers work on both ETS1Δ280 and ETS1Δ335. The L337A primers are specific to ETS1Δ280. The altered bases are underlined. Purification of unmodified ETS1Δ280, as well as the R394A/Y395A and L337A mutant proteins, was performed essentially as described in Ref. 4Lamber E.P. Vanhille L. Textor L.C. Kachalova G.S.

Purification of R378C mutants was also identical except for the addition of 1 mm DTT to the lysis and storage buffers. Purification of ETS1Δ335 was identical to that in Ref. 4Lamber E.P. Vanhille L.

Complementary 60-base oligonucleotides encoding desired ETS1 binding site sequence embedded within their naturally occurring flanking DNA were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. The sequences of the top strand of the wild type sites are: MMP3, 5′-TCAGTTTTCTCCTCTACCAAGACAGGAAGCACTTCCTGGAGATTAATCACTGTGTTGCCT-3′; and p53, 5′-CATCAGTTAAAATGTCATTTTTTAGGAAGGCTTTCCGTAATATCACAC CCTAACGTTTTC-3′. The EBSs present are underlined. Equivalent amounts of each pair of the complementary strands were mixed, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and slowly cooled over 4 h to anneal the two strands. Double-stranded DNA was separated from the individual single strands by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE (89 mm Tris, pH 8.9, 89 mm borate, 1 mm EDTA) and eluted from them by a crush and soak method. Eluted DNA was separated from contaminants by size exclusion chromatography. Following gel purification, the DNA fragments were radioactively labeled at their 5′ ends by incubating the DNA with γ-[32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Epicenter, Inc., Madison, WI). Labeled DNA was incubated with the specified concentrations of ETS1 protein in binding buffer (40 μg/ml BSA, 0.01% Triton X-100, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol) for 20 min at 4 °C. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C. The electrophoresis buffer was 1× TBE. The amounts of protein-DNA complexes present on dried gels were quantified using a Storm imager (GE Healthcare). The values of the dissociation constant (KD) were determined by nonlinear squares fitting of the EMSA data to a hyperbolic equation using Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Each dissociation constant was determined from at least four replicate measurements. Single-stranded DNA containing the desired binding sites was gel-purified as described above and radioactively labeled at their 5′ ends by incubating the DNA with γ-[32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Epicenter, Inc.). Following ethanol precipitation, the labeled DNA was dissolved in TEN (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl), and a 1.1 molar excess of the complementary strand was added. The mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooled over 4 h to anneal the two strands. DNase I cleavage was performed as follows. In a 20-μl reaction, 1.5 pmol of end-labeled DNA was incubated with increasing amounts of the desired ETS1 protein in buffer containing 40 μg/ml BSA, 0.01% Triton X-100, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2 and 5% glycerol. Protein-DNA complexes were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min and subsequently brought to 25 °C prior to the addition of 3 μg/ml DNase I, an amount sufficient to generate, on average, one cleavage per DNA molecule in 3 min of additional incubation. The cleavage reactions were terminated by precipitation with ethanol and sec-butanol dehydration, and the DNA was dissolved in 90% formamide solution containing tracking dyes.

Briefly, in a 10-μl reaction, 2 pmol of the desired ETS1 protein was incubated with 2–5× molar excess DNA for 20 min at 4 °C in EMSA binding buffer. Subsequently, bismaleimidoethane (BMOE; Thermo Scientific) was added to a final concentration of 10 μm, and samples were incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Reactions were quenched by adding 10 μm DTT and incubating for 15 min at 37 °C. Subsequent to adding loading dye, the samples were boiled for 5 min, and the reaction products were fractionated on a 15% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoretic separation, the reaction products were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the membranes were blocked for 1 h in 2% BSA or 5% milk in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.001% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl) at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h in primary antibody (ETS-1, C-20: sc-350; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) at room temperature at a 1:10,000 dilution. The membranes were then rinsed and incubated in goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific, Pierce) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at a 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Reaction products were visualized using an ECL detection kit (Bio-Rad). Imaging and band analysis were performed on a Bio-Rad Gel-Doc. In a 10 μl reaction, purified ETS1Δ280 (10 μg, ∼500 pmol) was incubated in the presence or absence of 2-fold molar excess of either MMP3 WT or M1 DNA for 20 min at 4 °C in buffer containing 0.01% Triton X-100, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol. 100 ng of chymotrypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ) was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 4 °C for 3 h, with one-third of the reaction sampled every hour. Proteolysis was quenched by addition of loading dye, after which samples were boiled, and the reaction products were resolved on 15% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. Reaction products were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. For mass spectrometry, proteolytic fragments were excised from an SDS-PAGE gel and sent to the Ohio State University Campus Chemical Instrument Center for MALDI-TOF analysis. The conformational changes in ETS1Δ280 induced by DNA were monitored by CD spectroscopy. Spectra were recorded at 22 °C from 300 to 190 nm using a JASCO-715 in a 0.4-cm-path length cuvette. Data were collected every 0.1 nm, averaged over 10 scans, and corrected for baseline. The spectra of 13.5 μm protein or a mixture of 13.5 μm protein and equimolar amounts of double-stranded MMP3 WT or M1 DNA dissolved in 1× PBS (3.8 mm NaH2PO4 plus 16.2 mm Na2H2PO4) and 500 mm NaCl buffer were recorded. Prior to CD measurements protein, and DNA were equilibrated, either separately or together, in buffer at 4 °C for 20 min. Spectra were converted to molar ellipticity and plotted. To begin analyzing the effect of DNA sequence, oligomeric state, and autoinhibition on ETS1 DNA binding affinity, we determined the affinity of this protein for the ETS1 homodimer binding site from the promoter of the DNA damage sensing protein p53 and for the wild type and mutants of the binding site in the promoter for MMP3 (stromelysin-1) an extracellular matrix remodeling metalloprotease. The MMP3 and p53 promoters each contain two head to head EBSs (see Table 1 for sequences). The sequences of the two core EBS in each of these promoters are identical, but the sequences flanking these regions differ between them. Unless otherwise noted, for all assays described below, we used ETS1Δ280, which bears a deletion of the N-terminal PNT and transactivation domains present in full-length ETS1. These domains do not contribute to DNA binding, dimerization, or autoinhibition (15Garvie C.W. Pufall M.A. Graves B.J. Wolberger C.

We find that when increasing concentrations of ETS1Δ280 are added to radiolabeled DNA containing either the MMP3 or p53 EBS, ETS1Δ280 forms a single complex with each DNA. The complexes formed on these DNAs are larger than those formed when MMP3 is bound by ETS1-p42, a splice variant previously reported to only bind as a monomer. ETS1-p42 does not bind to the p53 site (data not shown) (19Lionneton F. Lelièvre E. Baillat D. Stehelin D. Soncin F. Characterization and functional analysis of the p42Ets-1 variant of the mouse Ets-1 transcription factor.Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9156-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that ETS1-DNA complexes formed with these DNAs each contain two ETS1 molecules (Fig. 1, A and C). Consistent with the suggestion that the identity of the bases that flank the EBS core consensus sequence are important in determining ETS1 DNA affinity, we find that despite having identical core sequences, the dissociation constants (KD) of the complexes between ETS1Δ280 and MMP3 or p53 differ by 30-fold (Table 1). Mutating either EBS in the MMP3 promoter site prevents ETS1Δ280 from forming a specific protein-DNA complex that is detectable by EMSA, even though each of these sites (MMP3 M1 and MMP3 M2) still contains an intact EBS (Fig. 1B). This result is consistent with previous findings showing that ETS1Δ280 DNA binding to MMP3 DNA requires the core consensus sequence of both of the two head to head EBS sites be intact (20Leprivier G. Baillat D. Begue A. Hartmann B. Aumercier M. Ets-1 p51 and p42 isoforms differentially modulate Stromelysin-1 promoter according to induced DNA bend orientation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4341-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that two ETS1 monomers bind cooperatively to these two EBSs. Consistent with this idea, ETS1 is also incapable of forming an EMSA-detectable complex with an MMP3 variant in which the two intact core consensus sequences are separated by an additional four bases (MMP3 + 4) (1Baillat D. Bègue A. Stéhelin D. Aumercier M. ETS-1 transcription factor binds cooperatively to the palindromic head to head ETS-binding sites of the stromelysin-1 promoter by counteracting autoinhibition.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29386-29398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In light of the ability of other ETS family members (21Poon G.M. DNA binding regulates the self-association of the ETS domain of PU.1 in a sequence-dependent manner.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 4096-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the ETS1 splice variant (ETS1-p42) to bind to a single EBS and the ability of ETS1-p51 to bind single EBSs in partnership with heterologous proteins, we find the inability of ETS1Δ280 to form EMSA-detectable complexes with the MMP3 M1, M2, and +4 variant sites somewhat surprising. Considering that rapid dissociation during electrophoresis can prevent detection of protein-DNA complexes by EMSA (22Hellman L.M. Fried M.G. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) for detecting protein-nucleic acid interactions.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1849-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that ETS1 forms weak and/or transient complexes with these DNAs. To test this idea, we examined ETS1-DNA complex formation using DNase I footprinting. Adding ETS1Δ280 to wild type MMP3 completely protects both EBS core sequences from digestion by DNase I (Fig. 2A). In addition to the ETS1-mediated protections, we find that the presence of DNA-bound ETS1Δ280 enhances DNase I cleavage at A/T base pairs located six residues upstream and downstream of each of the two EBS regions. A footprint of the p53 binding site showed similar pattern of protection and enhancements (Fig. 2C). In both cases, ETS1-mediated protection and enhancements at both EBSs in both p53 and MMP3 DNA sites arose simultaneously. These findings are consistent with the idea that two ETS1 molecules bind cooperatively to each of these DNA sites, with one monomer associated with each of the two head to head EBS present on these DNAs. Added ETS1Δ280 is unable to protect either the mutated or wild type EBS core sequences in the MMP3 M1 site from digestion by DNase I (Fig. 2B). However, careful inspection of the footprint patterns reveals that in the presence of ETS1Δ280, regions of enhanced DNase I cleavage are seen in the MMP3 M1 mutant site at positions identical to those seen in the wild type MMP3-ETS1 footprint. Importantly, a nearly identical pattern of protection and enhancement was observed previously (21Poon G.M. DNA binding regulates the self-association of the ETS domain of PU.1 in a sequence-dependent manner.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 4096-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Poon G.M.

Thus, this"

All of them had been in complete remission after receiving at least four cycles of chemotherapy, containing rituximab or not. Consolidation radiation was delivered thereafter in 28 patients while other 43 received clinical observation only. Locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were compared between patients with or without radiotherapy.The 10-year LRFS, DFS, OS and DMFS were 100% and 81.4% (p = 0.028), 91.7% and 77.1% (p = 0.14), 91.7% and 77.8% (p = 0.67), 91.7% and 78.0% (p = 0.42) for patients with or without radiotherapy.Radiotherapy is associated with improved locoregional control of patients with early stage primary gastric DLBCL, who have achieved complete remission following at least four cycles of chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W992378567,"Hantaviruses are important emerging zoonotic pathogens. The current understanding of hantavirus evolution is complicated by the lack of consensus on co-divergence of hantaviruses with their animal hosts. In addition, hantaviruses have long-term associations with their reservoir hosts. Analyzing the relative abundance of dinucleotides may shed new light on hantavirus evolution. We studied the relative abundance of dinucleotides and the evolutionary pressures shaping different hantavirus segments.A total of 118 sequences were analyzed; this includes 51 sequences of the S segment, 43 sequences of the M segment and 23 sequences of the L segment. The relative abundance of dinucleotides, effective codon number (ENC), codon usage biases were analyzed. Standard methods were used to investigate the relative roles of mutational pressure and translational selection on the three hantavirus segments.All three segments of hantaviruses are CpG depleted. Mutational pressure is the predominant evolutionary force leading to CpG depletion among hantaviruses. Interestingly, the S segment of hantaviruses is GpU depleted and in contrast to CpG depletion, the depletion of GpU dinucleotides from the S segment is driven by translational selection. Our findings also suggest that mutational pressure is the primary evolutionary pressure acting on the S and the M segments of hantaviruses. While translational selection plays a key role in shaping the evolution of the L segment. Our findings highlight how different evolutionary pressures may contribute disproportionally to the evolution of the three hantavirus segments. These findings provide new insights on the current understanding of hantavirus evolution.There is a dichotomy among evolutionary pressures shaping a) the relative abundance of different dinucleotides in hantavirus genomes b) the evolution of the three hantavirus segments."
