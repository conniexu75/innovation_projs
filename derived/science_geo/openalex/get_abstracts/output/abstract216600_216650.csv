https://openalex.org/W1548946251,"The enzyme, which was named sucrose phosphorylase, has not been found in plant tissues (4), and thus the mechanism of sucrose synthesis remains obscure. Evidence obtained from tracer experiments led Buchanan et al. (5, 6) to assume that in plants sucrose phosphate is formed from UDPG’ and fructose-l-phosphate. This hypothesis stimulated work which led to the discovery of an enzyme which catalyzes sucrose synthesis according to the following reaction:"

https://openalex.org/W135280128,"It is well known that the hepatic utilization of glucose is impaired in alloxan diabetes, and evidence exists which suggests that in diabetes the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate is impaired (1). It has been suggested that the enzyme hexokinase is less active in the diabetic animal (2). The presence in liver of a specific glucose-6-phosphatase has been dem- onstrated by Swanson (3) and by de Duve and coworkers (4, 5). Pre- sumably this enzyme is responsible for contributing free glucose to the blood from the liver glycogen pool and from other precursors of glucose-6- phosphate. Since the net rate of formation of glucose-6-phosphate depends upon the relative velocities of the hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase reactions, it appeared possible that an increased activity of glucoseS- phosphatase in the liver might be responsible for decreased net utilization of glucose by this tissue, even if the hexokinase reaction were functioning normally. In this paper is presented evidence that there is greatly in- creased activity of glucose-6-phosphatase in the livers of alloxan-diabetic rats, and that this increased activity appears to be related rather specifi- cally to the diabetic state."
https://openalex.org/W1590066322,"Elwyn et al. (1, 2) have demonstrated that the C1 unit formed from serine is of the oxidation level of formaldehyde rather than formate. They compared the dilution of the Cl4 and deuterium of 2 ,3-deuterio-3-C14,N15L-serine that occurred during the conversion of the serine B-carbon to methyl groups in rats. The results indicated that this carbon did not pass through an intermediate, such as formate, which required the loss of 1 of the hydrogen atoms. In consideration of the results of Elwyn et al. and the general implication of the cit,rovorum factor, 5-formyl-5,6,7 ,&tetrahydrofolic acid, in the metabolism of C1 compounds, Welch and Nichol (3) proposed that the C1 unit formed from serine was a reduced form of citrovorum factor, 5-hydroxymethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid, a hypothetical condensation product of formaldehyde and tetrahydrofolic acid. The formulation of the biosynthesis of serine as a process involving a condensation between the a-carbon of glycine, activated by the Schiff base formation with pyridoxal phosphate (4)) and 5-hydroxymethyl-5,6,7,8tetrahydrofolic acid is reminiscent of the Mannich reaction (5). Serine would be produced by hydrolytic cleavage of the resulting product. The conversion of serine to glycine could occur by the reverse process. The participation of THFA’ as a cofactor in the biosynthesis and cleavage of serine has been studied by adding it to pigeon liver extracts incubated anaerobically with glycine-1-V and L-serine. The assumption underlying this procedure was that the formation and breakdown of serine were catalyzed by a single enzyme. In this case, the ,&carbon atom of the L-serine would provide the C1 unit for the conversion of glycine-l-Cl4 * The results of preliminary experiments in this investigation have been published"
