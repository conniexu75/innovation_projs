https://openalex.org/W2021103771,"The differentiation of floor plate cells and motor neurons can be induced by Sonic hedgehog (SHH), a secreted signaling protein that undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage to generate amino- and carboxy-terminal products. We have found that both floor plate cells and motor neurons are induced by the amino-terminal cleavage product of SHH (SHH-N). The threshold concentration of SHH-N required for motor neuron induction is about 5-fold lower than that required for floor plate induction. Higher concentrations of SHH-N can induce floor plate cells at the expense of motor neuron differentiation. Our results suggest that the induction of floor plate cells and motor neurons by the notochord in vivo is mediated by exposure of neural plate cells to different concentrations of the amino-terminal product of SHH autoproteolytic cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2064352628,"Neurexins are neuronal cell surface proteins with hundreds of isoforms generated by alternative splicing. Here we describe neuroligin 1, a neuronal cell surface protein that is enriched in synaptic plasma membranes and acts as a splice site-specific ligand for beta-neurexins. Neuroligin 1 binds to beta-neurexins only if they lack an insert in the alternatively spliced sequence of the G domain, but not if they contain an insert. The extracellular sequence of neuroligin 1 is composed of a catalytically inactive esterase domain homologous to acetylcholinesterase. In situ hybridization reveals that alternative splicing of neurexins at the site recognized by neuroligin 1 is highly regulated. These findings support a model whereby alternative splicing of neurexins creates a family of cell surface receptors that confers interactive specificity onto their resident neurons."

We found that binding to calnexin, a membrane-bound molecular chaperone, was specific to molecules that possessed monoglucosylated core glycans. In the microsomes, these were generated either by glucose removal from the original triglucosylated core oligosaccharide by glucosidases I and II or by reglucosylation of already unglucosylated high mannose glycans. Release of fully folded HA from calnexin required the removal of the remaining glucose by glucosidase II. The results provided an explanation for trimming and reglucosylation activities in the endoplasmic reticulum and established a direct correlation between glycosylation and folding."
https://openalex.org/W2016385127,"WT1 is a tumor suppressor gene with a key role in urogenital development and the pathogenesis of Wilms' tumor. Two alternative splice sites in the WT1 transcript allow the gene to encode four proteins. These carry four Krüppel-type zinc fingers and to date have primarily been implicated in transcriptional control of genes involved in growth regulation. However, here we demonstrate colocalization of WT1 with splicing factors in the fetal kidney and testis and in expressing cell lines. Using immunoprecipitation, we show that two WT1 isoforms directly associate with one or a limited number of components in the spliceosomes and coiled bodies. Moreover, COS cell expression studies suggest that alternative splicing within the WT1 zinc finger region determines whether the protein localizes mainly with splicing factors or with DNA in transcription factor domains in the nucleus. We propose that WT1 plays roles in posttranscriptional processing of RNA as well as in transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1997572381,"Oskar (osk) protein directs the deployment of nanos (nos), the posterior body-patterning morphogen in Drosophila. To avoid inappropriate activation of nos, osk activity must appear only at the posterior pole of the oocyte, where the osk mRNA becomes localized during oogenesis. Here, we show that translation of osk mRNA is, and must be, repressed prior to its localization; absence of repression allows osk protein to accumulate throughout the oocyte, specifying posterior body patterning throughout the embryo. Translational repression is mediated by an ovarian protein, bruno, that binds specifically to bruno response elements (BREs), present in multiple copies in the osk mRNA 3'UTR. Addition of BREs to a heterologous mRNA renders it sensitive to translational repression in the ovary."
https://openalex.org/W1993531220,"Proteolytic processing of the transforming growth factor β precursor (pro-TGFβ) is an essential step in the formation of the biologically active TGFβ homodimeric protein (TGFβ). The 361-amino-acid precursor pro-TGFβ1 has within its primary structure the R-H-R-R processing signal found in many constitutively secreted precursor proteins and potentially recognized by members of the mammalian convertase family of endoproteases. To determine whether cleavage of pro-TGFβ1 can be achieved by the furin convertase in vitro, purified precursor was incubated in the presence of a truncated/secreted form of the enzyme. Immunoblots showed that the 55-kDa pro-TGFβ1 was converted into the 44 and 12.5 kDa bands corresponding to the pro-region and the mature monomer, respectively. Treatment of pro-TGFβ1 with furin resulted in a 5-fold increase in the production of biologically active TGFβ1. Furthermore, when expressed in the furin-deficient LoVo cells, no processing of pro-TGFβ1 was observed. In contrast, efficient processing was oberved when pro-TGFβ was coexpressed with the furin convertase. Collectively, these results provide evidence that in our experimental systems the TGFβ1 precursor is efficiently and correctly processed by human furin thus permitting release of the biologically active peptide.

Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)1( 1The abbreviations used are: TGFβtransforming growth factor βVVVaccinia virusWTwild typeHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisFURfurinPOMCproopiomelanocortinCHOChinese hamster ovary. ) is a 25-kDa homodimeric protein with potent effects on cell growth and differentiation (for reviews, see Refs. 1Sporn M.B.

Three different isoforms (TGFβ1, TGFβ2, and TGFβ3) with similar bioactivities have been identified in mammalian tissues, TGFβ1 being the most extensively characterized isoform. Several proteins more distantly related to TGFβs such as activins, inhibins, Müllerian inhibitory substance, bone morphogenic proteins, products of the nodal gene in mice as well as products of the decapentaplegic complex of Drosophila and the Vg1 gene from Xenopus laevis appear to play an important role in cellular differentiation (4Kingsley D.M.

It has been shown that most cell types secrete TGFβ1 in an inactive form (9Lawrence D.A. Pircher R. Jullien P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Inactive TGFβ may take multiple forms: for example, the 25-kDa mature TGFβ may be complexed with specific binding proteins such as the TGFβ latency-associated peptide (NH2-terminal part of the precursor sequence) (3Roberts A.B.

Cancer Cells (Cold Spring Harbor). 1985; 3: 65-71Google Scholar) suggest that processing and activation of TGFβ is an important step in the regulation of TGFβ action. The active 25-kDa TGFβ1 molecule consists of two identical disulfide-linked 12.5-kDa polypeptide chains (17Assoian R.K. Komoriya A. Meyers C.A. Miller D.M. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7155-7160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning of the TGFβ1 precursor cDNA and determination of its primary structure revealed that the mature 112-amino-acid chain of TGFβ1 is derived from the COOH terminus of a 390-amino-acid pre-pro-TGFβ1 by proteolytic cleavage (18Derynck R. Jarrett J.A. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4377-4379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This processing event is predicted to occur following an R-H-R-R sequence immediately preceding the NH2-terminal Ala 279 residue of the mature growth factor. This suggests that processing of the growth factor involves an endoprotease which shows cleavage specificity toward pairs of basic amino acids (18Derynck R. Jarrett J.A. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4377-4379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gentry L.E. Webb N.R. Lim G.J. Brunner A.M. Ranchalis J.E. Twardzik D.R. Lioubin M.N. Marquardt H. Purchio A.F. Mol.

Endocrinology. 1989; 3: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Many proteins including polypeptide hormones, viral proteins, growth factors, and receptors are synthesized as large inactive precursor proteins that must be proteolytically processed in order to release the bioactive polypeptide (21Sossin W.S. Fisher J.M. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1409Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The most commonly occurring site of proteolysis is at the carboxyl-terminal side of basic amino acids residues found within the pro-protein (21Sossin W.S. Fisher J.M. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1409Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recently, a family of mammalian processing enzymes called SPCs (subtilisin-like pro-protein convertases) has been characterized (22Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chan S.J. Oliva A.A. La Mendola J. Grens A. Bode H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Up to six members of this family have been identified to date. These are Ca2+-dependent serine proteases that have been shown to cleave mostly at the R-R or K-R pairs of basic amino acids. Furin, the first SPC member to be extensively characterized, has been shown to process many proproteins including pro-β-NGF (24Bresnahan P.A. Leduc R. Thomas L. Thorner J. Gibson H.L. Brake A.J. Barr P.J. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), the insulin receptor (25Robertson B.J. Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. J. Biol.

Nature. 1992; 360: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) among others. Expression of the fur gene, which encodes furin, appears to be ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and cell types examined to date (24Bresnahan P.A. Leduc R. Thomas L. Thorner J. Gibson H.L. Brake A.J. Barr P.J. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 27Barr P.J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12120-12130Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Colocalization with TGN 38 and failure to redistribute to the endoplasmic reticulum in the presence of brefeldin A suggest that furin is mostly localized in the trans-Golgi network (24Bresnahan P.A. Leduc R. Thomas L. Thorner J. Gibson H.L. Brake A.J. Barr P.J. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 29Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Van Slyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity studies have revealed that furin requires a R- X-X-R motif for cleavage while the R- X-K/R-R sequence provides an optimum processing site (30Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon inspection of the amino acid sequence of the TGFβ1 precursor, such an optimum furin cleavage motif was revealed immediately upstream of the amino acids constituting the NH2-terminal of the mature TGFβ. Colocalization of TGFβ precursor with mannosidase II and its sensitivity to endoglycosidase H suggest that pro-TGFβ processing occurs in the Golgi complex, the subcellular site of furin location (31Miyazona K. Thyberg J. Heldin C-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5668-5675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the nearly ubiquitous expression of both furin and TGFβ, the correlation between their cellular localization, and the nature of the TGFβ-processing site make furin a good candidate for the physiological processing of TGFβ. Here we provide evidence that furin can efficiently and correctly process pro-TGFβ and that cleavage by this endoprotease occurs at the carboxyl side of the consensus R-H-R-R cleavage motif. Vaccinia virus (VV) strain WR was used in this study. The VV wild type (VV:WT) and the VV recombinant engineered to express a soluble COOH-terminal truncated form of furin (VV:hFUR713t) or full-length furin (VV:FUR) have been previously described (30Molloy S.S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14304-14308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The engineering of VV:POMC has been previously described (33Thomas G. Thorne B.A. Thomas L. Allen R.G. Hruby D.E. Fuller R. Thorner J. Science. 1988; 241: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and VV:TGFβ was prepared as described (34Hruby D.E. Thomas G. Herbert E. Franke C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 124: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) using full-length human TGFβ1 cDNA insert (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATTC)). For furin production, BSC-40 cells were grown to near confluence on 100-mm plates in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Parallel plates were infected with either VV:WT or VV:hFUR713t at an infection multiplicity of 5. At 18-h post-infection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 37°C for 4 h in 2 ml of serum-free medium (MCDB 202; Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of aprotinin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin (0.7 μg/ml), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (170 μg/ml). Media were harvested, centrifuged (12,000 Ꭓ g, 10 min) at 4°C, and the supernatants were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon-30 filtration units and kept on ice until used. LoVo cells (obtained from ATCC) were grown to near confluence on 100-mm plates in Ham's F12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cultures were infected as described previously (35Benjannet S.

Fluorometric assay on the boc RVRR-aminomethylcoumarin substrate (380-nm excitation, 460-nm emission) was performed as described previously (30Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that can release 1 pmol of aminomethylcoumarin from the substrate in 1 h. TGFβ1 precursor from CHO cells transfected with simian TGFβ1 cDNA (19Gentry L.E. Webb N.R. Lim G.J. Brunner A.M. Ranchalis J.E. Twardzik D.R. Lioubin M.N. Marquardt H. Purchio A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3418-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was purified from a confluent roller bottle collected for 48 h containing 50 ml of serum-free media as described (37Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and then dialyzed versus two changes of 0.2 M acetic acid and one change of 4 mM HCl. The acidified TGFβ1 media was lyophilized, redissolved in 2 ml of 40% acetonitrile-water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and fractionated on an HPLC gel filtration column, SEC-250 (Bio-Rad). The pro-TGFβ1 was collected (37Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and purified by HPLC chromatography on a C-18 column with a gradient of water, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and propanol, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, and the precursor appeared at 23% propanol, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. In some cases, the monomeric pro-TGFβ1 was purified on reducing SDS-PAGE gels. Five μl of pro-TGFβ1 purified as described above was incubated in the presence of 27 μl of VV:WT-derived conditioned medium or VV:hFUR713t-derived conditioned medium (3-5 units of furin as defined above) in 8 μl of 5 Ꭓ reaction buffer (500 mM HEPES, 0.50% Triton X-100, and 5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol pH 7.5) at 30°C for 3 h. For inhibition experiments, EDTA was added to the reaction mixture at a final concentration of 5 mM and the decanoyl-arginine-valine-lysine-arginine-chloromethylketone (decanoyl-RVKR-cmk) was dissolved in water at 1 mM and 0.2 μl (5 uM final) was added 30 min before the addition of pro-TGFβ1. The reaction mixture was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Separated proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, blocked, and probed overnight with peptide antiserum that are specific for NH2-terminal (1:200 dilution) sequence, COOH-terminal sequence (1:200 dilution) or the whole precursor polypeptide (1:800 dilution). The antibodies have been characterized previously (19Gentry L.E. Webb N.R. Lim G.J. Brunner A.M. Ranchalis J.E. Twardzik D.R. Lioubin M.N. Marquardt H. Purchio A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3418-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The membranes were then washed and incubated for 1 h with either horseradish peroxydase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:2500) and immunoreactive bands revealed using the ECL detection system (Amersham) or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) and developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate reagent (Bio-Rad). Growth inhibition assays were performed with Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells (CCL-64; ATCC) essentially as originally described by Tucker et al.(38Tucker R.F. Shipley G.D. Moses H.L. Holley R.W. Science. 1984; 226: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In brief, CCL64 cells were plated in 96-well flat bottom plates at 2500 cells/well. After 24 h, the medium was removed and serial dilutions of the samples to assay for TGFβ activity were added. After 72 h incubation, the cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine. Cells were collected and radioactivity counted in a liquid scintillation counter. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of TGFβ required to give 50% maximal response in the assay. The 55 kDa band corresponding to monomeric TGFβ1 precursor was excised from preparative 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels accordingly to the position of prestained molecular mass markers. The bands were sliced and eluted from gels 4 h in 250 μl of enzymatic reaction buffer, concentrated by ultrafiltration using Microcon-30 filtration units, and diluted in enzymatic digestion buffer. Pro-TGFβ cleavage was achieved as described above. The cleavage products were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE gels, electrotransferred onto Immobilon P membranes, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The 12.5 kDa band corresponding to the mature form of TGFβ was excised and subjected to automated Edman degradation in a PSQ-1 gas-phase sequencer. To determine whether cleavage of the TGFβ1 precursor can be mediated by furin, we initially used in vitro enzymatic digestions. As a source of pro-TGFβ, supernatants from CHO cells expressing the simian pre-pro-TGFβ1 sequence were used (39Sharples K. Plowman G.D. Rose T.M. Twardzik D.R. Purchio A.F. DNA. 1987; 6: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Purification of these supernatants was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The simian type 1 TGFβ cDNA encodes the entire growth factor precursor and displays a high sequence homology to its human counterpart (39Sharples K. Plowman G.D. Rose T.M. Twardzik D.R. Purchio A.F. DNA. 1987; 6: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Derynck R. Jarrett J.A. Chen E.Y. Eaton D.H. Bell J.R. Assoian R.K. Roberts A.B. Spron M.B. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1985; 316: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). TGFβ-transfected CHO cells have been shown to secrete two molecular forms of TGFβ1 proteins (100-110 and 25 kDa) as determined by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (19Gentry L.E. Webb N.R. Lim G.J. Brunner A.M. Ranchalis J.E. Twardzik D.R. Lioubin M.N. Marquardt H. Purchio A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3418-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Upon electrophoresis under reducing conditions, followed by gel staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the corresponding monomers were found: a 55 kDa band (pro-TGFβ1), a 44 kDa band (pro-region), and a mature 12.5-kDa TGFβ1 monomer (Fig. 1 B). Because of the glycosylation of the precursor sequence (41Brunner A.M. Marquard A.R. Malacko A.R. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 264: 13660-13664Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), the 55 and 44 kDa bands appear as broad, stained regions. In contrast, the mature TGFβ polypeptide that does not contain glycosylation sites is detected as a sharp, discrete band. Evidence that the 55, 44, and 12.5 kDa in Fig. 1 B represent the regions of the TGFβ precursor depicted in Fig. 1A has been presented previously (19Gentry L.E. Webb N.R. Lim G.J. Brunner A.M. Ranchalis J.E. Twardzik D.R. Lioubin M.N. Marquardt H. Purchio A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3418-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Note that as previously reported (37Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), current procedures used to purify the intact 55-kDa pro-TGFβ to homogeneity also resulted in the recovery of the 44- and 12.5-kDa species due to reassociation of the pro-region with the mature polypeptide. Further attempts to fractionate this TGFβ complex into separate components were unsuccessful (37Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Therefore, our precursor preparation contains detectable amounts of the pro-region and the mature polypeptide. As a source of human furin, supernatants from BSC-40 cells infected with recombinant VV containing cDNA encoding the soluble secreted form of human furin (VV:hFUR713t) was used. Furin-containing supernatants were compared in our assays with supernatants from VV:WT. We were unable to detect furin-like activity from VV:WT supernatants using the fluorogenic substrate boc RVRR-aminomethylcoumarin. Following treatment with furin, the pro-TGFβ1 preparation was analyzed using immunobloting techniques. Sequence-specific antibodies as indicated in Fig. 1A were used to detect changes in immunoreactive polypeptides after digestion with furin. As shown in Fig. 2, lane 2, the overall intensity of the 55 kDa band was diminished, and the 44 kDa band was intensified as detected with an NH2-terminal-specific antiserum. This shift was not observed using supernatant from wild type VV-infected BSC-40 cells (Fig. 2, lane 3). A similar immunoblot probed with the COOH-terminal TGFβ1-specific antiserum indicated that after furin treatment, a 12.5 kDa band was intensified (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 1). This band has the same migration pattern as pure recombinant TGFβ1 (data not shown). In a time course study, subtle intensification of the 44 and 12.5 kDa bands was observed after a 1-h digestion with a maximal effect seen at 3 h as revealed with antibodies against the whole precursor (data not shown). Therefore, furin is able to process the TGFβ1 precursor yielding the corresponding 44-kDa pro-region and 12.5-kDa-TGFβ-related cleavage products as detected under reducing conditions. Interestingly, prolonged digestion of pro-TGFβ1 with furin or increasing concentrations of furin (data not shown) did not yield any intermediates which may have occurred following processing of pairs of basic amino acids found within the pro-TGFβ 1 molecule (39Sharples K. Plowman G.D. Rose T.M. Twardzik D.R. Purchio A.F. DNA. 1987; 6: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Derynck R. Jarrett J.A. Chen E.Y. Eaton D.H. Bell J.R. Assoian R.K. Roberts A.B. Spron M.B. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1985; 316: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). This provides evidence for the specificity of the in vitro cleavage of pro-TGFβ1 by furin. Peptidyl chloroalkylketones with peptide moieties that mimic the furin cleavage site have been shown to be specific inhibitors of furin enzymatic activity (26Hallenberger S. Bosch V. Angliker H. Shaw Klenk H.-D. Garten W. Nature. 1992; 360: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows the inhibitory properties of the water-soluble decanoyl-RVKR-cmk on furin-mediated cleavage of TGFβ1 precursor. Densitometric measurement of the 44 and 12.5 kDa band indicated that 5 μM of dec-RVKR-cmk blocked furin-mediated conversion of the 55-kDa TGFβ precursor into the corresponding 12.5- and 44-kDa cleavage products. In fact, the intensity of the bands corresponding to pro-TGFβ cleavage products (44- and 12.5-kDa species) was similar to background level (due to 44 and 12.5-kDa species found in the initial pro-TGFβ1 preparation used; see Fig. 1B). Similar inhibition was observed using 5 mM EDTA showing the requirement of calcium for endoproteolytic cleavage of pro-TGFβ by furin (Fig. 3 A). Proteolytic cleavage of TGFβ1 is predicted to occur following a basic Arg-His-Arg-Arg sequence and immediately preceding the NH2-terminal Ala279 residue of the mature growth factor (37Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 39Sharples K. Plowman G.D. Rose T.M. Twardzik D.R. Purchio A.F.

Nature. 1985; 316: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). To specifically localize the site of cleavage by furin, the purified 12.5-kDa proteolytic fragment was subjected to NH2-terminal sequence analysis. The resulting sequence Ala-Leu-Asp- X-Asn was consistent with the predicted NH2-terminal sequence of mature simian TGFβ1 and indicates that cleavage by furin occurs carboxyl to the consensus Arg-His-Arg-Arg furin cleavage motif. We next asked whether in vitro proteolytic cleavage of pro-TGFβ1 by furin would release bioactive TGFβ1. For this purpose, a rapid and sensitive growth inhibition assay using CCL-64 mink lung epithelial cells was used (38Tucker R.F. Shipley G.D. Moses H.L. Holley R.W. Science. 1984; 226: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Pro-TGFβ1 incubated with supernatants from either VV:hFUR713t- or VV:WT-infected BSC-40 cells was assayed for biological activity. Fig. 4 demonstrates that treatment of pro-TGFβ1 with furin results in a 5-fold increase in bioactive TGFβ with 213 μg/ml of TGFβ detected compared to 42 μg/ml in control supernatant (pro-TGFβ1 treated with supernatant from VV:WT-infected BSC-40 cells). These results indicate that processing of pro-TGFβ1 by furin results in the production of biologically active TGFβ and that furin processed pro-TGFβ at a physiologically relevant cleavage site. To assess the ability of furin to cleave TGFβ precursor in cells, coinfection experiments were performed, and the products of expression were analyzed by electrophoresis of concentrated supernatants on reducing SDS-PAGE gels followed by immunoblotting. For this experiment, we used the furin-deficient LoVo cells (42Takahashi S. Kasai K. Hatsuzawa K. Katamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 43Komada M. Hatsuzawa K. Shibamoto S. Ito F. Nakayama K. Kitamura N. FEBSLett. 1993; 328: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2, the 55-kDa TGFβ1 precursor band was not observed in mock infected LoVo cells or cells infected with control recombinant vaccinia (VV:POMC). LoVo cells coinfected with TGFβ-expressing vaccinia recombinant (VV:TGFβ) and a control vaccinia recombinant (VV:POMC) failed to cleave TGFβ1 precursor (Fig. 5, lane 3) as shown by the detection of the 55 kDa precursor band only. Using the CCL-64 bioassay with a sensitivity of 50 pg/ml, we did not detect any bioactive TGFβ from these supernatants. This indicates that the 55-kDa pro-TGFβ has very little or lacks bioactivity (Table I). However, coinfection with VV:TGFβ and VV:FuR resulted in a loss of immunoreactive 55 kDa precursor band with the concomitant appearance of the 44-kDa pro-region as detected with the NH2-terminal-specific antibody (Fig. 5, lane 4). Reprobing of the same blot with the COOH-terminal-specific antisera indicate that the observed detection of the 44-kDa species corroborated with the detection of the 12.5-kDa polypeptide. No other species than the intact pro-region (44 kDa) and the mature polypeptide (12.5 kDa) was observed even when the immunoblots were overexposed (data not shown). Measure of the biological activity of the (VV:TGFβ/VV:FUR) supernatants revealed large amounts of bioactive TGFβ (20, 385 pg/ml; Table I).Table IMeasure of bioactive TGFβ in supernatants of LoVo cells coinfected with recombinant vaccinia Open table in a new tab A series of cellular events take place during TGFβ processing.

https://openalex.org/W2072159023,A long-range signal encoded by the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene has been implicated as the ventral patterning influence from the notochord that induces sclerotome and represses dermomyotome in somite differentiation. Long-range effects of hedgehog (hh) signaling have been suggested to result either from local induction of a secondary diffusible signal or from the direct action of the highly diffusible carboxy-terminal product of HH autoproteolytic cleavage. Here we provide evidence that the long-range somite patterning effects of SHH are instead mediated by a direct action of the amino-terminal cleavage product. We also show that pharmacological manipulations to increase the activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A can selectively antagonize the effects of the amino-terminal cleavage product. Our results support the operation of a single evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway for both local and direct long-range inductive actions of HH family members.

Two conserved classes, designated class I and class II, are localized to the cytosol. Recombinant HSP18.1 and HSP17.7, representing class I and class II proteins from pea, respectively, were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy demonstrated that the purified proteins formed discretely sized, high molecular weight complexes. Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that the HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 complexes were composed of approximately 12 subunits. Both proteins were able to enhance the refolding of chemically denatured citrate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase at stoichiometric levels in an ATP-independent manner. Furthermore, HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 prevented aggregation of citrate synthase at 45°C and irreversible inactivation of citrate synthase at 38°C. HSP18.1 also suppressed aggregation of lactate dehydrogenase at 55°C. These findings demonstrate that HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 can function as molecular chaperones in vitro.

Plants synthesize numerous small heat shock proteins (smHSPs)1( 1The abbreviations used are: smHSPsmall heat shock proteinCScitrate synthaseLDHlactate dehydrogenasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ) ranging in size from 15 to 30 kDa that are related to the evolutionarily conserved family of smHSPs and α-crystallins of the vertebrate eye lens (1Vierling E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 579-620Crossref Scopus (1374) Google Scholar, 2Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 70: 2360-2364Crossref Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In contrast to mammalian smHSPs, plant smHSPs constitute the most abundant and diverse group of proteins synthesized in response to heat stress. For example, more than 25 individual smHSP polypeptides can be observed by two-dimensional PAGE from a variety of heat-stressed plants (3Mansfield M.A. Key J.L. Plant Physiol. 1987; 84: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only one species of smHSP has been identified in human, mouse, and yeast, and each is typically present in the cytosol (4Arrigo A.-P. Landry J. Morimoto R. Tissieres A. Georgeopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1994: 335-373Google Scholar). At least four major classes of plant smHSPs have been identified based on sequence alignments and immunological cross-reactivity; two are found in the cytosol, one is localized to the chloroplast, and another is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (1Vierling E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 579-620Crossref Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Recently, a plant smHSP localized to mitochondria has also been identified (5Lenne C. Douce R.

Little is known about the cellular function of smHSPs, although evidence from mammalian and Drosophila systems supports the theory that smHSPs play a role in thermotolerance (6Rollet E. Lavoie J.N.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that mammalian smHSPs and the related α-crystallins possess molecular chaperone activity in vitro(9Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

More recent data have suggested that mammalian smHSPs may regulate actin filament dynamics (7Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G. Tanguay R.M. Landry J. J. Biol.

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 579-620Crossref Scopus (1374) Google Scholar, 4Arrigo A.-P. Landry J. Morimoto R. Tissieres A. Georgeopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1994: 335-373Google Scholar). The complexes from plant sources are small and uniform, from 200 to 240 kDa (5Lenne C. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1255-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Helm K.W.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but their oligomeric structure appears to be dynamic in response to phosphorylation (20Kato K. Hasegawa K. Goto S. Inaguma Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the actual size of mammalian smHSP complexes has been a matter of controversy. Phosphorylation of plant smHSPs, however, has not been observed (22Nover L. Scharf K.-D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Based on sequence alignments, all plants synthesize two distinct classes of cytosolic smHSPs, designated class I and class II (1Vierling E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 579-620Crossref Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). HSP18.1, a class I protein, and HSP17.7, a class II protein, both from Pisum sativum (pea), share 60% amino acid similarity and 38% identity (15DeRocher A.E. Helm K.W. Lauzon L.M. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These two proteins, with derived molecular masses of 18,086 and 17,732 Da for HSP18.1 and HSP17.7, respectively, are normally absent from vegetative tissues in plants unless induced by heat at temperatures above 30°C (15DeRocher A.E. Helm K.W. Lauzon L.M. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Maximum induction of HSP18.1 occurs at 38°C, during which class I smHSP levels can reach up to 1% of the total protein in roots and somewhat lower levels in leaves (15DeRocher A.E. Helm K.W. Lauzon L.M. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Following heat stress, accumulated HSP18.1 remains stable with a half-life of 38 h (15DeRocher A.E. Helm K.W. Lauzon L.M. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and may therefore function during both heat stress and recovery. HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 share marginal overall sequence homology with mammalian smHSPs. For example, HSP18.1 shares only 25% identity with human HSP27 at the amino acid level (23Plesovsky-Vig N. Vig J. Brambl R. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 35: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, like all smHSPs and α-crystallins, the regions of greatest homology occur in the C-terminal halves of the proteins (23Plesovsky-Vig N. Vig J. Brambl R. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 35: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 expression is not strictly limited to heat stress conditions. Both proteins have been identified in developing embryos at levels roughly equivalent to those observed in moderately heat-stressed tissues (24DeRocher A.E. Vierling E. Plant J. 1994; 5: 93-102Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cytosolic smHSPs have also been shown to be expressed during pollen development (25Bouchard R.A. Genome. 1990; 33: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Dietrich P.S. Bouchard R.A. Casey E.S. Sinibaldi R.M. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1268-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and corresponding mRNAs have been identified in ripening fruit (27Fray R.G. Lycett G.W. Grierson D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). How these other patterns of smHSP expression are related to their presence during and after heat stress is not understood, but developmentally regulated patterns of smHSP expression have also been observed in Drosophila and mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 4Arrigo A.-P. Landry J. Morimoto R. Tissieres A. Georgeopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1994: 335-373Google Scholar). Because of the abundance and diversity of smHSPs in plants, we have been particularly interested in understanding and comparing the structural and functional properties of plant smHSPs. Here, we have characterized recombinant HSP18.1, a class I smHSP, and HSP17.7, a class II smHSP, with regard to oligomeric structure and in vitro molecular chaperone activity. Pig heart citrate synthase, bovine muscle lactate dehydrogenase, bovine liver catalase, bovine IgG, Tris, and HEPES were obtained from Sigma. Ultrapure (NH4)2SO4 and ultrapure urea were obtained from Baker. Ultrapure guanidine hydrochloride was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The Pshsp18.1 and Pshsp17.7 cDNAs (15DeRocher A.E. Helm K.W. Lauzon L.M. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 28Lauzon L. Helm K.W. Vierling E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which encode pea HSP18.1 and HSP17.7, respectively, were subcloned into the expression vector pJC20 (29Clos J. Brandau S. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) as follows. The EcoRI fragment of Pshsp18.1 was end-filled with Klenow fragment and inserted by blunt-end ligation into the BamHI site of pJC20 that had also been end-filled. The SmaI/ApaI fragment of Pshsp17.7 was inserted into the similarly prepared pJC20. To eliminate N-terminal fusion proteins encoded by these pJC20 derivatives, polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis was used to introduce NdeI sites at the translation start sites of the Pshsp18.1 and Pshsp17.7 cDNAs. The PCR products were subcloned into vector pCR using the TA cloning system (Invitrogen). The NdeI/NcoI fragment from the modified Pshsp18.1 cDNA and the NdeI fragment from the modified Pshsp17.7 cDNA were exchanged for the corresponding wild-type fragments in the pJC20 derivatives to yield pAZ316 and pAZ317, respectively. The engineered mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) of the regions derived from the polymerase chain reaction. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pAZ316 or pAZ317 for T7 RNA polymerase-directed expression of the target proteins (31Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were induced with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h and then harvested. Cells were washed with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 (buffer A), broken by sonic lysis, and centrifuged at 17,500 × g for 30 min to yield soluble crude extracts. Crude extracts were then fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The 60-95% (for HSP18.1) and 40-70% (for HSP17.7) ammonium sulfate fractions were dialyzed against 25 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 (buffer B) and separated on 0.2-0.8 M linear sucrose gradients in buffer B for 2 h, 45 min at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman VTi50 rotor. Fractions containing the smHSPs were pooled and applied to a diethylaminoethyl-Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated with buffer B supplemented with 3 M urea. Small HSPs were eluted with a 0-0.2 M NaCl gradient in buffer B supplemented with 3 M urea and then dialyzed extensively against buffer B. SDS-PAGE indicated that the smHSP preparations were at least 95% pure (see Fig. 1). SDS-PAGE was performed using a 12.5% acrylamide gel as described (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Non-denaturing pore exclusion PAGE was performed on a 4-22.5% acrylamide gel according to the method of Helm et al.(15DeRocher A.E. Helm K.W. Lauzon L.M. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Small HSPs were applied to a carbon film, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. The samples were viewed in a Phillips EM410 electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Micrographs were taken at × 55,000 magnification. Molecular weights of HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 complexes were determined at 4°C by sedimentation equilibrium in a Beckman Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics. A Beckman An60Ti rotor was used with six-sector equilibrium centerpieces at speeds ranging from 7,000 to 15,000 rpm. Centrifugation of HSP18.1 was carried out in buffer B, and centrifugation of HSP17.7 was carried out in buffer B supplemented with 50 mM NaCl. All samples were clarified at 40,000 × g before centrifugation. Solvent densities were calculated from buffer and protein composition, respectively, as described by Laue et al.(33Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Multiple data sets of A280 versus radial position were simultaneously fit to the Yphantis equation using a nonlinear least squares fit with the program HID4000 (34Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar). The residuals were examined for aggregation and/or non-ideality. Analysis of the residuals for HSP18.1 indicated a homogenous solution, whereas analysis of the residuals for HSP17.7 indicated aggregation in some of the samples. These HSP17.7 data sets were deleted from the pool, and the remainder of the data sets was reanalyzed, resulting in better residuals. The molecular weights calculated with the edited and unedited data sets were close to each other (less than 5% difference), but the error was smaller with the edited sets. CS or LDH was denatured at a concentration of 1.5 μM in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (for CS) or pH 7.5 (for LDH) for 1.5 h at 25°C. Refolding was initiated by diluting 2.5 μl of denatured CS or LDH into 247.5 μl of rapidly vortexing refolding buffer in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes as described (35Wang Z. Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Srere P.A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The final refolding conditions were 150 nM CS or LDH in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (for CS) or pH 7.5 (for LDH), 20 μM dithiothreitol, 2 mM (NH4)2SO4 carried over from the commercial enzyme stocks, and variable amounts of HSP18.1, HSP17.7, catalase, or lysozyme at 25°C. At the times indicated, 25-μl aliquots were assayed for CS or LDH activity. 150 nM CS or LDH was combined with varying amounts of HSP18.1 or HSP17.7 in 50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5 (total volume, 1 ml) in covered quartz cuvettes at 25°C. Where indicated, catalase or IgG was added at the concentrations indicated. Samples were incubated in a water bath at 45°C (for CS) or 55°C (for LDH) and then monitored for light scattering at 320 nm (36Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 191-223Google Scholar) at the times indicated. 150 nM CS was incubated in the absence or presence of 150 nM HSP18.1, HSP17.7, 32 μg/ml catalase, or 50 μg/ml lysozyme in 50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0 in covered glass tubes (total volume, 0.5 ml) at the indicated temperatures. At various time points 25 μl aliquots were removed and measured for CS activity. All assays were performed at 25°C. CS activity was measured according to the method of Ochoa (37Ochoa S. Biochem. Prep. 1957; 5: 19-21Google Scholar) in which the disappearance of acetyl CoA is monitored by the decrease in absorbance at 233 nm. LDH activity was measured as described (38Kornberg A. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 441-443Crossref Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The concentrations of smHSPs and LDH were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The concentration of CS was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm (39Bloxham D.P. Ericsson L.H. Titani K. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3979-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The concentrations of smHSPs indicated in the text refer to the complexes composed of 12 subunits. Therefore, 150 nM smHSP is equivalent to approximately 32 μg/ml. The concentrations of CS and LDH refer to monomers. Errorbars in figures represent standard errors generated from at least three replicate trials. Recombinant smHSPs were purified from E. coli cells to greater than 95% homogeneity as soluble, high molecular weight complexes (Fig. 1). One liter of cell culture yielded approximately 6-10 mg of purified protein. Analysis of the protein preparations by non-denaturing pore exclusion PAGE indicated that the recombinant proteins, similar to those from heat-stressed pea roots (15DeRocher A.E. Helm K.W. Lauzon L.M. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar),2( 2K. Helm, G. Lee, and E. Vierling, manuscript in preparation. ) migrated exclusively as complexes with apparent molecular masses of 240 and 320 kDa for HSP18.1 and HSP17.7, respectively. Analysis of HSP18.1 by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation yielded a molecular mass of 216,418 ± 6,601 Da, consistent with the apparent molecular size derived from non-denaturing PAGE. This molecular mass corresponds to 11.97 ± 0.37 HSP18.1 subunits, indicating that the native HSP18.1 oligomer consists of 12 subunits. Similar analysis revealed that HSP17.7 had a molecular size of 200,183 ± 8,208 Da, which corresponds to 11.28 ± 0.46 subunits, suggesting that HSP17.7, like HSP18.1, may also be composed of 12 subunits. Since migration of proteins on non-denaturing pore exclusion PAGE is dependent on both size and shape (40Anderson L.O. Borg H. Mikaelsson M. FEBS Lett. 1972; 20: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), it appears that HSP17.7 may differ structurally from HSP18.1 by virtue of shape. Indeed, electron microscopy of negatively stained HSP18.1 complexes at a magnification of 55,000 suggested that HSP18.1 forms uniformly globular particles with approximate diameters of 10 nm (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, similar analysis of HSP17.7 complexes revealed both round and triangular structures (Fig. 2 B), which may represent different orientations of the complexes. In Vitro Function of HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 Both HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 increased the folding yields of CS (homodimer of 50-kDa subunits) and LDH (tetramer of 35-kDa subunits), which had been denatured in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. When 150 nM HSP18.1 or 240 nM HSP17.7 was added to 150 nM denatured CS monomers under conditions that stimulated refolding, greater than 40% (relative to an equivalent amount of non-denatured CS) attained the native state after 60 min (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, only 17% of the CS activity was spontaneously reactivated in the absence of the smHSPs. Although the smHSPs increased the yield of refolded CS, no rate enhancements were observed in their presence. Similar results were obtained when LDH was used as the target protein (Fig. 3 B). As a control, bovine catalase, a protein with a similar native molecular mass and isoelectric point (247 kDa, pI = 5.8) to HSP18.1 (217 kDa, pI = 5.96 (15DeRocher A.E. Helm K.W. Lauzon L.M. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)) was substituted for the smHSPs. Addition of 32 μg/ml catalase, the equivalent weight-to-volume concentration of 150 nM smHSP, resulted in less than 18% reactivation of either CS or LDH, demonstrating that the enhancement in refolding was specific to the smHSPs (see Fig. 5). Adding 50 μg/ml lysozyme or further increasing the concentration of catalase to 128 μg/ml did not increase refolding yields (not shown).Figure 5:ATP or GTP does not affect smHSP-enhanced CS or LDH refolding. CS (A) or LDH (B) was denatured and allowed to refold as described in the legend to Fig. 4. Refolding reactions were carried out in the absence of any additions (Unassisted), in the presence of 32 μg/ml catalase, or in the presence of 150 nM HSP18.1 or HSP17.7, as indicated. Where indicated, reactions included 3 mM ATP or GTP supplemented with 6 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM KCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The refolding of CS and LDH was next examined as a function of the amount of smHSP in the refolding reactions. For both CS and LDH, refolding yields saturated at an smHSP complex-to-CS or -LDH monomer ratio of approximately 1 (Fig. 4). The observed enhancement of refolding by the smHSPs occurred in a nucleotide triphosphate-independent manner; addition of MgATP or MgGTP did not further stimulate refolding yields (Fig. 5). Since HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 are coordinately expressed in various tissues2(24DeRocher A.E. Vierling E. Plant J. 1994; 5: 93-102Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar), a mixture of the two proteins was evaluated for its ability to refold chemically denatured LDH. The amount of LDH reactivation observed for a mixture of 30 nM HSP18.1 plus 30 nM HSP17.7 was approximately equal to that observed in the presence of 60 nM (nonsaturating amounts according to Fig. 4) of either species alone (Fig. 6). These results suggest that HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 function independently of one another rather than synergistically in these assays. When heated to 45°C, CS began to form insoluble aggregates that could be detected by light scattering (Fig. 7). Aggregation, however, could be reduced in the presence of the smHSPs and was completely suppressed at an HSP18.1-to-CS ratio of 0.5 (Fig. 7 A). Catalase added to CS at a concentration of 32 μg/ml had no protective effect; nor did 50 μg/ml lysozyme (not shown). HSP17.7 also prevented CS thermal aggregation but was less effective than HSP18.1; only 65% of CS scattering could be prevented upon addition of HSP17.7 at an HSP17.7-to-CS ratio of 1.6 (Fig. 7 B). Beyond this, increasing amounts of HSP17.7 had no further protective effect. Under these conditions, neither HSP18.1 nor HSP17.7 alone gave rise to any detectable light scattering (not shown). Light scattering by LDH could not be detected at 45°C but was observed when the temperature was increased to 55°C. At this higher temperature HSP18.1 was less effective against LDH aggregation as compared with CS aggregation at 45°C (Fig. 8). At a concentration of 150 nM LDH monomers, the protective effect of HSP18.1 saturated at a concentration of 600 nM HSP18.1 complex. However, addition of 128 μg/ml bovine IgG or lysozyme (not shown), both of which are stable at 55°C, had no protective effect, suggesting the level of protection by HSP18.1 was significant. HSP17.7 aggregated itself at 55°C, thereby preventing further analysis (not shown). When CS was incubated at 38°C alone or in the presence of 32 μg/ml catalase, less than 5% of the original CS activity remained after 60 min (Fig. 9). Upon temperature shift of the samples to 22°C, less than 15% of the original CS activity remained after 60 min in the presence or absence of 32 μg/ml catalase. Similar results were obtained when 50 μg/ml lysozyme was substituted for catalase (not shown). In contrast, when CS was treated similarly but in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of HSP18.1 or HSP17.7, CS activity was minimally protected at 38°C, but approximately 65-70% of the original activity was subsequently regained after 60 min at 22°C. However, the thermal protective effect of the smHSPs was only observed if the smHSPs were present during the initial high temperature incubation; addition of smHSPs at the time of temperature shift to 22°C did not result in CS reactivation (Fig. 9). Although smHSPs protected CS against irreversible inactivation at 38°C, essentially no protection of activity was observed at 45°C in the presence of either HSP18.1 or HSP17.7 (Fig. 10) despite the fact that HSP18.1 efficiently suppressed CS aggregation at this temperature (Fig. 7). Furthermore, in the presence or absence of the smHSPs, no CS reactivation could be detected after shifting the samples from 45 to 22°C (not shown). From this and other recent studies of a variety of plant smHSPs, it appears that smHSPs from plant sources generally form oligomeric complexes ranging in size from 200 to 240 kDa (4Arrigo A.-P. Landry J. Morimoto R. Tissieres A. Georgeopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1994: 335-373Google Scholar, 15DeRocher A.E.

Here, we have characterized two representatives of plant cytosolic smHSPs from P. sativum, HSP18.1 and HSP17.7. Both behave solely as oligomers composed of 12 subunits. Since most other plant smHSPs have native molecular sizes similar to those of HSP18.1 and HSP17.7, as judged by non-denaturing PAGE, it is likely that other plant smHSPs are also composed of 12 subunits. A structural model consisting of an inner core of 12 subunits has been previously proposed for α-crystallin high molecular weight complexes (41Tardieu A. Laporte D. Licinio P. Krop B. Delaye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, smHSP complexes from mammalian sources have been found to exist in larger, more dynamic complexes. For example, the murine smHSP, HSP25, has been characterized as a 32-mer with a native molecular mass of 730 kDa (19Behlke J. Lutsch G. Gaestel M. Bielka H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the subunit composition of mammalian smHSPs can be highly variable in response to phosphorylation state (20Kato K. Hasegawa K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11274-11278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Benndorf R. Hayeβ K. Ryazantsev S. Wieske M. Behlke J. Lutsch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the control of smHSP oligomerization may regulate their interaction with actin (21Benndorf R. Hayeβ K. Ryazantsev S. Wieske M. Behlke J. Lutsch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At present however, phosphorylation of plant small HSPs has not been detected (22Nover L. Scharf K.-D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and the recognition sites for phosphorylation observed in mammalian smHSPs (41Tardieu A. Laporte D. Licinio P. Krop B. Delaye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 42Gaestel M. Schroder W. Benndorf R. Lippmann C. Buchner K. Hucho F. Erdmann V.A. Bielka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14721-14724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have not been conserved in plant smHSPs (23Plesovsky-Vig N. Vig J. Brambl R. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 35: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 share common features such as 60% amino acid similarity (15DeRocher A.E. Helm K.W. Lauzon L.M. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), similar subunit size, and native molecular weight as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation, their different mobilities on non-denaturing pore exclusion PAGE suggest that other structural differences may distinguish class I and class II smHSPs. While the relative migration of HSP18.1 (compared to globular standards) was consistent with that predicted by analytical ultracentrifugation, the migration of HSP17.7 was inconsistent. Based on these findings, it is likely that the shape of the HSP17.7 complex deviates from a globular structure. This observation would be consistent with the triangular structures seen exclusively in HSP17.7 preparations by electron microscopy. Such a large structural difference between HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 may account for the fact that mixed complexes between the two species are not observed in vivo and will not form in vitro.2 Indicative of a molecular chaperone function for HSP18.1 and HSP17.7, both proteins were able to influence the folding and aggregation properties of model substrates during several in vitro assays. As has been previously reported for mammalian smHSPs and α-crystallins (9Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 11Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), refolding of chemically denatured proteins could be enhanced with the addition of stoichiometric levels of HSP18.1 or HSP17.7 in an ATP-independent manner. Whereas murine HSP25 maximally enhanced the refolding of chemically denatured CS at an HSP25 complex-to-CS monomer ratio of 1:3, the enhancement by the plant smHSPs tested here saturated at a ratio of approximately 1:1. Since the native molecular mass of HSP25 has been estimated at 730 kDa and those for HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 have been estimated between 200 and 216 kDa, the plant smHSPs appear to be as efficient as the mammalian smHSPs on a per weight basis. An additional consideration is that in the present study, we have utilized 6 M guanidine HCl as the protein denaturant, as opposed to 8 M urea, based on the finding that 8 M urea is insufficient to produce CS monomers (43Landry J. Lambert H. Zhou M. Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 794-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a precise stoichiometric comparison between the previous and the present study may be difficult based on the different oligomerization and folding states adopted by CS after guanidine versus urea denaturation. Nonetheless, it appears that the functional properties among plant and mammalian smHSPs have been conserved despite the fact the two groups share only limited overall sequence homology. The ability of HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 to prevent thermal aggregation of model substrates provides further support for their putative role in thermotolerance. Complete suppression of CS aggregation by HSP18.1 at 45°C was observed at an HSP18.1 complex-to-CS monomer ratio of 0.5:1, although HSP17.7 was far less efficient. By comparison, similar, maximal protection by murine HSP25 was observed at a ratio of 0.67:1 (11Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since under these conditions CS dimers would be expected to prevail, the true complex-to-substrate stoichiometry would be approximately 1:1 for both HSP18.1 and HSP25. Less efficient protection by HSP18.1 or lack of protection by HSP17.7 imparted to LDH at 55°C suggests that this temperature may exceed the functional temperature range for these smHSPs. However, the temperatures necessary to induce insolubilization of CS (45°C) and LDH (55°C) exceed the temperature of maximum smHSP synthesis in plants (15DeRocher A.E. Helm K.W. Lauzon L.M. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) as well as the heat stress temperatures generally experienced by plants under field conditions (44Hernandez L. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We sought to evaluate the protective effects of HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 at 38°C, the temperature at which these smHSPs are maximally induced (15DeRocher A.E. Helm K.W. Lauzon L.M. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). By employing a more physiologically relevant elevated temperature of 38°C followed by a return to 22°C, we found that both HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 displayed similar behavior in protecting CS from irreversible heat inactivation. The predominant effect of the smHSPs was to increase the potential of heat-inactivated CS to properly refold at the permissive temperature of 22°C. These findings suggest that in vivo the presence of HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 may have important consequences during both heat stress and recovery and are consistent with the observation that HSP18.1 and other smHSPs remain abundant in tissues during and after heat stress (15DeRocher A.E. Helm K.W. Lauzon L.M. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The fact that the protective effects of the smHSPs could only be observed if the smHSPs were present during the 38°C incubation indicates that the smHSPs must be present during the time of thermal denaturation when irreversible misfolding and/or aggregation are most likely to occur. These findings are similar to those described for heat-inactivated firefly luciferase, which can be subsequently reactivated by incubation at room temperature in the presence of the chaperones DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE (45Schroeder H. Langer T. Hartl F.-U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). At minimum, the presence of DnaJ is required during thermal inactivation to prevent aggregation of luciferase, whereas reactivation requires the addition of DnaK and GrpE. Unlike the HSP60, HSP70, and TriC classes of molecular chaperones (12Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar), the in vitro smHSP functional cycle does not require ATP or other factors that regulate the release of substrates bound to the chaperone. Thus, it is probable that smHSPs recognize non-native substrates but bind them reversibly. By this mechanism, smHSPs may lower the effective concentration of free, unfolded intermediates and reduce off-pathway processes such as aggregation or misfolding. Pools of free substrates could then spontaneously refold under permissive conditions. This relatively passive mechanism, which requires neither an energy source nor coordination with other proteins, may explain why refolding of chemically denatured CS is relatively less efficient in the presence of the smHSPs than in the presence of GroEL, GroES, and ATP. For example, up to 80% CS reactivation has been observed in the presence of saturating amounts (6-fold molar excess) of the GroE system (35Wang Z. Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Srere P.A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), compared with 45% in the presence of saturating (stoichiometric) amounts of smHSPs. However, it is highly unlikely that the enhancements in refolding of chemically denatured CS or LDH observed in the present study resulted from nonspecific solute effects since excesses of the control proteins catalase or lysozyme did not stimulate refolding. These results imply that the smHSPs were not simply reducing the number of molecular collisions between aggregation-prone folding intermediates. The failure of the smHSPs to facilitate reactivation of CS incubated at 45°C may be indicative of irreversible CS misfolding that cannot be prevented even by association with the smHSPs at this higher temperature. Under such conditions, however, smHSP-promoted solubilization of permanently damaged proteins, like that observed with CS in the presence of HSP18.1, may facilitate degradation by proteolytic systems. Such a role has been proposed for other molecular chaperones (46Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 27: 437-496Crossref Scopus (1850) Google Scholar, 47Kandror O. Busconi L. Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vivo function of HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 is not understood at present; nor have any endogenous substrates of these smHSPs been identified. The present study suggests that both HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 can recognize and interact with different foreign proteins that possess non-native structures as the common feature. In this light, HSP18.1 and HSP17.7 may function as nonspecific chaperones. However, in vivo, more specific protein-protein interactions may occur and may be highly specific for either class I or class II proteins. Such specialization may account for the strong evolutionary conservation of these two classes of cytosolic smHSPs in higher plants.

This synaptic terminal protein was first identified by cloning the gene from a rat brain cDNA library (27Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H.

Recently, several isoforms with different tissue and cellular distribution were isolated; in particular syntaxin 1A and 1B are specifically localized in the nervous tissue, while syntaxin 2, 3, 4, and 5 are broadly expressed (27Bennett M.K.

Here we show that BoNT/C is a zinc-dependent proteinase containing two zinc atoms and we identify the peptide bond of syntaxin specifically hydrolyzed by this novel metalloproteinase, as well as its specificity for the known syntaxin isoforms. Exponentially grown Clostridium botulinum type C (strain NCTC 8264) bacteria were harvested by tangential flow filtration, washed with ice-cold 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and finally recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 ~ g for 20 min. Cells were extracted with 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, for 16 h at 4 C and then protease-free ribonuclease A (Sigma) was added (final concentration: 0.1 mg/ml). The suspension was further incubated for 2 h at 37°C and, after centrifugation at 25,000 ~ g, the supernatant was precipitated with 60% of (NH4)2SO4. After stirring for 30 min at 25°C, the precipitated toxin was collected by centrifugation at 25,000 ~ g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mM triethanolamine, pH 8.0, and dialyzed extensively against the same buffer at 4°C. The clarified BoNT/C solution was loaded onto a Q Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 50 mM triethanolamine, pH 8.0, and eluted with the latter buffer containing 100 mM NaCl. BoNT/C was further purified with a Mono S column (Pharmacia), followed, when necessary, by a Mono Q (Pharmacia) step. Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography was used to remove traces of contaminant proteases (30Rossetto O. Schiavo G. Polverino de Laureto P. Fabbiani S. Montecucco C. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Captopril ([2 S]-1-[3-mercapto-2-methyl-propionyl]-L-proline) was from Squibb (Italy). Dimyristoylglycerophosphocholine, dimyristoylglycerophosphoethanolamine, dimyristoylglycerophosphoserine, dimyristoylglycerophosphate, dimyristoylglycerophosphoinositol, and cholesterol were from Sigma). Bovine brain mixed gangliosides were kindly provided by Dr. G. Kirschner (FIDIA Research Laboratories, Abano Terme, Italy). Their composition and that of soybean mixed lipids (asolectin) were as described previously (31Schiavo G. Demel R. Montecucco C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Liposomes were obtained by mixing chloroform/methanol (2:1) stock solutions of lipids. After drying under N2 flux, lipids were resuspended in diethyl ether, dried, and sonicated until optical clarity was achieved at the concentration of 5 mg/ml in 10 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. Synaptosomes, synaptic membrane fraction (LP1) and small synaptic vesicles were isolated from rat cerebral cortex (13Schiavo G. Rossetto O. Catsicas S. Polverino de Laureto P. DasGupta B.R.

Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), were centrifuged in an SS34 Sorvall rotor at 16,500 rpm for 20 min and the pellet was resuspended in 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, at a 2.5-4.4 mg/ml protein concentration. Small synaptic vesicles were prepared omitting the glass bead chromatography step (32Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), resuspended in the same buffer as LP1 at a 1.5-2.2 mg/ml protein concentration, and used thereafter for addition of 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μg/ml pepstatin (Sigma). Recombinant glutathione S-methyltransferase syntaxin 1A or 1B fusion proteins (GST-Syn 1A or GST-Syn 1B) were obtained by inserting codons 4-288 of syntaxin 1A and codons 3-288 of syntaxin 1B cDNAs into the vector pGEX-KG (33Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) and transformation into the AB1899 strain of Escherichia coli. GST-fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on GSH-agarose matrix (Sigma) and the recombinant portion of the fusion protein was released by thrombin cleavage (33Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Peptides SDTKKAVKY and KVKDASKTY were kindly prepared by Dr. L. Lozzi (University of Siena) with a SMP 350 automatic synthesizer (Zynsser Analytic, Frankfurt), employing a Fmoc chemistry. The peptides were purified by reverse-phase chromatography on a C8 Ultra-Sphere preparative column (Beckman). The content of zinc, nickel, iron, copper, cobalt, and manganese was measured, after dialysis of the toxin in metal-free buffers (5Schiavo G. Poulain B. Rossetto O. Benfenati F. Tauc L. Montecucco C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3577-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), by atomic adsorption with a Perkin Elmer 4000 atomic adsorption flame spectrophotometer with impact bed loading. Zinc was removed by 3 ~ 8 h of dialysis at 4°C against 10 mM HEPES-Na, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM ortho-phenantroline (OP), pH 7.4, and subsequent extensive dialysis against the same buffer without OP. Zinc reuptake by apo-BoNT/C was performed in 300 μM zinc chloride, 10 mM HEPES-Na, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4; after 24 h at 4°C, samples were extensively dialyzed against the same buffer without zinc and metal content was determined as above. Toxin samples of 0.2-0.3 mg were used for each atomic adsorption measurement. 50 μg of synaptosomes, isolated from rat brain cortex, were incubated with the different BoNTs (100 nM), in 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, for 4 h at 37°C. Native LP1 (50 μg) and small synaptic vesicles (25 μg), or solubilized with 0.5% n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, were incubated with BoNT/C (50-100 nM), previously reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min at 37 C, in 4 mM HEPES-Na, 300 mM glycine, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.3, for 3 h at 37°C. In some samples the toxin was preincubated for 30 min at 37°C with different inhibitors (captopril, 2 mM; OP, 1 mM; EDTA, 1 mM). Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue or silver as before (12Schiavo G. Benfenati F. Poulain B. Rossetto O. Polverino de Laureto P. DasGupta B.R. Montecucco C. Nature. 1992; 359: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Recombinant syntaxin 1A and 1B and the correspondent GST-syntaxin proteins (2 μg/sample) were incubated for 1 h at 37°C mixed with 100 μg of liposomes of different lipid composition: asolectin; dimyristoylglycerophosphocholine:dimyristoylglycerophosphoethanolamine:cholesterol, 4:4:1 (A); A plus 10% dimyristoylglycerophosphate (w/w); A plus 10% dimyristoylglycerophosphoserine; A plus 10% dimyristoylglycerophosphoinositol; A plus 10% mixed brain gangliosides. After dialysis against 10 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, for 3 days at 4°C, to remove the detergent used for syntaxin purification, liposome-bound syntaxin was recovered by centrifugation for 60 min at 200,000 ~ g in a Ti50 rotor (Beckman). Liposomes were resuspended by gentle pipetteting into 1 ml of the same buffer, centrifuged, and finally homogenized by 8 passages in a 25-gauge needle at a final protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. BoNT/C reduced with DTT as above (100 nM final concentration) was added and, after 3 h at 37°C, samples were diluted with 600 μl of 10 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, and centrifuged for 60 min at 300,000 ~ g in a SW55 rotor (Beckman). Supernatants were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, centrifuged 15 min at 15,000 ~ g, and pellets were dissolved in 8% SDS, 10 mM Tris acetate, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.2. Pellets derived from the SW55 centrifugation were solubilized in the same buffer and boiled for 2 min. Samples were analyzed in a 12% polyacrylamide SDS gels or in a high resolving SDS gel system (35Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10475) Google Scholar) and, after protein staining, scanned with a dual wavelength Shimadzu CS-630 densitometer. Rabbit polyclonal antisera recognizing rat syntaxin isoforms were generated against purified bacterially expressed proteins as reported (27Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 34Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against cysteine string protein was a kind gift of Dr. A. Mastrogiacomo (University of Rome). A mouse monoclonal antibody against rat retina synaptophysin was purchased from Sigma, while the one specific for rat synaptotagmin was kindly provided by Dr. M. Popoli (University of Milan, Italy). Samples were transferred onto nitrocellulose as described elsewhere (13Schiavo G. Rossetto O. Catsicas S. Polverino de Laureto P. DasGupta B.R. Benfenati F. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23784-23787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and treated with anti-syntaxin-specific antisera (1:200 dilution), anti-VAMP (1:500), anti-synaptophysin (1:2,000), or anti-synaptotagmin (1:2,000). Primary antibodies were detected by immunostaining with an anti-rabbit (1:10,000 dilution; Boehringer Mannheim) or anti-mouse antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1:1,000; Sigma) (13Schiavo G. Rossetto O. Catsicas S. Polverino de Laureto P. DasGupta B.R. Benfenati F. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23784-23787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amount of staining was determined by scanning the nitrocellulose paper with a dual wavelength densitometer (Shimadzu CS-630). A 4-kDa syntaxin fragment was electroeluted from polyacrylamide gels in an ISCO apparatus fitted with a Spectra/Por dialysis membrane (Spectrum, CA) with a 500-Da cut-off. Freeze-dried samples were applied to ProSpin tubes (Applied Biosystems), and sequenced in a pulsed liquid Applied Biosystem model 477A protein sequencer. BoNT/C is a proteinase that cleaves syntaxin within the carboxyl-terminal region (26Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4821-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The biochemical aspects of this proteolytic activity are not characterized. On the basis of its sequence (10Hauser D. Eklund M.W. Kurazono H. Binz T. Niemann H. Gill D.M. Boquet M. Popoff M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which shows the presence of the His-Glu- Xaa-Xaa-His zinc-binding motif of zinc-endopeptidases, it is expected to be a metalloendoproteinase. Fig. 1 shows that highly purified preparations of BoNT/C do contain zinc. However, at variance with the other clostridial neurotoxins that contain one zinc atom per toxin molecule (5Schiavo G.

A. 1994; 91: 4688-4692Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), BoNT/C harbors two atoms of zinc. This feature of BoNT/C is shared by neutrophil collagenase, whose three-dimensional structure has been recently solved (36Bode W. Reinemer P. Huber R. Kleine T. Schnierer S. Tschesche H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 37Lovejoy B. Cleasby A. Hassell A.M. Longley K. Luther M.A. Weigl D. McGeehan G. McElroy A.B. Drewry D. Lambert M.H. Jordan S.R. Science. 1994; 263: 375-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The active-site zinc of this metalloproteinase is bound to two histidines of the motif and to a third His residue. The second zinc is tetra-coordinated via three histidines and an aspartate. At variance from the catalytic metal atom, this latter zinc is not exchangeable and is thought to play a structural role (36Bode W. Reinemer P. Huber R. Kleine T. Schnierer S. Tschesche H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 37Lovejoy B. Cleasby A. Hassell A.M. Longley K. Luther M.A. Weigl D. McGeehan G. McElroy A.B. Drewry D. Lambert M.H. Jordan S.R. Science. 1994; 263: 375-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 also shows that both zinc atoms can be removed upon incubation with OP, thus generating an apo-BoNT/C. Unfortunately, the relative Kavalues of the two zinc atoms could not be determined as we have done before for other botulinum neurotoxins (7Schiavo G. Rossetto O. Santucci A. DasGupta B.R. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23479-23483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because of the present unavailability of BoNT/C in amounts sufficient for such measurements. The two metal ions can be regained upon incubation in zinc-containing buffers (Fig. 1). The content of cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, and nickel was below detection. Fig. 2A shows that in synaptosomes incubated with BoNT/C a doublet of syntaxins is cleaved with the production of two fragments of higher electrophoretic mobility. As a control, it is also reported in the same panel A that BoNT/B, /D, /F, and /G affect VAMP without altering the amount of syntaxin. Fig. 2B shows that this BoNT/C activity is inhibited by OP, EDTA, and partially by captopril, three known inhibitors of metalloproteinases (11Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar, 38Powers J.C. Harper J.W. Barrett A.J. Salversen G. Proteinase Inhibitors. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1986: 219-297Google Scholar). BoNT/C-induced syntaxin proteolysis is also prevented by dissolving the synaptosomal membranes with mild detergents, such as octylglucoside (Fig. 2 B). This indicates that syntaxin has to be inserted in the lipid bilayer in order to be recognized and cleaved by BoNT/C. When BoNT/C was assayed with full-length recombinant syntaxin-1A or syntaxin-1B, no proteolysis was observed, even upon prolonged incubations with high concentrations of BoNT/C (not shown), in agreement with the results of Blasi et al.(26Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4821-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). However, both neuronal isoforms of syntaxin are cleaved when incorporated in lipid bilayers and, in both cases, a large fragment of estimated molecular mass of 31-32 kDa is produced (not shown). As reported in Fig. 3 also, the NH2-terminal GST-syntaxin fusion protein is efficiently cleaved, thus suggesting that BoNT/C cleaves syntaxin within the cytoplasmic domain at a site close to the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane region. This result clearly indicates that no additional synaptosomal factors are required for syntaxin proteolysis by BoNT/C. The large proteolytic syntaxin fragment dissociates from the membrane and is recovered in the supernatant (Fig. 3, left panel), while the smaller carboxyl-terminal fragment remains membrane-bound. It migrates in SDS-PAGE at the lipid front and is barely visible, because the excess of lipids interferes with protein staining. Among the lipid mixtures tested here, maximal cleavage efficiency of BoNT/C was found with asolectin and minimal activity with mixture A (see “Materials and Methods”), thus suggesting that negatively charged phospholipids affect BoNT/C activity and/or syntaxin conformation. To determine the site(s) of BoNT/C proteolytic cleavage of syntaxin, synaptosomes and LP1 membranes (a plasmalemma-rich fraction) were tested, but their complex protein composition prevented such an analysis. Hence, recombinant GST-syntaxin 1A and 1B were incorporated into asolectin liposomes and, after BoNT/C cleavage, liposomes were recovered and loaded onto a high resolution SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 A). Due to their hydrophobicity and to the unfavorable lipid:protein ratio, the small syntaxin fragments migrated just above the lipid front, from where they were electroeluted and sequenced. Fragments derived from syntaxin 1A and 1B gave the identical sequence AVKYQSxA, corresponding to BoNT/C cleavage of the peptide bond Lys235-Ala254 of 1A and Lys252-Ala235 of 1B (Fig. 4 B). The 1A and 1B fragments have a molecular mass of 3,779 and 3,790 daltons and are composed of 35 and 36 residues, respectively. The nonapeptide SDTKKAVKY, corresponding to the cleavage site is not cleaved by BoNT/C, but partially inhibits the BoNT/C-mediated cleavage of syntaxin (not shown), while a scrambled peptide is ineffective. This peptide is not a strong inhibitor (and this can be explained in terms of the recent finding that clostridial neurotoxins recognize their substrates via a double interaction that involves the cleavage site as well as a recognition site located in a different part of the substrate protein molecule (39Rossetto O. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Poulain B. Deloye F. Lozzi L. Shone C.C. Nature. 1994; 372: 415-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar)). It is noteworthy that another Lys-Ala peptide bond (Lys260-Ala261 in syntaxin-1A; Lys259-Ala260 in syntaxin-1B) is present in the vicinity, but it is not cleaved at any rate. This finding also indicates that BoNT/C recognizes the tertiary, rather than the primary, structure of syntaxin with a precise relative spatial position of the binding and the cleavage sites (39Rossetto O.

Syntaxin isoform-specific antibodies are available for isoforms 1, 2, 3, and 4, while isoform 5 is less clearly identifiable. Immunoblotting and densitometric analysis shows that syntaxin 2 and 3 are cleaved by BoNT/C, while syntaxin isoform 4 is not (Fig. 5). Under the conditions used here, the cleavage of syntaxins contained in the LP1 preparation of synaptosomal membrane is never complete (Figs. 2 and 5). This result may reflect syntaxin heterogeneity in the preparation or, as suggested by Hayashi et al.(40Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), the presence of a multiple protein complex formed by syntaxin, SNAP 25, and VAMP/synaptobrevin, in which syntaxin is resistant to clostridial neurotoxin cleavage. The susceptibility to BoNT/C proteolysis of the various syntaxin isoforms if fully consistent with their sequence at the cleavage site since 1A, 1B, 2, and 3 are identical, while 4 has a Ile rather than a Lys at the P1 site. A replacement of a hydrophilic residue with an aliphatic one at the P1 site makes rat VAMP isoform 1 resistant to the proteolytic activity of tetanus neurotoxin and BoNT/B (12Schiavo G. Benfenati F.

Montecucco C. Nature. 1993; 364: 581-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). No clear results could be obtained with respect to isoform 5, which shows an amino acid substitution at the P1’ site. These results are also consistent with the identification of a neurotoxin binding motif in syntaxin, additional to the cleavage site (39Rossetto O. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Poulain B. Deloye F. Lozzi L. Shone C.C. Nature. 1994; 372: 415-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The motif is present in two copies: X1 (segment 29-38 of rat syntaxin 1A) and X2 (segment 164-173 of rat syntaxin 1A). X1 is present only in syntaxin isotypes 1A and 1B, while X2 is conserved in isotypes 1A, 1B, 2, 3; in contrast, X2 shows a Gln for Asp substitution in isoform 4 and is absent in syntaxin 5. The present findings suggest that it is X2 that is the functional BoNT/C binding segment of syntaxin. This paper reports on the biochemical characterization of the zinc-endopeptidase activity of BoNT/C. This neurotoxin shows unique features that differentiate it from the other seven clostridial neurotoxins recently studied. (a) It binds two atoms of zinc, rather than one as the related toxins do. In this respect it resembles the collagen-specific zinc-endopeptidases, whose structure has been recently resolved (36Bode W. Reinemer P. Huber R. Kleine T. Schnierer S. Tschesche H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 37Lovejoy B. Cleasby A. Hassell A.M. Longley K. Luther M.A. Weigl D. McGeehan G. McElroy A.B. Drewry D. Lambert M.H. Jordan S.R. Science. 1994; 263: 375-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). On this basis, we suggest also that in BoNT/C one zinc atom plays a catalytic role, while the other plays a structural role. (b) As recently shown by Blasi et al.(26Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4821-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), BoNT/C is the only clostridial neurotoxin that cleaves syntaxin. Here, we have reported the identification of the precise cleavage site as an unique Lys-Ala peptide bond, among the two such bonds present in the carboxyl-terminal region of syntaxin. (c) The peptide bond cleaved by BoNT/C differs from those hydrolyzed by the other clostridial neurotoxins. No common pattern of proteolytic cleavage can be identified in the peptide segments containing the cleavage site of each neurotoxin, even within the same protein target. This suggests that the region including the peptide bond cleaved is not the sole determinant of the target specificity of the clostridial neurotoxin. Additional segment(s) of the target protein must be involved and, in fact, we have recently identified a common neurotoxin binding motif on VAMP, SNAP-25, and syntaxin (39Rossetto O. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Poulain B. Deloye F. Lozzi L. Shone C.C. Nature. 1994; 372: 415-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Hence, the basis of the remarkable specificity of the clostridial neurotoxins is a double interaction with their substrate via a shared motif present in VAMP, SNAP-25, and syntaxin and a region containing the peptide bond to be hydrolyzed, unique of each target. In conclusion, this paper shows that the molecular pathogenesis of botulism type C is related to a specific proteolytic activity of BoNT/C, which penetrates into the neuronal cytosol and removes the majority of the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin. This will inevitably result in the prevention of the assembly of a functional 20 S SNAREs complex (19Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2621) Google Scholar), thus accounting for the persistent inhibition of neuroexocytosis caused by BoNT/C (2Smith L.D.S. Sugiyama H. Botulism: The Organism, Its Toxins, the Disease. Charles C. Thomas Publisher, Springfield, IL1988Google Scholar). The present results provide the molecular basis for the use of BoNT/C as a tool to probe the involvement of syntaxin isoforms in cellular processes and for its use in the treatment of dystonias and strabismus, as it is already a common medical practice with BoNT/A, /B, and /F (42Jankovic J.

The 1.55 A crystal structure of the dimeric enzyme from Thiosphaera pantotropha is reported here. The protein was sequenced from the X-ray structure. Each subunit contains a covalent c heme with two axial His ligands (His-17, His-69) and a unique noncovalent d1 heme ligated by Tyr-25 and His-200.

AICAR (5-amino 4-imidazolecarboxamide ribotide, ZMP) was found to stimulate up to 10-fold rat liver AMP-activated protein kinase, with a half-maximal effect at approximately 5 mM. In accordance with previous observations, addition to suspensions of isolated rat hepatocytes of 50-500 microM AICAriboside, the nucleoside corresponding to ZMP, resulted in the accumulation of millimolar concentrations of the latter. This was accompanied by a dose-dependent inactivation of both acetyl-CoA carboxylase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Addition of 50-500 microM AICAriboside to hepatocyte suspensions incubated in the presence of various substrates, including glucose and lactate/pyruvate, caused a parallel inhibition of both fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. With lactate/pyruvate (10/1 mM), half-maximal inhibition was obtained at approximately 100 microM, and near-complete inhibition at 500 microM AICAriboside. These findings open new perspectives for the simultaneous control of triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis by pharmacological stimulators of AMP-activated protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2087593127,"The ability of cytolytic cells to cause apoptosis in target cells is in part due to the action of the serine proteinase granzyme B. We demonstrate that granzyme B is inhibited, with an association rate constant of 2.9 × 10<sup>5</sup>M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, by the cowpox viral serpin cytokine response modifier A (CrmA). Previously we have shown CrmA to be an inhibitor of the cysteine proteinase interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE). Thus the mechanism of CrmA involves the unusual ability to efficiently inhibit proteinases from two distinct catalytic classes, in this case serine and cysteine proteinases. Granzyme B and ICE are both used to combat viral infection, and we propose that cowpox virus uses CrmA to evade the contribution of these two proteinases. Thus, through CrmA, the virus may influence two of the pathways normally used to kill virus-infected cells: acting on endogenous proteinases such as ICE and on exogenous proteinases delivered by cytotoxic lymphocytes to infected cells."

We tested whether the greater antiproliferative effect of these analogues is due to a differential activation of the VDR. In ROS 17/2.8 cells, the effective doses required to produce 50% maximal stimulation (ED50) of transfected reporter genes driven by either the osteocalcin or the osteopontin vitamin D-response elements (VDRE) were 5 × 10-9M, 10-10M, and 10-11M for 1,25-D3, ID, and IE, respectively. Similar results were obtained when recombinant human VDR was cotransfected into CV-1 cells with an osteocalcin VDRE-reporter plasmid. We found that in vitro the sensitivity of 1,25-D3-induced and analogue-induced receptors to proteases was different. The ED50 for binding to VDRE, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, was significantly higher for 1,25-D3-induced than for analogue-induced VDR. The concentration of retinoid X receptor (RXR) was significantly lower in 1,25-D3-induced than analogue-induced VDR complexes with VDRE.We therefore conclude that IE and ID augment transcriptional activity of VDR more than 1,25-D3 does, by producing conformational changes that enhance dimerization of VDR with RXR. We suggest that these conformational changes are due to differences in the contact sites of the 20-epi analogues and 1,25-D3 with the VDR. The relative affinities of the 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3) analogues 20-epi-1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (IE) and 20-epi-22-oxa-24a,26a,27a-tri-homo-1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (ID) to the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) are similar to that of 1,25-D3, but their antiproliferative action is 1000-fold greater.

A particularly interesting group are the 20-epi analogues (5Binderup L. Latini S. Binderup E. Bretting C. Calverley M. Hansen K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1565-1575Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). These compounds have antiproliferative activities 200-7,000-fold greater than that of 1,25-D3, but their calcemic activity is not proportionally higher (5Binderup L. Latini S. Binderup E. Bretting C. Calverley M. Hansen K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1565-1575Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Although these compounds may not be suitable for treatment of cancer because they are very active immunosuppressants, the mechanism of their facilitated action remains an interesting issue. Because both the immunosuppressive and antiproliferative activities of vitamin D are thought to be transcriptional events mediated by the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) (6Haussler M.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1986; 6: 527-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Amento E.P. Steroids. 1987; 49: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the first explanation proposed for the facilitated action of these compounds was that their affinity to the VDR was proportionally higher. All of the first generation of 20-epi analogues were tested for their relative affinity for the chick intestinal VDR and were found to have affinities similar to that of 1,25-D3(5Binderup L. Latini S. Binderup E. Bretting C. Calverley M. Hansen K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1565-1575Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, another study showed that one compound in this series, 20-epi-1,25-D3 (also known as MC1288 or analogue IE) had a higher affinity for calf thymus VDR than 1,25-D3 did (8Dilworth F.J. Calverley M.J. Makin H.L.J. Jones G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because in both studies binding and antiproliferative activities were assayed in receptors from different species, the relevance of the binding data to the augmented action of these compounds remains unclear and requires further clarification. 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 nuclear 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor 20-epi-1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 20-epi-22-oxa-24a,26a,27a-tri-homo-1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 vitamin D binding protein retinoid X receptor vitamin D response element two direct repeats separated by three nucleotides relative competition index electrophoretic mobility shift assay Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline. A second possible explanation was that the cellular uptake of the 20-epi analogues is more efficient. Analogue IE was shown to have poor binding affinity for the vitamin D-binding protein (DBP). However, in culture, the presence or absence of DBP had only a minor effect on the biological activity of either 1,25-D3 or the analogue tested (8Dilworth F.J. Calverley M.J. Makin H.L.J. Jones G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A third possible explanation was that the catabolism rate of the 20-epi analogues was slower than that of 1,25-D3. The catabolism studies performed with analogue IE showed that it was a good substrate for 24-hydroxylase but probably a poor substrate for 23-hydroxylase (8Dilworth F.J. Calverley M.J. Makin H.L.J. Jones G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting that poor catabolism may contribute to the facilitated action of this compound and perhaps that of other analogues in this family. Another possibility that has not been previously tested is that the mode of interaction of the 20-epi analogues with VDR facilitates its transcriptional activity. To determine whether the 20-epi analogues augmented VDR action, we tested early steps in the sequence of events leading to transcriptional activation of VDR by ligand and compared the efficacy of the analogues to that of 1,25-D3 at each of these steps. We report here that in vitro, the 20-epi analogues induced a specific conformational change in the VDR, facilitated dimerization of VDR to the retinoid X receptor (RXR), and augmented binding to and transcriptional activation through a vitamin D response element (VDRE) containing two direct repeats separated by three nucleotides (DR3). Synthetic oligonucleotides were prepared by the Macromolecular Synthesis and Analysis Facility of M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Anti-VDR antibodies were prepared by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic human VDR peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. [α-32P]dATP was obtained from ICN and [35S]methionine and 1,25(OH)2[26,27-3(3) H]D3 from Amersham Corp. A coupled transcription-translation kit was obtained from Promega. The analogues 20-epi-1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (MC1288) and 20-epi-22-oxa-24a,26,27a-tri-homo-1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (KH1060) were a generous gift from Dr. L. Binderup (Leo Pharmaceuticals, Bellerup, Denmark). For convenience, MC1288 was designated IE and KH1060 was designated ID. The structural formulas of these compounds are shown in Fig. 1. African green monkey kidney cell lines (COS-1 and CV-1) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Rat osteosarcoma ROS 17/2.8 cells were maintained in 50% DMEM and 50% F12. All culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Forty-eight h before transfection, the cells were plated in 35-mm dishes at a density of 3 × 105/dish (ROS 17/2.8 and CV-1) or in 150-mm dishes at a density of 6 × 105/dish (COS-1) in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum. ROS 17/2.8 cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid containing either the VDRE from the mouse osteopontin gene (TGCTCGGGTAGGGTTCACGAGGTTCACTCGAC) (9Noda M. Vogel R.L. Craig A.M. Prahl J. DeLuca H.F. Denhardt D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21881-21888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These response elements were attached to the thymidine kinase promoter-growth hormone fusion gene. CV-1 cells were transfected with the osteocalcin VDRE-reporter fusion gene (4 μg/dish) and the recombinant human VDR expression vector (2 μg/dish). COS-1 cells were transfected with 20 μg/dish of recombinant human VDR plasmid. All transfections were performed by the DEAE-dextran method (11Peleg S. Cote G.J. Abruzzese R.V. Gagel R.F. Henry Ford Hosp. Med. J. 1989; 37: 194-197PubMed Google Scholar), and the cells were then treated for 1 min with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. Medium samples for measurements of growth hormone were collected 2 days after transfection. Growth hormone production from the reporter gene was measured by a radioimmunoassay as described by the manufacturer (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). To test the ligand-induced DNA binding activity of VDR and to assess the amount of RXR in the VDR·VDRE complexes, nuclear extracts were prepared from COS-1 cells 48 h after transfection with the human VDR plasmid. Ligands (1,25-D3, IE, and ID) dissolved in ethanol were added 1 or 24 h before the cells were harvested. The cells were then scraped from individual dishes into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed twice in that buffer, and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After they had swollen, the cells were homogenized by 5-10 strokes in Dounce homogenizers and centrifuged for 30 s at 14,000 × g. The supernatants were then discarded, and the nuclear pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol), set on ice for 30 min, homogenized again, and centrifuged for 30 s at 14,000 × g. The nuclear extracts were then collected, frozen in dry ice immediately, and stored at −80°C for further analysis. A HindIII fragment containing the mouse osteopontin VDRE was labeled with 32P to a specific activity of 1-5 × 108 counts/min/μg. Each binding reaction included 50 mM KCl, 12 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 12% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 ng of the DNA probe, 10 μg of nuclear proteins, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor DNA. The binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min. The complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through 4% polyacrylamide gels at 4°C. For competition experiments and for analysis of the complexes by antibody binding, the conditions were exactly as described above except that specific oligonucleotides or the αVDR and αRXR antibodies and nonspecific DNA were added to the binding reactions before addition of the probe. To compare the relative affinity of 1,25-D3 and the 20-epi analogues to VDR in vitro, whole-cell extracts from untransfected ROS 17/2.8 cells were prepared in KTED (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mM EDTA, 0.3 M KCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). Briefly, the cells were scraped into PBS, washed three times, and homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were then aliquoted into tubes containing 0.2 pmol of [3H]1,25-D3 and increasing concentrations of nonradioactive ligand. The mixtures were incubated on ice for 3-4 h, and then free ligand was separated from bound by hydroxyapatite (12Wecksler W.R. Norman A.W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 67: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The bound ligand was released from the hydroxyapatite by ethanol extraction, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. The results (Table I see legend to) were expressed as relative competition index (RCI) by the method of Wecksler and Norman (12Wecksler W.R. Norman A.W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 67: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), with the RCI for 1,25-D3 defined as 100%.Table IRelative competition index (RCI) of the 20-epi analoguesThe RCIs were calculated by plotting the inverse of the percent maximum binding [3H]1,25-D3× 100 on the ordinate versus [competitor]/[3H]1,25-D3] on the abscissa, and dividing the slope of the line for analogue binding by the slope of the line for 1,25-D3, and multiplying by 100. By definition, the RCI for 1,25-D3 is 100. To measure RCI in culture, increasing concentrations of ligand were added to cells in serum-free culture medium and incubated for 1 h. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, scraped off the plates, and homogenized. The homogenates were then incubated with a constant amount of [3H]1,25-D3 with or without 100-fold excess of unlabeled 1,25-D3. To measure RCI in vitro, cell homogenates were incubated with increasing amounts of ligand and a constant amount of [3H]1,25-D3. Three experiments were performed in culture and five in vitro.

To measure RCI in vitro, cell homogenates were incubated with increasing amounts of ligand and a constant amount of [3H]1,25-D3. Three experiments were performed in culture and five in vitro. To assess receptor occupancy by the ligand in vivo, monolayers of ROS 17/2.8 or VDR-transfected COS-1 cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with ligand in serum-free medium, and then the medium was discarded. The cells were washed three times in cold PBS, scraped into 10 ml of PBS, centrifuged, resuspended in KTED, and homogenized. Aliquots of the homogenates (0.2 ml) were incubated on ice for 3-4 h with 0.2 pmol of [3H]1,25-D3 with or without 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. To assess the number of unoccupied VDR sites, the free ligand was separated from the bound by hydroxyapatite as described above. Synthetic human VDR, labeled with [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) was prepared by in vitro coupled transcription-translation in reticulocyte lysates (Promega) with the human VDR cDNA inserted into the pGEM4 vector. The receptor was incubated with 10 nM 1,25-D3 or analogues for 10 min at room temperature. Then 0-25 μg/ml trypsin (Calbiochem) was added, and the mixture was further incubated for 10 min. The digestion products were analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gels were dried and autoradiographed. The results of the growth hormone assays were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean of 3-10 transfections. The vitamin D analogues IE and ID have been shown by Binderup et al.(5Binderup L. Latini S. Binderup E. Bretting C. Calverley M. Hansen K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1565-1575Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar) to possess antiproliferative responses 200-fold and 7,000 fold, respectively, greater than that of 1,25-D3. Because this aspect of vitamin D action is considered a nuclear receptor-mediated event (6Haussler M.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1986; 6: 527-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether these augmented effects on cell proliferation can be reflected in a simplified model to test a single transcriptional activity of VDR. We used the thymidine kinase promoter-growth hormone fusion genes containing either the osteocalcin or the osteopontin VDREs; both have DR3 motifs (13Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Naar A.M. Kim S.Y. Boudin J.-M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 1251-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The difference between the two is that the osteocalcin element also contains an activator protein 1-binding site immediately upstream from the DR3 motif (14Scule R. Umensono K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Bolado J. Pike J.W. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 497-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The fusion genes containing these VDREs were transfected into ROS 17/2.8 cells, and growth hormone reporter-protein production was measured after treatment with increasing concentrations of ligand. The cells were exposed to the ligands for 1 h in serum-free medium, to avoid involvement of DBP in the regulation of ligand uptake by the cells. Fig. 2 A shows that transcription of a reporter gene containing the osteocalcin VDRE reached 50% of maximal activity (ED50) at 5 × 10-9M. The ED50 for IE and ID were 10-11M and 10-10M, respectively. Similar results were obtained by transfection of the osteopontin VDRE-containing fusion gene (Fig. 2 B). We concluded that the 20-epi analogues increased VDR sensitivity to ligand (as was evident by the shift of the dose-response curve to the left) but did not increase the levels of transcription because maximal fold-induction of gene transcription was similar for all three ligands. Because later assays of VDR activity were carried out with recombinant human VDR, we tested whether the sensitivity of the recombinant human VDR was also augmented by the 20-epi analogues. For that study, the VDR-negative CV-1 cells were cotransfected with the recombinant human VDR expression vector and the osteocalcin VDRE-growth hormone fusion gene. Fig. 2 C shows that IE and ID increased the sensitivity of the human VDR in a manner similar to their effect on the rat VDR in ROS 17/2.8 cells. We concluded from these experiments that the transcriptional activity of VDR through a DR3 VDRE motif was augmented by the 20-epi analogues. The ED50 for IE transcriptional activity was identical to its ED50 for antiproliferative activity. However, the ED50 for transcriptional activity of ID was 100-fold greater than its ED50 for anti-proliferative action. These results suggest that although the augmented antiproliferative action of the 20-epi analogues was mediated through enhanced activation of genes with a DR3 motif, an additional unknown mechanism may also be responsible for their augmented antiproliferative action. The augmented transcriptional activity of the 20-epi analogues was reflected by increased receptor sensitivity to the analogues rather than by an increase in levels of transcription. These results suggest that either the affinity of the 20-epi analogues for the receptor was greater than that of 1,25-D3 or that the affinity of the analogue-induced receptor for other components in the transcriptional machinery was greater than that of the 1,25-D3-induced VDR. The original report on these compounds showed that their affinity to chick intestinal VDR was similar to that of 1,25-D3(5Binderup L. Latini S. Binderup E. Bretting C. Calverley M. Hansen K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1565-1575Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, we could not exclude the possibility that the binding properties of rat VDR from ROS 17/2.8 cells and those of the recombinant human VDR are different from those of the chick receptor. To test that possibility, we performed binding assays with homogenates from ROS 17/2.8 cells (Fig. 3 A) and from VDR-transfected COS-1 cells to determine their RCI values (Fig. 3 B). When we plotted the competition curves for these compounds, and calculated their RCIs (summarized in Table I), we found that for the rat VDR the relative affinities of IE and ID (RCI values of 43 ± 18 and 55 ± 26, respectively) were lower than that of 1,25-D3 (RCI = 100). Similar results were obtained for the human VDR (RCI values of 32 and 34 for IE and ID, respectively). We then considered the possibilities that the receptor-binding properties of intact cells are significantly different from the binding properties of cell homogenates and that the uptake of the 20-epi analogues, even in the absence of serum, is significantly higher than that of 1,25-D3. We therefore attempted to determine the concentrations of the three ligands required to reach 50% saturation of VDR in vivo. We repeated the binding assays by incubating the cells with increasing concentrations of nonradioactive ligands for 1 h in serum-free medium and then measured the concentration of unoccupied receptor remaining in the cell homogenates. Fig. 4 shows that in ROS 17/2.8 cells, the slope of the plots of binding activity of 20-epi analogue-treated cells was smaller than that of binding activity of 1,25-D3-treated cells, indicating that either the uptake or the affinity (or both) of the 20-epi analogues to the VDR in vivo was lower than that of 1,25-D3. Similar results were obtained with the recombinant human VDR from transfected COS 1 cells (data not shown). The results of the in vivo and in vitro competition assays in ROS 17/2.8 cells are summarized in Table I. We concluded that the augmented transcriptional activity of the 20-epi analogues under our experimental conditions cannot be attributed to higher affinity for the VDR or to more efficient delivery into the cells. Because the augmented transcriptional activity of the 20-epi analogues was not due to increased affinity to the VDR or to a more efficient uptake mechanism, we tested whether the analogues facilitated binding of the VDR to the VDRE more than did 1,25-D3. Two aspects of DNA binding activity were tested: affinity of the ligand-induced VDR to the osteopontin VDRE and dose-dependent binding of the ligand-induced VDR to the VDRE. For these assays VDR was overexpressed in COS-1 cells, exposed to ligand in the intact cells in serum-free medium for 1 h, and extracted from the nuclear fraction of the cells. The binding properties of the extracted VDR to the osteopontin VDRE were tested by EMSA. We used the osteopontin VDRE and not the osteocalcin VDRE because VDR binding to the former was more stable and was not accompanied by additional specific (activator protein 1) and nonspecific binding activities (14Scule R. Umensono K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Bolado J. Pike J.W. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 497-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 15Sone T. Kerner S. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23296-23305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows the complexes formed after incubation of 1,25-D3-treated extracts from human VDR-transfected cells with radiolabeled osteopontin VDRE. We found that a single complex was formed. The formation of this complex was blocked by a 50-fold excess of unlabeled osteopontin VDRE, and the complex contained VDR, as it was partially supershifted by anti-VDR antibodies. Next, we compared the affinities of 1,25-D3-induced and 20-epi analogue-induced VDR to the osteopontin VDRE. Receptor preparations from cells treated with 10-8M ligand were subjected to EMSA, with 32P-labeled osteopontin VDRE as a probe and increasing concentrations of unlabeled VDRE as a competitor. Fig. 5 B shows that the unlabeled VDRE inhibited the formation of the VDR complex with the labeled probe in a dose-dependent manner. The incubation of VDR in vivo with the 20-epi analogues did not increase its affinity to the VDRE relative to 1,25-D3-induced VDR; 50% competition was reached at similar concentration of competitor for 1,25-D3-, IE-, and ID-induced VDR. We then tested whether there were quantitative differences in the amount of VDR binding to VDRE in 1,25-D3-induced and 20-epi analogue-induced preparations. VDR-transfected cells were treated for 1 h with increasing concentrations of ligand, and then nuclear extracts were prepared. The EMSAs were repeated with these receptor preparations and with osteopontin VDRE as a probe. We found that in the absence of ligand only a very small amount of complex formed (Fig. 6 A) and that including ligand induced a significant increase in VDR binding to DNA. The binding was dose dependent and reached 50% of maximal value at 10-9 to 10-10M 1,25-D3, at 10-10 to 10-11M ID, and at 10-11M IE. Fig. 6 B shows the relative intensity of the VDR bands from each treatment. In summary, we found that the analogues facilitated the DNA binding activity of VDR in a dose-dependent manner. A prerequisite for binding of the VDR to a VDRE containing the DR3 motif is heterodimerization with RXR (13Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Naar A.M. Kim S.Y. Boudin J.-M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 1251-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Because we found that both transcription and DNA binding to these elements were augmented by the analogues, we hypothesized that these compounds might also facilitate dimerization of VDR with RXR. To test this hypothesis, VDR preparations from cells treated with ligand for 1 h in serum-free medium were incubated with antibodies against RXR or control IgG and then incubated with the labeled VDRE and subjected to EMSA. The antibodies used (a generous gift from Dr. P. Chambon) recognize all three RXR species,2( 2P. Chambon, personal communication. ) so the assay detected all possible VDR·RXR complexes, simultaneously. Fig. 7 A shows that the antibodies induced a partial supershift of VDR complexes, whereas the control IgG did not have any effect on the complexes. When VDR was pretreated with 10-8M ligand, there was no difference in the proportion of supershifted VDR·RXR complexes for the three ligands. On the other hand, at ligand concentrations of 10-9 and 10-10M, there was a significant difference in the proportion of supershifted 1,25-D3-induced and analogue-induced VDR·RXR complexes. To assess the difference between receptor preparations quantitatively, we densitometrically scanned the autoradiograms (Fig. 7 B) and found that the proportion of VDR·RXR complexes supershifted by the anti-RXR antibodies was significantly higher in receptor preparations treated with 10-9 and 10-10M IE and ID than in those treated with same concentrations of 1,25-D3. These results suggested that there was more RXR associated with VDR activated by 20-epi analogues than with VDR activated by 1,25-D3 and that the analogues facilitated heterodimerization. Again, the differences were seen only when VDR was activated by suboptimal levels of 1,25-D3. We think that differences were not seen at higher ligand concentrations because the amount of RXR in the extracts limited heterodimer formation. The binding and uptake studies did not reveal a difference in receptor occupancy or affinity to the 20-epi analogues that correlated with their augmented transcriptional activity. In fact, the ligand-binding pattern was not correlated with the dimerization, DNA binding, or transcriptional activities of any of the compounds tested. We therefore hypothesize that it is the mode of interaction of the ligands, perhaps their contact sites with VDR, more than relative affinities of the ligands to the receptor that determines the efficacy of the activation process that leads to DNA binding and transcriptional activity. We reasoned that if there are differences in the mode of interaction they should be reflected by conformational changes in VDR. To identify qualitative differences in the mode of interaction of the three ligands with VDR, we compared the conformational changes induced by the three ligands as reflected in the pattern of sensitivity to proteases. These assays were performed in vitro, with 35S-labeled synthetic VDR incubated with either 1,25-D3 or the 20-epi analogues, and then treated with increasing concentrations of trypsin. Fig. 8 A shows that in the absence of ligand, VDR was rapidly degraded, and only one short fragment (fragment d, 22 kDa) was detectable after 10 min of incubation with the protease. Under the same incubation conditions, treatment of VDR with 1,25-D3 changed the proteolytic pattern of trypsin action: it produced an additional, slowly migrating fragment (fragment a, 34 kDa) not seen in the absence of hormone. Treatment of VDR with ID (Fig. 8 B) generated an additional fragment (fragment b, 30 kDa), whereas the treatment with IE (Fig. 8 B), generated both fragment b and an additional slow-migrating fragment (fragment c, 32 kDa) not seen with 1,25-D3-treated VDR. This experiment was repeated with chymotrypsin, with similar results (data not shown). We concluded from these experiments that binding of the 20-epi analogues to VDR induced conformational changes that exposed certain arginine or lysine residues that are not normally exposed on the 1,25-D3-activated VDR. We speculate that these conformational modifications facilitate the action of VDR, beginning by enhancing dimerization with RXR. The biological actions of 1,25-D3 and its analogues are believed to be mediated through both genomic and non-genomic signal-transduction pathways (16Pike J.W. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1991; 11: 189-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 17Nemere I. Yoshimoto Y. Norman A.W. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1467-1483Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 18Lieberherr M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extensive search for analogues of 1,25-D3 more suitable for clinical purposes has yielded a wealth of compounds that can be used as tools for studying these different aspects of the action of vitamin D (20Farach-Carson M.C. Sergeev I. Norman A.W. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1878-1884Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21Norman A.W. Okamura W.H. Farach-Carson M.C. Allewaert K. Branisteanu D. Nemere I. Muralidharan K.R. Bouillon R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13811-13819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We chose to investigate the mechanism of action of the 20-epi analogues because the antiproliferative action of these compounds is several orders of magnitude higher than that of 1,25-D3. The antiproliferative effect of 1,25-D3 is thought to be primarily a genomic action and therefore believed to be regulated by the nuclear VDR (6Haussler M.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1986; 6: 527-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The traditional concept of nuclear receptors activation by a ligand suggests that activation should be directly proportional to the ligand's affinity for the receptor. However, the action of the 20-epi analogues presented a paradox: the affinity of these compounds for VDR is similar or even lower than that of 1,25-D3, but their antiproliferative action is several orders of magnitude higher (5Binderup L. Latini S. Binderup E. Bretting C. Calverley M. Hansen K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1565-1575Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In the Introduction we addressed the possibility that the augmented activity of these analogues is due to their pharmacokinetic qualities (8Dilworth F.J. Calverley M.J. Makin H.L.J. Jones G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). While this is a valid consideration for whole-animal studies or for experiments that require the continuous presence of the vitamin in serum-enriched culture medium (such as the antiproliferative assay), we have focused on experimental systems in which pharmacokinetic qualities of the tested compounds could be separated from their actual biological activities as agonists of 1,25-D3 action and as ligands for VDR. To separate the pharmacological and direct molecular effects of the analogues on VDR, we tested in vitro the sensitivity of the 20-epi analogue-induced VDR to proteases and compared it to the protease sensitivty of the 1,25-D3-induced VDR. By using a similar approach for the analysis of ligand interaction with steroid receptors, it was possible to show differences in the pattern of protease sensitivity of agonist- and antagonist-treated receptors for progesterone, estrogen, and androgen (22Allan G.F. Leng X. Tsai S.Y. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Beekman J.M. Alan G.F. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1266-1274PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kuil C.W. Mulder E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 102: R1-R5Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our results clearly indicate that each of the three ligands used in our experiments induced a unique pattern of sensitivity to trypsin. Therefore, although the apparent affinity of these compounds to VDR was not higher, it is possible that the conformational changes they induced facilitated receptor action. Our interpretation of these results is that the amino acids used by the 20-epi analogues as contact sites on VDR are somewhat different from the contact sites used by 1,25-D3. Flexibility in ligand binding requirements that leads to differential activation of receptors by parental compounds and their analogues has been clearly demonstrated by deletion analysis of the progesterone receptor (25Vegeto E. Allan G.F. Schrader W.T. Tsai M.-J. McDonell D.P. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). We are now in the process of mapping the ligand-binding domain of VDR and comparing the amino acids required for binding and function of 1,25-D3 and of the 20-epi analogues. Our preliminary results suggest that the binding requirements for these compounds are different from those of 1,25-D3. The earliest events in VDR activation by the ligand are dimerization with RXR (which was originally identified as nuclear accessory factor or NAF) (15Sone T. Kerner S. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23296-23305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the subsequent binding to VDRE. Under certain conditions it is possible to demonstrate ligand-dependent induction of heterodimerization and binding of VDR to DNA in vitro, for example, in recombinant receptor expressed in yeast cells and mixed with RXR-containing cell extracts (15Sone T. Kerner S. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23296-23305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the VDR-RXR heterodimer expressed in vitro binds strongly to VDRE, and its binding is not significantly increased by inclusion of ligand (13Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Naar A.M. Kim S.Y. Boudin J.-M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 1251-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). In our system, VDR and RXR expressed in mammalian cells had very poor binding activity to osteopontin VDRE in the absence of ligand. This binding activity was enhanced only by inclusion of ligand in the culture medium, not in a cell-free system. We therefore speculate that in mammalian cells a ligand-induced post-translational modification (possibly phosphorylation) must take place to efficiently facilitate formation of VDR complexes with RXR or binding of the VDR·RXR complexes to the VDRE. Because this event was facilitated by the 20-epi analogues within 1 h of ligand administration in vivo under conditions of similar uptake and receptor saturation by 1,25-D3 and the analogues, we are convinced that the facilitated action of the 20-epi analogues on DNA binding and dimerization of VDR is not due to their pharmacological properties. We speculate that the conformational change induced by these compounds either directly facilitated dimerization of RXR with VDR or perhaps facilitated a post-translational event that increased the affinity of ligand-activated VDR for RXR. Can the greater biological activities of the 20-epi analogues be explained only by the pharmacological qualities and molecular alterations induced by direct interaction with the receptor? One should not overlook the great discrepancy between the ED50 for transcription induction of DR3 motif-driven genes by ID (10-10M) and its ED50 for antiproliferation and induction of differentiation (10-12 to 10-14M) (5Binderup L. Latini S. Binderup E. Bretting C. Calverley M. Hansen K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1565-1575Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy. The first is that ID-induced VDR may be far more transcriptionally active due to the action of a motif different from DR3 and that genes with such motifs are important for the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Examples of diversity in VDREs are the negative VDREs of the parathyroid hormone and the calcitonin genes. The parathyroid hormone gene is repressed by weak direct binding of VDR to DNA elements that are significantly different from DR3 (26Demay M.B. Kiernan M.S. DeLuca H.F. Kronenberg H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8097-8101Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The calcitonin gene is down-regulated by a mechanism that does not require direct interaction of the receptor with DNA (27Peleg S. Abruzzese R.V. Cooper C.W. Gagel R.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Another possible mechanism for the discrepancy in ID ED50 is that the 20-epi analogues, similarly to 1,25-D3 (or even more so) may activate nuclear receptor-independent pathways (the so called non-genomic responses) that are also important for regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The biochemical and physiological events induced by 1,25-D3 and related compounds that do not require direct interaction with VDR include activation of calcium channels (19Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), regulation of the phosphoinositol pathway and diacylglycerol formation (18Lieberherr M.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2495-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Any one of these events may contribute to regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Exploring these possibilities is essential for further evaluation of the mechanism of action of vitamin D analogues. We thank Dr. J. W. Pike for hVDR, human vitamin D receptor expression plasmid, and Dr. Pierre Chambon (LGME-U.184) for the generous gift of the RXR antibodies 1RX-6G12 and 4RX-1D12."

The cAMP and Ca2+/phospholipid signal transduction pathways activate transcription factors that bind to the cAMP response element (CRE) and phorbol ester response element (TRE), respectively. Little is known about transcriptional regulation of gene expression by NO/cGMP. In transient and stable transfection experiments and in microinjection studies we found that three different NO-releasing agents and two membrane-permeable cGMP analogs activated TRE-regulated but not CRE-regulated reporter genes in rodent fibroblast and epithelial cell lines. Activation of TRE-regulated genes by NO-releasing agents and cGMP analogs appeared to be mediated by the AP-1 (Jun/Fos) transcription factor complex because we observed increased DNA binding of AP-1 and increased junB and c-fos mRNA in cells treated with these agents. The mechanism of gene activation by NO/cGMP was distinct from that used by phorbol esters and cAMP because it was not associated with c-jun mRNA induction and was not observed with CRE-containing promoters.—Pilz, R.

In HeLa cells, NIMA induced premature mitotic events without activating CDC2, whereas the mutants caused a specific G2 arrest but did not block mutant CDC2T14AY15F-induced premature entry into mitosis.

https://openalex.org/W2090173484,"We have identified an essential gene, called FIP1, encoding a 327 amino acid protein interacting with yeast poly(A) polymerase (PAP1) in the two-hybrid assay. Recombinant FIP1 protein forms a 1:1 complex with PAP1 in vitro. At 37 degrees C, a thermosensitive allele of FIP1 shows a shortening of poly(A) tails and a decrease in the steady-state level of actin transcripts. When assayed for 3'-end processing in vitro, fip1 mutant extracts exhibit normal cleavage activity, but fail to polyadenylate the upstream cleavage product. Polyadenylation activity is restored by adding polyadenylation factor I (PF I). Antibodies directed against FIP1 specifically recognize a polypeptide in these fractions. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal that RNA14, a subunit of cleavage factor I (CF I), directly interacts with FIP1, but not with PAP1. We propose a model in which PF I tethers PAP1 to CF I, thereby conferring specificity to poly(A) polymerase for pre-mRNA substrates."

Crystallographic studies of Ras indicate that the difference between the GTP-active and GDP-inactive structures derives mainly from two regions: switch I and switch II (10Milburn M.V. Tongo L. DeVos A.M. Brunger A. Ymaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Interestingly, switch I encompasses residues 32-40, defined as the effector domain (11Marshall M.S. TrendsBiochem.

These amino acids are identical in Rap1 and Ras, raising the possibility that the proteins share similar or antagonistic functions. In fact, Rap1-GTP interacts in vitro with two proteins known to bind the effector domain in Ras: p120-GAP (14Frech M. John J. Pizon V. Chardu P. Tavitian A. Clark R. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A.

Moreover, a role for Rap1 in antagonizing Ras function is strongly supported in several model systems, including Xenopus oocytes (17Campa M.J. Chang K.J. Molina y Vedia L.M. Reep B.R. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), Drosophila(18Hariharan I.K. Carthew R.W. Rubin G.M.

However, the precise cellular function of Rap1 remains unclear. Identification of a signaling pathway that inputs signals into Rap proteins may assist in deciphering its function. First insights into this signaling function came from studies demonstrating that activation of the heterotrimeric G-protein, Gs by prostaglandins, led to cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of Rap1b (22Lapetina E.G.

Immunol. 1991; 147: 1628-1635PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Rap1b does not affect its basal GDP/GTP exchange reaction rate, basal GTPase activity, or the GAP-stimulated GTPase activity (23Kawata M. Kikuchi K. Hoshijime M. Yamamoto K. Hashimoto E. Yamamura H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15688-15695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, experiments performed in vitro suggested that phosphorylation by protein kinase A plays a role in Rap1 activation (26Hata Y. Kaibuchi K. Kawamura S. Hiroyoshi M. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6571-6577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and consequently implicated Rap1 as one of the effectors of cAMP action. Here we show that stimulation of cAMP signaling in vivo results in activation of Rap1b. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of hormonal regulation of Rap proteins. isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP isobutylmethylxanthine guanosine 5’-3- O-(thio)triphosphate adenosine 5’-3- O-(thio)triphosphate. isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP isobutylmethylxanthine guanosine 5’-3- O-(thio)triphosphate adenosine 5’-3- O-(thio)triphosphate. Control vector plasmid (pL7-Hygro) was constructed in a triple ligation reaction by combining a SalI/NruI fragment from the vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen), containing the hygromycin gene with an Ecl136II/BamHI fragment from pL7-CAT (27Baim S. Labow M. Levine A. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5072-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and a BamHI/XhoI fragment from the vector pCGN (28Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) containing the β-globin intron and polyadenylation signal. Different Rap1b clones were made by subcloning Ecl136II/BamHI fragments from pCGN-Rap1b (29Altschuler D. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7527-7531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into pL7-Hygro at the StuI/BamHI site. The NIH3T3 fibroblast derivative, LISN C4, which overexpresses the IGF-1 receptor was used for all experiments (30Kaleko M. Rutter W.J. Miller A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). These cells were cotransfected using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with a 10-fold excess (10 μg) of the LAP 267 plasmid (27Baim S. Labow M. Levine A. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5072-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) containing the mutant lac repressor/VP16 fusion gene together with 1 μg of the plasmid expressing wild type and mutant Rap1b. Rap1b expression was under the control of a promoter containing several copies of the lac operator. Colonies were selected for 2 weeks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% calf serum in the presence of 200 μg/ml hygromycin and clonal lines were selected by dilution cloning in 96-well microtiter dishes in DMEM with 5% calf serum in the presence of 4 μg/ml insulin. To select lines with physiological levels of Rap1b expression, clonal lines were then expanded and induced for 48 h in the presence of 5 mM IPTG. Cells were lysed and the transfected protein was immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the epitope tag, clone 12CA5 (BAbco). The level of expression of the Rap1b constructs closely approximates that of the endogenous protein, as estimated from Western blotting with the M90 antibody (data not shown). All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Cells were grown in the presence of 5 mM IPTG in 10-cm diameter dishes for 24 h. Subconfluent cells were then serum-starved for an additional 18-20 h in DMEM containing 0.7% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated in phosphate-free DMEM for 45 min and then metabolically labeled with 32Pi (250 μCi/ml) for 3 h. The medium was aspirated and replaced with medium containing 50 μM forskolin or 100 μM 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (CPT-cAMP) in combination with 100 μM IBMX or medium containing equivalent amounts of dimethyl sulfoxide. Stimulations were stopped by washing the cells one time in cold phosphate-buffered saline, followed by the addition of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2) containing approximately 100 nM recombinant Rap1b loaded with GTPγS. Lysates were precleared at 4°C with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 20 min. Exogenous Rap1b was immunoprecipitated from lysates with the 12CA5 antibody, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose containing 1 mM cold GTP and ATP. Precipitates were washed extensively in lysis buffer containing 0.25% sodium deoxycholate. The phosphorylation state of Rap1b was analyzed by removing 20% of the sample for analysis on 10-20% gradient polyacrylamide gels. The remaining sample was incubated at 70°C for 20 min and loaded onto polyethyleneimine cellulose plates. The nucleotides were resolved in 0.75 M KH2P04, pH 3.4. Rap1b bound GDP and GTP were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The percentage of GTP was calculated using the equation, GTP/(1.5 GDP + GTP). We have developed a system that allows us to search for agonists capable of activating Rap1b in vivo, as measured by an increase in the ratio of bound GTP/GDP. Independent, stable cell lines expressing Rap1b constructions were isolated making use of an IPTG-inducible system (27Baim S. Labow M. Levine A. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5072-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which avoided the potential inhibitory activity of the expressed protein (Fig. 1, A and B). Exogenous Rap1b proteins were tagged at their NH2 terminus with the HA epitope. The epitope does not modify the subcellular localization of Rap1b or its ability to be phosphorylated by protein kinase A in vivo(29Altschuler D. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7527-7531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of the epitope served a dual function. It allowed us to analyze different Rap1b constructions independently of the endogenous protein for which specific immunoprecipitating antibodies do not exist. It also allowed us to include GTPγS-loaded recombinant Rap1b in the cell lysis buffer to inhibit postlysis GAP activity, a function fulfilled by the Y13-259 antibody in the Ras nucleotide assay (31Gibbs J. Marshall M. Scolnick E.M. Dixon R.F. Vogel U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20437-20442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This methodological consideration allowed us to reliably measure activation of Rap1 as reflected by an increase in the GTP/GDP-bound ratio. Cells expressing wild-type Rap1b were stimulated as indicated, lysed, and the epitope-tagged Rap1b was immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5 antibody. The phosphorylation state and the Rap1b-bound nucleotides were then determined. Preliminary agonist screening assays clearly showed that cAMP-elevating agents increased the level of phosphorylation and the bound GTP/GDP ratio. These included both receptor-mediated agents such as prostaglandin E1 and non-receptor-mediated agents such as forskolin and CPT-cAMP. The time course of the forskolin/IBMX-dependent activation of Rap1b is shown in Fig. 2. Forskolin/IBMX treatment resulted in a rapid increase in Rap1b phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A) and in general was accompanied by a 3-5-fold increase in the bound GTP/GDP ratio compared with the basal ratio (Fig. 2 B). These values are comparable with those observed for Ras activation with tyrosine kinase receptor agonists (32Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24149-24152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The forskolin-dependent activation of Rap1b clearly showed a biphasic profile with a rapid first phase (0.5-1 min) and a second sustained phase (5-30 min). This response was consistently observed. Attempts to inhibit the decrease in Rap-GTP at the 2.5-min time point were made with several phosphatase inhibitors: NaF, vanadate, okadaic acid, ATPγS, and β-glycerophosphate. All failed to change the biphasic profile observed. The activation probably represents a balance of in vivo reactions, exchange activation, and GAP inhibition, although general NDP kinases and nucleotide triphosphatases cannot be ruled out. We tested the possibility that an agonist-dependent increase in GTP hydrolysis over exchange activation might explain the decrease in the bound GTP/GDP ratio observed at 2.5 min. We generated a cell line expressing a Val-12 mutation using the same inducible system. As reported before, Rap Val-12 is impaired in its GTPase activity and resistant to the effects of Rap-GAP (33Cook S. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and so represents an invaluable tool for the examination of GAP activity versus exchange mechanisms. Rap Val-12 showed a 5-fold higher basal GTP/GDP ratio compared with the wild-type protein, confirming that the GTPase was inhibited. However, the kinetic profile after forskolin or CPT-cAMP stimulation showed the same biphasic behavior (Fig. 3). This result suggests that the involvement of GAP inhibition in the overall cAMP-dependent activation reaction is not significant. As reported before, Rap-GAP is a substrate for protein kinase A (34Polakis P. Rubinfeld B. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10780-10785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in agreement with our data, in vitro phosphorylation did not affect its specific activity (35Rubinfeld B. Crossier W.J. Albert I. Conroy L. Clark R. McCormick F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells expressing Rap Val-12 with prostaglandin E1 (10 μM) resulted in a slightly greater than 2-fold increase (23% basal to 51%) in bound GTP within 1 min, and this then dropped to 37% by 20 min poststimulation (data not shown). Another potential factor involved in the activation of Rap1b is Rap1-GDS. As discussed above, GDS action is enhanced in a cell-free system after Rap1b phosphorylation (26Hata Y. Kaibuchi K. Kawamura S. Hiroyoshi M. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6571-6577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous experiments in cell-free systems led to the hypothesis that Rap1b phosphorylation is involved in priming its own GDS-dependent activation (26Hata Y. Kaibuchi K. Kawamura S. Hiroyoshi M. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6571-6577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the effect of Rap1b phosphorylation on forskolin-dependent activation, we generated a cell line expressing a double mutant S179A/S180A (pKAA), which is not phosphorylated by protein kinase A (29Altschuler D. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7527-7531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that phosphorylation is required for activation in the first phase but is not strictly required in the second phase. Stimulation of this cell line with forskolin/IBMX showed a smaller but consistent activation over the time course analyzed (Fig. 4). The differences in the kinetic profiles may indicate that full activation of Rap1 by cAMP is complex, involving several factors, or that the unphosphorylated Rap1 is a poorer substrate for activation and so exhibits slower kinetics. It is possible that there is a functional distinction between the two phases of activation in that they could be responsible for triggering different signals. The phosphorylation data for wild-type and mutant Rap1b do not show a biphasic profile. It is possible that by gaining a greater understanding of the biphasic nature of Rap1 activation we will understand more fully the role of Rap1 phosphorylation. COOH-terminal post-translational modifications include a series of events that are important not only for membrane localization but also for appropriate targeting and interaction with other proteins. Specifically, Rap1b is geranyl-geranylated at Cys-181 (36Kawata M. Farnsworth C. Yoshida Y. Gelb M. Glomset J. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8960-8964Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 37Buss J. Quilliam L. Casey P. Solski P. Wong G. Clark R. McCormick F. Bokoch G. Der C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1523-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In COS cells, Rap1b Gly-181 (pCys) mutants failed to incorporate [14C]mevalonolactone and were shown by indirect immunofluorescence to be localized to the cytosol. A stable cell line expressing IPTG-inducible Rap1b Gly-181 was generated. The Rap1b Gly-181 protein was soluble and almost exclusively localized in the S100 fraction (data not shown). In general, Ras mutants at this position have a null phenotype. We tested whether Rap1b Gly-181 mutants could be activated in response to forskolin/IBMX. We were unable to detect any activation over the time course analyzed (Fig. 4), even though the phosphorylation of Rap1b was more rapid when compared with the wild-type protein (data not shown). These data indicate that the presence of the isoprenoid moiety is required for the activation machinery or that membrane localization is necessary for the activation step. It is interesting to note that almost all of the mammalian exchange factors isolated so far are soluble and able to utilize the non-processed protein as a substrate. An alternative explanation might be that even though the exchange factor is present in a soluble form, a membrane-bound limiting cofactor is required for the activation of the membrane-bound Rap protein. Demonstrating the existence of this cofactor will require further analysis and experimentation. These data demonstrate that Rap1b is activated in vivo in response to cAMP, strongly implicating the former's involvement in some aspect of cAMP signaling. The effect of raising intracellular cAMP levels on the transformed phenotype is well documented (38Pastan I. Johnson G.S. Anderson W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 491-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 39Chen J. Iyengar R. Science. 1994; 263: 1278-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Several recent reports showed that one component of cAMP's action is the inhibition of Map kinase activation (40Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M. Sturgill T. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 41Cook S. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 42Sevetson B. Kong X. Lawrence Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10305-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Moreover, cAMP interferes with the MAP kinase pathway through competitive inhibition at a site downstream of p21 but upstream of Raf-1 (43Burgering B. Pronk G. van Weeren P. Chardin P. Bos J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the effects of cAMP are very similar to those obtained after stable expression of Rap Val-12. We2( 2D. L. Altschuler, S. N. Peterson, M. C. Ostrowski, and E. G. Lapetina, unpublished results. ) and others have demonstrated that Rap Val-12 can inhibit MAP kinase activation (33Cook S. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Rap1 can also block signals to the Fos promoter from c-K-Ras but not c-Raf1 in transient expression assays (44Sakoda T. Kaibuchi K. Kishi K. Kishida S. Doi K. Hoshino M. Hattori S. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1705-1711PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent report, phosphorylation of an NH2-terminal Raf fragment by protein kinase A reduced the affinity of Raf-1-(1-149) for Ras in vitro(45Chuang E. Barnard D. Hettich L. Zhang X. Avruch J. Marshall M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5318-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This information provides a molecular basis for cAMP inhibition of the Ras pathway but leaves open the possibility that other cellular factors may contribute to the action of cAMP. It is tempting to speculate, based upon several previously published results (33Cook S. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 38Pastan I. Johnson G.S. Anderson W.B. Annu. Rev.

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1705-1711PubMed Google Scholar), that Rap1b plays a role in the cAMP-dependent inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway. There are several possible mechanisms by which the perinuclear Rap1b might antagonize Ras, localized in the plasma membrane. To date, we have been unable to obtain data to support direct interaction of Rap1b and Raf-1 in mammalian cells. An intriguing alternative is that upon activation, Rap may activate specific phosphatases that impinge upon the Ras pathway at the Raf-1/MEK/Map kinase activation step. Alternatively, Rap1 activation might trigger an independent function, which in combination with Raf inhibition is responsible for the full inhibitory action of cAMP. Expression of a dominant negative Rap mutant protein may allow us to resolve which, if either, of these possibilities is correct. We thank S. Baim and M. Labow for a gift of the LAP267 system and Fernando Ribeiro-Neto, Michael Campa, and Eddie Wood for critical reading of the manuscript and valuable suggestions during this work."

How TNF activates NF-κB, however, is not well understood. We examined the role of protein phosphatases in the TNF-dependent activation of NF-κB. Treatment of human myeloid ML-1a cells with TNF rapidly activated (within 30 min) NF-κB; this effect was abolished by treating cells with inhibitors of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase), including phenylarsine oxide (PAO), pervanadate, and diamide. The inhibition was dependent on the dose and occurred whether added before or at the same time as TNF. PAO also inhibited the activation even when added 15 min after the TNF treatment of cells. In contrast to inhibitors of PTPase, okadaic acid and calyculin A, which block serine-threonine phosphatase, had no effect. The effect of PTPase inhibitors was not due to the modulation of TNF receptors. Since both dithiothreitol and dimercaptopropanol reversed the inhibitory effect of PAO, critical sulfhydryl groups in the PTPase must be involved in NF-κB activation by TNF.PTPase inhibitors also blocked NF-κB activation induced by phorbol ester, ceramide, and interleukin-1 but not that activated by okadaic acid.

https://openalex.org/W2034294731,"The coupling between the peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activities of prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS) has been proposed to be mediated by a critical tyrosyl radical through a branched chain mechanism (Dietz, R., Nastainczyk, W., and Ruf, H. H. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 171, 321-328). In this study, we have examined the ability of PGHS isoform-1 (PGHS-1) tyrosyl radicals to react with arachidonate. Anaerobic addition of arachidonate following formation of the peroxide-induced wide doublet or wide singlet tyrosyl radical led to disappearance of the tyrosyl radicals and emergence of a new EPR signal, which is distinct from known PGHS-1 tyrosyl radicals. The new radical was clearly derived from arachidonate because its EPR line shape changed when 5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-octadeuterated arachidonate was used. Subsequent addition of oxygen to samples containing the fatty acyl radical resulted in regeneration of tyrosyl radical EPR. In contrast, the peroxide-generated tyrosyl radical in indomethacin-treated PGHS-1 (a narrow singlet) failed to react with arachidonate, consistent with the cyclooxygenase inhibition by indomethacin. These results indicate that the peroxide-generated wide doublet and wide singlet tyrosyl radicals serve as immediate oxidants of arachidonate bound at the cyclooxygenase active site to form a carbon-centered fatty acyl radical, which reacts with oxygen to form a hydroperoxide. These observations represent the first direct evidence of chemical coupling between the peroxidase reaction and arachidonate oxygenation in PGHS-1 and support the proposed role for a tyrosyl radical in cyclooxygenase catalysis. The coupling between the peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activities of prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS) has been proposed to be mediated by a critical tyrosyl radical through a branched chain mechanism (Dietz, R., Nastainczyk, W., and Ruf, H. H. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 171, 321-328). In this study, we have examined the ability of PGHS isoform-1 (PGHS-1) tyrosyl radicals to react with arachidonate.

INTRODUCTIONProstaglandin H synthase (PGHS)1( 1The abbreviations used are: PGHS-1prostaglandin H synthase isoform-1PGG2prostaglandin G2PGH2prostaglandin H2d8-arachidonate5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-octadeuterated arachidonateWDwide doublet tyrosyl radicalWSwide singlet tyrosyl radicalNSnarrow singlet tyrosyl radical. ) plays a key role in controlling the biosynthesis of various physiologically important prostaglandins (1Samuelsson B. Goldyne M. Granström E. Hamberg M. Hammarström S. Malmsten C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 997-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Although two distinct PGHS isozymes have been discovered in many different cells or tissues, they are believed to share the same basic catalytic mechanism (2Smith W.L. Eling T.E. Kulmacz R.J. Marnett L.J. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Type 1 PGHS (PGHS-1) thus serves as a useful prototype for detailed mechanistic study. PGHS-1 has two enzyme functions: a cyclooxygenase, which converts arachidonic acid to PGG2, and a peroxidase, which catalyzes the transformation of PGG2 to PGH2(1Samuelsson B. Goldyne M. Granström E. Hamberg M. Hammarström S. Malmsten C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 997-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 2Smith W.L. Eling T.E. Kulmacz R.J. Marnett L.J. Tsai A.-L.

A branched chain radical mechanism (Fig. SI) has been proposed to integrate the two catalytic activities (4Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In this proposal, a tyrosyl radical (Fe(IV)Tyr) is generated by an internal electron transfer in peroxidase compound I (Fe(V)), shown as step 2. The cyclooxygenase reaction itself begins when the tyrosyl radical reacts with bound arachidonate (AA) to form a fatty acyl radical (Fe(IV)Tyr/AA), shown as step 3. The bound fatty acyl radical then reacts with molecular oxygen and rearranges to form a PGG2 radical (step 4). In the final cyclooxygenase step, the tyrosyl radical is regenerated, and PGG2 is released (step 5).The tyrosyl radical mechanism nicely explains the heme dependence of both enzyme activities and the hydroperoxide requirement of the cyclooxygenase activity, and it also is consistent with x-ray crystallographic data that interposes a tyrosine residue (Tyr-385) between the heme and the arachidonic acid binding channel (5Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Results from chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis also have suggested a critical role for Tyr-385 in catalysis and radical formation (6Shimokawa T. Kulmacz R.J. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20073-20076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tsai A. Hsi L.C. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5085-5091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, the kinetic correlation of cyclooxygenase product formation and tyrosyl radical levels has provided indirect evidence that a specific wide doublet tyrosyl radical (WD) could serve as the immediate oxidizing agent in the cyclooxygenase cycle (8Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, other PGHS-1 tyrosyl radical species also are observed (8Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kulmacz R.J. Ren Y. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and direct evidence for reaction of any of the radicals with arachidonate has been lacking. In the studies described here, we have used single turnover experiments to demonstrate that the peroxidase-associated WD radical indeed reacts with arachidonic acid to form a carbon-centered radical, providing direct evidence for a key step in the proposed tyrosyl radical mechanism.MATERIALS AND METHODSArachidonic acid was purchased from NuChek Preps, Inc. (Elysian, MN). 5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-Octadeuterated arachidonic acid was a generous gift of Hoffman-La Roche (Nutley, NJ). Polar contaminants were not detected in either deuterated or unlabeled arachidonic acid when analyzed by silica gel thin layer chromatography with hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (60:60:1) as the solvent. Mass spectral analysis of the methyl ester of the deuterated arachidonate indicated a composition of 76% octadeuteration and 24% heptadeuteration. The deuterated arachidonate was not purified further. Hemin and indomethacin were obtained from Sigma. Ethyl hydroperoxide was the product of Polyscience Inc. (Warrington, PA).PGHS-1 was purified from sheep seminal vesicles (12Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. Benedetto C. McDonald-Gibson R.G. Nigam S. Slater R.F. Prostaglandins and Related Substances: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington D. C.1987: 209-227Google Scholar). The holoenzyme was prepared by replenishing the lost heme as previously described (8Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase activity was assayed by oxygen consumption rate (12Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. Benedetto C. McDonald-Gibson R.G. Nigam S. Slater R.F. Prostaglandins and Related Substances: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington D. C.1987: 209-227Google Scholar); enzyme preparations used in this study had specific activities ranging from 65 to 80 μmol of O2/min/mg of protein.The glass titration vessel used in our single turnover experiments (Fig. SII) was adapted from the original design of Dutton (13Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 226: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 14Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The PGHS-1 enzyme solution (1.1-1.5 ml) was placed in the glass vessel, and the opening was sealed by clamping down the hard plastic cap lined with a rubber gasket. The bottom portion of the glass vessel was immersed in ice water, and the enzyme was constantly stirred with a glass-encased magnet to keep the enzyme solution at 0°C. The vessel and contents were made anaerobic by five cycles of alternating vacuum (30 s) and argon replacement (5 min) through a glass valve connected to an anaerobic train (14Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid and ethyl hydroperoxide solutions contained in glass tubes sealed with rubber septa were made anaerobic by bubbling with argon for 5 min on ice. The substrates were then added in the desired sequence through the rubber septum plugs on the titration vessel cap using gas-tight Hamilton syringes.Scheme II:Diagram of the anaerobic vessel used. 1, gas-tight Hamilton syringes; 2, butyl rubber tubing connecting to the anaerobic train; 3, stainless steel transfer needle (wrapped to minimize warming from the fingers during manipulation); 4, hollow glass high-vacuum stopcock; 5, quartz EPR tube; 6, rubber septa; 7, hard plastic cap; 8, metal clamp; 9, rubber gasket; 10, glass vessel; 11, well for enzyme solution; 12, stirring magnet.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were transferred to EPR tubes through a long stainless steel transfer needle using the positive argon pressure in the vessel. For this, the transfer needle was first positioned in the titrator headspace, and the argon venting from the outside end of the needle was used to flush a prechilled EPR tube for a few seconds. Then, the tip of the needle was lowered into the enzyme solution to begin transfer. After the EPR tube was filled to a depth of about 3 cm, transfer was completed by raising the tip of the needle above the liquid surface. While still being flushed with argon, the EPR sample was frozen quickly in a dry ice/acetone bath and stored in liquid nitrogen for EPR analysis. Further aerobic reaction of individual EPR samples was achieved by immersion in a 0°C bath and mixing with a nichrome wire plunger for the desired time interval before refreezing the sample in the dry ice/acetone bath.EPR spectra were recorded at liquid nitrogen or liquid helium temperatures on a Varian E-6 spectrometer (8Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, the EPR conditions for liquid nitrogen temperature were as follows: modulation amplitude, 2 G; time constant, 1 s; power, 1 milliwatt; and temperature, 96 K. Radical concentrations were determined by double integration of the EPR signals, with reference to a copper standard (15Wertz J.E. Bolton J.R. Electron Spin Resonance. Chapman and Hall, New York1986: 462-464Google Scholar). Computer simulations of EPR spectra were done on a PC using a modified version of the POWFUN program (16Hoganson C.W. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11874-11880Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. Gerald T. Babcock and Dr. Curt Hoganson (Michigan State University).DISCUSSIONA key step in the mechanism in Fig. SI is the reaction of the hydroperoxide-induced tyrosyl radical with bound arachidonate to activate the fatty acid for reaction with oxygen. The reduction potential of the tyrosyl radical (TyrO/TyrOH) in solution at pH 7 is 0.94 V versus NHE (19DeFelippis M.R. Murthy C.P. Faraggi M. Klapper M.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4847-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Abstraction of hydrogen from the fatty acid gives a pentadienyl radical; this radical has a reduction potential (R/RH) of 0.60 V (20Koppenol W.H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A tyrosyl radical is thus a strong enough oxidant to abstract a hydrogen atom from arachidonate. The tyrosine residue believed to carry the unpaired electron in native PGHS-1, Tyr-385 (6Shimokawa T. Kulmacz R.J. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20073-20076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tsai A. Hsi L.C. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5085-5091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is located in the vicinity of both the heme and the putative fatty acid binding site (5Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Thus, having a tyrosyl radical in PGHS-1 as the oxidant for bound arachidonate is quite plausible from the structural standpoint. The new radical produced by reaction of arachidonate with tyrosyl radical is established as a fatty acyl radical by the dramatic change in line shape observed when deuterated arachidonate was used (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:). This demonstration of the ability of tyrosyl radical to form fatty acyl radical provides the first direct evidence that tyrosyl radical in native PGHS-1 actually does react with arachidonic acid as required by the proposed mechanism (Fig. SI) and is not just a marker for self-inactivation as suggested by other investigators (10Lassmann G. Odenwaller R. Curtis J.F. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20045-20055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11DeGray J.A. Lassmann G. Curtis J.F. Kennedy T.A. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Given the arrangement of double bonds in arachidonate and the fact that the fatty acid-derived radical was trapped in the absence of oxygen, this radical is most likely a pentadienyl carbon-centered radical, as depicted in Fig. 7. The neutral radical formed from abstraction of the 13-pro- S hydrogen atom of arachidonate would be expected to have its electron density delocalized over C-11-C-15, as found in model systems containing the pentadienyl structure (21Sustmann R. Schmidt H. Chem. Ber. 1979; 112: 1440-1447Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Hinchliffe A. Cobb J. J. Mol. Struct. 1974; 23: 273-279Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23Bascetta E. Gunstone F.D.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6897-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Nelson M.J. Cowling R.A. Seitz S.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4966-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The unpaired electron density is likely to be higher at C-11, C-13, and C-15 and lower at C-12 and C-14 (21Sustmann R. Schmidt H. Chem. Ber. 1979; 112: 1440-1447Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Hinchliffe A. Cobb J. J. Mol. Struct. 1974; 23: 273-279Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23Bascetta E. Gunstone F.D. Scrimgeour C.M.

Perkin Trans. 1981; 2: 633-641Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Spectral simulations were performed using the proton hyperfine coupling constants observed for a planar pentadienyl radical (21Sustmann R. Schmidt H. Chem. Ber. 1979; 112: 1440-1447Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Hinchliffe A. Cobb J. J. Mol. Struct. 1974; 23: 273-279Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23Bascetta E. Gunstone F.D. Scrimgeour C.M.

Perkin Trans. 1981; 2: 633-641Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as initial values and a range of isotropic coupling constants for the β-protons. It was assumed that the principal axes of the A and g tensors are parallel and that only one out of the two β-protons at C-10 and C-16 has significant interaction with the unpaired electron. The optimal spectrum fits achieved for the radicals from unlabeled and deuterated arachidonate are shown together with the original EPR spectra in Fig. 8. The values for the parameters used in the simulations are summarized in Table I, which also includes data from a model planar pentadienyl radical.Figure 7:Proposed structures of planar pentadienyl radicals generated by abstraction of the 13-pro(S) hydrogen from unlabeled arachidonate (upper) or d8-arachidonate (lower).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8:Simulations of EPR spectra of radicals derived from unlabeled arachidonate (A) and from d8-arachidonate (B). The simulated spectra (dottedlines) were calculated as described in the text and are compared with the actual spectra (solidlines).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IParameters used to simulate EPR spectra of radicals observed in reactions with unlabeled and deuterated arachidonate Open table in a new tab A satisfactory simulation was obtained for the radical derived from unlabeled arachidonic acid (Fig. 8 A and Table I) using coupling constants of 1 (2H), 9.8 (2H), 5 (1H), 7 (1H), and 12 (1H) G. A line width of 4.1 G was used to reflect the poor resolution in the original spectrum. The hyperfine coupling constants for the first two sets of doublet protons can thus be assigned to those associated with C-12/C-14 and C-11/C-15, respectively, whereas the other three coupling constants are associated with the protons at C-13 and one each of the β-protons associated with either C-10 or C-16 (Fig. 7). The EPR spectrum produced by reaction of PGHS-1 tyrosyl radical with arachidonate can thus be reasonably ascribed to the expected carbon-centered pentadienyl radical on the fatty acid. The radical observed directly in the present experiments may well be the parent of a spin-trapped adduct previously reported (27Schreiber J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The simulation for the EPR signal with deuterated arachidonate was less satisfactory (Fig. 8 B). Based on the chemical structure shown in Fig. 7, the radical spectrum would be expected to have proton hyperfine structure caused by three protons: the single proton at C-13 and the β-proton pairs at C-10 and C-16. Such splitting would produce a quadruplet radical EPR. However, a fifth splitting was actually observed in samples prepared from three different batches of PGHS-1 (Fig. 8 B). This additional splitting may reflect the additional proton in the 24 mol % of d7-arachidonate present in the deuterated arachidonate used for the experiments. However, the location(s) of the additional proton could not be determined from the mass spectral analyses, and so no attempt was made to account for it explicitly in the EPR simulation, which was based on d8-arachidonate. The coupling constants giving the optimal simulation for the d8-arachidonate radical structure (Figs. 7 and 8 and Table I) are 1 (4H), 9.6 (1H), 11.6 (1H), and 13 (1H) G and a line width of 5 G. As the hyperfine interaction from a deuteron is only one-sixth that of a proton, the first four equivalent protons thus are the deuterons substituted at C-11, C-12, C-14, and C-15 (Fig. 7).A tyrosyl radical plays a central role in the branched chain mechanism proposed for cyclooxygenase catalysis by PGHS-1 (Fig. SI and Ref. 4Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As required by the mechanism, reaction of pure PGHS-1 with hydroperoxide can produce a tyrosyl radical (9Kulmacz R.J. Ren Y. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8760-8771Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Karthein R. Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In fact, detailed EPR studies have detected at least three types of hydroperoxide-induced radical signals in the enzyme, all ascribed to tyrosyl radicals (8Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kulmacz R.J. Ren Y. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G.

Biochem. 1988; 171: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A WD arising from a tyrosyl radical with a strained ring orientation is observed early during reaction of native enzyme with hydroperoxide (9Kulmacz R.J. Ren Y. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8760-8771Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Barry B.A. El-Deeb M.K. Sandusky P.O. Babcock G.T. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1988; 171: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). PGHS-1, whose cyclooxygenase activity has been inhibited with agents such as indomethacin, produces NS EPR characteristic of a tyrosyl radical with a relaxed ring orientation (8Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kulmacz R.J. Ren Y. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G.

Chem. 1990; 265: 20139-20143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PGHS-1 inactivated during catalysis also produces an NS EPR but with somewhat less distinct hyperfine features than observed with the indomethacin-treated enzyme (8Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kulmacz R.J. Ren Y. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8760-8771Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). WS EPR signals also are observed (8Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kulmacz R.J. Ren Y. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EPR of the WS radical produced under self-inactivation conditions can be accounted for by the sum of the corresponding WD and NS radicals (10Lassmann G. Odenwaller R. Curtis J.F. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20045-20055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11DeGray J.A. Lassmann G. Curtis J.F. Kennedy T.A. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not by the sum of the WD from native enzyme and the NS from indomethacin-treated enzyme.2( 2A.-L. Tsai, unpublished results. ) Thus, there may actually be two types of NS radicals. Comparisons of the kinetics of the various tyrosyl radicals with the cyclooxygenase kinetics have indicated that the WD radical is present at appreciable concentrations during cyclooxygenase catalysis (8Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It is important to note that the WD and WS radicals associated with PGHS-1 with active cyclooxygenase (8Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reacted with arachidonate (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:), whereas the NS radical associated with inactivated cyclooxygenase (9Kulmacz R.J.

This demonstrates that reaction with arachidonate requires particular PGHS-1 tyrosyl radicals, and it links the reaction to cyclooxygenase catalysis rather than to nonspecific fatty acid oxidation. Further, the observation that the fatty acyl radical is converted back to the tyrosyl radical upon reaction with oxygen is exactly the behavior proposed for the arachidonate radical intermediate in cyclooxygenase catalysis (Fig. SI). The evidence placing the reaction of tyrosyl radical with arachidonate within the context of cyclooxygenase catalysis indicates that the observed reaction corresponds to step 3 in the mechanism in Fig. SI. In summary, the results of the present study provide strong support for the key initial cyclooxygenase step in the tyrosyl radical mechanism proposed for PGHS-1 catalysis. INTRODUCTIONProstaglandin H synthase (PGHS)1( 1The abbreviations used are: PGHS-1prostaglandin H synthase isoform-1PGG2prostaglandin G2PGH2prostaglandin H2d8-arachidonate5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-octadeuterated arachidonateWDwide doublet tyrosyl radicalWSwide singlet tyrosyl radicalNSnarrow singlet tyrosyl radical. ) plays a key role in controlling the biosynthesis of various physiologically important prostaglandins (1Samuelsson B. Goldyne M. Granström E. Hamberg M. Hammarström S. Malmsten C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 997-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Although two distinct PGHS isozymes have been discovered in many different cells or tissues, they are believed to share the same basic catalytic mechanism (2Smith W.L. Eling T.E. Kulmacz R.J. Marnett L.J. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Type 1 PGHS (PGHS-1) thus serves as a useful prototype for detailed mechanistic study. PGHS-1 has two enzyme functions: a cyclooxygenase, which converts arachidonic acid to PGG2, and a peroxidase, which catalyzes the transformation of PGG2 to PGH2(1Samuelsson B. Goldyne M. Granström E. Hamberg M. Hammarström S. Malmsten C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 997-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 2Smith W.L. Eling T.E. Kulmacz R.J. Marnett L.J. Tsai A.-L.

A branched chain radical mechanism (Fig. SI) has been proposed to integrate the two catalytic activities (4Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In this proposal, a tyrosyl radical (Fe(IV)Tyr) is generated by an internal electron transfer in peroxidase compound I (Fe(V)), shown as step 2. The cyclooxygenase reaction itself begins when the tyrosyl radical reacts with bound arachidonate (AA) to form a fatty acyl radical (Fe(IV)Tyr/AA), shown as step 3. The bound fatty acyl radical then reacts with molecular oxygen and rearranges to form a PGG2 radical (step 4). In the final cyclooxygenase step, the tyrosyl radical is regenerated, and PGG2 is released (step 5).The tyrosyl radical mechanism nicely explains the heme dependence of both enzyme activities and the hydroperoxide requirement of the cyclooxygenase activity, and it also is consistent with x-ray crystallographic data that interposes a tyrosine resi"

Previous work has shown that Asp124, which is located close to the internal substrate-binding cavity, carries out a nucleophilic attack on the C-α of the alkylhalide, displacing the halogen. The resulting alkyl-enzyme intermediate is subsequently hydrolyzed. In order to study the role of His289 in the hydrolysis of the intermediate, a His289→ Gln mutant was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis.

Using ion spray mass spectrometry, accumulation of the covalent alkyl-enzyme and binding of the alkyl moiety of the substrate to an Asp124-containing tryptic peptide were shown. Fluorescence-quenching experiments indicated that halide ions are strongly bound by the alkyl-enzyme but not by the substrate-free enzyme. The results show that His289 is the base catalyst for the dealkylation of the covalent intermediate, but that it is not essential for the initial nucleophilic attack of Asp124 on the C-1 atom of the haloalkane.

INTRODUCTIONThe first step in the degradation of 1,2-dichloroethane by bacteria is hydrolytic conversion to 2-chloroethanol catalyzed by haloalkane dehalogenase. The enzyme from Xanthobacter autotrophicus hydrolyzes a broad range of haloalkanes to the corresponding alcohols, without a requirement for cofactors or oxygen. The sequence of the gene (dhlA) that encodes the 310-amino acid enzyme is known (1Janssen D.B. Pries F. Van der Ploeg J. Kazemier B. Terpstra P. Witholt B. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6791-6799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the x-ray structure was determined (2Franken S.M. Rozeboom H. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 3Verschueren K.H.G. Franken S.M. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 856-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The protein is composed of a main domain, which is formed by an eight-stranded β-sheet and α-helices, and a cap domain, which is formed by helices and loops located on top of the main domain. On the basis of the topology of the main domain, haloalkane dehalogenase was classified as a member of the α/β hydrolase fold enzymes (4Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B.W. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). This group of hydrolytic proteins have a conserved arrangement of active site residues in the main domain, forming a catalytic triad.Two tryptophans that line an internal cavity of 37 Å3, which is the substrate binding site, bind the halogen atom of the substrate and halide ions (5Verschueren K.H.G.

On the basis of x-ray crystallographic studies (5Verschueren K.H.G. Kingma J. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Janssen D.B. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9031-9037Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Verschueren K.H.G. Seljée F. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W.

Jeronimus-Stratingh C.M. Bruins A.P. Janssen D.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1242-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), Asp124 was proposed to act as a nucleophile, causing displacement of the halide ion and formation of an alkyl-enzyme intermediate. The aspartate is located on the nucleophile elbow, a conserved structural element present in the main domain of α/β hydrolase fold enzymes (4Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B.W. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). The alkyl-enzyme ester bond of the covalent intermediate was proposed to be hydrolyzed by water. A water molecule could be activated by His289, which is also at a conserved position in the α/β hydrolase fold structure and may act as a proton acceptor (Fig. 1). The “charge relay” residue that activates His289 is Asp260, which is also present at a conserved position in these enzymes.In this study, we analyze the properties of a His289→ Gln mutant and show that the histidine is essential for hydrolysis of the covalent intermediate but not for its formation. Mutation of His289 and alkylation of Asp124 were also found to influence the affinity of the enzyme for halide ions and the rate of substrate-independent exchange of the carboxylate oxygens of Asp124 with solvent water.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAll reagents were purchased from Merck or Sigma. Restriction enzymes and other molecular biology enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim. α-Chymotrypsin and L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin were obtained from Worthington Biochemical Corp., NJ. All DNA primers were purchased from Eurosequence BV, Groningen. DNA sequencing was done with the T7 sequencing kit from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. H218O (97%) was obtained from Isotec Inc., Miamisburg, OH.Construction of the Mutant H289QMutants were constructed by two consecutive PCR1( 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. ) reactions. Wild-type dhlA DNA was amplified with the mutant primer 5’-GCGGACGCTGGCCAGTTCGTACA (Gln codon underlined) and the antisense primer located downstream of the dhlA gene 5’-ATAGAATTCATGGATCCTCAGTTTTCGTACCGGCACCGG (BamHI site underlined). The PCR product was elongated by a subsequent PCR reaction with primer 5’-AACCCCTCGAGATAGCGGACCC (XhoI site underlined) and the above downstream primer. The new PCR product was used as mutant DNA and exchanged with the corresponding fragment of a derivative of the haloalkane dehalogenase expression vector pPJ123 (8Schanstra J.P. Rink R. Pries F. Janssen D.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which contained an additional XhoI site in the dhlA gene,2( 2F. Pries, G. H. Krooshof, and D. B. Janssen, unpublished results. ) and finally recloned in the much better DhlA expression vector pELA (8Schanstra J.P. Rink R. Pries F. Janssen D.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sequences were confirmed by T7 DNA polymerase dideoxy sequencing (9Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52363) Google Scholar).Expression and Purification of Haloalkane DehalogenaseWild-type and mutant H289Q haloalkane dehalogenase were purified from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as described by Schanstra et al.(8Schanstra J.P. Rink R. Pries F. Janssen D.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells with pELA constructs expressing haloalkane dehalogenase were grown at 30°C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 of about 1. Cultivation was continued at 17°C, and IPTG (0.4 mM) was added after 1 h as an inducer for DhlA expression. Cells were harvested after 16 h (A600 2), washed with TEMAG buffer (25 mM Tris•SO4, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium azide, and 10% (v/v) glycerol), resuspended in TEMAG buffer, and sonicated for 10 s/ml cell suspension. Cell debris and other nonsoluble material were removed by centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 60 min. This was followed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and hydroxylapatite chromatography to yield pure enzyme (8Schanstra J.P. Rink R. Pries F. Janssen D.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All enzyme samples used were more than 99% pure as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Stocks of the enzyme were stored in TEMAG buffer. For incubations with H218O, the enzyme was concentrated by ultrafiltration over an Amicon PM10 filter to 10-20 mg/ml. Stoichiometric bromide release from 1,2-dibromoethane was tested with enzyme concentrated to 42 mg/ml.AssaysMeasurements of haloalkane dehalogenase activity with different substrates were performed by following halide liberation with a colorimetric assay as described previously (1Janssen D.B. Pries F. Van der Ploeg J. Kazemier B. Terpstra P. Witholt B. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6791-6799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay is done in 1 N nitric acid and thus results in denaturation of the enzyme. Bromide release from 1,2-dibromoethane by a high concentration of DhlA was tested in incubation mixtures containing 1.2 mM enzyme, 3 mM 1,2-dibromoethane, and 50 mM Tris•SO4, pH 8.2, in a total volume of 500 μl. Halide liberation was measured colorimetrically after 30 s and 5 min of incubation at 30°C. Calculations were corrected for the absorbance caused by enzyme, using a control incubation containing no substrate. Protein concentrations were determined with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm.The N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined by Eurosequence BV, Groningen, using automatic Edman degradation (10Chang J.-Y. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) with an Applied Biosystems model 477A sequencer. In the wild-type and mutant dehalogenases produced by pELA-based expression vectors, the N-terminal sequence of the enzyme is MVNAIR instead of MINAIR, which reduces the molecular weight of native DhlA to 34,990.Fluorescence MeasurementsFluorescence spectra and fluorescence quenching by halide or substrate were determined with an Aminco SPF500-C spectrofluorometer at 25°C as described previously (5Verschueren K.H.G. Kingma J. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Janssen D.B. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9031-9037Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All incubations were done using 1 μM dehalogenase in TEMAG buffer with an excitation wavelength of 290 nm. Emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm.Incubations with H218OIncubations of dehalogenase with H218O were carried out in 100 μl of incubation mixtures containing 0.1 mM dehalogenase, 50 mM Tris•SO4, pH 8.2, and 48 or 83% H218O for the wild-type and H289Q DhlA, respectively. After 2.5 min or 3 h at 30°C, 14 μl of 2 M ammonium acetate/ammonium carbonate, pH 8.0, and 5 μl of 1 mg/ml trypsin, freshly dissolved in 0.2 M of the same buffer, were added. Digestion was carried out for 4 h at 37°C. Controls were performed similarly but with 1,2-dibromoethane and 1-bromopropane omitted.HPLC Isolation of the Peptide FragmentsTrypsin cleavage was carried out with 5-20 mg/ml haloalkane dehalogenase and 0.05-0.2 mg/ml trypsin in 0.2 M ammonium acetate/ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8. After 4 h at 37°C, the mixture was separated by reversed phase HPLC on a Nucleosil 10C18 column, using a linear gradient of 0-67% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as the eluant. Eluting peptides were either subjected directly to mass spectrometric analysis or collected, lyophilized, and used for further experiments. The alkylated mutant enzyme was significantly less sensitive to trypsin digestion, and therefore a 4-fold higher trypsin concentration and an incubation time of 20 h were used.For determining incorporation of 18O from [18O]H2O in Asp124, trypsin cleavage was done as described above, and fragments were isolated by HPLC using 0-67% acetonitrile in 0.1% ammoniumacetate, pH 6, as the solvent instead of trifluoroacetic acid. The 24-amino acid peptide containing the nucleophilic aspartate (Asn117-Arg140) was subsequently digested by chymotrypsin, and a pentapeptide (Val121-Trp125) containing Asp124 was isolated by HPLC as described before (7Pries F. Kingma J. Pentenga M. van Pouderoyen G. Jeronimus-Stratingh C.M. Bruins A.P. Janssen D.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1242-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Control experiments and previous work (7Pries F. Kingma J. Pentenga M. van Pouderoyen G. Jeronimus-Stratingh C.M. Bruins A.P. Janssen D.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1242-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) showed that no significant exchange of carboxylate oxygens with solvent water oxygen occurred after trypsin digestion of the dehalogenase. The C-terminal carboxylate of the 24-mer is cleaved off during chemotrypsin digestion.Ion Spray Mass SpectrometryFor mass spectrometry, lyophilized peptides were dissolved at approximately 100 nmol/ml in a solution of 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% (v/v) methanol in water and analyzed by pneumatically assisted electrospray ionization on a Nermag R 3010 quadrupole instrument as described previously (11Bruins A.P. Covey T.R. Henion J.D. Anal. Chem. 1987; 59: 2642-2646Crossref Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 12Bruins A.P. Beaugrand C. Proc. 36th ASMS Confer. on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics. 1988; : 1242Google Scholar). Data acquisition and data reduction took place by means of the standard Nermag SIDAR software. Each peptide solution was examined by full scan mass spectra recorded in 1-atomic mass unit steps in order to confirm the identity of the peptide and to determine the incorporation of 18O.Whole proteins were also analyzed by ion spray mass spectrometry (13Covey T.R. Bonner R.F. Shushan B.I. Henion J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Proteins were dissolved in a solution of 1% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% (v/v) methanol in water. Multiply charged ion mass spectra were recorded in 1-atomic mass unit steps.Alkylation of Asp124-containing peptides was determined by direct introduction of the HPLC column eluate into the mass spectrometer using a Nucleosil 10C18 reversed phase column for separation and a 0-67% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for elution.Gas Chromatography AnalysisThe presence of 2-bromoethanol and 1-bromopropane in dialyzed enzyme solutions was measured by gas chromatography. The samples were extracted with diethylether containing 1-bromohexane as the internal standard. Analysis and fitting of the data were performed as described by Schanstra et al.(8Schanstra J.P. Rink R. Pries F. Janssen D.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), with the modification that for 1-bromopropane the temperature program of the GC started with 3-min isothermal operation at 30 instead of 45°C.RESULTSActivity of the H289Q Haloalkane DehalogenaseMutant H289Q haloalkane dehalogenase was constructed by PCR mutagenesis, expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified. Using incubations containing 0.8 mg/ml of enzyme (22 μM) and 5 mM substrate at pH 8.2, no catalytic activity was found with 1,2-dibromoethane and dibromomethane (detection limit 0.006 units/mg protein). The wild-type enzyme has an activity with 1,2-dibromoethane of 4 units/mg of protein under these conditions. Thus, the activity of the mutant was reduced more than 660-fold.The possibility that bromide was released stoichiometrically to enzyme by a large amount of mutant DhlA was checked with 1,2-dibromoethane. Incubation of 1.2 mM H289Q DhlA with 3 mM 1,2-dibromoethane led to the release of 1.1 ± 0.2 mM bromide after 30 s and 1.02 ± 0.2 mM bromide after 5 min, as determined by colorimetric analysis. No formation of 2-bromoethanol could be detected by gas chromatography (detection limit, 0.1 mM), while the concentration of 1,2-dibromoethane had decreased by 31%. The data indicate that after the first stoichiometric release of bromide, the enzyme activity was completely blocked and that the covalent intermediate accumulated.Identification of the Covalent Alkyl-EnzymeTo determine whether a covalent alkyl-enzyme did indeed accumulate during incubation of H289Q DhlA with bromoalkane, whole enzyme and a 24-mer peptide containing Asp124 were analyzed by ion spray mass spectrometry.Analysis of H289Q enzyme, which was not incubated with substrate and dialyzed against water, showed the presence of multiply protonated ions with the number of positive charges varying from 18 to 42 (Fig. 2 A). N-terminal sequencing of the enzyme showed that 80% of the mutant H289Q haloalkane dehalogenase molecules had lost the N-terminal methionine. The molecular mass was calculated from the observed m/z values of multiply charged ions (13Covey T.R. Bonner R.F. Shushan B.I. Henion J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The experimentally determined molecular mass was 34,990 (±2), which is identical to the molecular mass predicted from the amino acid sequence of H289Q DhlA. The mass of H289Q DhlA that had reacted with 1,2-dibromoethane was determined in the same way (Fig. 2 B). A value of 35,100 (±2) was found, which is 110 mass units higher than the mass of the unreacted mutant protein. This is very close to the calculated mass increment upon incorporation of the bromoethyl group, which is 107.Figure 2:Partial ion spray mass spectra of the H289Q haloalkane dehalogenase incubated without (A) and with (B) 1,2-dibromoethane as substrate. Both spectra were obtained with an injection of 20 μl of a 10 nmol/ml protein solution. Multiply protonated protein ion series in A are observed from m/z 834 (42 charges) through m/z 1944 (18 charges) and in B from m/z 837 (42 charges) through 1951 (18 charges).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The nucleophilic aspartate (Asp124) of DhlA is present in a 24-amino acid tryptic peptide that can be isolated by reversed phase HPLC (7Pries F.

To show that this peptide is alkylated during reaction of H289Q DhlA with 1,2-dibromoethane, the enzyme was incubated with substrate, digested with trypsin and analyzed by HPLC/mass-spectrometry (Fig. 3). The peak corresponding to the 24-amino acid peptide (mass, 2601 Da) was detected in trypsin-cleaved H289Q enzyme that was not exposed to a bromoalkane but was no longer present in enzyme reacted with 1,2-dibromoethane or 1-bromopropane (Table I and Fig. 3). Instead, peaks with longer retention times were detected after trypsin cleavage of enzyme reacted with the alkylbromides. Mass spectrometry showed the presence of fragments of 2643, 3140, and 4210 Da (accuracy ± 1 Da) in enzyme reacted with 1-bromopropane. This corresponds to the 24-mer Asn117-Arg140, the 28-mer Leu113-Arg140, and the 37-mer Asn104-Arg140, each with a propyl group attached. Analysis of fragments obtained by trypsin cleavage of H289Q enzyme incubated with 1,2-dibromoethane revealed the presence of the same peptides as obtained from the 1-bromopropane-incubated protein but with a molecular mass that was 65 Da higher, which corresponds to the difference between the propyl and bromoethyl groups.Figure 3:Reversed-phase HPLC elution profiles of proteolytic fragments.

The binding of halides to wild-type haloalkane dehalogenase was previously determined by quenching of fluorescence of the two tryptophan residues that form the halide binding site (5Verschueren K.H.G. Kingma J. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Janssen D.B. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9031-9037Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). At pH 8, wild-type enzyme bound chloride (5Verschueren K.H.G. Kingma J. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Janssen D.B. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9031-9037Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and bromide ions (Table III) with Kdvalues of 57 and 5.2 mM, respectively. Dissociation constants for chloride could not be determined with mutant H289Q DhlA at pH 8 or pH 6 since quenching was very low at concentrations up to 800 mM. At pH 8, significant quenching of fluorescence of H289Q DhlA was also not detected with 200 mM bromide, a concentration above which it became an aspecific collisional quencher. Some quenching was observed with bromide at pH 6. The degree of quenching was only 15%, as compared with 30% with the wild-type, and the Kdwas 4.2 ± 0.7 mM (Table II). This indicates that binding of bromide and chloride to the H289Q mutant was very poor as compared with the wild-type enzyme.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Table IIFluorescence quenching of dehalogenases by bromide Open table in a new tab Strong quenching of fluorescence was observed after incubation of H289Q DhlA with low concentrations of 1,2-dibromoethane and 1-bromopropane, indicating that Trp125 and Trp175 could still bind substrate and/or bromide after alkylation (Fig. 4). Quenching with 1,2-dibromoethane was somewhat stronger than with 1-bromopropane. Dialysis of enzyme incubated with 1,2-dibromoethane or 1-bromopropane against TEMAG buffer or water did not abolish quenching of fluorescence, indicating that the quenching is caused either by covalent modification or by very tight binding.Figure 4:Fluorescence spectra of mutant H289Q haloalkane dehalogenase and quenching by 1,2-dibromoethane or 1-bromopropane.

To determine whether a bromopropane molecule was present in the active site, 0.93 mM H289Q DhlA was incubated with 5 mM 1-bromopropane for 10 min at 30°C and pH 8.2 and then dialyzed for 48 h against TEMAG. The mixture was extracted with diethylether. No bromopropane could be detected by GC analysis (detection limit, 0.01 mM). Furthermore, titration of H289Q DhlA with 1-bromopropane indicated that the quenching of fluorescence was maximal after addition of an equimolar amount of 1-bromopropane (Fig. 5). These data suggest that the persistence of quenching upon dialysis is caused by a tightly bound bromide ion or by the covalently attached alkyl group, and not by excess substrate bound to the enzyme.Figure 5:Complete quenching of fluorescence of H289Q mutant haloalkane dehalogenase by a stoichiometric amount of 1-bromopropane. The enzyme concentration used in each measurement was 1 μM, and the fluorescence was measured after addition of varying concentrations of 1-bromopropane. Fluorescence was measured at λmax = 346 nm and is given relative to the unquenched fluorescence of the H289Q mutant enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether halide ions remained bound to the enzyme after hydrolysis of the C-Br bond during formation of the covalent adduct, 0.4 mM enzyme was incubated with 0.4 mM 1-bromopropane for 10 min at 30°C. Subsequently, enzyme and buffer were separated by centrifugation on a Centricon-10 microconcentrator membrane (cutoff, 10,000). Halide assays revealed the presence of 0.15 mM bromide in the dialysate. Exact determination of the amount of bromide bound to enzyme was not possible due to the high background caused by the protein, but it was estimated that 0.8 ± 0.2 mM bromide was present in the enzyme fraction that contained 1.6 mM dehalogenase. Thus, halide ions were not completely released from the alkylated enzyme into the surrounding medium.To determine the binding strength of alkylated enzyme and halide, H289Q enzyme incubated as above with 1-bromopropane was extensively dialyzed against TEMAG buffer, pH 7.5. Colorimetric analysis indicated that the dialyzed enzyme contained less than 10% (on a molar basis) bromide. Fluorescence quenching persisted, however. Both at pH 6 and pH 8, the addition of bromide to the diluted dialyzed protein (1 μM) caused an increase in fluorescence with typical ligand binding profiles and Kdvalues that were much lower than those of wild-type or free H289Q mutant DhlA (Table II). These observations are in agreement with quenching of fluorescence of alkylated enzyme being caused by the alkyl group of the bound substrate and/or self quenching of the two tryptophan residues. No excimer fluorescence emission peak at higher wavelength (350-450 nm) was detected with the bromide-free dialyzed alkylated enzyme. Apparently, the alkylated enzyme binds bromide ions much more tightly than the substrate-free mutant or wild-type enzymes (Table II), and the degree of quenching is lower with a bromide ion present in the active site than in the bromide-free alkylated H289Q dehalogenase (Fig. 4).Exchange of Carboxylate Oxygens of Asp124with Solvent WaterBased on sequence homology, eukaryotic epoxide hydrolase was proposed to have an overall structure and reaction mechanism similar to haloalkane dehalogenase. Lacourciere and Armstrong (14Lacourciere G.M. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 10466-10467Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar) have incubated epoxide hydrolase under single turnover conditions with substrate and H218O, dialyzed the enzyme, and reincubated it with substrate in the absence of H218O. This led to incorporation of 18O in the second product. Similar experiments performed by us with haloalkane dehalogenase failed since there was too much substrate-independent exchange of the Asp124 carboxylate oxygens of the intact wild-type enzyme with solvent water during dialysis (data not shown). The role of His289 in this exchange reaction was investigated by comparing the rates of 18O incorporation in the absence of substrate between wild-type DhlA and H289Q DhlA. The exchange was stopp"

We report here the isolation and disruption of the gene, CKB1, encoding the 38-kDa β subunit. The predicted Ckb1 sequence includes the N-terminal autophosphorylation site, internal acidic domain, and potential metal binding motif (CPX3C-X22-CPXC) present in other β subunits but is unique in that it contains two additional autophosphorylation sites as well as a 30-amino-acid acidic insert. CKB1 is located on the left arm of chromosome VII, approximately 33 kilobases from the centromere and does not correspond to any previously characterized genetic locus. Haploid and diploid strains lacking either or both β subunit genes are viable, demonstrating that the regulatory subunit of CKII is dispensable in S. cerevisiae. Such strains exhibit wild type behavior with regard to growth on both fermentable and nonfermentable carbon sources, mating, sporulation, spore germination, and resistance to heat-shock and nitrogen starvation, but are salt-sensitive. Salt sensitivity is specific for NaCl and LiCl and is not observed with KCl or agents which increase osmotic pressure alone. These data suggest a role for CKII in ion homeostasis in S. cerevisiae.

Advances in Second Messenger and Phosphoprotein Research. Vol. 23. Raven Press, New York1991: 123-164Google Scholar). The CKII holoenzyme is a constitutively active α2β2 heterotetramer composed of catalytic (α) and regulatory (β) subunits. Two distinct α subunits encoded by separate genes are present in most organisms, although only a single α subunit isoform has so far been identified in Drosophila melanogaster (Glover et al., 1983Glover C.V.C. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3256-3258Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), Caenorhabditis elegans (Hu and Rubin, 1990aHu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Schzosaccharomyces pombe (Roussou and Draetta, 1994Roussou I. Draetta G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 576-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Bidwai et al., 1994Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Glover C.V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Arabidopsis thaliana (Collinge and Walker, 1994Collinge M.A. Walker J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) also contain two distinct β subunits. A second β-like polypeptide, the product of the Stellate locus, has been identified in D. melanogaster (Livak, 1990Livak K.J. Genetics. 1990; 124: 303-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stellate is expressed exclusively in the testis, but its biological function and relevance to CKII are unknown. CKII phosphorylates a Ser or Thr followed by a stretch of acidic residues, and numerous endogenous substrates have been identified, including diverse transcription factors, nuclear oncoproteins, and components of signal transduction cascades (Pinna, 1990Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In vitro, CKII activity is stimulated by polybasic compounds, such as polylysine and protamine (Meggio et al., 1987Meggio F. Brunati A.M. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and inhibited by polyacidic compounds, such as polyaspartate and polyglutamate (Meggio et al., 1983Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Marchiori F. Borin G. FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but the relevance of these compounds to in vivo regulation of CKII activity is unknown. casein kinase II Saccharomyces cerevisiae kilobase(s) base pair(s). The physiological role of the catalytic subunit has been explored by molecular-genetic analysis in budding and fission yeast. In S. cerevisiae, simultaneous disruption of the CKA1 and CKA2 genes encoding the α and α’ subunits is lethal (Padmanabha et al., 1990Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Arrested cells are enlarged and exhibit morphologies reminiscent of mutations which affect the cell division cycle. Analysis of a strain carrying a temperature-sensitive cka2 allele indicates that CKII is required for normal cell cycle progression in both G1 and G2/M (Hanna, 1991Hanna D.E. Construction and Analysis of Conditional Alleles of Casein Kinase II in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 1991Google Scholar). Depletion of CKII activity also results in Ca2+-dependent cell-cell aggregation or flocculation, suggesting alteration in the structure or function of the cell wall (Padmanabha et al., 1990Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In S. pombe, the catalytic subunit appears to be encoded by a single gene, cka1+, which has been isolated both by the polymerase chain reaction (Roussou and Draetta, 1994Roussou I. Draetta G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 576-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and as a temperature-sensitive recessive lethal mutation, orb5, which confers a spherical morphology at the non-permissive temperature (Snell and Nurse, 1994Snell V. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Genetic and cytological analysis of orb5 strains indicates a role for CKII in the reinitiation of polarized growth following cytokinesis (Snell and Nurse, 1994Snell V. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The available data strongly suggest that CKII performs an essential function in both yeasts, but the rather different phenotypes observed make it unclear to what extent the physiological role of the enzyme is conserved. The role of the regulatory subunit has remained enigmatic. Comparisons of the free catalytic subunit with native or reconstituted holoenzyme in vitro have established several biochemical functions of this polypeptide. First, the β subunit stabilizes the catalytic subunit against proteolytic degradation and denaturation by heat or urea treatment (Issinger et al., 1992Issinger O.-G. Brockel C. Boldyreff B. Pelton J.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6098-6103Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar; Meggio et al., 1992bMeggio F. Boldyreff B. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Second, it serves as a general activator of the catalytic subunit, stimulating it approximately 5-fold against most substrates at physiological ionic strength (Bidwai et al., 1993Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Glover C.V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar; Hu and Rubin, 1990bHu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1992; 204: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Third, it modulates CKII specificity by inhibiting the phosphorylation of a subset of potential substrates, including calmodulin (Bidwai et al., 1993Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Glover C.V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar; Meggio et al., 1992bMeggio F. Boldyreff B. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Fourth, it plays an important role in mediating the activation of the catalytic subunit by polybasic effectors (Bidwai et al., 1993Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Glover C.V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar; Hu and Rubin, 1990bHu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20609-20615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Lin et al., 1991Lin W.J. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1992; 205: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The β subunit also undergoes autophosphorylation, at Ser2 in the mammalian enzyme (Boldyreff et al., 1993aBoldyreff B. James P. Staudenmann W. Issinger O.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but the functional significance of this reaction is not known. Roussou and Draetta, 1994Roussou I. Draetta G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 576-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar have recently reported the isolation and disruption of the ckb1+ gene encoding the β subunit of S. pombe CKII. Loss of ckb1+ function is not lethal but results in slow growth, cell-cell aggregation, and cold sensitivity. ckb1 cells exhibit an abnormal, rounded morphology, reminiscent of the orb5 mutation and display intense and irregular staining with Calcofluor, suggesting abberant structure and/or composition of the cell wall. Overexpression of ckb1+ results in slow growth and inhibits cytokinesis, leading to the accumulation of multiseptated cells. Purified CKII from S. cerevisiae contains two distinct regulatory subunits, β and β’ (Bidwai et al., 1994Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Glover C.V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Disruption of the CKB2 gene, encoding the 32-kDa β’ subunit, has no overt phenotypic effect in a wild type background but leads to slow growth and flocculation in a cka1 or cka2 background (Reed et al., 1994Reed J.C. Bidwai A.P. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18192-18200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the occurrence of some shared phenotypes in the two systems is intriguing, the interpretation of the S. cerevisiae results is obviously hampered by the potential functional redundancy of the β subunit. We report here the isolation of the CKB1 gene encoding the 38-kDa β subunit of Sc CKII. In contrast to S. pombe ckb1 strains, S. cerevisiae strains lacking both regulatory subunits exhibit essentially wild type behavior on normal media. However, we find that strains lacking either or both β subunits are specifically sensitive to high concentrations of Na+ or Li+. Mutations in at least two other protein kinases and the protein phosphatase, calcineurin, also affect salt tolerance in S. cerevisiae, suggesting that CKII may function in a complex pathway regulating ion homeostasis in this organism. The strains of S. cerevisiae used in this study are listed in Table I. Unless indicated, all strains were grown at 29°C in YPD or complete dropout medium as described (Ausubel et al., 1987Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York, NY1987Google Scholar). YPGal, super YPD/YPGal (YPD/YPGal supplemented with all amino acids, adenine, and uracil at concentrations as listed), and sporulation medium were prepared as described (Ausubel et al., 1987Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York, NY1987Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α (Clonetech laboratories), XL1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and Y1090 (Young and Davis, 1983Young R.A. Davis R.W. Science. 1983; 222: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) were grown in Luria broth containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin and/or 15 μg/ml tetracycline as appropriate. Media components were purchased from Difco Laboratories with amino acids, and other supplements were from Sigma.Table IS. cerevisiae strains Open table in a new tab We previously determined the sequence of several internal tryptic peptides derived from the 38-kDa β subunit (Bidwai et al., 1994Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Glover C.V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The sequence of one of these peptides, FGHEYFCQVPTEFIEDDFN, was used to design oligonucleotide probes specific for the 38-kDa polypeptide (the Cys and second Asp of this sequence, which were not identified in the original report, were assigned based on homology with other β subunits and a weak signal in the sequencing run, respectively). Two non-overlapping, 64-fold degenerate, antisense probes were synthesized: 5’-AC (C/T)TG (A/G)CA (A/G)AA (A/G)TA (C/T)TC (A/G)TG-3’ (CKB1-P3), and 5’-TT (A/G)AA (A/G)TC (A/G)TC (C/T)TC IAT (A/G)AA (C/T)TC-3’ (CKB1-P4), where I indicates inosine. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the University of Georgia Molecular Genetics Instrumentation Facility on an Applied Biosystems model 394 DNA-RNA synthesizer and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. S. cerevisiae genomic DNA was isolated as described (Sherman et al., 1986Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) and digested with a set of 6-base (EcoRI, BamHI, HindIII, and PvuII) and 4-base (HaeIII and MspI) restriction enzymes. Digested DNA (7 μg/lane) was electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose gels in 1 × TBE (89 mM Tris base, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA) and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell) as described (Ausubel et al., 1987Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York, NY1987Google Scholar). Probes CKB1-P3 and CKB1-P4 were 5’ end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Ausubel et al., 1987Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York, NY1987Google Scholar) and used to screen duplicate blots of genomic DNA. Both probes were hybridized in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.2% SDS at 48°C for 48 h. The filters were washed three times for 5 min each in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 23°C and finally in 6 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 min at 58°C prior to autoradiography. A λgt11 library of random-sheared, EcoRI-linkered S. cerevisiae genomic DNA (Mike Snyder, Yale University) was plated on E. coli Y1090, transferred in duplicate to nitrocellulose, and screened with CKB1-P3 and CKB1-P4 under the conditions described above for genomic Southern analysis. A total of 150,000 clones were screened, and clones hybridizing with both probes were identified and plaque purified. Seven clones, CKB1-1 through CKB1-7, were obtained and restriction-mapped (Fig. 1 C). The 1.6-kb EcoRI fragment common to all seven clones (Fig. 1 C) was isolated from CKB1-7 and subcloned into pBluescript II KS+ and KS- (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate plasmids, pAPB10 and pAPB12, respectively. The CKB1 open reading frame is oriented opposite to that of lacZ in both constructions, the other orientation being not well tolerated in E. coli. Nested deletions of the 1.6-kb insert were constructed using the ExoIII/Mung Enhanced Deletion Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A 5’ deletion series was constructed using SmaI+ SacI-digested pAPB10 and a 3’ series using ApaI+ EcoRV-digested pAPB12. Single-stranded DNA from the deletion clones was synthesized using helper phage R408 at a multiplicity of infection of 20:1. Sequencing was achieved by dideoxy-chain termination using [α-35S]dATP and Sequenase 2.0 (United States Biochemical Corp.) using a universal primer or, when necessary, custom primers. Portions of the sequence were confirmed by double-stranded sequencing on an Applied Biosystems DNA Sequencer, 373A. The location of CKB1 on the physical map of the yeast genome was determined by hybridization to an ordered array of overlapping γ and cosmid clones representing most of the genome of S. cerevisiae AB972 (Olson et al., 1986Olson M.V. Dutchik J.E. Graham M.Y. Brodeur G.M. Helms C. Frank M. MacCollin M. Scheinman R. Frank T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7826-7830Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar; American Type Culture Collection, catalog no. 76269). The 1.6-kb EcoRI insert of pAPB10 was labeled by random primer labeling (Boehringer Mannheim), and unincorporated label was removed with an Insta-Prep column (5 Prime-3 Prime, Boulder, CO). Hybridization was carried out in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's, and 0.2% SDS for 24 h at 42°C. After hybridization, membranes were washed in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 min at 63°C and autoradiographed. Disruptions of the CKB1 gene were achieved by γ-integration (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 491-bp 5’ fragment of the gene (containing 450 bp of 5’-untranslated sequence and 41 bp encoding the 14 N-terminal amino acids of the open reading frame) was isolated by digestion of pAPB10 DNA with DraII, end-repair with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I, and digestion with EcoRI. A 485-bp 3’ fragment (containing 211 bp encoding the C-terminal 70 amino acids plus 274 bp of 3’-untranslated sequence) was isolated by digestion of pAPB10 with HindIII plus EcoRI. Both fragments were simultaneously ligated into SmaI+ HindIII-digested pRS306 and used to transformed E. coli DH5α. Plasmid DNA was isolated and restriction mapped to verify the presence and correct orientation of the two fragments, and one transformant, pAPB15, was chosen. In order to convert the plasmid-associated marker from URA3 (pRS306) to HIS3 (pRS303), the insert of pAPB15 was isolated by digestion in the polylinker region with XhoI plus SacI. The 1060-bp fragment was ligated into XhoI+ SacI-digested pRS303 and used to transform E. coli DH5α. Plasmid DNA was prepared and restriction mapped, and one transformant, pAPB17, was chosen. Both constructions, pAPB15 and pAPB17, delete the coding region of CKB1 from S15 to T208. pAPB15 and pAPB17 were linearized by digestion with EcoRI and used to transform yeast strains YPH499, YPH500, and YPH501 by electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser). Uracil and histidine prototrophs, respectively, were isolated on selective medium and genomic DNA isolated from 5-ml cultures as described (Sherman et al., 1986Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Targeting of the two constructs to the CKB1 locus was verified by Southern blots of DNA digested with either EcoRI or KpnI+ SacI using the 1.6-kb EcoRI fragment of pAPB10 as a probe. Isolates displaying the specific pattern of bands indicative of integration at the CKB1 locus (data not shown) were chosen for further analysis. Diploid products of mating reactions were positively selected via complementation of nutritional markers (Guthrie and Fink, 1991Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Diploids were sporulated as described (Guthrie and Fink, 1991Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) except that asci were digested in 0.5 mg/ml zymolyase T-100 (ICN) in 1 M sorbitol for 15-30 min at 23°C and dissected on super YPD containing 1 M sorbitol. Sensitivity to ultraviolet light (UV) was determined as follows. Cells were grown in YPD and diluted in water to a final density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. A 25-ml sample of diluted culture was placed in a 100 × 15-mm Petri dish on a shaking table and exposed to a calibrated UV lamp (Sylvania shortwave germicidal bulb G8T5, 8 watts) at 1 J m-2 s-1. Aliquots were removed at 20-s intervals, and viable cell number was determined by plating cells in triplicate on YPD. Percent survival was calculated by dividing the viable count at each time point by that obtained just prior to UV exposure. Sensitivity of stationary phase cultures to nitrogen starvation or heat shock was determined as described by Broek et al., 1987Broek D. Toda T. Michaeli T. Levin L. Birchmeier C. Zoller M. Powers S.

To construct low and high copy plasmids carrying the CKB1 gene, a 1.6-kb XhoI+ SacI fragment was isolated from pAPB10. This fragment contains the entire protein-coding region of the CKB1 gene plus 450 bp of 5’ and 271 bp of 3’-flanking sequences. The purified fragment was ligated into XhoI+ SacI-digested centromere vector, pRS316 (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and high copy, 2 μm vector, pRS426 (Christianson et al., 1992Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar), to generate plasmids pAPB16 and pAPB18, respectively. Plasmids pJCR12 and pJCR14, which contain the CKB2 gene in pRS316 and pRS426, respectively, have been described (Reed et al., 1994Reed J.C. Bidwai A.P. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18192-18200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pDH3 containing a cDNA encoding the β subunit of D. melanogaster CKII under transcriptional control of GAL10 in pBM272 has also been described previously (Padmanabha et al., 1990Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding the D. melanogaster β-like protein, Stellate, was amplified from plasmid pOG1.24 (Livak, 1990Livak K.J. Genetics. 1990; 124: 303-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by the polymerase chain reaction, using upstream primer 5’-GCGAATTCTCGAGGTGAACTGGCAACATGTC-3’ and downstream primer 5’-GCGAATTCTCTAGATACATTGATGCGCCTGAC-3’. The amplified DNA of 650 bp was digested with EcoRI and ligated into the EcoRI site of plasmid pBM272. The orientation of the insert was determined by restriction mapping. Clone pAPB19 contains the Stellate cDNA in the correct orientation to allow transcription from the GAL10 promoter. The sequence of the amplified fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Strains YAPB6 and JCR7 (Table I) were transformed with plasmids pBM272, pDH3, pAPB19, pRS316, pAPB16, pJCR12, pRS426, pAPB18, and pJCR14 by electroporation. Transformants prototrophic for uracil were isolated and analyzed for growth on super YPGal and super YPGal containing 0.7 M NaCl. The use of galactose instead of dextrose was necessary since the expression of D. melanogaster β and Stellate is under the control of the inducible promoter, GAL10. Strains were grown overnight in YPGal, adjusted to 1 × 107 cells/ml in YPGal, and 10-fold serially diluted to 1 × 103 cells/ml. Aliquots of 5 μl each, containing 5, 50, and 500 cells, were spotted and the plates incubated at 29°C for 4-8 days. We employed the sequence of a tryptic peptide derived from the 38-kDa β subunit of Sc CKII to design two degenerate, non-overlapping, antisense oligonucleotide probes specific for this subunit (see “Experimental Procedures”). Genomic Southern analysis with both probes yielded an identical set of hybridizing fragments (data not shown). The two probes were then used to screen an S. cerevisiae genomic library in λgt11, and seven clones (CKB1-1 through CKB1-7) were isolated (Fig. 1 C). Restriction mapping indicated that all seven clones contained identical or overlapping inserts which shared a common EcoRI fragment of 1.6 kb (Fig. 1 C). This fragment from clone CKB1-7 was subcloned into pBluescript II and sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures” and outlined in Fig. 1D. Fig. 2 presents the nucleotide sequence of the 1.6-kb EcoRI fragment and its deduced amino acid sequence. The sequence contains a single long open reading frame of 837 nucleotides, which is preceded by an in-frame stop codon located 18 bp upstream of the putative initiating methionine. Conceptual translation of the open reading frame yields a predicted polypeptide of 278 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 32,475 Da. The perfect agreement of the deduced sequence (Fig. 2) with the available peptide sequence data (Bidwai et al., 1994Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Glover C.V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) confirms that the gene encodes the 38-kDa β subunit. The calculated molecular mass of 32,475 Da is significantly lower than that determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (38,000-41,000 Da, depending upon the gel conditions; Bidwai et al., 1994Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Glover C.V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may reflect either secondary modification of the protein (e.g. phosphorylation) or simply an anomolous electrophoretic mobility. An alignment of Sc Ckb1 with other β subunits and D. melanogaster Stellate is shown in Fig. 3. Sc Ckb1 exhibits all of the major features conserved in the β subunits of other organisms (Reed et al., 1994Reed J.C. Bidwai A.P. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18192-18200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including an N-terminal autophosphorylation motif, internal acidic region (in the vicinity of residue 60), and potential metal binding motif, C109PX3C-X22-CPXC140. Sc Ckb1 resembles other fungal and plant β subunits in that it contains an N-terminal extension relative to the invariant N terminus of metazoan β subunits. Features unique to the Sc β subunit include a 30 amino acid insertion (following residue 68), an unusually long acidic region (which includes the N-terminal portion of the 30 residue insert), and two additional autophosphorylation motifs (S60DEEEDEDD within the acidic domain and S210TEEDWEE near the C terminus). Pairwise comparisons among the sequences shown in Fig. 3 reveal that Sc Ckb1 is not a close relative of any previously described β subunit. In particular, it is as distantly related to Sc Ckb2 (45% identity) as it is to the β subunits of other species (45-49% identity). In order to analyze more rigorously the relationships among the available β subunits and Stellate, we used a distance matrix algorithm to construct the evolutionary tree shown in Fig. 4. Except for minor alterations in the topology near the center of this diagram, similar results were obtained by neighbor joining and maximum parsimony methods (data not shown). In general, the divergence among the fungal and plant species is quite high compared to that among metazoans. The gene duplication event giving rise to Sc Ckb1 and 2 appears to be quite ancient, that giving rise to A. thaliana Ckb1 and 2 relatively recent. The Stellate protein presumably represents a special case and is considered under “Discussion.” In order to determine the chromosomal location and orientation of the CKB1 gene, the 1.6-kb EcoRI fragment (Fig. 1 D) was used to screen an array of ordered lambda and cosmid clones representing approximately 96% of the yeast genome. Two λ-clones, ATCC 70669 and 70830, were found to hybridize with the probe, and these contained overlapping inserts derived from the left arm of chromosome VII (Fig. 1, A and B). A comparison of the EcoRI plus HindIII restriction map of the seven λgt11 clones (Fig. 1 C) with that of 70669 and 70830 (Fig. 1 B) indicated that CKB1 is located near the proximal end of 70669 (consistent with the weaker hybridization of this clone), approximately 33 kb from the centromere, and that the direction of transcription is toward the centromere. The only genetic locus which has been correlated to this region of the physical map is TRP5, which is located distal to CKB1 on clone 70669. The absence of known genes immediately centromere proximal to TRP5 (Mortimer et al., 1992Mortimer R.K. Contopoulou C.R. King J.S. Yeast. 1992; 8: 817-902Crossref PubMed Sco"

https://openalex.org/W2123526469,"An ion parametric resonance (IPR) model recently developed by Blanchard and Blackman predicts distinct magnetic field interactions with biological systems based on a selective relation among four factors: the flux density of the static magnetic field, the frequency and flux density (Bac) of the parallel ac magnetic field, and the charge-to-mass ratio of ions of biological relevance. To test this model, PC-12 cells stimulated by nerve growth factor to produce neurites were exposed for 23 h in a 5% CO2 incubator using a multiple-coil exposure system to produce 45 Hz ac and dc (366 mG parallel to ac; less than 2 mG perpendicular to ac) magnetic fields. Our earlier work showed a cycle of inhibition/no inhibition of neurite outgrowth consistent with the IPR model predictions for Bac exposures between 0 and 468 mG rms. The work described here tests neurite outgrowth over a broader range of Bac (233-1416 mG rms). The experimental results remain consistent with earlier results, and with IPR model predictions of a second cycle of inhibition, return to control values, followed by a third cycle of inhibition of neurite outgrowth. These responses support the fundamental relationships predicted by the IPR model. The results have broad significance for biology."

This is the first demonstration that a laminin derived peptide is capable of inducing or enhancing monocyte inflammatory responses that may influence a number of biological activities such as wound healing or excessive connective tissue destruction associated with chronic inflammation. Monocytes are recruited to sites of tissue injury or chronic inflammation by cell-derived chemotactic factors and/or degraded extracellular matrix components. Once at the site, the monocyte may orchestrate the extent of connective tissue destruction, in part, by the production and activation of a family of metalloproteinases that degrade all the major components of the extracellular matrix (for review, see Birkedal-Hansen et al., 1993Birkedal-Hansen H.

In addition to these matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),1( 1The abbreviations used are: MMPsmatrix metalloproteinasesPGE2prostaglandin E2ConAconcanavalin AIL-1interleukin-1PMNspolymorphonuclear cells. ) monocytes secrete inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-1 (IL-1) which influence the production of MMPs by other cells. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide or concanavalin A (ConA) induces monocytes to produce PGE2 which leads to the production of MMPs (Wahl and Lampel, 1987Wahl L.M. Lampel L.L.

Thus, the synthesis of MMPs by monocytes is dependent on PGE2 production. matrix metalloproteinases prostaglandin E2 concanavalin A interleukin-1 polymorphonuclear cells. Matrix components have also been shown to influence monocyte functions. Exposure of monocytes to type I collagen, gelatin, and endothelial cell-derived basement membrane induces the production of PGE2 (Gudewicz et al., 1994Gudewicz P.W. Frewin M.B. Heinel L.A. Minnear F.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Native and denatured type I collagen also induce the production of monocyte interstitial collagenase (Shapiro et al., 1993Shapiro S.D. Kobayashi D.K. Pentland A.P. Welgus H.G. J. Biol.

Although intact laminin does not induce the production of MMPs by macrophages/monocytes (Shapiro et al., 1993Shapiro S.D. Kobayashi D.K. Pentland A.P. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8155-8170Google Scholar), we examined whether specific sites on laminin, possibly exposed during degradation of this molecule, could modulate monocyte function. The glycoprotein laminin-1, a major component of the basement membrane, is composed of three chains (α1, β1, and γ1) which form a covalent cross-like molecule (Burgson et al., 1994Burgson R.E. Chiquet M. Duetzmann R. Ekblom P. Engel J. Kleinman H. Martin G.R. Meneguzzi G. Paulsson M. Sanes J. Timpl R. Tryggvason K. Yamada Y. Yurchenco P.D.

Several sites on the laminin molecule that mediate these biological responses have been identified at the synthetic peptide level (Kleinman et al., 1993Kleinman H.K. Weeks B.S. Schnaper H.W.

We demonstrate in this report that the laminin peptide SIKVAV increases the production of PGE2, interstitial collagenase (EC 3.4.24.7) and gelatinase B (EC 3.4.24.35) by monocytes. These data suggest that laminin fragments may play an important role in the resolution of tissue damage at a wound site and/or the exacerbation of connective tissue destruction associated with chronic inflammatory lesions. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained by leukapheresis of normal volunteers at the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. The monocytes in the mononuclear fraction were enriched to 90-95% by counterflow centrifugal elutriation using endotoxin-free reagents as described previously (Wahl et al., 1984Wahl L.M. Katona M.I. Wilder R.L. Winter C.C. Haraoui B. Sher I. Wahl S.M. Cell Immunol. 1984; 85: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The α1 chain-derived SIKVAV-containing peptide (amino acids 2099-2105; CRKQAASIKVAVS) was synthesized, purified as described previously (Graf et al., 1987Graf J. Ogle R.C. Robey F.A. Sasaki M. Martin G.R. Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6896-6904Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and endotoxin-filtered. Control peptides include the SHA-7 peptide (CSRARKQAASGKVAVSADR) which contains a single amino acid substitution in the SIKVAV active site, and YOSH-3 (CRTDEGEKKCGCPGC) which is an inactive sequence from the β1 chain of laminin. These peptides tested negative for endotoxin by the limulus amebocyte lysate assay. Monocytes (20 × 106/4 ml) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) for 48 h at 37°C under the following conditions: in suspension in 15-ml polypropylene tubes (Falcon) along with the peptides, in 60-mm tissue culture dishes that had been previously coated with peptides, or adhered to 60-mm culture dishes prior to the addition of peptides. Peptides were coated onto 60-mm tissue culture dishes by drying sterile phosphate-buffered saline containing the laminin peptides. Phosphate-buffered saline that did not contain peptide was used as the control. After 48 h of incubation under the culture conditions indicated above, the conditioned media were harvested and the levels of PGE2 in the supernatants were determined by radioimmunoassay (Wahl, 1981Wahl L.M. Herscowitz H.B. Holden H.T. Bellanti J.A. Ghaffar A. Manual of Macrophage Methodology. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1981: 423-429Google Scholar). Western blot analysis for the MMPs was performed as described previously (Corcoran et al., 1992Corcoran M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D. Wahl L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 515-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the secreted proteins in the remaining supernatants were ethanol-precipitated, separated on reducing 8-16% Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. A 1:100 dilution of antibody 110, which recognizes the latent and active forms of gelatinase B (92-kDa type IV collagenase), and antibody 125, which recognizes the active forms of interstitial collagenase was used followed by an incubation with 1:16,000 dilution of protein G-horseradish peroxidase. The MMP proteins were visualized by chemoluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Corp.) and the intensity of the signal quantitated using Image 1.45 software and an Arcus scanner. Freshly isolated human monocytes were added to tissue culture dishes that were previously coated with the laminin peptides. After 48 h, the conditioned media were evaluated for the presence of inflammatory mediators including interstitial collagenase, gelatinase B, and PGE2. As determined by Western blot analysis, monocytes cultured on either 100 μg or 200 μg/well of SIKVAV-containing peptide induced the production of interstitial collagenase which was predominantly the 47- and 42-kDa catalytically active species (Fig. 1). Induction of interstitial collagenase was not observed when monocytes were cultured on YOSH-3, an inactive peptide sequence from the β1 chain of laminin, or on uncoated plastic. Native laminin did not induce the production of these mediators (data not shown). As expected, 20 μg/ml of ConA stimulated production of interstitial collagenase on nontreated dishes. Adding 20 μg/ml of ConA to the monocytes cultured on SIKVAV-coated dishes further enhanced the production of interstitial collagenase over that produced by monocytes cultured in the presence of SIKVAV alone (Fig. 1). Monocytes cultured on SIKVAV-coated dishes also produced gelatinase B (Fig. 2). A control peptide, SHA-7, which contains a single amino acid substitution (SGKVAV) in the biologically active site, did not induce the production of this enzyme. These results were also confirmed by gelatin zymography (data not shown). Since PGE2 production correlates with the production of monocyte MMPs (Corcoran et al., 1992Corcoran M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D. Wahl L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 515-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the levels of this mediator were also determined. The production of PGE2 (4.03 ± 1.4 ng/ml) by monocytes cultured on substrate-bound SIKVAV peptide (100 μg/ml) was 4-fold higher compared with no peptide treatment (1 ± 0.4 ng/ml). Addition of 1 μg/ml of ConA to the SIKVAV-coated dishes induced more than a 2-fold increase in PGE2 production (22.5 ± 2.4 ng/ml) over that observed from cells cultured on plastic and stimulated with ConA alone (9.9 ± 1.7 ng/ml). Monocytes cultured on tissue culture plates prior to addition of soluble SIKVAV peptide did not produce interstitial collagenase (Fig. 3). However, if the adhered monocytes were treated with 1 μg/ml ConA as well as soluble SIKVAV (400 μg/ml), the production of interstitial collagenase was significantly enhanced over that observed with ConA (1 μg/ml) treatment alone (Fig. 3). Similarly, the addition of SIKVAV peptide alone to adherent monocytes did not induce PGE2 production. However, the PGE2 produced in response to 1 μg/ml of ConA (6.5 ± 1.9 ng/ml versus control, 0.85 ± 0.2 ng/ml) was enhanced 4-5-fold (29 ± 7 ng/ml) by 100 μg/ml soluble SIKVAV peptide. When the monocytes were cultured with the peptides in suspension, SIKVAV alone was also shown to induce interstitial collagenase in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). While soluble SIKVAV alone (200 or 400 μg/ml) induced the production of interstitial collagenase, when a suboptimal stimulatory dose of ConA (1 μg/ml) was added with SIKVAV there was a synergistic induction of interstitial collagenase (Fig. 4). There was a positive correlation between MMP and PGE2 production. Suspended monocytes treated with soluble SIKVAV (100 μg/ml) peptide had a 5-fold increase in PGE2 levels (8.5 ± 0.1 ng/ml) as compared with untreated cells (1.6 ± 0.9 ng/ml). Soluble SIKVAV (100 μg/ml) peptide also elicited the production of latent gelatinase B by monocytes cultured in suspension (Fig. 5). In the presence of ConA (20 μg/ml), SIKVAV enhanced by 4-5-fold the production of the 92-kDa gelatinase B over that induced with ConA treatment alone (Fig. 5). Additionally, the 84-kDa proteolytically active product of gelatinase B was detected when monocytes were treated with ConA and SIKVAV. Monocytes were cultured under different conditions to simulate situations that occur either in the blood stream or at sites of tissue damage. When the monocytes were cultured in suspension, SIKVAV stimulated the production of PGE2, interstitial collagenase, and gelatinase B in the absence of a primary stimulus (ConA). In the presence of suboptimal concentrations of ConA, monocytes cultured in suspension responded to SIKVAV by inducing a greater enhancement of monocyte PGE2 and MMPs. Substrate-bound SIKVAV also directly elicited the production of PGE2, interstitial collagenase and gelatinase B, and enhanced these responses in the presence of a suboptimal concentration of ConA. However, when monocytes were adhered, SIKVAV failed to induce MMP and PGE2 production, but enhanced these responses when they were initiated by ConA. The fact that SIKVAV can directly induce monocyte protease production agrees with previous studies on endothelial cells (Grant et al., 1992Grant D.S. Kinsella J.L. Fridman R. Auerbach R. Piasecki B.A. Yamada Y. Zain M. Kleinman H.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 614-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The differential responses to SIKVAV observed under different culture conditions may be important in understanding the control mechanisms that limit monocyte activation at sites of inflammation and tissue damage. Cellular invasion studies using the U937 monoblastic cell line suggest that gelatinase B may be the protease utilized by monocytes to transverse the extracellular matrix and enter inflammatory sites (Watanabe et al., 1993Watanabe H. Nakanishi I. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. Okada Y. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 991-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once at the inflammatory site, the production of interstitial collagenase by these cells is pivotal for initiating the degradation of fibrillar collagen in the damaged matrix. Stimulation of monocyte interstitial collagenase, gelatinase B, PGE2, and possibly other monocyte functions by SIKVAV may be important in promoting tissue repair during wound healing. The ability of degraded extracellular matrix molecules to elicit an inflammatory response by human monocytes, such as the production of tumor necrosis factor, has been observed with fibronectin and its fragments (Beezhold and Personius, 1992Beezhold D.H. Personius C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1992; 51: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar; Chang et al., 1993Chang Z.L. Beezhold D.H. Personius C.D. Shen Z.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Other studies have reported that the manner in which the monocytes are cultured may modulate their responses to extracellular matrix molecules (Kohn and Klingemann, 1991Kohn F.R. Klingemann H.G. Exp. Hematol. 1991; 19: 653-658PubMed Google Scholar). Native and denatured collagens have also been reported to induce the production of arachidonic acid metabolites by monocytes (Gudewicz et al., 1994Gudewicz P.W. Frewin M.B. Heinel L.A. Minnear F.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and interstitial collagenase by alveolar macrophages (Shapiro et al., 1993Shapiro S.D. Kobayashi D.K. Pentland A.P. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8155-8170Google Scholar). Collagen and collagen fragments also enhance chemotaxis, respiratory burst, gelatinase, and elastase production by alveolar macrophages (Laskin et al., 1994Laskin D.L. Soltys R.A. Berg R.A. Riley D.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although native laminin has been previously observed to be inert in stimulating monocyte function (Shapiro et al., 1993Shapiro S.D. Kobayashi D.K. Pentland A.P. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8155-8170Google Scholar; Gudewicz et al., 1994Gudewicz P.W. Frewin M.B. Heinel L.A. Minnear F.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we show here that the laminin-derived amino acid sequence SIKVAV, by itself, induces an inflammatory response from human monocytes. This suggests that this site of laminin contributes not only to promote angiogenesis but also to potentiate monocytic inflammatory responses. Previously, SIKVAV has been reported to promote angiogenesis by inducing endothelial cell adhesion, migration, and invasion (Kibbey et al., 1992Kibbey M.C. Grant D.S. Kleinman H.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In a murine model, injection of matrigel along with the SIKVAV peptide results in vascularization of the matrigel plug. This effect may be partly due to the infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and subsequently monocytes (Kibbey et al., 1994Kibbey M.C. Corcoran M.L. Wahl L.M. Kleinman H.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) into the SIKVAV-containing matrigel plug. If these mice are made neutropenic, the angiogenesis in the matrigel plug containing SIKVAV is greatly reduced. Moreover, we also demonstrated that PMNs have the capacity to release proteases that degrade intact laminin molecules. It is possible that the PMNs, one of the first cells to arrive at the inflammatory site, initiate the degradation of matrix components such as collagen and laminin. The degradation of laminin and subsequent exposure of peptides containing the SIKVAV sequence may potentiate the inflammatory response by infiltrating monocytes. The ability of laminin peptides to modulate the production of PGE2, interstitial collagenase, as well as the gelatinase B by monocytes could play an important role in their ability to transverse basement membranes. Thus, laminin fragments containing the SIKVAV sequence may contribute to the inflammatory response at sites of wound healing. Additionally, laminin fragments containing the SIKVAV sequence may contribute to the excessive induction of metalloproteinases that ultimately result in destruction of connective tissue associated with chronic inflammatory lesions.

https://openalex.org/W2054311827,"Appicans are secreted and cell-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans containing Alzheimer amyloid precursor (APP) as their core protein. Appicans are found in brain tissue, and in cell cultures their expression depends on both cell type and growth conditions. Here we report that the core protein of appicans derives from an APP mRNA lacking exon 15. Splicing out of this exon creates a new consensus sequence for the attachment of a chondroitin sulfate chain in the resulting APP product. Transfection of C6 glioma or 293 kidney fibroblast cells with APP cDNAs containing exon 15 produced no appican, while transfection with an APP cDNA lacking this exon induced high levels of appican production. Polymerase chain reactions indicated that appican-producing cells contained an APP mRNA species without exon 15, whereas cells without this mRNA produced no appican. Site-directed mutagenesis combined with immunoreactivity experiments showed that the chondroitin sulfate chain is attached to a serine residue 16 amino acids upstream of the amino terminus of the Aβ sequence of APP. The attachment of a glycosaminoglycan chain close to the Aβ sequence of APP may affect the proteolytic processing of APP and production of Aβ. The proteoglycan nature of APP suggests that addition of the chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan is important for the implementation of the biological function of these proteins."

We postulate that interaction with TR-β impairs the function(s) of one or more assembling transcriptional complexes during the multistep assembly of a PIC. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe that, in the absence of thyroid hormone, TR-β or a heterodimer of TR-β and retinoid-X-receptor undergoes direct protein-protein interactions with the transcription factor IIB-TATA binding protein complex, an early intermediate during PIC assembly. Binding of hormone to TR-β dramatically reduces the interaction between the receptor and the transcription factor IIB-TATA binding protein complex. We propose that the role of ligand is to facilitate the assembly of functional PICs at the target promoter by reducing nonproductive interactions between TR-β and the initiation factors."

We have examined the functional significance of numerous conserved charged amino acid residues proposed to be located within or near the transmembrane domains. Whereas the wild type FPR exhibits a Kdfor an agonist of 1-3 nM, which is reduced to ~40 nM in the presence of guanosine 5’-3- O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS), substitution of either Asp71 or Arg123 resulted in mutant receptors that bound ligand with only low affinity (Kd= 30-50 nM) independent of GTPγS. In contrast, substitution of Arg163, predicted to be located at a similar depth within the membrane as Asp71, had no effect on ligand binding. Replacement of residues Arg309-Glu310-Arg311 resulted in an FPR with intermediate ligand binding characteristics. Functional analysis of the mutant receptors revealed that substitution of either Asp71 or Arg123 resulted in a mutant receptor that was unable to mediate calcium mobilization, whereas replacement of residues Arg309-Glu310-Arg311 yielded a receptor with an EC50 of 50 nM, compared with 0.5 nM for the wild type FPR. In order to determine the point of the defect in signal transduction, we performed reconstitution of the solubilized receptors with purified G proteins. The wild type FPR displayed a Kdfor G protein of ~0.6 μM compared with the Arg309/Glu310/Arg311 mutant with a Kdof approximately 30 μM. A significant physical interaction between the Asp71 or Arg123 mutants and G protein was not observed. The implications of these findings for signal transduction mechanisms are discussed.

INTRODUCTIONThe activation of cellular processes through the binding of agonists to cell surface membrane receptors is of central importance to numerous aspects of biology. The recent explosion in the cloning of cell surface receptors has demonstrated that a large number of these signal-transducing receptors are coupled to GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins)1( 1The abbreviations used are: G proteinguanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteinFPRN-formyl peptide receptorfMLPN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanineTCMternary complex modelPIPESpiperazine- N, N’-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)fMLPK-[125I]SASDN-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe- N∈-(2-(p-azidosalicylamido)ethyl-1,3’-dithiopropionyl)-LysTMtransmembrane domainGTPγSguanosine 5’-3- O-(thio)triphosphateRreceptorLRligand-receptorGG protein. ) (for a review, see Refs. 1Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfor S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar and 2Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). The class of G protein-coupled receptors is typified by its unique membrane topology of seven-transmembrane-spanning domains. Under physiological conditions, transmembrane signaling is initiated by the binding of ligand to the extracellular surface of the receptor. This is proposed to induce a conformational change in the receptor resulting in the activation of a G protein and the subsequent activation of downstream effectors. Despite recent advances in the study of G protein-coupled receptors, little is known regarding the structural and functional differences between the various states of the receptor, such as the liganded, activated receptor and the unliganded, inactive receptor.The ternary complex model (TCM) is the most accepted model for describing the activation of G protein-coupled receptors (3De Lean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It describes the active form of the receptor as a ternary complex among ligand, receptor, and G protein formed as a result of the sequential association of ligand and G protein, in either order, with receptor. The more favorable sequence is traditionally thought to involve ligand binding to receptor followed by G protein binding. This simple form of the TCM has been found to be inadequate for the evaluation of recently described experiments (4Cotecchia S. Exum S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 5Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of constitutively active (i.e. ligand-independent) mutants of α- and β-adrenergic receptors has led to the conclusion that the unliganded form of receptors exists in an equilibrium between active and inactive states and that the binding of ligand serves to shift the equilibrium from the inactive to the active state. Only this active state is capable of initiating signal transduction. The TCM of signal transduction has also been investigated by studies of conformational changes in the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) through rapid kinetic spectrofluorometric methods using fluorescent chemotactic peptides as ligands (6Fay S.P. Posner R.G. Swann W.N. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5066-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Posner R.G. Fay S.P. Domalewski M.D. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 65-73PubMed Google Scholar). This technique takes advantage of the large difference (approximately 2 orders of magnitude) in dissociation rates between the high and low affinity states of the FPR. Analysis of such kinetic data has shown that the assembly of the ternary complex is rapid, occurring with a half-time of less than 1 s, suggesting that a portion of the receptor population may be precoupled to G protein.The FPR of neutrophils is representative of the class of G protein-coupled receptors. Neutrophils respond to a large number of structurally diverse ligands with functions such as chemotaxis, superoxide production, and degranulation. Many of these chemotactic receptors have recently been cloned, including the receptors for N-formyl peptides (8Boulay F. Tardif M. Brouchon L. Vignais P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), complement component C5a(9Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Nature. 1991; 349: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), platelet-activating factor (10Ye R.D. Prossnitz E.R. Zou A. Cochrane C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and interleukin-8 (11Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 12Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). These receptors are all members of the class of G protein-coupled receptors, appearing to couple through the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi subtype of G protein. Recent work has suggested that the FPR couples to G proteins via its second intracellular loop and carboxyl-terminal domain but that the third intracellular loop is of only minor significance (13Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem J. 1993; 294: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Schreiber R.E. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Cochrane C.G. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 326-331Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain has also been shown to be a substrate for G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2, suggesting this kinase is involved in phosphorylation and desensitization of the FPR (15Prossnitz E.R. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the characterization of FPR mutants in the second transmembrane domain, the second intracellular loop, and the carboxyl-terminal domain that are unable to bind ligand with high affinity and are also incapable of signal transduction, suggesting a defect in receptor-G protein interactions. Since it is known that the high affinity, liganded state of the wild type FPR forms a stable physical complex with G protein (16Schreiber R.E. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we used these mutants to test whether the low affinity state of the FPR is similarly capable of interacting with G protein. The results will provide important mechanistic information regarding the dynamics of G protein-coupled receptors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe cDNA that encodes the FPR was obtained from a human HL-60 granulocyte library as described previously (17Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, lipofectamine, G418, and trypsin-free dissociation buffer were from Life Technologies, Inc. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon. Mutagenesis was carried out using the Amersham Corp. oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis system. Sequencing was carried out using Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Bacterial cells were grown in Circlegrow medium (BIO 101). fML[3H]P (specific activity, 56 Ci/mmol) was obtained from DuPont NEN, and unlabeled fMLP was purchased from Sigma. Carrier-free sodium [125I]iodide was obtained from Amersham Corp. N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-fluorescein and indo-1/AM were obtained from Molecular Probes. Mouse L cell fibroblasts (L2071) were obtained from ATCC. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Whittaker Bioproducts; fetal bovine serum was from HyClone. Enzymobeads were from Bio-Rad, and sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(p-azidosalicylamido)ethyl-1,3’-dithiopropionate was from Pierce.Construction and Expression of Site-directed MutantsThe FPR gene was subcloned into the EcoRI site in the polylinker of M13 mp18 (13Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem J. 1993; 294: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Single-stranded M13 DNA in conjunction with mutant oligonucleotides (containing the altered nucleotides necessary to generate the desired mutations) was used to introduce mutations into the FPR gene. Plaques were amplified, and the mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. For expression, the mutated FPR genes were subcloned into the EcoRI site of the vector pSFFV.neo, which contains the selectable marker aminoglycoside transferase. Mutations were reconfirmed by dideoxy sequencing prior to transfection. Mouse L cell fibroblasts were transfected as follows. Approximately 106 cells were plated out in a 25-cm2 flask 20 h prior to transfection with 10 μg of linearized vectors by lipofectamine. Transfectants were selected by their resistance to G418 sulfate at an active drug concentration of 0.35 mg/ml. For each mutant, approximately 20-50 individual colonies from transfected cells were pooled for analysis.Flow CytometryMouse L cell fibroblasts were detached from the culture flask with protease-free dissociation buffer, harvested by centrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended to 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. Binding was carried out in 0.5 ml with N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-fluorescein at 20 nM. Following incubation for at least 15 min on ice, the cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) for fluorescent intensity. Debris and dead cells were excluded with a gate on forward and side scatter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μM N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe.Membrane PreparationCells were detached from culture flasks with protease-free dissociation buffer, collected at 500 × g, and resuspended at 107 cells/ml in 10 mM PIPES (pH 7.3), containing KCl (100 mM), NaCl (3 mM), MgCl2 (3.5 mM), ATP (0.6 mg/ml), and the protease inhibitors chymostatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and diisopropyl fluorophosphate (Sigma). The cells were disrupted by N2 cavitation (500 p.s.i., 15 min, 4°C), and the cell nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The membranes were collected by sedimentation at 130,000 × g for 45 min, resuspended at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 200 mM sucrose, and stored at −80°C until use.Photoaffinity Labeling of the FPRMembranes were photoaffinity-labeled with 20 nM N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe- N∈-(2-(p-azidosalicylamido)ethyl-1,3’-dithiopropionyl)-Lys (fMLPK-[125I]SASD) as described previously (18Allen R.A. Tolley J.O. Jesaitis A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 882: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 19Allen R.A. Jesaitis A.J. Cochrane C.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1987; 33: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys, dissolved in dry dimethylformamide, was added to equimolar amounts of sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(p-azidosalicylamido)ethyl-1,3’-dithiopropionate and triethylamine and incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature. fMLPK-SASD was radiolabeled using 5 mCi of Na125I and the Enzymobead reagent as described by the manufacturer. The mixture was then chromatographed on a Bio-Gel P-2 (extra fine) equilibrated in 20 mM NaOH to obtain the fMLPK-[125I]SASD, which eluted in the void volume. FPR-expressing fibroblasts and their respective membrane preparations were covalently labeled as follows. Cells (0.5 × 106) were harvested and resuspended in 200 μl of HEPES-buffered saline. Membranes (50 μg) were diluted to 200 μl of HEPES-buffered saline. fMLPK-[125I]SASD (5-10 μl of the eluted sample, representing a final concentration of 10-30 nM) was added in the absence or presence of 1 μM unlabeled fMLP to assess nonspecific labeling. Following a 10-min incubation on ice, the radiolabel was covalently incorporated by exposure on ice to UV light in a Rayonet ultraviolet light reactor irradiating at 370 nm for 5-10 min. Labeled samples were centrifuged and washed two times with HEPES-buffered saline prior to further analysis.Quantitative Radioligand BindingLigand binding assays were performed on membrane preparations in a final volume of 0.2 ml. Membranes (30 μg of protein) were suspended in the binding buffer (pH 7.4) consisting of 140 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 0.3 mM MgSO4, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Binding was started by the addition of various amounts of [3H]fMLP. Equilibrium binding was carried out at 23°C for 45 min and terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/C filters followed by three washes with 0.75 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. Specific binding was calculated as total binding minus nonspecific binding, which was determined in the presence of 50 μM unlabeled fMLP. Each determination was done in duplicate. The amount of bound ligand was estimated by scintillation counting, and the binding data were analyzed by fitting to a double rectangular hyperbola with the nonlinear curve fitting program, SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). Measurement of [Ca2⁺]i-Cells were harvested in dissociation buffer, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were incubated with 5 μM indo-1/AM for 25 min at 37°C, washed once with medium, and resuspended to a concentration of approximately 106 cells/ml. The elevation of intracellular Ca2⁺ by various amounts of fMLP was monitored by continuous fluorescent measurement using an SLM 8000 photon-counting spectrofluorometer (SLM-Aminco) detecting at 400 and 490 nm, respectively, as described (17Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The concentration of intracellular Ca2⁺ was calculated as described (20Cobbold P.H. Rink T.J. Biochem J. 1987; 248: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar).Purification of G ProteinsGi (containing subtypes Gi-1 and Gi-2) was purified from bovine brain essentially as described (21Sternweis P.C. Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11517-11526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the heptylamine-Sepharose purification step, resolution of Gi from Go was achieved by purification on a 20-ml DEAE-Sephacel column, which was equilibrated with TENL (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.6% Lubrol) and eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of 0-250 mM NaCl in TENL. Gi-enriched fractions were pooled and judged by silver stain following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to contain approximately 80% Gi and 20% Go.FPR/G Protein Reconstitution and AnalysisReconstitution was performed as described previously (22Bommakanti R.K. Bokoch G.M. Tolley J.O. Schreiber R.E. Siemsen D.W. Klotz K.N. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7576-7581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes, photoaffinity-labeled with fMLPK-[125I]SASD, were extracted with 1% octylglucoside in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml chymostatin for 1 h on ice. Extracts were incubated with or without Gi for 2 h at 4°C and then applied to 700 μl of 5-20% linear sucrose gradients prepared in the extraction buffer. Gradients were centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in an SW 50.1 rotor (Beckman) for 13.3 h and fractionated into 14 × 50-μl fractions. Fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography to confirm the specific labeling and distribution of the receptor. Gradients containing 20 μg of bovine serum albumin (4.4 S) and rabbit immunoglobulin (7.7 S) were centrifuged in parallel with FPR-containing gradients. Based on the sedimentation of these standard proteins, the migration of 4 S and 7 S proteins was calculated to peak in fractions 6 and 10, respectively.RESULTSG protein-coupled receptors may represent the largest class of signal-transducing molecules, and as such they bind a vast array of ligands and couple to many distinct intracellular effectors via a large collection of G proteins. Although all members of this class contain the canonical seven-transmembrane domain motif, they possess considerable sequence diversity to accommodate the multitude of functions they perform. Despite this diversity, G protein-coupled receptors contain certain amino acid residues that are highly conserved throughout the entire class. Perhaps the most distinct of these is the Asp-Arg-Tyr triplet at the boundary between transmembrane domain 3 (TM3) and the second intracellular loop. Another almost invariant residue, an Asp, is found in the middle of TM2. Highly conserved among the muscarinic, adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonin, and a number of other G protein-coupled receptors is an Asp in the middle of TM3. In some instances, this and the other conserved Asp residues are replaced by the similarly charged acidic amino acid, Glu. We have also noted a weak homology at the boundary between the TM7 and the carboxyl terminus. This consensus consists of a Phe preceded and/or followed by one or more basic amino acids. Examples of this include FR (e.g. opsins), FRR (e.g. α-adrenergic), FKK (e.g. m4 muscarinic), FRK (D2 dopamine), KKFRKH (e.g. platelet-activating factor), and KFRH (e.g. interleukin-8). As a model G protein-coupled receptor to study the role of these conserved residues, we have utilized the FPR, which possesses all of these consensus residues. Instead of a Tyr at the third position of the Asp-Arg-Tyr triplet, the FPR contains a Cys, found in a small number of G protein-coupled receptors. The consensus at the TM7/cytoplasm boundary of the FPR consists of the sequence FRER, which is consistent with the pattern of sequences outlined above, although the presence of an acidic residue near the Phe residue is unusual. For the purposes of this study, we altered the conserved amino acids described above as illustrated in Fig. 1. Arg163 was also mutated because it represents a charged residue with a predicted position in the fourth transmembrane domain at a similar depth to Asp106.Following the generation of the desired mutations by site-directed mutagenesis, the mutant recombinant FPR constructs in the expression vector pSFFV.neo were stably transfected into mouse L cell fibroblasts. We have previously shown that these cells are capable of expressing functional FPR upon transfection with the wild type gene. After selection with G418, the stable transfectants were analyzed for surface expression of the FPR. This was accomplished in two ways: 1) by flow cytometry using a fluorescein-conjugated hexapeptide ligand and 2) by covalent photoaffinity labeling using an iodinated photoactivatable tetrapeptide ligand followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results are shown in Fig. 2. Whereas mock-transfected cells show no specific binding of either of the two ligands (panelA), wild type FPR-transfected cells show binding of both the fluoresceinated ligand, as indicated by the increase in cell-associated fluorescence (panelB), and the iodinated ligand, as evidenced by the presence of a band of molecular mass 55,000-70,000 kDa upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (panelB, inset). In both cases, the binding of the ligand was demonstrated to be specific by the addition of excess fMLP, which competed for the binding of the labeled ligand. The addition of excess unlabeled fMLP to the mock-transfected cells had no effect on the nonspecific background binding of either of the labeled ligands. Analysis of the mutant forms of the FPR revealed that mutants D71A, R123G, R163F, and R309G/E310A/R311G were capable of binding formyl peptide ligands to a similar extent as the wild type receptor. However, the mutants D106A and D122A displayed no specific binding of either ligand, suggesting that either these two mutants were not expressed at the cell surface or that they were expressed at the cell surface but were incapable of binding the ligand.Figure 2:Cell surface expression of the wild type and mutant forms of the FPR. Expression was evaluated for cells transfected with vector only, the wild type FPR, and each mutant FPR by flow cytometry, plotting cell number versus fluorescent intensity (panelsA-H). Binding was determined with N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-fluorescein at 20 nM. The inset within each panel shows the profile of membrane proteins photoaffinity-labeled with approximately 20 nM fMLPK-[125I]SASD analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The major labeled protein, representing the FPR, has a molecular mass of 55,000-70,000 kDa. In each assay, binding was determined in the absence (-) and presence (+) of 1 μM N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. Data are representative of two to four experiments. RER/GAG, R309G/E310A/R311G.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the ligand binding characteristics of the mutants in greater detail, we performed fML[3H]P binding assays using membranes prepared from the transfected cells. Analysis of the wild type FPR revealed the expected properties, high affinity binding representing 2.3 pmol/mg protein with a Kdof 2.7 nM, which could be converted to low affinity binding by the addition of 2 μM GTPγS, yielding a Kdof approximately 40 nM with a receptor density of 1.6 pmol/mg of protein (Fig. 3 A, Table I). The low affinity state of the receptor generated in the presence of GTPγS is presumed to be the result of the irreversible activation and dissociation of G proteins from receptors and results in an apparent reduction in the receptor density as determined by filtration binding. Scatchard analysis as well as nonlinear curve fitting of the binding data revealed the presence of a single site in both the presence and absence of GTPγS (Table I). Of the mutant receptors observed to bind the fluoresceinated ligand, only the R163F mutant displayed binding affinities characteristic of the wild type receptor, although in the absence of GTPγS both the high and low affinity sites were observed (approximately 1 nM and 20 nM, respectively). Binding of fMLP to the wild type FPR of human neutrophils and HL60 cells routinely displays both high and low affinity sites in the absence of GTPγS, with the receptor population in the high affinity state being sensitive to GTPγS, as observed here with the R163F mutant.Figure 3:Ligand binding characteristics of the FPR mutants. Specific fML[3H]P binding to isolated membranes from cells expressing the wild type (panelA) and the following mutant forms of the FPR: D71A (panelB), R123G (panelC), R163F (panelD), and R309G/E310A/R311G (RER/GAG) (panelE). Binding was performed in the absence (○) or presence (△) of 2 μM GTPγS. Binding data were fit with a one-site model, except for the R163F mutant in the absence of GTPγS, which was better fit with a two-site model. Data are representative of three to five binding assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ILigand binding parameters of wild type and mutant FPRsLigand binding assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in either the presence or absence of 2 μM GTPγS as indicated. The data were analyzed using a two-site model. Where one of the sites represented less than 1% of the total number of sites (-), it was taken to indicate that only a single site existed. Site 1 is arbitrarily taken as the high affinity site and site 2 as the low affinity site. The Kdvalues are given in nM, whereas the Bmax values are given in fmol/mg of protein. Open table in a new tab Two of the mutants, D71A and R123G, exhibited fMLP binding with a Kdof approximately 30-50 nM. This binding was unaffected by the presence of GTPγS, suggesting that even in the absence of GTPγS the FPR was unable to exist in the high affinity state. The receptor densities for the D71A and R123G mutants were 0.4 and 0.9 pmol/mg protein, respectively. Although these values represent a small percentage of the number of sites determined for the wild type FPR in the absence of GTPγS, they represent up to 60% of the sites determined for the wild type FPR in the presence of GTPγS, a more valid comparison since this state of the FPR represents the uncoupled form of the receptor. Analysis of the R309G/E310A/R311G mutant revealed that its binding properties were intermediate between that of the wild type FPR and mutants D71A and R123G. In the absence of GTPγS, this mutant predominantly displayed a Kdof 40 nM with a receptor density of 1.9 pmol/mg of protein (representing 97-100% of the receptor sites). Scatchard analysis did reveal the presence of a very small population of receptors with high affinity (1.2 ± 0.9 nM) representing only 2-3% of the receptor sites. In the presence of GTPγS, no high affinity binding was observed, but the number of low affinity sites was reduced to 1.2 pmol/mg of protein with an unaltered Kd. This level of reduction in the apparent number of fML[3H]P binding sites assayed in the presence of GTPγS, is similar to that seen with the wild type FPR.To examine the functional capabilities of the mutant forms of the FPR, we measured the ability of the transfected cells to mobilize calcium. As we have previously reported, addition of fMLP to L cells transfected with the wild type FPR resulted in a dose-dependent increase in intracellular levels of calcium with an EC50 of ~0.5 nM (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with cells expressing the R163F mutant. Cells expressing the R309G/E310A/R311G mutant were also able to initiate calcium mobilization upon the addition of fMLP; however, higher concentrations of ligand"

This study demonstrated that stimulation of procoagulant activity by elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+ is greatly diminished in ATP-depleted erythrocytes. Phospholipid translocase inhibitors failed to fully inhibit recovery from the procoagulant state after removal of Ca2+. The data indicate that recovery of endogenous lipid from a procoagulant configuration may not be entirely mediated by the phospholipid translocase.

As these three protein derivatives all have six-coordinate, low spin, ferric hemes with axial imidazole and thiolate ligands, the superposition of x-ray absorption edge spectral properties demonstrates that the protein environment does not effect the spectra, provided one compares heme iron centers with identical coordination numbers, spin and oxidation states, and ligand sets. In contrast, a 0.96 eV difference is observed in the energy of the absorption edge for imidazole- and thiolate-ligated ferric myoglobin with the latter shifted to lower energy as observed for ferrous myoglobin states. Similarly, in the low spin ferric-imidazole and ferrous-CO states, the energies of the absorption edge for chloroperoxidase and P-450-CAM are shifted in the direction of the ferrous state (to lower energy) when compared with those for analogous myoglobin derivatives.

Although their amino acid sequences (5Brew K. Vanaman T.C. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3747-3749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and three-dimensional structures (6Smith S.G.

Walker N.P.C. Lewis M. Phillips D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 99-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) are largely homologous, functionally they are widely different. Lysozymes catalyze the hydrolysis of the β1-4 glycosidic linkage between N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid in the main polysaccharide constituent of Gram-positive bacterial cell walls. Their hydrolytic activity is carried by two essential carboxylate groups, contributed in human lysozyme by residues Glu-35 and Asp-53.1( 1As a rule, the amino acid sequence numbering used refers to HLY, unless otherwise stated. ) On the other hand, α-lactalbumins regulate lactose biosynthesis by modulating the specificity of β-galactosyltransferase. One of the best characterized functions of α-lactalbumins is their ability to bind Ca2+ strongly. This property resides in a typical Ca2+-binding loop, in which two peptide carbonyls and three carboxylate groups (Asp-82, Asp-87 and Asp-88 in the bovine species) act as ligands (8Stuart D.I. Acharya K.R. Walker N.P.C. Smith S.G. Lewis M. Phillips D.C. Nature. 1986; 324: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The binding of Ca2+ to α-lactalbumin results in the formation of a stable metalloprotein. Dissociation of Ca2+, extremes of pH, elevated temperatures, or moderate concentrations of denaturant lead to the appearance of a typical partially unfolded state (9Dolgikh D.A. Gilmanshin R.I. Brazhnikov E.V. Bychkova V.E. Semisotnov G.V. Venyaminov S.Y. Ptitsyn O.B. FEBS Lett. 1981; 136: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), which has been designated a molten globule state. It has been characterized by a variety of measurements and shown to exhibit a high content of secondary structure, considerable compactness, nonspecific tertiary structure and significant structural flexibility (10Kuwajima K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar, 11Haynie D.T. Freire E. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1707-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). As a result, upon denaturation molecules of α-lactalbumin pass in a multistate process from a native folded state through an equilibrium molten globule intermediate into a completely unfolded state. By contrast, lysozymes generally conform to the classical two-state model for cooperative unfolding without showing an intermediate state with molten globule character. We have recently observed a partially unfolded state comparable with the molten globule state of α-lactalbumin in the case of equine lysozyme (13Van Dael H. Haezebrouck P. Morozova L. Arico-Muendel C. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11886-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is indicative that, although most lysozymes are unable to bind Ca2+, equine lysozyme possesses a Ca2+-binding loop (14Nitta K. Tsuge H. Shimazaki K. Sugai S. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Protein engineering experiments mostly involve the introduction of point mutations at specific sites into well characterized enzymes in order to investigate the role of the corresponding amino acid residues either in binding and catalysis or in molecular structure and stability. Since the stability of protein molecules can be considerably promoted by the introduction of metal ion binding sites, several attempts have been made to introduce the Ca2+ binding function of α-lactalbumin in lysozyme by site-directed mutagenesis. Kuroki et al.(15Kuroki R. Taniyama Y. Seko C. Nakamura H. Kikuchi M. Ikehara M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6903-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have shown that introducing two of the necessary Asp residues at the corresponding sites in the human lysozyme molecule results in a functional Ca2+-binding site. More recently, we have been able to demonstrate, first, that a single Asp (A92D) suffices for Ca2+ binding and, second, that another mutant (M42) ( 2The abbreviations used are: M4mutant of human lysozyme, obtained by site-directed mutagenesis, in which four (A83K, Q86D, N88D, A92D) residues were changedHLYhuman lysozyme (isolated from milk)BLAbovine α-lactalbuminLYLA1chimera obtained from human lysozyme by substituting the central part for the homologous sequence of bovine α-lactalbumin as described in the textCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase(GlcNAc)3 = N,N’N”-triacetylchitotrioseFura-21-[2-(5’-carboxyoxazol-2’-yl)-6-aminobenzofuran-5-oxy]-2-(2’-amino-5’-methylphenoxy)-ethane- N,N,N’, N’-tetraacetic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. )which contains a fully equipped Ca2+ site is clearly stabilized against thermal denaturation in its Ca2+-bound form (16Haezebrouck P.

The purpose of the present study was to transplant the structural element, which is responsible for the Ca2+ binding properties of BLA, into the sterically homologous position in HLY and to study the effects of the newly introduced Ca2+ binding capacity on the properties of the hybrid. The transplanted structure is composed of a short 310 helix, the Ca2+-binding loop, and the central helix C (Fig. 1), and corresponds to the amino acid sequence 72-97 (BLA numbering) (Table I). The construction of the hybrid gene occurred in three steps. In the first, identical restriction sites had to be introduced in register into the plasmids pTZAGLYSHR and pTZs31T, that were used as the source material for the hly and bla genes, respectively. In the second, the homologous bla gene fragment was inserted into the hly gene. In the third, the hybrid gene was cloned into the appropriate shuttle vector.

In order to create an XhoII site at codons 101-103 of the lysozyme gene, and to shift the XhoII site from the corresponding amino acid position 94-96 to position 96-98 of the α-lactalbumin gene (BLA numbering), we used two oligonucleotides. The first one intended for pTZAGLYSHR was 5’-GATACCTTGTGGATCTAACAACTCT-3’ and the second one for pTZs31T: 5’-GATACGACCGGATCTAGAATCTTCTTAAC-3’ (the XhoII site in both is marked in italics). By using the newly created NdeI restriction site in the hly gene and the NdeI site already present in the bla gene at the corresponding amino acid positions, and both newly created XhoII restriction sites in the hly and bla genes, the hly sequence corresponding to the amino acid sequence from Ala-76 to Asp-102 was exchanged for that of bla, equivalent to Ile-72 to Asp-97 (BLA numbering). Because the pTZAGLYSHR plasmid contains several XhoII sites, it was cut by XhoII/SalI and SalI/NdeI, respectively. From each digest the appropriate fragment was isolated and ligated to the NdeI- XhoII fragment of pTZs31T, and the resulting plasmid was named pTZAGLYLA1. After verifying the sequence of the chimeric lyla1 gene, pTZAGLYLA1 was cut with BamHI and SalI to isolate the DNA sequence corresponding to the promotor, the signal sequence, and the lyla1 gene. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-terminator sequence was isolated from pGEMAGTLYSHR as a SalI- BamHI fragment. Both fragments (promotor-signal-gene on the one hand and terminator on the other) were ligated into the BamHI site of pTZ18U to obtain pTZAGLYLA1T. The BamHI- BamHI fragment of the latter, containing the promotor, signal, coding sequence, and terminator, were ligated into the BamHI site of the pAB24 shuttle vector, resulting in the pABAGLYLA1 expression plasmid. The newly constructed pABAGLYLA1 was used to transform the S. cerevisiae GRF182 strain by the lithium acetate method (26Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Uracil-selective medium was used to screen for plasmid-containing cells and Ura+ transformants were grown in leucine-selective medium for 4 days. This culture was used to inoculate (1/20) buffered YPD medium. Cells were grown at 28°C in shaking culture or in a 10-liter fermentation batch supplied with 4% ethanol after exhaustion of the carbon source. The culture was harvested after 5-7 days of growth. The LYLA1 protein was purified from the pooled supernatant by repeated cation-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography as follows. The supernatant was diluted with 4 volumes of distilled water and its pH was adjusted to 6.5. It was loaded onto a cation-exchange column Fractogel-SO3 (Merck; type EMD 650 M) which was equilibrated with 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. After washing with the same buffer, the chimeric protein was eluted with 1 M NaCl in buffer. Fractions positive for enzymatic or antigenic activity were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl HR-100 (Pharmacia) column, using 50 mM NaAc, pH 5.0, 0.2 M NaCl. The fractions containing the chimeric protein were pooled, dialyzed against water, and rerun on the previously mentioned cation exchanger, this time eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0-1.5 M). The final yield of LYLA1 was between 8 and 9 mg/liter of medium. The purity of the final product was controlled by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), by isoelectric focusing on precoated plates (Serva) containing an ampholite gradient of pH 3-10, by electrospray-mass spectrometry on a V. G. Biotech BIO-Q instrument, and by N-terminal sequence analysis on a gas phase sequenator (Applied Biosystems model 477A) using Edman chemistry. The antigenic properties of the chimeric LYLA1 were analyzed using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to the parent proteins BLA and HLY. The latter were prepared by injecting rabbits with recombinant HLY (18De Baetselier A. Rosenberg S. Hanotier J. European Patent Application 89870140.4. 1989; Google Scholar) or with natural BLA (21Viaene A. Volckaert G. Joniau M. De Baetselier A. Van Cauwelaert F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Antibodies to HLY were affinity-purified on CNBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia) to which a commercial preparation of HLY was coupled. Antibodies to BLA were purified as described (21Viaene A. Volckaert G. Joniau M. De Baetselier A. Van Cauwelaert F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The presence of antigenic determinants specific for the Ca2+-binding loop and the helix C in LYLA1 was confirmed using antibodies induced with a CAT-fusion protein in which the C terminus of CAT was elongated by the BLA sequence 73-105 (16Haezebrouck P. De Baetselier A. Joniau M. Van Dael H. Rosenberg S. Hanssens I. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As both BLA- and HLY-specific epitopes are present on the LYLA1 chimera, measurement of this protein was routinely done with a sandwich immunoradiometric assay (21Viaene A. Volckaert G. Joniau M. De Baetselier A. Van Cauwelaert F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), using anti-BLA to coat the wells and 125I-labeled anti-HLY for detection. The standard enthalpy for Ca2+ binding (Δ Hca) was measured using a batch microcalorimeter (LKB type 2107) (27Desmet J. Hanssens I. Van Cauwelaert F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the binding constant (Kca) by competition titration with Fura-2 (14Nitta K. Tsuge H. Shimazaki K. Sugai S. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Decalcification of LYLA1 was performed as described before (28Haezebrouck P. Noppe W. Van Dael H. Hanssens I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1122: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the final Ca2+ content of the apo form, measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy, was always lower than 0.05 mol/mol of protein. The lytic activity was measured using M. luteus as substrate (29Kikuchi M. Yamamoto Y. Taniyama Y. Ishimaru K. Yashikawa W. Yoshihiko K. Ikehara M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 85: 9411-9415Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), with the exception that the buffer used was 0.1 M MES, pH 6.2. In order to monitor the effect of Ca2+ on the enzymatic activity, the assay mixture was adjusted to either 1 mM CaCl2 or 1 mM EDTA. In a study of the pH dependence of the hydrolytic activity, different buffers were used as indicated. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm, based on the following values for A (1%): for BLA = 20.1; HLY, A92D, and M4 = 25.5; and LYLA1 = 25.0, computed on the basis of the calculated molecular weight and Tyr and Trp content. Absorbance measurements were done on a Beckman DU-70 spectrophotometer. The binding of (GlcNAc)3 to these proteins was monitored by the Trp fluorescence enhancement that is induced upon substrate binding to the active site cleft (30Chipman D. Grisaro V. Sharon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4388-4394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In practice, to 2.0 ml of 0.1 mg/ml protein in 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing either 1 mM Ca2+ or 1 mM EDTA, small aliquots of a suitably diluted (GlcNAc)3 solution in water were added. After each addition, the temperature was re-equilibrated to 25°C and the Trp fluorescence emission spectrum recorded (λexc = 285 nm). The enhanced fluorescence intensity at 325 nm was corrected for dilution and plotted as a function of the logarithm of the total (GlcNAc)3 concentration. From the sigmoidal saturation curves the pEC50 (the logarithm of the concentration of (GlcNAc)3 needed to obtain 50% of the maximally enhanced fluorescence intensity) values, that are representative for the relative binding constants, were deduced by the point of inflection. All fluorescence measurements were performed on an Aminco SPF-500 spectrofluorometer, and only corrected spectra are shown. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were carried out on a Jasco J-600A spectropolarimeter using cuvettes of 1-cm path length in the near-UV region and of 1 or 0.1 mm in the far-UV. Base-line normalization was done at 250 (far-UV) and 320 nm (near-UV). The data were expressed as residual ellipticity [θ] (deg·cm2·dmol−1) using 115.1 and 113.1 as the mean residue weight for LYLA1 and HLY, respectively. NMR spectra were recorded using a GE Omega 500 MHz spectrometer. One-dimensional spectra were measured with a sweep width of 7042 Hz using 4096 points, giving a digital resolution of 1.71 Hz/point. The following two-dimensional experiments were performed for the purposes of assignment and structural analysis: phase-sensitive J-correlated spectroscopy (COSY), single and double relayed coherence transfer spectroscopy, and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (31Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4721) Google Scholar, 32Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar, 33Macura S. Huang Y. Suter D. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 43: 259-281Google Scholar). Data sets were acquired as 512 t1 increments of 2048 data points and 48-96 transients. Several mixing times were used in the nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy experiment ranging between 150 and 250 ms. Samples were internally referenced using 1,4-dioxane which resonates at 3.743 ppm. All NMR spectra were recorded at pH 4.5, 35°C, and were processed using the program Felix 2.1 (Hare Research Inc.) on a Sun computer. Computer modeling was done on a Silicon Graphics IRIS Indigo computer. The software used for interactive modeling and energy calculations was the BRUGEL program (34Delhaise P. Bardiaux M. Wodak S. J. Mol. Graph. 1984; 2: 103-106Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates used were those of the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (35Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer Jr., E.E. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8058) Google Scholar) for HLY (code: 1 LZ1) and for baboon α-lactalbumin (code: 1 ALC). SDS-PAGE of the purified protein indicated that neither aggregation nor fragmentation had occurred (data not shown). On isoelectric focusing, the chimera migrates to a position close to that of HLY. By extrapolation from the reference mixture, the pI of the hybrid is estimated to be 9.6. In comparison with HLY (pI around 11), this figure is consistent with expectations since the hybrid carries four additional Asp residues and one additional Lys. Again, the presence of a single band illustrates the relative purity of the chimera. When measured by electrospray-mass spectrometry, the molecular weight of the peak corresponded to the Ca2+ form (14,878 versus a predicted value of 14,879). N-terminal sequencing confirmed correct processing by the yeast cells. In analogy with previous work on mutant M4 (16Haezebrouck P. De Baetselier A. Joniau M. Van Dael H. Rosenberg S. Hanssens I. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against the whole BLA molecule and also against a CAT-fusion protein that carries the BLA sequence 73-105, we proved that LYLA1 clearly possesses BLA epitopes (data not shown). The binding of Ca2+ to LYLA1 was examined by competition titrations with the Ca2+ binding dye, Fura-2 (14Nitta K. Tsuge H. Shimazaki K. Sugai S. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in 0.01 M Hepes, 0.1 M KCl at pH 7.1 and 20°C. The titration data are consistent with a single, strong binding site with a Kca of 2.50 (± 0.04) × 108M−1 (Fig. 2). In, thermodynamic data obtained from microcalorimetric titrations are compared with those for BLA, HLY, and the Ca2+-binding HLY mutant, M4. Since the chimera contains the two residues essential for catalytic activity, Glu-35 and Asp-53, one might expect LYLA1 to possess muramidase activity. Also, the introduction of the Ca2+ site derived from BLA raises the question whether its lytic activity can be modulated by Ca2+ binding. LYLA1 possesses about 10% of the hydrolytic activity of HLY. In the presence of Ca2+, the specific activity of HLY (506 enzyme units/mg) is reduced to 46 for LYLA1. In 1 mM EDTA, the corresponding figures are 342 and 53. Thus, the specific activity of the chimera is only slightly dependent on the presence of Ca2+. We also checked the pH dependence of the catalytic activity of LYLA1 and compared it with that of HLY and of its mutant M4 (Fig. 3). The data show that the chimera possesses optimal activity at a pH slightly lower than that of HLY. The figure also indicates the virtual absence of a Ca2+ effect at all pH values. In contrast, although no strong Ca2+ site has been found on HLY, Ca2+ seems to improve its muramidase activity, whereas in the case of the Ca2+-binding mutant M4, Ca2+ slightly suppresses the catalytic activity. The binding affinity of the competitive inhibitor (GlcNAc)3 was also evaluated. Binding of this oligosaccharide can conveniently be followed by its enhancing effect on tryptophan fluorescence (30Chipman D. Grisaro V. Sharon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4388-4394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Go"
https://openalex.org/W1514772864,"We examined the regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger gene during differentiation of the P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells. Treatment of P19 cells with retinoic acid induces the development of neurons, astroglia, and microglia cells. Upon retinoic acid-induced differentiation of P19 cells, there was an early and rapid 10-fold increase in NHE1 transcription. A proximal cis-acting AP-2 site of the NHE1 promoter was sufficient for stimulation of transcription of the gene by differentiation. Bandshift experiments demonstrated that in retinoic acid-treated cells there was an elevated level of AP-2 transcription factor binding to the AP-2 consensus site of the Na+/H+ exchanger gene. In the differentiation defective mutant RAC65, the effect of differentiation on Na+/H+ exchanger gene expression was reduced by 60%. Examination of Na+/H+ exchanger activity showed that retinoic acid-treated P19 cells recovered from an acid load at a rate approximately three times greater than untreated cells. The increases in gene expression and protein activity preceded major changes in cell morphology, suggesting that the initiation of differentiation is linked to NHE1 gene expression. Our findings show for the first time that the NHE1 gene is activated early in cell differentiation and that this activation may play an important role in the process of neuronal cell differentiation.

Our findings show for the first time that the NHE1 gene is activated early in cell differentiation and that this activation may play an important role in the process of neuronal cell differentiation. The Na+/H+ exchanger is a mammalian plasma membrane protein that mediates the exchange of intracellular H+ ions for extracellular Na+ ions with a stoichiometry of 1:1. Several isoforms of the protein have been identified which are designated NHE1-4. The NHE1 isoform is present in all mammalian cells and has been described as the housekeeping isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger family (1Fliegel L. Frohlich O. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). NHE1 is involved in pH regulation (2Boron W.F. Boulpaep E.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), control of cell volume (3Grinstein S. Clarke C.A. Rothstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 82: 619-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and is activated by growth factors (4Pouyssegur J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 453-455Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of regulation of the protein has received much attention, the recent cloning of both the human and the mouse NHE1 genes have enabled more in-depth study of the promoter activity (5Kolyada A.Y. Lebedeva T.V. Johns C.A. Madias N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Dyck J.R.B. Silva N.L.C. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1375-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Specific regions of both promoters have been identified as putative cis-elements that may be responsible for controlling the regulation of the NHE1 gene (6Dyck J.R.B. Silva N.L.C. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1375-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have provided direct evidence of a transcription factor that can up-regulate the NHE1 gene. This trans-acting nuclear protein has been identified as the transcription factor AP-2 (5Kolyada A.Y. Lebedeva T.V. Johns C.A. Madias N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These findings have shown that the Na+/H+ exchanger gene can be up-regulated and suggest that the exchanger performs specific functions separate from its normal housekeeping role. The Na+/H+ exchanger is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation (7Rao G.N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). During cell proliferation the exchanger is responsible for an elevation of intracellular pH. In some cell types this pH change has been shown to play an important permissive role in growth (8Grinstein S. Rotin D. Mason M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 73-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Cell differentiation, however, results in more drastic alterations in growth patterns and involves the activation of many genes. How the Na+/H+ exchanger gene is regulated and involved during this process remains unknown. Rao et al.(7Rao G.N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) examined the regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger expression and its role in retinoic acid-induced differentiation of HL60 cells. Immediately prior to differentiation into granulocyte-like cells, the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger increases and remains elevated well into differentiation (7Rao G.N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Ladoux A. Cragoe E.J. Geny B. Abita J.P. Frelin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 811-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is an 18-fold increase in NHE1 mRNA levels as well as a 7-fold increase in protein levels (7Rao G.N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This dramatic rise in Na+/H+ antiporter levels suggests that Na+/H+ exchanger gene expression and differentiation are closely linked. Retinoic acid-induced differentiation is not specific to HL60 cells. Many murine cell lines can also differentiate when treated with retinoic acid (10Strickland S. Mahdavi V. Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). In tissue culture systems the acidic form of vitamin A (retinoic acid) replaces the natural morphogen present during development (11Luscher B. Mitchell P.J. Williams T. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The effects of retinoic acid are believed to be exerted through a wide variety of receptors and binding proteins. These proteins act as trans-activating factors which can regulate the expression of specific genes (12Leid M. Kaster P. Chambon P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 13Bain G. Ray W.J. Yao M. Giottlieb D.I. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The transcription factor AP-2 is one such regulatory protein (14Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Retinoic acid causes increases in AP-2 mRNA and protein levels. These increases are believed to be important in initiating differentiation in embryonal carcinoma cell lines such as P19 cells and human NT2 teratocarcinoma cells (14Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 15Philipp J. Mitchell P.J. Malipiero U. Fontana A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 602-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). P19 cells are a well-established tissue culture model for early embryonic determination and differentiation. These cells are a widely utilized pluripotent cell line able to grow continuously in serum-supplemented media. The differentiation of these embryonal carcinoma cells can be controlled by nontoxic doses of retinoic acid or dimethyl sulfoxide. Treatment with retinoic acid effectively induces the development of neurons, astroglia, and microglia cells normally derived from the neuroectoderm. Six days after initial retinoic acid treatment more than 85% of cells express neuronal markers (16McBurney M.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription factor AP-2 has been implicated in retinoic acid-induced differentiation of P19 cells and in NT2 cells, a similar human teratocarcinoma cell line (11Luscher B. Mitchell P.J. Williams T. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 14Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 15Philipp J. Mitchell P.J. Malipiero U. Fontana A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 602-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study we examine regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger gene during retinoic acid induced differentiation of P19 cells. Because AP-2 has been suggested to be important in both regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger gene (6Dyck J.R.B. Silva N.L.C. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1375-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and embryonal carcinoma cell differentiation (11Luscher B. Mitchell P.J. Williams T. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 15Philipp J. Mitchell P.J. Malipiero U. Fontana A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 602-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) we suspected that AP-2 may be involved in regulation of antiporter expression during differentiation. Our findings provide direct evidence to support the conclusion that the Na+/H+ exchanger gene is activated early in P19 cellular differentiation. They suggest that this AP-2-dependent activation may play a key role in the process of retinoic acid induced differentiation in this cell type. Restriction endonuclease and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Laval, Quebec, Canada) and Life Technologies, Inc. All trans-retinoic acid and G418 were purchased from Sigma. Hybond-N+ nylon membranes were obtained from Amersham (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). [α-32P]dCTP and [δ-32P]dATP were from ICN. The plasmid pTZ 19 was from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnol. All other chemicals were of analytical or molecular biology grade and were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada), Sigma, or BDH (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD). RAC65 cells were a generous gift from Dr. McBurney from the Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Wild type and mutant P19 cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum and 7.5% calf serum as reported earlier (17Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 19-49Google Scholar). Before transfection cells were plated in 10-cm dishes at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml and incubated for 24 h. After 24 h the medium was changed, the cells transfected, and incubated for 5 h. On completion of the incubation stage, the cells were split into two 10-cm dishes, one treated with retinoic acid and the other left in control medium. For the stable cell line, a slightly different protocol was used to induce a high percentage of the cells to differentiate to neuronal cell types. The cells were aggregated for 4 days in the presence of 5 μM retinoic acid in non-adhesive plates then plated on adhesive substrates in the absence of retinoic acid for another 48 h. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described earlier (6Dyck J.R.B. Silva N.L.C. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1375-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). pXP-1MP was constructed as described earlier (6Dyck J.R.B. Silva N.L.C. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1375-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The 1.1-kilobase fragment contains base pairs −1085 to +22 of NHE1. To construct pMP+AP2 plasmid, two oligonucleotides were used as primers for polymerase chain reaction (no. 1, ttgg atc CGT GAC ACT TCC TTC CCT and no, 3, cc ttc gaa GGG TCC CGC GGT AGC GGA) were synthesized to amplify base pairs −125 to +22 of the gene. The polymerase chain reaction product had the restriction enzyme sites BamHI and HindIII generated on either end and was inserted into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pXP-1. Similarly, pMP-AP2 plasmid was made using the product of the primers 3 and 2 (no. 2, ttgg atc CTG CAC CGC GCG GGC GCT) and the 114-base pair product (−92 to +22) was inserted into pXP-1. To construct p(AP2)3SV, oligonucleotides AP2R1 (5’-GAT C(CT)T TCC TTC CCT GGG CGA CAG GGG CCA-3’) and AP2R2 (5’-GAT C(CT)G GCC CCT GTC GCC CAG GGA AGG AAA-3’) were annealed, ligated together, and then digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and BglII. The product was size fractionated on a 9% acrylamide gel, and the ligated product of the oligonucleotides was purified and ligated into the BamHI site of PTZ 19. The DNA was removed from PTZ with the restriction enzymes SalI and EcoRI. The SV40 promoter was digested from pCAT-promoter plasmid (Promega) using EcoRI and HindIII and was ligated into the corresponding sites of pBluescript SK- (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This fragment was removed from pBluescript SK- with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and HindIII. The plasmid pXP-1 was digested with HindIII and SalI and ligated simultaneously with the two fragments: the SalI and EcoRI fragment containing the AP-2 repeats and the EcoRI and HindIII fragment containing the SV40 promoter. The resulting plasmid (p(AP2)3SV) contained three tandem copies of the AP-2 site of the mouse NHE1 promoter located 5’ to the SV40 promoter. All plasmids were sequenced to verify proper orientation and fidelity of polymerase chain reaction. Cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described earlier (6Dyck J.R.B. Silva N.L.C. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1375-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). P19 cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes, and each dish received 10 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and 10 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control. After cells were incubated for 5 h with the plasmid and the calcium phosphate coprecipitate, they were divided into new plates with a dilution of 1:2 and were treated ( 1The abbreviations used are: TricineN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycineBCECF-AM2’-7’-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. )with 5 μM of retinoic acid or control medium. After 40 h cells were harvested and cell lysates assayed for luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected as described earlier (6Dyck J.R.B. Silva N.L.C. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1375-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were made using the same calcium phosphate transfection protocol with pRSVneo plasmid (1 μg) and with pMP+AP2 (20 μg). After transfection, cells were incubated for 24 h before being replated at a dilution of 1:10. After replating the cells were treated with 200 μg/ml of G418 for 18 days. G418-resistant colonies were identified, and individual colonies were repropagated until reaching a higher density. They were then assayed for the ability to express luciferase activity. Polymerase chain reaction was used to determine if the entire mouse promoter region from pMP+AP2 had been inserted. The polymerase chain reaction primers amplified a region from the 5’ end of the luciferase gene to the 5’ end of the mouse NHE1 insert. P19 cells stably transfected with the plasmid pMP+AP2 (referred to as P19A2) were used to study cell differentiation. P19A2 cells were aggregated for 4 days on 10-cm non-adhesive type Petri dishes in the presence of retinoic acid, then plated on adhesive substrates for another 48 h. The same number of cells were harvested at various time points throughout the differentiation process and were assayed for luciferase activity. Each luciferase assay contained 40 μl of the cell lysate and 100 μl of the luciferase assay reagent (20 mM Tricine,1 1.07 mM magnesium carbonate, 2.67 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 33.3 mM dithiothreitol, 470 mM luciferin, 530 mM ATP, 270 mM coenzyme A, and 1 ng/ml bovine serum albumin). The β-galactosidase assay included 50 μl of cell lysate, 50 μl of H20, and 20 μl of O-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside incubated at 37°C for 60 min. Luciferase activity was assayed with an LKB luminometer and normalized to β-galactosidase for efficiency of transfection for transiently transfected cells and to the number of cells and protein content for stably transfected cells.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was on 9% polyacrylamide gels as described earlier (18Fliegel L. Haworth R.S. Dyck J.R.B. Biochem J. 1993; 289: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Protein levels from cell extracts were determined using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto the gels, and after separation, proteins were transferred electrophoretically on to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunostaining of nitrocellulose was carried out in the presence of 1% skim milk powder using the neuron-specific class III β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (19Alexander J.E. Hunt D.F. Lee M.K.

The antibody was detected using the Amersham Enhanced Chemiluminescence Western blotting and Detection System as described by the manufacturer. For measurement of intracellular pH P19 cells were grown for 40 h with or without retinoic acid and then trypsinized and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescence measurements were made on a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorophotometer. Cells were incubated in a cuvette with constant stirring. The acetoxy methyl ester of 2’-7’-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (6Dyck J.R.B. Silva N.L.C. Fliegel L. J. Biol.

Intracellular pH was measured utilizing the dual excitation single emission ratio technique. Excitation wavelengths were at 452 and 500 nM with emission at 520 nM. This allows measurement of intracellular pH that is independent of cell concentration and dye loading (20Chaillte J.R. Boron W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 86: 765-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A calibration curve for intracellular dye was generated by the nigericin method (20Chaillte J.R. Boron W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 86: 765-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To measure initial rates of proton extrusion after an acid challenge the NH4Cl prepulse method was used. Cells were incubated with buffer containing 15 μM NH4Cl for 5 min. They were pelleted (10,000 rpm for 30 s) and then resuspended in Na+-free buffer that contained 135 mM N-methyl-D-glucamine instead of NaCl. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in a solution containing 67.5 μM NaCl (and 67.5 μM N-methyl-D-glucamine), and the initial rate of rise of internal pH was measured during the first 40 s of recovery. Nuclear extracts were prepared from P19 cells as reported by Schreiber et al.(21Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). The synthetic oligonucleotides of the sequence 5’-TTC CTT CCC TGG GCG ACA GGG GCC-3’ (MPAP2a) and 5’-GGC CCC TGT CGC CCA GGG AAG GAA-3’ (MPAP2b) were made which correspond to the AP-2 region of the mouse Na+/H+ exchanger promoter. The oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. They were heated to 95°C for 2 min and cooled to room temperature overnight for annealing. DNA binding reactions were for 10 min at room temperature and contained 30,000 counts/min of γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotides mixed with P19 nuclear extract (5 μg) in a binding buffer (4% glycerol, 1.25 μM MgCl2, 0.5 μM EDTA, 0.5 μM dithiothreitol, 50 μM NaCl, 10 μM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.05 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)). After electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels, the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for 16 h. In some experiments nuclear extracts were treated to specifically remove AP-2 protein before gel mobility shift assays were performed. Twenty μl of a 10% solution of Protein A was incubated with 1 or 2 μg of AP-2 antibody (IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for 1 h at 4°C. After 1 h the solution was washed three times (20 μM Tris, pH 7.9, 400 μM NaCl, 1 μM EDTA, 1 μM EGTA, 1 μM dithriothreitol, and 1 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), mixed with 5 μl of P19 nuclear extracts, and incubated at 4°C for 16 h. The mixture was then spun at 6,500 revolutions/min for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected. Control experiments contained equal amounts of irrelevant IgG. A 1.1-kilobase fragment of the mouse NHE1 gene has recently been cloned, and putative regulatory sites have been identified (6Dyck J.R.B. Silva N.L.C. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1375-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Initial studies concentrated on identifying the regions of the promoter that are involved in the regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger gene in P19 cells. We constructed several different plasmids containing varying fragments of the promoter/enhancer region. Our initial construct contained the entire 1.1-kilobase mouse promoter/enhancer region located 5’ to a luciferase gene. This plasmid was termed pXP-1MP. From this initial plasmid we deleted base pairs −1085 to −126 (pMP+AP2) and −1085 to −92 (pMP-AP2) to create two new plasmids (Fig. 1). These plasmids were then transfected into P19 cells in an attempt to determine which regions were responsible for regulating the NHE1 gene. All transfection experiments also included pSV-β-galactosidase which was used to normalize for any differences in transfection efficiency. Fig. 1 is a comparison of luciferase activity between the three plasmids. When the region from −1085 to −126 was deleted from the original pXP-1MP construct there was a 37% decrease in the rate of transcription. This decrease indicates that the deleted region must contain some element(s) that contribute to the basal levels of transcription of the NHE1 gene in P19 cells. We then examined the importance of the region immediately 3’ to this deletion. When an extra 33 base pairs were deleted from pMP+AP2 the level of luciferase activity decreased another 62% from that seen with the complete promoter. These 33 base pairs have been shown earlier to contain the binding site for the transcription factor AP-2 and to be involved in NHE1 gene regulation (6Dyck J.R.B. Silva N.L.C. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1375-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To examine the direct involvement of the AP-2 site from the mouse NHE1 gene in P19 cells, two new reporter plasmids were constructed. The luciferase gene was linked to a wild type SV40 promoter (pSVLUC) or to the SV40 promoter which contained a triplicated AP-2-binding site derived from the NHE1 gene (p(AP2)3 SV, Fig. 2). These plasmids were then transfected into P19 cells with pSV-β-galactosidase. Fig. 2A demonstrates the importance of the AP-2 site in the regulation of transcription in P19 cells. In these experiments, p(AP2)3SV showed a 3.2-fold increase in transcription in comparison to pSVLUC (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2). This indicates that in P19 cells the AP-2 site from the NHE1 gene can activate a foreign promoter and increase the luciferase levels. Because the two new plasmids differ only in the presence of the NHE1 AP-2 site, we can conclude that this site plays a significant role in the elevated expression of the exchanger gene in P19 cells. This regulation may allow for a constitutively higher level of transcription in P19 cells compared to cells with lower levels of AP-2 protein. The need for increased exchanger promoter activity may be due to the pluripotent nature of P19 cells (17Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 19-49Google Scholar). Higher levels of NHE1 transcription may lead to a parallel increase in protein expression. This overall increase in exchanger protein may be important for the P19 cell to maintain its elevated pH (22Bierman A.J. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9621-9628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in steady state pH in P19 cells may contribute to producing a permissive environment for protein and DNA synthesis necessary for differentiation (23Pouyssegur J. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. FEBS Lett. 1985; 190: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 24Chambard J.C. Pouyssegur J. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 164: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis is that the AP-2 site is involved in regulating the mouse NHE1 gene in differentiating P19 cells. To test this hypothesis, we first needed to rule out any involvement from the region(s) proximal to the AP-2 site. Because this proximal region is involved in regulating basal levels of transcription in P19 cells (Fig. 1), the same region may also be involved in regulating the gene during differentiation. P19 cells were transfected with either pXP-1MP or with pMP+AP2. The cells were then treated with 0.5 μM all- trans-retinoic acid for 40 h. This concentration of retinoic acid has been shown to induce differentiation of P19 cells into neurons, astrocytes, and fibroblast-like cells (25St-Arnaud R. Moir J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1590-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A demonstrates the effects of differentiation on the level of transcription of the NHE1 promoter. After 40 h of treatment, the differentiating cells exhibited a 4-fold increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 3 A). The results show that retinoic acid-induced differentiation results in an increase in transcriptional activity from the mouse NHE1 gene. In addition, because the amount of increase in luciferase activity is the same in both plasmids (i.e. pXP-1MP and pMP+AP2) then the region responsible for the increase must not lie within base pairs −1085 to −126. It is for this reason we concentrated further studies on the region of the gene beginning from the AP-2 site to the start site of transcription. When P19 cells are induced to differentiate with retinoic acid, cells are subjected to two variables. The increase in NHE1 transcription may be directly due to retinoic acid, due to differentiation, or to a combination of the two stimuli. To ensure that a maximal stimulus has been achieved and complete neuronal differentiation has been induced, we increased the concentration of retinoic acid to 5 μM. This concentration has been shown to be sufficient to fully induce neuronal differentiation (26Dedhar S. Rennie P.S. Shago M. Hagesteijn C.L. Yang H. Filmus J. Hawley R.G. Bruchovsky N. Cheng H. Matusik R.J. Giguere V. Nature. 1994; 367: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). With higher concentrations of retinoic acid, we observed even higher levels of NHE1 promoter activity. Fig. 3 B demonstrates that the construct pMP+AP2 now produces a 10-fold increase in luciferase activity with retinoic acid-induced stimulation. The plasmid pMP-AP2, however, produced only a minor, insignificant increase in promoter activity compared with pMP+AP2. The results from Fig. 3B confirm that retinoic acid-induced effects on P19 cells are localized to the region known to interact with transcription factor AP-2 (6Dyck J.R.B. Silva N.L.C. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1375-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Additionally, Fig. 3 B demonstrates that with the higher concentration of retinoic acid either the cells are stimulated to further differentiate or that retinoic acid itself affects the NHE1 gene. In an attempt to distinguish direct transcriptional effects of retinoic acid from the effects mediated through differentiation, the P19 mutant RAC65 was utilized. This cell line was derived from a clone which has been selected for its inability to differentiate when exposed to retinoic acid (27Pratt C.M.A. Kralova J. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6446-6453Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These cells were transfected with pMP+AP2 and pSV-β-galactosidase and then treated either with or without"

In work described here, we demonstrate that the MGSA-enhanced phosphorylation of this receptor is mediated via a process involving pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Furthermore, treatment of the 3ASubE P-3 cells with either 12- O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) or 1,2-dioctanoyl- sn-glycerol (diC8), two different activators of protein kinase C (PKC), results in a concentration-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of the IL-8RB. Inhibition of PKC, by treatment with staurosporin (50 nM for 2 h), or down-regulation of PKC, by prolonged treatment with TPA (400 nM for 40 h) suppresses the TPA-enhanced receptor phosphorylation, but has no effect on the MGSA-enhanced receptor phosphorylation. These data suggest that the isoforms of PKC that are sensitive to these manipulations may not play a role in mediating the MGSA-enhanced phosphorylation of the IL-8RB. TPA treatment also results in a time-dependent decrease in 125I-MGSA binding to the 3ASubE P-3 cells. A 30-min treatment with 400 nM TPA results in approximately a 50% decrease in binding, whereas a 2-h treatment essentially eliminates specific binding of 125I-MGSA to these cells. The TPA-induced decrease in 125I-MGSA binding is accompanied by enhanced degradation of the IL-8RB, as indicated by Western blot analysis and pulse-chase experiments, suggesting a potential role for PKC as a negative regulator of the IL-8RB. MGSA treatment (50 nM for 2 h) also stimulates receptor degradation in the 3ASubE P-3 cells, indicating that this receptor is down-regulated in response to prolonged exposure to its ligand. In similar studies conducted on the promonocytic cell line, U937, MGSA treatment of the U937 cells resulted in receptor phosphorylation, whereas PKC activation failed to significantly modulate the phosphorylation state of the IL-8RB. Treatment of the U937 cells with MGSA, TPA, or diC8 resulted in a loss of receptor protein present in these cell types. These data imply that MGSA signaling through the IL-8RB is similar in both the non-hematopoietic and hematopoietic cell types, whereas activation of PKC by TPA or diC8 elicits different responses in these two distinct cell types.

https://openalex.org/W2056319669,"The truncated gene of hexokinase, mini-hexokinase, starting with methionine 455 and ending at the C terminus was expressed in Escherichia coli. Mini-hexokinase lost its ability to ameliorate inhibition of glucose-6-P-inhibited mini-hexokinase in the presence of phosphate (P(i)). We suggest that the P(i) site either resides in the N-terminal half of hexokinase I or requires the N-terminal portion of the enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to obtain two mutants of mini-hexokinase: C606S and C628S. Both are thought to be associated with the active site of hexokinase I. These mutants exhibited a 3-fold increase in Km for glucose but no change in either the Km for ATP or the kcat. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra showed no differences among the wild-type or mutant enzymes. These results suggest that Cys606 and Cys628 are not involved in glucose binding directly. The putative ATP-binding site of full-length human brain hexokinase may involve Arg539 and Gly679, and these residues were mutated to Ile. For the mutant R539I, the kcat value decreased 114-fold relative to wild-type hexokinase, whereas the Km values for ATP and glucose changed only slightly. No change was observed in the Ki value for 1,5-anhydroglucitol 6-phosphate. CD spectra showed only a slight change in secondary structure. For the mutant G679I, overexpressed hexokinase is insoluble. We suggest that Arg539 is important for catalysis because it stabilizes the transition state product ADP-hexokinase. Gly679 is probably important for proper folding of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1978648139,"Two lines of evidence indicate the importance of the N-terminal portion of rhodanese for correct folding of the nascent ribosome-bound polypeptide. A mutant gene lacking the codons for amino acids 1-23 of the wild-type protein is expressed very efficiently by coupled transcription/translation on Escherichia coli ribosomes; however, the mutant protein that is released from the ribosomes is enzymatically inactive. The mutant protein does not undergo the reaction that is promoted by the bacterial chaperone, DnaJ, which appears to be essential for folding of ribosome-bound rhodanese into the native conformation. The effect of DnaJ is monitored by fluorescence from coumarin cotranslationally incorporated at the N terminus of nascent rhodanese. Secondly, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 17 amino acids of the wild-type protein interferes with the synthesis of wild-type rhodanese but has much less effect on the synthesis of the N-terminal deletion mutant. The N-terminal peptide inhibits the effect of DnaJ on the nascent wild-type rhodanese and blocks the chaperone-mediated release and activation of ribosome-bound full-length rhodanese polypeptides that accumulate during in vitro synthesis. The results lead to the hypothesis that the N-terminal segment of rhodanese is required for its chaperone-dependent folding on the ribosome."

Catalase (EC 1.11.1.6; H2O2: H2O2-oxidoreductase) is a heme protein found in nearly all aerobically respiring organisms. Although catalases can catalyze the peroxidative oxidation of a wide range of organic and inorganic substrates, its primary function is believed to be to protect the cell components from the hazardous effects of hydrogen peroxide by catalyzing its dismutation according to the reaction: 2 H2O2→ 2 H2O + O2. Catalases have been isolated from a wide range of organisms, including mammals (Sumner and Dounce, 1937Sumner J.B. Dounce A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1937; 121: 417Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), plants (Galston et al., 1957Galston A.W. Bonnichsen R.K. Arnon D.I. Acta Chem. Scand. 1957; 5: 781-790Crossref Google Scholar), fungi (Scott and Hammer, 1960Scott D. Hammer F. Enzymologia. 1960; 22: 229-237PubMed Google Scholar), and bacteria (Herbert and Pinsent, 1948Herbert D. Pinsent J. J. Biochem. 1948; 43: 193-202Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Most isolated catalases are tetramers of noninteracting subunits with one heme group per subunit. The crystal structure has been solved and refined for three catalases: bovine liver catalase (BLC)1( 1The abbreviations used are: BLCbeef liver catalasePVCPenicillium vitale catalaseMLCMicrococcus lysodeikticus catalaseHRPhorseradish peroxidaseANCAspergillus niger catalaseRRresonance Raman. ) (Murthy et al., 1981Murthy M.R.N.

The crystal structure of the three catalases are very similar, the heme groups of each subunit being deeply buried in a nonpolar cavity formed by single polypeptide chains. The most distinctive feature of the catalase structure is the coordination of a phenolate group of the proximal tyrosine residue to the heme iron as a fifth ligand. Interestingly, attempts to model catalase activity with simple iron porphyrin compounds indicate that axial ligands with an oxygen donor (e.g. phenolate, tyrosinate, alcoholate ligands) are less efficient in catalyzing the dismutation of hydrogen peroxide than ligands with nitrogen donors (e.g. imidazole) (Belal et al., 1989Belal R. Momenteau M. Meunier B. New J. Chem. 1989; 13: 853-862Google Scholar; Robert et al., 1991Robert A. Loock B. Momenteau M. Meunier B. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 30: 706-711Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the coordination of these nitrogen donor ligands to the heme enhances not only the catalase activity but also the oxygenase activity, which is destructive for the distal amino acid residues of the protein (Belal et al., 1989Belal R. Momenteau M. Meunier B. New J. Chem. 1989; 13: 853-862Google Scholar; Robert et al., 1991). This oxygenase activity is quite small for oxygen donors, but they still maintain reasonable catalase activity. beef liver catalase Penicillium vitale catalase Micrococcus lysodeikticus catalase horseradish peroxidase Aspergillus niger catalase resonance Raman. The catalytic cycle of catalase involves the reaction with two molecules of hydrogen peroxide to form water and oxygen. The first step is an oxidation process involving the reaction with one molecule of hydrogen peroxide to form an oxidized reactive intermediate, known as compound I, and water. The second step is a reduction process which involves the reaction of compound I with a second molecule of hydrogen peroxide to regenerate the ferric catalase and molecular oxygen. Therefore, the mechanism of catalase action can be written (Schonbaum and Chance, 1976Schonbaum G.R. Chance B. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Vol. 13. Academic Press, New York1976: 263-408Google Scholar) as the following. Catalase+H2O2→I+H2OCompoundI+H2O2→+catalase+O2(Eq. 1) (Eq. 2) Compound I of catalases, like that of HRP, is best described as a ferryl π-cation radical, which is produced by the heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond of hydrogen peroxide and it is well established that the active sites of peroxidases and catalases contain structural elements which facilitate the transition state charge separation and promote the heterolytic O-O bond cleavage (Fita and Rossman, 1985aFita I.

Recently, it has been reported that BLC binds four molecules of NADPH very tightly (Kirkman and Gaitani, 1984Kirkman H.N. Gaitani G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4343-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar; Fita and Rossman, 1985bFita I. Rossman M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1604-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although the removal of the bound NADPH molecules does not eliminate the catalase activity, a significant loss of activity was observed upon lengthy exposure to H2O2. It has been proposed that binding of NADPH circumvents the inactivation of catalase by its natural substrate, hydrogen peroxide, by preventing the accumulation of compound II (Kirkman et al., 1987Kirkman H.N. Galiano S. Gaitani G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 660-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for the investigation of hemeprotein activesites (Spiro and Li, 1988Spiro T.G. Li X.-Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. Wiley, New York1988: 1-37Google Scholar) and axial-ligand vibrations (Yu and Kerr, 1984; Yu et al., 1988). Previous RR studies have concentrated on the investigation of the skeletal modes of the native forms of various catalases, the enhancement of the axial tyrosinate modes through excitation in the visible region (Chuang et al., 1988Chuang W.-J. Johnson S. Van Wart H.E. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1988; 34: 201-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar; Sharma et al., 1989Sharma K.D. Andersson L.A. Loehr T.M. Terner J. Goff H.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the detection of the reactive intermediates in the catalytic cycle (Chuang et al., 1989Chuang W.-J. Heldt J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14209-14215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Chuang and Van Wart, 1992Chuang W.-J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13293-13301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of RR studies on catalases ligated with various exogenous ligands prompted us to carry out an investigation of the ligated forms of catalases in order to probe the heme distal environment and the effect of the endogenous tyrosinate ligation on the vibrational modes of the axial ligand. Recently, this group reported the results of an RR investigation of CO-ligated BLC (Hu and Kincaid, 1992Hu S. Kincaid J.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In other reports, we have demonstrated that RR investigation (Al-Mustafa and Kincaid, 1993; Hu and Kincaid, 1992Hu S. Kincaid J.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) of the cyanide adducts of peroxidases can provide vital information about the important structural elements of the active sites and reveal the role of distal- and proximal-side heme environments on the catalytic cycle. In the present work, we report RR studies of the cyanide adducts of two catalases, a mammalian catalase (BLC) and a fungal catalase (ANC). BLC powder was purchased from Sigma and purified by standard methods (Browett and Stillman, 1979Browett W.R. Stillman M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 577: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar; Eglinton et al., 1983Eglinton D.G. Gadsby P.M.A. Sievers G. Peterson J. Thomson A.J. Biochim. Biophys.

(Tokyo). 1982; 92: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). BLC was dissolved in deionized water and centrifuged. The deep green solution was dialyzed for 6 h against deionized water and for 12 h against 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7). The BLC solution was then loaded onto a DE-52 (Whatman) column (2.5 × 25 cm) equilibrated with 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7). The column was washed with 100-200 ml of the same buffer and eluted with a linear gradient consisting of 300 ml of 20 mM and 300 ml of 300 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7). The BLC fractions having an Rz (A405/A280) value greater than 0.9 were pooled and used for spectral measurements. Aspergillus niger catalase (ANC) suspension in 3.2 M ammonium sulfate (pH 6) was obtained from Sigma. The ammonium sulfate was removed by dialyzing twice against deionized water (6 h each) and then against 20 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7 (12 h). The ANC solution was centrifuged and the deep green solution was chromatographed using the same procedure described for BLC. The purified ANC solution (Rz = 0.68) was used for the spectroscopic measurements. The buffer exchange was achieved either by passing the catalase solution over a Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia) column or by ultrafiltration (Amicon). The buffers used for the final samples were 250 mM sodium acetate (pH 5), 250 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7), and 250 mM sodium carbonate (pH 10.5 and 11.6). Potassium cyanide was from Aldrich. The K13C14N, K12C15N, and K13C15N at 99% enrichment were obtained from Isotech Inc. (Miamisburg, OH). The various isotopomeric forms of cyanoferric ANC and BLC were prepared by mixing 0.15 ml of catalase solution (approximately 0.1 mM in heme) with 0.05 ml of the isotopomeric cyanide solution (160 mM). The RR spectra were acquired with a Spex 1269 spectrometer (mechanical slit width of 75 μm) equipped with a Princeton Instruments ICCD-576 uv-enhanced detector and a 413.1-nm notch filter (Kaiser, Ann Arbor, MI). The 413.1-nm laser line was from a Coherent Innova model 100-K3 Krypton ion laser. The spectra were collected with the back scattering geometry from 5-mm NMR tubes. The NMR tube containing the sample was spun during illumination to avoid local heating. In all cases a gradually increasing background was observed which became more serious at high pH values, especially for BLC. The frequencies of the severely overlapping isotope-sensitive features were estimated using the comparison of the difference spectra obtained by subtraction of absolute experimental spectra for different isotopes with computer-simulated difference spectra (see below). To obtain a more reliable estimate of the actual vibrational parameters of individual modes from the difference spectra, the following approach has been used. Initially, the idealized (built of ideal, 50/50, Gauss-Lorentzian peaks) absolute spectra are simulated by computer. These simulated spectra are then subtracted and the difference spectra obtained in this way are compared with their experimental analogues. In the next step the idealized absolute spectra are slightly perturbed (by allowing frequency, band width, and intensity of peaks to vary) and the new set of simulated difference spectra is compared with the set of experimental difference spectra. The perturbation process is repeated iteratively until the discrepancy between the simulated and experimental difference spectra is minimized. The computer program based on this strategy has been locally generated.2( 2M. Sykora and J. R. Kincaid, manuscript in preparation. ) In this program the quantitative measure of the difference between the simulated and the experimental data (D) is defined by the following equation. D=∑i=1,j=1m,n(Ii,je×p-Ii,jsyn)2(Eq. 3) The results corresponding to the best fit for ANC-CN at pH = 4.9 and BLC-CN at pH 7.0, obtained by the computer program described above, are summarized in Table I. In the process of simulation it has been assumed that different isotopic substitutions in the CN fragment influence the absolute frequencies of the peaks only and that the band widths and intensities do not change upon these substitutions. Various initial estimates and perturbation steps have been used in the process of fitting. In all cases the frequencies obtained were within experimental error ± 2 cm−1 of those summarized in. Table ITable IAxial mode frequencies (cm-1), band widths (FWHM in cm-1) and relative intensities obtained by computer simulation of difference spectra of cyanoferric HRP with different labeled cyanide isotopomers Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows the RR spectra of the various isotopomeric forms of BLC-CN. To help identify the Fe-C-N modes, we digitally generated difference spectra (Fig. 2) by the subtraction of the various pairs of spectra shown in Fig. 1. Inasmuch as the Fe-C-N axial modes overlap, and the difference features in Fig. 2 therefore do not necessarily correspond to the absolute frequencies, we have developed a simulation procedure described above which allows us to estimate the absolute frequencies of the peaks contributing to the experimental difference spectra. Fig. 3 shows the results of computer simulation of experimental difference spectra. The peak positions estimated from the fitting of the difference spectra between 340 and 460 cm−1 for the CN- adducts of BLC are summarized in Table I.3( 3Together with estimation for the isotope-sensitive porphyrin mode. ) An easily identified isotope-sensitive mode in the spectrum of natural abundance BLC-CN can be seen at 433 cm−1 in Fig. 1, a mode that is absent in the RR spectra of the native BLC. This mode exhibits a monotonic isotope shift pattern (Yu et al., 1984Yu N.-T. Benko B. Kerr E.A. Gersonde K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5106-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as the total mass of the cyanide isotopomer is increased, shifting to 431 cm−1 (13C14N-), 430 cm−1 (12C15N-), and 429 cm−1 (13C15N-). A feature that corresponds to this mode can be seen in Fig. 2. On the basis of this isotope shift pattern we assign this mode to the ν[Fe-CN] stretching vibration in BLC-CN (Yu et al., 1984Yu N.-T. Benko B. Kerr E.A. Gersonde K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5106-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, there is an apparent isotope-sensitive intensity fluctuation observed in the region between 400 and 416 cm−1. Upon labeling the carbon atom of the bound cyanide, the mode at 416 cm−1 decreases in intensity and shifts 4-5 cm−1 to higher frequency. Simultaneously, a shoulder at 404 cm−1 appears only when the carbon atom of the bound cyanide is labeled. The digitally subtracted difference spectra, given in Fig. 2, clearly document the presence of this isotope-sensitive mode. Traces “c-b,”“a-b,”“a-d,” and “c-d” of Fig. 2, which are obtained by the subtraction of spectra of BLC-CN isotopomers in which the carbon atom of the ligated cyanide is labeled from spectra of cyanide adducts in which the carbon atom is not labeled, show difference features at 412 and 402 cm−1. This mode cancels out completely in traces “a-c” and “b-d,” which are obtained by the subtraction of a pair of spectra corresponding to the isotopomers in which the carbon atoms have the equal masses. As is clear from inspection of Figs. 2 and 3 this behavior results from the presence of a band which exhibits a zigzag isotopic shift pattern, shifting (based on the simulation) from 413 cm−1 (12C14N-), to 402 cm−1 (13C14N-), 412 cm−1 (12C15N-), and 401 cm−1 (13C15N-). Accordingly, we assign this mode to a Δ[Fe-C-N] bending vibration (Yu et al., 1984Yu N.-T. Benko B. Kerr E.A. Gersonde K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5106-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Figure 2:Difference spectra generated by the digital subtraction of the various spectra shown in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:Difference spectra of the BLC-CN at pH 7 generated by the simulation procedure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recently, we reported that cyanide binds to ferric HRP in two geometries (Al-Mustafa and Kincaid, 1993). Therefore, we examined the spectra for evidence of heterogeneity in binding of cyanide to ferric BLC. Fig. 2 reveals the presence of an isotope-sensitive mode hidden by the strong porphyrin mode (ν8) at 349 cm−1. This mode can be seen in all traces of Fig. 2 with the exception of trace c-b. These difference spectra were generated by the subtraction of spectra of isotopomeric forms which differ in the total mass of the ligated cyanide, while it cancels out completely in trace c-b, which was obtained by the subtraction of the spectrum of the 13C14N- adduct from that of the 12C15N- adduct (i.e. those which have equal total masses). These data thus document the presence of a mode which shifts monotonically with increase of the total mass of the cyanide ligand, regardless of the position of labeling (Yu et al., 1984Yu N.-T. Benko B. Kerr E.A. Gersonde K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5106-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The overlap of this band with an intense porphyrin mode (ν8) hinders the determination of the exact frequency of this mode. However, with the help of the simulation procedure and using the difference spectra shown in Fig. 2, we estimate that this mode occurs at 349 cm−1 for the 12C14N- adduct and shifts to 345 cm−1 for the 13C15N- adduct. Accordingly, we assign this mode to the ν[Fe-CN] stretching mode of a second conformer of BLC-CN (Han et al., 1989Han S. Madden J.F. Siegel L.M. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5477-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; Lopez-Garriga et al., 1990Lopez-Garriga J.J. Oertling W.A. Kean R.T. Hoogland H. Wever R. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9387-9395Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar; Hu et al., 1993Hu S. Treat R.W. Kincaid J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10125-10130Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; Al-Mustafa and Kincaid, 1993). The presence of a fourth isotope-sensitive mode (i.e. a second bending mode) is less apparent in both the absolute and the difference spectra shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. However, careful examination of the difference spectra in Fig. 2, especially traces a-b, a-d, and c-d, which are expected to show all of the stretching and bending modes, reveals an asymmetrical difference feature near 430 cm−1. On the other hand, traces a-c and b-d of Fig. 2, which should show only the stretching modes (the bending modes should cancel out) yield a symmetrical difference feature in the same region. Therefore, we conclude that the asymmetry of the difference features in traces a-b, a-d, and c-d of Fig. 2, in the region around 430 cm−1, is due to the combination of two overlapping difference features; a feature that is ascribable to the monotonically shifting mode at 433 cm−1 mentioned earlier and assigned to a stretching of ν[Fe-CN], and a second mode of slightly higher frequency that exhibits a zigzag isotopic shift pattern. In trace c-b of Fig. 2, which is obtained by the subtraction of isotopomeric forms that have equal total masses but differ in the mass of the carbon atoms, should reveal only the bending vibration (i.e. the stretching vibrations should cancel out). This trace clearly reveals the presence of two bending vibrations; the feature near 410 cm−1 mentioned earlier, and another bending mode near 440 cm−1. The numerical fitting yielded two simulated bands, having a zigzag pattern, in these regions. One mode at 413 cm−1 (12C14N-) shifting to 401 cm−1 (13C15N-) and a second mode at 445 cm−1 (12C14N-) that shifts to 435 cm−1 (13C15N-). Studies carried out on the cyanide adducts of the one electron-reduced sulfite reductase (Han et al., 1989Han S. Madden J.F. Siegel L.M. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5477-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), ferric HRP (Al-Mustafa and Kincaid, 1993), ferric myeloperoxidase (Lopez-Garriga et al., 1990Lopez-Garriga J.J. Oertling W.A. Kean R.T. Hoogland H. Wever R. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9387-9395Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and ferric lactoperoxidase (Hu et al., 1993Hu S. Treat R.W. Kincaid J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10125-10130Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) revealed that the bending of the Fe-C-N linkage causes a reversal of the ordering of the ν[Fe-CN] and Δ[Fe-C-N] vibrations and drives them apart relative to the linear form. Therefore, we assign the stretching mode at 434 cm−1 and the bending mode at 413 cm−1 to a conformer of ferric BLC-CN which possesses an essentially linear Fe-C-N linkage and the stretching and the bending modes at 349 cm−1 and 445 cm−1, respectively, to a second conformer having a more bent Fe-C-N linkage. Inspection of Figs. 1 and 2 reveals the presence of several other isotope-sensitive features which are not readily discernable in Fig. 1 owing to their small shift and their overlap with isotope-insensitive heme deformation modes. The region near 380 cm−1 in Fig. 1 appears to be composed of two modes; one of which is a mode at 380 cm−1 which exhibits a small (2 cm−1) but definite downshift. The observation of sharp difference features near 380 cm−1 in the difference spectra in Fig. 2 confirms the isotope sensitivity of this mode. The behavior of this component upon isotopic substitution is similar to a mode observed at 378 cm−1 in the RR spectra of cyanide adducts of HRP (Al-Mustafa and Kincaid, 1993). We assign this vibration, as it was assigned in the case of HRP-CN, to an out-of-plane heme core mode or possibly a peripheral substituent mode and we attribute the observed shifts to the coupling of this mode to the Fe-C-N vibrations, which are also out-of-plane in nature. The second component can be seen as a shoulder at 385 cm−1 which does not show any isotope dependence. The RR spectra of ferric ANC-CN obtained at pH 4.9 and their difference spectra are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. Fig. 4 shows an isotope-sensitive mode at 433 cm−1 (12C14N-), 432 cm−1 (13C14N-), 431 cm−1 (12C15N-), and 429 cm−1 (13C15N-). This band corresponds to the 434 cm−1 mode observed for BLC-CN and accordingly is assigned also to the ν[Fe-CN] mode of a linear conformer of ANC-CN. A second isotope-sensitive mode that exhibits a zigzag shift pattern can be seen near 410 cm−1 in both Figs. 4 and 5. Similarly to BLC-CN, simulations suggest that this mode occurs at 412 cm−1 (12C14N-) and at 402 cm−1 (13C15N-) and is assigned to the Δ[Fe-C-N] bending vibration of the linear conformer of ANC-CN. As in the case of BLC-CN, the spectra of ANC-CN reveal the presence a second conformer with a reversed ordering of the stretching and bending frequencies. The difference spectra in Fig. 5 reveal the presence of a monotonically shifting mode near 350 cm−1 (12C14N-), shifting to 347 cm−1 (13C15N-) and it is assigned to the ν[Fe-CN] stretching vibration of a second, bent, conformer of ANC-CN. The major difference between the spectra of BLC-CN and ANC-CN is the frequency of the bending mode identified at 445 cm−1 in BLC-CN. This mode appears to shift to a slightly higher frequency in ANC-CN as is indicated by the appearance of a new positive component at about 456 cm−1 in traces a-b, a-d, and c-d of Fig. 5. Also trace c-b of Fig. 5, which is expected to exhibit only the difference features associated with the bending vibrations of ferric ANC-CN, shows a difference feature at 455 and 443 cm−1 slightly higher than BLC-CN (444 and 436 cm−1). The absolute spectra of ANC-CN in Fig. 4 show a weak feature at 456 cm−1 (12C14N-, 12C15N-) that apparently disappears, most likely shifting underneath the strong band at 431-429 cm−1(13C14N-, 13C15N-). Accordingly, it is assigned to the Δ[Fe-C-N] bending vibration of the second form of ferric ANC-CN. We assign the features at 350 and 456 cm−1 to the stretching and bending vibrations of a second conformer of ANC-CN which exists in a bent Fe-C-N geometry. The results of simulation (Fig. 6) of the experimental difference spectra suggest another significant difference in the spectral behavior of BLC-CN and ANC-CN besides the upshifting of the bending mode from 445 cm−1 to 456 cm−1; i.e. the isotope shift upon 13C substitution for the Δ[Fe-C-N] of the bent conformer has been found to be ~10 cm−1 for BLC-CN and ~15 cm−1 in the case of ANC-CN. The ~10 cm−1 isotopomeric shift found in the case of BLC-CN is in reasonable agreement with the experimental data reported for related systems, where the shift varied between 5 and 8 cm−1 (Lopez-Garriga et al., 1990; Han et al., 1989Han S.

Analysis of the high and low frequency RR spectra of the native form (spectra not shown) and the cyanide-ligated forms indicates no significant denaturation for either protein. However, at pH values slightly below 5, BLC starts to precipitate while ANC remains soluble (possibly because ANC is a glycoprotein containing about 9% carbohydrate while BLC does not contain any carbohydrates) (Kikuchi-Torii et al., 1982Kikuchi-Torii K.

https://openalex.org/W2047873641,"The chaperones GroEL/hsp60 are present in all prokaryotes and in mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells. They are involved in protein folding, protein targeting to membranes, protein renaturation, and control of protein-protein interactions. They interact with many polypeptides in an ATP-dependent manner and possess a peptide-dependent ATPase activity. GroEL/hsp60 cooperates with GroES/hsp10, and the productive folding of proteins by GroEL generally requires GroES, which appears to regulate the binding and release of substrate proteins by GroEL. In a recent study, we have shown that GroEL interacts preferentially with the side chains of hydrophobic amino acids (Ile, Phe, Val, Leu, and Trp) and more weakly with several polar or charged amino acids, including the strongest α-helix and β-sheet formers (Glu, Gln, His, Thr, and Tyr). In this study, we show that GroES reduces the specificity of GroEL for hydrophobic amino acids and increases its specificity for hydrophilic ones. This shift by GroES of the GroEL specificity from hydrophobic amino acids toward hydrophilic ones might be of importance for its function in protein folding. The chaperones GroEL/hsp60 are present in all prokaryotes and in mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells. They are involved in protein folding, protein targeting to membranes, protein renaturation, and control of protein-protein interactions. They interact with many polypeptides in an ATP-dependent manner and possess a peptide-dependent ATPase activity. GroEL/hsp60 cooperates with GroES/hsp10, and the productive folding of proteins by GroEL generally requires GroES, which appears to regulate the binding and release of substrate proteins by GroEL. In a recent study, we have shown that GroEL interacts preferentially with the side chains of hydrophobic amino acids (Ile, Phe, Val, Leu, and Trp) and more weakly with several polar or charged amino acids, including the strongest α-helix and β-sheet formers (Glu, Gln, His, Thr, and Tyr).

https://openalex.org/W2123076693,"The lac repressor carboxyl-terminal region is required for tetramer assembly and protein stability. To further investigate this region, especially the unusual sequence KRK, four deletion mutants eliminating the carboxyl-terminal 34, 35, 36, and 39 amino acids and five substitution mutants at the position of Arg-326, R326K, R326A, R326E, R326L, and R326W, were constructed using site-specific mutagenesis. The -34-amino-acid (aa) mutant, missing the most carboxyl-proximal lysine from the KRK sequence, exhibited lower affinity for both operator and inducer and lower protein stability than dimeric proteins studied previously. The -35-aa mutant with RK missing, as well as -36 aa and -39 aa, for which the entire KRK sequence was deleted, yielded inactive polypeptides that could be detected only by monoclonal antibody for lac repressor. In the Arg-326 mutant proteins, operator binding affinity was decreased by approximately 6-fold, the shift in inducer binding at elevated pH was diminished, and protein stability was decreased. Dramatic decreases in protein expression and stability occurred with substitution at position 326 by glutamate, leucine, or tryptophan. These results suggest that Arg-326 plays an important role in the formation of the proper tertiary structure necessary for inducer and operator affinity and for protein stability."
