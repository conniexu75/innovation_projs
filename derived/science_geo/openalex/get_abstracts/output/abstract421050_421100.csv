To determine the role of BMSC mitochondria in this protection, we airway-instilled mice first with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and then with either mouse BMSCs (mBMSCs) or human BMSCs (hBMSCs). Live optical studies revealed that the mBMSCs formed connexin 43 (Cx43)-containing gap junctional channels (GJCs) with the alveolar epithelia in these mice, releasing mitochondria-containing microvesicles that the epithelia engulfed. The presence of BMSC-derived mitochondria in the epithelia was evident optically, as well as by the presence of human mitochondrial DNA in mouse lungs instilled with hBMSCs. The mitochondrial transfer resulted in increased alveolar ATP concentrations. LPS-induced ALI, as indicated by alveolar leukocytosis and protein leak, inhibition of surfactant secretion and high mortality, was markedly abrogated by the instillation of wild-type mBMSCs but not of mutant, GJC-incompetent mBMSCs or mBMSCs with dysfunctional mitochondria. This is the first evidence, to our knowledge, that BMSCs protect against ALI by restituting alveolar bioenergetics through Cx43-dependent alveolar attachment and mitochondrial transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2106739895,"The ability to effectively assess tumor margins for brain tumor resection is a crucial factor in determining outcome in patients with brain tumors. Moritz Kircher and colleagues have developed a gold-silica nanoparticle that provides a triple-mode imaging capability of magnetic resonance, photoacoustic and Raman imaging, capitalizing on the complementary strengths of each modality for noninvasively delineating brain tumor margins both preoperatively and intraoperatively. The approach was tested in several mouse models, including one that recapitulates the infiltrating growth pattern of human gliomas. The difficulty in delineating brain tumor margins is a major obstacle in the path toward better outcomes for patients with brain tumors. Current imaging methods are often limited by inadequate sensitivity, specificity and spatial resolution. Here we show that a unique triple-modality magnetic resonance imaging–photoacoustic imaging–Raman imaging nanoparticle (termed here MPR nanoparticle) can accurately help delineate the margins of brain tumors in living mice both preoperatively and intraoperatively. The MPRs were detected by all three modalities with at least a picomolar sensitivity both in vitro and in living mice. Intravenous injection of MPRs into glioblastoma-bearing mice led to MPR accumulation and retention by the tumors, with no MPR accumulation in the surrounding healthy tissue, allowing for a noninvasive tumor delineation using all three modalities through the intact skull. Raman imaging allowed for guidance of intraoperative tumor resection, and a histological correlation validated that Raman imaging was accurately delineating the brain tumor margins. This new triple-modality–nanoparticle approach has promise for enabling more accurate brain tumor imaging and resection."

https://openalex.org/W2023072510,"For an epithelium to provide a protective barrier, it must maintain homeostatic cell numbers by matching the number of dividing cells with the number of dying cells. Although compensatory cell division can be triggered by dying cells, it is unknown how cell death might relieve overcrowding due to proliferation. When we trigger apoptosis in epithelia, dying cells are extruded to preserve a functional barrier. Extrusion occurs by cells destined to die signalling to surrounding epithelial cells to contract an actomyosin ring that squeezes the dying cell out. However, it is not clear what drives cell death during normal homeostasis. Here we show in human, canine and zebrafish cells that overcrowding due to proliferation and migration induces extrusion of live cells to control epithelial cell numbers. Extrusion of live cells occurs at sites where the highest crowding occurs in vivo and can be induced by experimentally overcrowding monolayers in vitro. Like apoptotic cell extrusion, live cell extrusion resulting from overcrowding also requires sphingosine 1-phosphate signalling and Rho-kinase-dependent myosin contraction, but is distinguished by signalling through stretch-activated channels. Moreover, disruption of a stretch-activated channel, Piezo1, in zebrafish prevents extrusion and leads to the formation of epithelial cell masses. Our findings reveal that during homeostatic turnover, growth and division of epithelial cells on a confined substratum cause overcrowding that leads to their extrusion and consequent death owing to the loss of survival factors. These results suggest that live cell extrusion could be a tumour-suppressive mechanism that prevents the accumulation of excess epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1984209370,"Effective targeted cancer therapeutic development depends upon distinguishing disease-associated 'driver' mutations, which have causative roles in malignancy pathogenesis, from 'passenger' mutations, which are dispensable for cancer initiation and maintenance. Translational studies of clinically active targeted therapeutics can definitively discriminate driver from passenger lesions and provide valuable insights into human cancer biology. Activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) are detected in approximately 20% of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and are associated with a poor prognosis. Abundant scientific and clinical evidence, including the lack of convincing clinical activity of early FLT3 inhibitors, suggests that FLT3-ITD probably represents a passenger lesion. Here we report point mutations at three residues within the kinase domain of FLT3-ITD that confer substantial in vitro resistance to AC220 (quizartinib), an active investigational inhibitor of FLT3, KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB and RET; evolution of AC220-resistant substitutions at two of these amino acid positions was observed in eight of eight FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients with acquired resistance to AC220. Our findings demonstrate that FLT3-ITD can represent a driver lesion and valid therapeutic target in human AML. AC220-resistant FLT3 kinase domain mutants represent high-value targets for future FLT3 inhibitor development efforts."

Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we assessed kinome activity in response to MEK inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and genetically engineered mice (GEMMs). MEK inhibition caused acute ERK activity loss, resulting in rapid c-Myc degradation that induced expression and activation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). RNAi knockdown of ERK or c-Myc mimicked RTK induction by MEK inhibitors, and prevention of proteasomal c-Myc degradation blocked kinome reprogramming. MEK inhibitor-induced RTK stimulation overcame MEK2 inhibition, but not MEK1 inhibition, reactivating ERK and producing drug resistance. The C3Tag GEMM for TNBC similarly induced RTKs in response to MEK inhibition. The inhibitor-induced RTK profile suggested a kinase inhibitor combination therapy that produced GEMM tumor apoptosis and regression where single agents were ineffective. This approach defines mechanisms of drug resistance, allowing rational design of combination therapies for cancer.

Acquired or selected mutations can decrease affinity for kinase inhibitors, but resistance also develops through alternate routes of kinase pathway activation. For example, RTK upregulation has been observed following targeted inhibition of selective kinases (Chandarlapaty et al., 2011Chandarlapaty S. Sawai A. Scaltriti M. Rodrik-Outmezguine V.

Alternatively, genomic loss of PTPN12 phosphatase expression similarly causes activation of multiple tyrosine kinases (Sun et al., 2011Sun T. Aceto N. Meerbrey K.L. Kessler J.D. Zhou C. Migliaccio I. Nguyen D.X. Pavlova N.N. Botero M.

Thus, dynamic and system-wide changes in multiple kinases can occur in tumor cells following pharmacological or progressive genetic perturbations. An understanding of these kinome responses and the mechanisms by which they occur will be key in determining how to abrogate therapeutic resistance. With more than 130 kinase-specific inhibitors currently in phase 1–3 clinical trials, developing combination therapies that are relevant for molecularly defined cancer subtypes is a highly tractable goal. However, rational design of kinase inhibitor combinations requires an overall knowledge of kinome activity and response, not just a simple measure of an inhibitor's effect on one or two kinase pathway components. Currently, there is no optimal discovery mechanism to define the entire kinome and its dynamic activity. Such a technique could globally assess tumor kinome response to small molecule inhibitors and suggest more effective combination therapies. To meet this challenge, we developed a chemical proteomics approach using multiplexed kinase inhibitor beads and mass spectrometry (MIB/MS) to define and quantitate the activity and drug responsiveness of a significant percentage (50%–60%) of the expressed kinome. We applied this technique to triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, preclinical tumor models, and human tumors. Analysis of patient TNBC showed activated RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling, supporting MEK as a target in TNBC. Pharmacologic MEK inhibition in TNBC cell lines and GEMM tumors resulted in rapid kinome reprogramming through the induced expression and activation of multiple Tyr and Ser/Thr kinases that bypassed the initial MEK-ERK inhibition. Alterations in virtually every Tyr and Ser/Thr kinase family were observed. The mechanism of this kinome reprogramming involved the proteolytic degradation of c-Myc following MEK1 and MEK2 inhibition, which resulted in increased expression and activity of RTKs. MIB/MS analysis showed that reprogrammed kinase activation overcame MEK2 (but not MEK1) inhibition, leading to therapeutic resistance. The MEK inhibitor kinome response signature allowed us to predict and test the efficacy of a novel small molecule kinase inhibitor combination. The combination synergistically inhibited TNBC cell line proliferation and caused apoptosis and tumor regression in the C3Tag GEMM of basal-like/claudin-low TNBC. TNBC clinical trials of single kinase inhibitors have largely failed, consistent with drug-induced activation of alternative survival signaling pathways. Figure 1A outlines our strategy to interrogate kinome dynamics with the goal of defining endpoints leading to rational design of combination therapies. RNA-seq defined the transcript-level expressed kinome, and affinity capture of endogenous kinases followed by quantitative mass spectrometry measured kinome activity profiles in tumors and cells. The proteomic assessment was used to define the kinome response to targeted inhibition of kinases. RNAi tested growth and survival functions of the kinases activated in response to inhibitors, and the cumulative results were used to rationally predict kinase inhibitor combinations to test in models of TNBC. RNA-seq defined the kinome transcript expression profile of a patient's claudin-low breast tumor and two claudin-low TNBC lines, SUM159 and MDA-MB-231. More than 400 of the 518 human protein kinases were expressed in the claudin-low human TNBC tumor and cell lines (Figure 1B). Approximately 10% of the kinases expressed in the claudin-low patient tumor were unique compared to the claudin-low cell lines, undoubtedly due to the tumor's complex cellular composition (Table S1 available online). The majority of expressed kinases are common between tumor and claudin-low cell lines, suggesting that interrogating the cellular kinome response to inhibitors will be relevant to patient tumors. Profiling kinase activity in tumors and cell lines was carried out using multiplexed inhibitor beads (MIBs), which consist of mixtures of Sepharose beads with covalently immobilized, linker-adapted kinase inhibitors of moderate selectivity for different kinases (Bisindoylmaleimide-X, SB203580, Dasatinib, and Lapatinib) and relatively broad pan-kinase inhibitors (VI16832, Purvalanol B, and PP58) (Figure S1A) (Daub et al., 2008Daub H. Olsen J.V. Bairlein M. Gnad F. Oppermann F.S. Körner R. Greff Z. Kéri G. Stemmann O. Mann M. Kinase-selective enrichment enables quantitative phosphoproteomics of the kinome across the cell cycle.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 438-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Kinase capture is reproducible and is a function of kinase expression, the affinity of kinases for the immobilized inhibitors, and the activation state of the kinase (Bantscheff et al., 2007Bantscheff M. Eberhard D. Abraham Y. Bastuck S. Boesche M. Hobson S. Mathieson T. Perrin J. Raida M. Rau C. et al.Quantitative chemical proteomics reveals mechanisms of action of clinical ABL kinase inhibitors.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Acute changes in activation-dependent binding were demonstrated by the increased binding of MAPK pathway kinases in EGF-stimulated cells and by the increased retention of Tyr kinases from cells treated with the Tyr phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate (Figures S1B and S1C). Our data showed that MIBs capture the majority of the expressed kinome estimated by RNA-seq and detect altered kinome activity profiles in response to stimulus or clinical kinase inhibitors. Using MIBs and mass spectrometry (MIB/MS), we have cumulatively sequence identified more than 320 kinases from cell lines and tumors (Table S2). MIB/MS profiling of an invasive ductal carcinoma breast tumor and two claudin-low cell lines identified ∼50%–60% of the expressed kinome (Figures 1C–1E and Tables S1 and S3). Kinases from all major kinome subfamilies were captured, with a large percentage representing the untargeted kinome (Fedorov et al., 2010Fedorov O. Müller S. Knapp S. The (un)targeted cancer kinome.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). iTRAQ labeling of digested MIB elutions allowed quantitative profiling of kinases in patient invasive ductal carcinoma compared to adjacent uninvolved mammary tissue (Figure 1F). Of the kinases detected, there was a general increase in MIB binding of tumor kinases, suggesting escalated kinome activity in the tumor compared to uninvolved mammary tissue. For example, the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is increased in MIB binding in the tumor relative to control tissue, consistent with ERK activity being a driver for TNBC proliferation. Immunoblots confirmed the activation of RAF-MEK-ERK signaling in the patient invasive ductal carcinoma (Figure 1G). RTK arrays further revealed Tyr phosphorylated RTKs in two human tumors, which showed phosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, PDGFRβ, CSF1R, RON, and EPHB2 (Figure 1H). Although our data pointed to the potential importance of Tyr-phosphorylated EGFR and PDGFRβ in patient TNBC, clinical trials targeting these RTKs have largely failed (Bianchi et al., 2009Bianchi G. Loibl S. Zamagni C. Salvagni S. Raab G. Siena S. Laferriere N. Peña C. Lathia C. Bergamini L. Gianni L.

Clin. Oncol. 2009; 27: 3908-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The failure of single-agent RTK inhibitors in TNBC is consistent with drug-induced activation of multiple kinases or compensatory tumor kinome responses. Because many expressed RTKs drive ERK activation, we profiled claudin-low breast cancer cells after MEK inhibition (e.g., AZD6244 currently in clinical trials) to determine whether dynamic kinome reprogramming occurs. Our goal was to define kinome alterations that would suggest a more effective, rationally designed combination therapy. MEK inhibitors AZD6244 or U0126 inhibited growth of SUM159 (Figure 2A) and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure S2A). ERK remained inhibited after 4 hr of MEK inhibitor treatment, whereas MEK phosphorylation was enhanced (Figure 2B). Inhibitor treatment for 24 hr resulted in reactivation of ERK, demonstrating that both lines overcame the initial MEK inhibition (Figures 2B and S2B). Phosphoproteomic analysis revealed loss of ERK-mediated feedback regulation of both BRAF and MEK1 (Figure 2C). Reduced phosphorylation of negative feedback sites on BRAF and MEK1 indicate escape from the suppressive feedback regulation on the ERK pathway (Ritt et al., 2010Ritt D.A. Monson D.M. Specht S.I. Morrison D.K. Impact of feedback phosphorylation and Raf heterodimerization on normal and mutant B-Raf signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Analysis of MIB-isolated protein kinases identified 52 peptides with decreased and 59 peptides with increased phosphorylation, whereas the phosphorylation status of 365 phosphopeptides was unchanged after MEK inhibition (Figure S2C and Table S3). The majority of these phosphorylation sites were Ser, Thr-, and Pro-directed Ser/Thr sites, but pTyr changes were also included, suggesting a broad change in kinome activity in response to AZD6244.Figure S2Kinome Profile of MDA-MB-231 TNBC Cells in Response to MEK1/2 Inhibition, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) MDA-MB-231 cells are growth inhibited by 5 μM U0126 or AZD6244.

(J) Venn diagram of the overlaps between the lists of significant kinases from MIB/MS replicates. We next used MIB/MS to profile the SUM159 kinome response after exposure to AZD6244 (Figure 2D). MEK inhibition resulted in time-dependent MIB binding changes for more than 140 kinases, including cell-cycle regulatory kinases, MAPK pathway kinases, RTKs, cytosolic Tyr kinases, and other Ser/Thr kinases. Figure 2E highlights the MIB binding dynamics for MAPK component kinases during the time course of MEK inhibitor response in SUM159 cells. At 4 hr of AZD6244 treatment, both MEK1 and MEK2 are inhibited, as measured by loss of MIB binding. However, whereas MEK1 binding remains largely inhibited, MEK2 binding to MIBs increases at 12 hr of treatment and by 24 hr was similar to control cells, indicating a return of MEK2 activity. In parallel to restored MEK2 binding to MIBs, RAF1 and ERK1 binding to MIBs increases over the time course of AZD6244 treatment, correlating with activation of these kinases. We used RNAi for each kinase in the MAPK pathway to determine whether knockdown had a differential growth affect in response to MEK inhibition (Figure 2F). RNAi knockdown shows that loss of MEK2 and ERK1 inhibited SUM159 cell growth in the presence of MEK inhibitor, whereas MEK1 knockdown did not enhance growth inhibition. Taken together, these data indicate that MEK2 and ERK1 can escape from inhibition by AZD6244, suggesting a critical role for MEK2/ERK1 in SUM159 growth and survival during AZD6244 treatment. Figures 2G and 2H show a 21 kinase signature defining a reprogrammed kinome in response to MEK inhibitors. This signature shows a loss of cyclin-dependent kinases, consistent with growth inhibition, and increased ERK binding to MIBs, indicating escape from MEK inhibition. RTKs, including AXL, DDR1 and PDGFRβ; cytosolic Tyr kinases FAK2 and JAK1; and the Ser kinase ACVR1, all showed increased MIB binding. Whereas MDA-MB-231 cells have a somewhat less robust kinome response to AZD6244, they displayed a significant kinome reprogramming that included a strong increase in PDGFRβ binding to MIBs (Figure S2D). RTK arrays confirm the increased Tyr phosphorylation of multiple RTKs, including PDGFRβ and AXL in response to MEK inhibition (Figures 2I and S2E). In SUM159 cells, AZD6244 also significantly increased Tyr phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and RET. The AZD6244 response of SUM159 cells is dose dependent (Figure 2J), as PDGFRβ and VEGFR2 show increased RTK phosphorylation and expression with increasing AZD6244. These results demonstrate that a significant number of kinases were induced in response to MEK inhibition. Relevant to the changes in the kinome to MEK inhibition, Figure S2F lists the 40 highest expressed kinase transcripts of a patient claudin-low tumor. Of these 40 kinases, 14 (24%) were dynamically regulated in SUM159 and/or MDA-MB-231 cells in response to AZD6244, suggesting that patient tumors could have a similar kinome reprogramming in response to targeted kinase inhibition. Figures 3A and S3A define the time course of kinome reprogramming to AZD6244 in SUM159 and MDA-MB-231 cells. MEK and ERK were rapidly inhibited, allowing accumulation of MKP3, the MAPK phosphatase that inactivates ERK (Marchetti et al., 2005Marchetti S. Gimond C. Chambard J.C. Touboul T. Roux D. Pouysségur J. Pagès G. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases phosphorylate mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 3/DUSP6 at serines 159 and 197, two sites critical for its proteasomal degradation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Increased MKP3 expression combined with AZD6244 to strongly suppress ERK activity, but MKP3 protein was lost as MAPK pathway activity returned. Over time, VEGFR2, PDGFRβ, and DDR1 expression was increased with AZD6244 treatment, as was the phosphorylation of HER3 and AXL. qRT-PCR analysis of SUM159 (Figure 3B) and MDA-MB-231 (Figure S3B) cells treated with AZD6244 demonstrated elevated RNA levels for several of these RTKs, including DDR1/2, PDGFRβ, VEGFR2 (SUM159 only), and HER2/3. Analysis of cytokine RNA expression showed EGF, Gas6, PDGFB, and PDGFD induction, indicating the establishment of autocrine/paracrine loops for RTK activation (Figures 3C and S3C). RTK arrays further showed a time-dependent increase in Tyr phosphorylation of PDGFRβ, VEGFR2, and HER2/3 (DDR1/2 are not on the array) (Figure 3D). PDGFRβ, whose RNA and protein expression was induced in response to AZD6244, was phosphorylated at Tyr 751, 857, and 1009—sites that are required for PDGFRβ activation and recruitment of PI3K and PLCγ (Figure 3E).Figure S3Transcriptional Upregulation of RTKs and Cytokines in MDA-MB-231 Cells and Specificity of Kinome Response, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) MDA-MB-231 cell response to AZD6244 parallels SUM159 response.(B) Transcriptional upregulation of kinases following 5 μM AZD6244 treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells, as determined by qRT-PCR.(C) Transcriptional upregulation of cytokines following 5 μM AZD6244 treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells, as determined by qRT-PCR.(D) Return of cyclin expression in SUM159-R cells compared to SUM159 cells treated with AZD6244, as determined by qRT-PCR.(E) SUM159 cells are growth inhibited by U0126 (5 μM), AZD6244 (5 μM), and BEZ235 (50 nM).(F) BEZ235 inhibits p70 S6 kinase activity but not ERK1/2 signaling in SUM159 cells.(G) Treatment of SUM159 cells with BEZ235 (50 nM) induces a distinct kinome response compared to AZD6244 or U0126 (5 μM), as determined by MIBs/MS using iTRAQ.

The AZD6244-resistant cells (SUM159-R, grown continuously in 5 μM AZD6244) continue to have a reprogrammed kinome in which PDGFRβ and VEGFR2 exhibited both increased expression and Tyr phosphorylation, and AXL showed increased Tyr phosphorylation (Figures 3D and 3G). Activation of these RTKs is accompanied by increases in phosphorylated AKT, RAF, p70 S6 kinase, MEK, ERK, and RSK1, showing that the cells overcame MEK inhibition by RTK activation of the ERK, AKT, and mTOR pathways (Figure 3G). These findings indicate that targeted MEK inhibition significantly alters the activity of multiple kinases. It was therefore important to determine whether the changes in kinase activity were specific for MEK inhibition or a function of growth arrest. BEZ235 is a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor that strongly inhibits SUM159 cell growth (Figure S3E). BEZ235 inhibited p70 S6 kinase activity, consistent with mTOR inhibition, but had no effect on the ERK pathway (Figure S3F). We compared the SUM159 kinome responses to BEZ235 and AZD6244 to determine whether kinome reprogramming was target specific or a function of growth arrest. Whereas AZD6244 induced PDGFRβ, VEGFR2, and AXL phosphorylation, BEZ235 treatment did not change the RTK phosphorylation profile except for increased phosphorylation of INSR, IGF1R, and AXL (Figure 3H). MIB/MS confirmed that AZD6244 altered the kinome differently from BEZ235, indicating that drug-induced kinome reprogramming is target specific (Figure S3G). ERK phosphorylates the transcription factor c-Myc at Ser62 and stabilizes c-Myc protein by preventing its proteasomal degradation (Sears et al., 2000Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Multiple Ras-dependent phosphorylation pathways regulate Myc protein stability.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Treatment of both SUM159 and MDA-MB-231 cells with AZD6244 caused rapid loss of c-Myc protein and mRNA (Figures 4A, 4B, and S4A). This AZD6244-mediated repression of c-Myc protein and transcript, along with reduced phosphorylation of c-Myc at Ser62 (Figures 4B and S4A–S4C ), resulted in decreased Myc-Max heterodimerization that is required for Myc transcriptional regulation (Figure 4C) (Marampon et al., 2006Marampon F.

Despite partial recovery of MEK-ERK activation after 24–72 hr, total c-Myc expression remained repressed in the continued presence of AZD6244 (Figures 4A–4C and S4A–S4C).Figure S4c-Myc Loss Causes Induction of RTKs, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Stable suppression of c-Myc protein levels following AZD6244 treatment.

They identify a locus at 12q24 associated with hippocampal volume and a locus at 12q14 associated with intracranial volume. Identifying genetic variants influencing human brain structures may reveal new biological mechanisms underlying cognition and neuropsychiatric illness. The volume of the hippocampus is a biomarker of incipient Alzheimer's disease1,2 and is reduced in schizophrenia3, major depression4 and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy5. Whereas many brain imaging phenotypes are highly heritable6,7, identifying and replicating genetic influences has been difficult, as small effects and the high costs of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have led to underpowered studies. Here we report genome-wide association meta-analyses and replication for mean bilateral hippocampal, total brain and intracranial volumes from a large multinational consortium. The intergenic variant rs7294919 was associated with hippocampal volume (12q24.22; N = 21,151; P = 6.70 × 10−16) and the expression levels of the positional candidate gene TESC in brain tissue. Additionally, rs10784502, located within HMGA2, was associated with intracranial volume (12q14.3; N = 15,782; P = 1.12 × 10−12). We also identified a suggestive association with total brain volume at rs10494373 within DDR2 (1q23.3; N = 6,500; P = 5.81 × 10−7)."
https://openalex.org/W2045611288,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability. Previous studies have implicated mGlu5 in the pathogenesis of the disease, but a crucial unanswered question is whether pharmacological mGlu5 inhibition is able to reverse an already established FXS phenotype in mammals. Here we have used the novel, potent, and selective mGlu5 inhibitor CTEP to address this issue in the Fmr1 knockout mouse. Acute CTEP treatment corrects elevated hippocampal long-term depression, protein synthesis, and audiogenic seizures. Chronic treatment that inhibits mGlu5 within a receptor occupancy range of 81% ± 4% rescues cognitive deficits, auditory hypersensitivity, aberrant dendritic spine density, overactive ERK and mTOR signaling, and partially corrects macroorchidism. This study shows that a comprehensive phenotype correction in FXS is possible with pharmacological intervention starting in young adulthood, after development of the phenotype. It is of great interest how these findings may translate into ongoing clinical research testing mGlu5 inhibitors in FXS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2013482405,"Hemimegalencephaly (HMG) is a developmental brain disorder characterized by an enlarged, malformed cerebral hemisphere, typically causing epilepsy that requires surgical resection. We studied resected HMG tissue to test whether the condition might reflect somatic mutations affecting genes critical to brain development. We found that two out of eight HMG samples showed trisomy of chromosome 1q, which encompasses many genes, including AKT3, a gene known to regulate brain size. A third case showed a known activating mutation in AKT3 (c.49G→A, creating p.E17K) that was not present in the patient's blood cells. Remarkably, the E17K mutation in AKT3 is exactly paralogous to E17K mutations in AKT1 and AKT2 recently discovered in somatic overgrowth syndromes. We show that AKT3 is the most abundant AKT paralog in the brain during neurogenesis and that phosphorylated AKT is abundant in cortical progenitor cells. Our data suggest that somatic mutations limited to the brain could represent an important cause of complex neurogenetic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2110014743,"The presence of diffuse morphogen gradients in tissues supports a view in which growth is locally homogenous. Here we challenge this view: we used a high-resolution quantitative approach to reveal significant growth variability among neighboring cells in the shoot apical meristem, the plant stem cell niche. This variability was strongly decreased in a mutant impaired in the microtubule-severing protein katanin. Major shape defects in the mutant could be related to a local decrease in growth heterogeneity. We show that katanin is required for the cell's competence to respond to the mechanical forces generated by growth. This provides the basis for a model in which microtubule dynamics allow the cell to respond efficiently to mechanical forces. This in turn can amplify local growth-rate gradients, yielding more heterogeneous growth and supporting morphogenesis.

This reproducibility implies the existence of some level of growth coordination between individual cells. Mechanistically, it has been proposed that growth patterns rely on morphogen gradients, which orchestrate the growth of individual cells in tissues (Jaeger et al., 2008Jaeger J. Irons D. Monk N. Regulative feedback in pattern formation: towards a general relativistic theory of positional information.Development. 2008; 135: 3175-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, Wolpert, 1969Wolpert L. Positional information and the spatial pattern of cellular differentiation.J. Theor. Biol. 1969; 25: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). Morphogen gradients have been observed in several systems, and their shape and origin are rather well described (Wartlick et al., 2009Wartlick O. Kicheva A. González-Gaitán M. Morphogen gradient formation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1: a001255Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In addition, growth is a physical process, and physical parameters have also been implicated in the coordination of growth. In particular, in tissues where cells adhere to each other, like imaginal discs in Drosophila or plant tissues (Jarvis et al., 2003Jarvis M.C. Briggs S.P.H. Knox J.P. Intercellular adhesion and cell separation in plants.Plant Cell Environ. 2003; 26: 977-989Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar), differential growth between neighboring cells is a source of residual mechanical stresses. There is even evidence that stresses themselves act as instructional signals, generating responses in the form of gene expression or cytoskeletal reorganization, in parallel to biochemical gradients (Farge, 2003Farge E.

For instance, an active role of mechanical forces in orchestrating cell proliferation patterns in imaginal discs from Drosophila has been theorized, but the exact mechanism behind it remains unknown (Aegerter-Wilmsen et al., 2007Aegerter-Wilmsen T.

Mechanical feedback as a possible regulator of tissue growth.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 3318-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Here we examine growth control in plants, where growth patterns depend on cell-wall synthesis and anisotropy (the existence of directions with distinctive properties). More specifically, growth anisotropy is generally larger in the direction perpendicular to the orientation of stiff cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall, which in turn is controlled by the orientation of the cortical microtubule (CMT) arrays that guide the trajectories of cellulose synthase (Paredez et al., 2006Paredez A.R. Somerville C.R. Ehrhardt D.W. Visualization of cellulose synthase demonstrates functional association with microtubules.Science. 2006; 312: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). The formation of parallel CMTs is itself thought to be largely self-organized, as microtubule dynamics facilitate encounters, bundling, and microtubule growth in parallel orientations. In this respect, the microtubule-severing protein katanin was proposed to increase the ability of microtubules to self-organize in parallel arrays, by enhancing CMT dynamics and promoting their encounters (Allard et al., 2010Allard J.F.

Interestingly, there is now strong evidence showing that the predominant orientations of the CMTs depend on force fields (Cleary and Hardham, 1993Cleary A.L. Hardham A.R.

Plant cell growth responds to external forces and the response requires intact microtubules.Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 425-430PubMed Google Scholar). More specifically, in the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem (SAM), a tissue that contains the plant stem cell niche and provides the precursor cells for all the postembryonic aerial organs, CMTs modify their orientation toward the direction of maximal stress (Hamant et al., 2008Hamant O. Heisler M.G. Jönsson H. Krupinski P. Uyttewaal M. Bokov P. Corson F. Sahlin P. Boudaoud A. Meyerowitz E.M. et al.Developmental patterning by mechanical signals in Arabidopsis.Science. 2008; 322: 1650-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). However, the role of the regulation of the CMT dynamics in this response to stress has not been addressed. Here we show that the microtubule-severing protein katanin is required to orchestrate growth between neighboring cells by providing cells with the ability to respond efficiently to mechanical stress. To investigate the role of CMT dynamics in the SAM, we selected the katanin (atktn1) mutant, which exhibits decreased microtubule dynamics (Bichet et al., 2001Bichet A. Desnos T. Turner S.

The GFP-microtubule-binding domain marker (GFP-MBD) was introgressed in the atktn1 mutant, and the GFP signal was analyzed. To quantitatively monitor the average orientation and anisotropy of CMT arrays in each cell, we generated a macro tool in ImageJ using the nematic tensor concept from the physics of liquid crystals (MT macro, see Extended Experimental Procedures). This allowed us to determine that CMTs reorient more slowly in the mutant than in the wild-type (WT) (Figures 1A and 1B ), confirming lower CMT dynamics in atktn1 cells. The WT SAM exhibited a binary CMT pattern, with a rather poor CMT organization in the central zone (CZ) and circumferential orientation of CMTs in the peripheral zone (PZ) (Hamant et al., 2008Hamant O. Heisler M.G. Jönsson H. Krupinski P. Uyttewaal M. Bokov P. Corson F. Sahlin P. Boudaoud A.

This pattern was strongly affected in the atktn1 mutant. In particular, although some supracellular CMT alignment could be observed in the boundary domains, it was often difficult to observe any coherent pattern in the PZ of the SAM (Figures 1D and 1F). More generally, the anisotropy of the CMT arrays was 28% lower in the atktn1 mutant than in the control (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM] is 0.150 ± 0.001 for the GFP-MBD line, standard deviation [SD]: 0.066, n = 2,152 cells; and 0.108 ± 0.001 for the mutant, SD: 0.055, n = 2,128 cells; 5 meristems per genotype; significant difference shown by t test at p < 0.001). Consistent with these CMT defects, cell division planes were also affected in the atktn1 mutant (Figure S1 available online). To get a quantitative view of these defects in space, we generated maps in which the CMT array anisotropy is represented as a disc, the radius of which increases with CMT anisotropy (Figures 1G and 1H). In the WT background, this representation clearly distinguished the CZ with nearly isotropic CMT arrays from the PZ with highly anisotropic arrays (Figure 1G). In the atktn1 mutant, the difference between CZ and PZ was significantly reduced (Figure 1H). To check the impact of the CMT defects in atktn1 on growth, we next quantified rate of growth in area as well as growth anisotropy (i.e., the unique directions of maximal and minimal values of growth, also called principal directions of growth) of the epidermal cells. To obtain the highest possible resolution, we used a live scanning electron microscopy protocol, also called the sequential replica method (Dumais and Kwiatkowska, 2002Dumais J. Kwiatkowska D.

Briefly, dental polymer molds of WT and atktn1 meristems were taken at different time points, and replicas of the meristems in epoxy resin were obtained and imaged with scanning electron microscopy, at two different angles, in order to position each cell vertex in three dimensions (3D) and compute growth rates and anisotropy (Dumais and Kwiatkowska, 2002Dumais J.

Plant Biol. 2008; 35: 1034-1046Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Figures 2A–2E ). As expected from the CMT pattern, we observed a decrease in growth anisotropy in all atktn1 SAMs analyzed, when compared to the WT. The growth anisotropy was 37% lower in the atktn1 mutant than in the control (mean ± SEM is 0.67 ± 0.03 for the WT, n = 664 cells, and 0.42 ± 0.02 for the mutant, n = 912 cells; 6 meristems per genotype; significant difference shown by t test at p < 0.001; Figure 2F). In contrast, no clear difference in terms of rate of growth in area could be observed between the WT and atktn1 on the SAM surface at first sight (Figures 2D and 2E). Discriminating between the WT and the mutant growth patterns was also difficult because of variability between individual meristems (Figure S2). Several morphogenetic features were altered in the atktn1 mutant. More specifically, the atktn1 meristems were flatter, and their surface was slightly bumpy, with a notable crater-like depression at the center of the meristem (Figures 3A and 3B ). We quantified this morphology with the replica method (Figures 3A–3C and S3; Extended Experimental Procedures). More specifically, the principal curvature directions at the cell centroid, i.e., the directions in which the normal curves lying on the surface attain maximal or minimal value, were computed as described previously (Dumais and Kwiatkowska, 2002Dumais J. Kwiatkowska D. Analysis of surface growth in shoot apices.Plant J. 2002; 31: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar; see Extended Experimental Procedures). The curvature was negative in both curvature directions in the center of the atktn1 SAM (Figures 3A–3C). Tissue folding at the boundaries was also less sharp in the atktn1 mutant than in the WT (Figures 3D and 3E). Notably, whereas concave curvature (red arms on Figures 3A and 3B) usually encompassed a two-cell file domain in WT boundaries, it covered the width of three to four cell files in the atktn1 mutant.Figure S3Mean Values of Maximal and Minimal Curvatures Computed for WT and atktn1 SAM Cells, Related to Figure 3Show full captionPlants were grown in the Katowice laboratory conditions.

The means computed for n = 505 cells (three meristems) of WT and n = 776 cells (three meristems) of atktn1 are significantly different (t test, p < 0.001). To check whether the position of the depression in the atktn1 SAM corresponds to that of the CZ, we introgressed the CZ marker pCLV3::GFP into the atktn1 mutant. Using a combined confocal-scanning electron microscopy protocol, we observed that the position of the depression in atktn1 matched that of the pCLV3::GFP expression domain (Figures 3F and 3G). Given that the CZ is growing slower than the PZ in both the WT and the atktn1 mutant (Figures 2D and 2E), the crater shape observed in the atktn1 mutant could be due to defects in growth anisotropy in the PZ. Previous data support a model in which CMTs orient according to the maximal mechanical stress direction, and this direction is largely determined by tissue shape (Hamant et al., 2008Hamant O.

Although the mechanoperception pathway behind it remains to be identified (Mirabet et al., 2011Mirabet V. Das P. Boudaoud A. Hamant O. The role of mechanical forces in plant morphogenesis.Annu. Rev.

Feeling green: mechanosensing in plants.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 228-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), it was shown that CMT orientations better match stress patterns than strain patterns (Hamant et al., 2008Hamant O. Heisler M.G. Jönsson H. Krupinski P. Uyttewaal M. Bokov P. Corson F. Sahlin P. Boudaoud A. Meyerowitz E.M. et al.Developmental patterning by mechanical signals in Arabidopsis.Science. 2008; 322: 1650-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar): strain measures the intensity and direction of material deformation (i.e., cell growth), whereas stress measures the intensity and direction of mechanical forces in cells, normalized by the geometrical features of the material (here the thickness of the cell wall). CMTs usually are perpendicular to the maximal strain direction,and parallel to the predicted maximal stress direction in cells. In the boundary domain of the SAM or after applying local forces onto the SAM, CMTs become parallel to the maximal direction of both stress and strain. In the following, we used the atktn1 mutant to investigate whether this mechanical feedback is altered when microtubule dynamics is affected. The presence of supracellular CMT alignments is regarded as a landmark for the response of microtubules to mechanical stress (Hamant et al., 2008Hamant O. Heisler M.G. Jönsson H. Krupinski P. Uyttewaal M. Bokov P. Corson F. Sahlin P. Boudaoud A. Meyerowitz E.M. et al.Developmental patterning by mechanical signals in Arabidopsis.Science. 2008; 322: 1650-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In this framework, the presence of disorganized CMTs in atktn1 could potentially be explained by lower stress levels in atktn1. However, bending tests, breaking force, and tensile modulus measurements as well as wall thickness analyses all point at weaker walls in differentiated tissues of atktn1 alleles, thus suggesting that stress levels should instead be increased in the mutant (Bichet et al., 2001Bichet A.

Using a microvice, we first compressed WT and atktn1 meristems to obtain a rough estimate of the mechanical properties of this tissue (see Extended Experimental Procedures). The response was similar in both genotypes, suggesting that stress levels were comparable. To check this at a more local level, with a recently published protocol, we used atomic force microscopy to measure the apparent elastic moduli of meristematic cells in WT and atktn1 (Peaucelle et al., 2011Peaucelle A. Braybrook S.A. Le Guillou L. Bron E. Kuhlemeier C. Höfte H. Pectin-induced changes in cell wall mechanics underlie organ initiation in Arabidopsis.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 1720-1726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that atktn1 cell walls in the SAM were roughly as stiff as those in the WT (Figure S4A ). Thus, the increased CMT disorganization in the atktn1 SAM cannot be related to lower stress level caused by stiffer cell walls. Alternatively, the presence of disorganized CMTs in the atktn1 SAM could be consistent with a scenario in which atktn1 cells are less competent to orient their CMTs in response to mechanical stress. To test this hypothesis, we computed the local variability of CMT array anisotropy and the local variability of CMT array orientation for groups of cells comprising a cell and its six closest neighbors in the WT and atktn1 mutant (Figures 4A and 4B and Extended Experimental Procedures). We reasoned that if the CMT orientation of a given cell depends on the local pattern of stress, the differences in CMT orientations between neighboring cells should be low when cells respond efficiently to stress. Our measurements revealed that the local variability in both CMT anisotropy and CMT orientation was significantly increased in atktn1 (Figures 4A and 4B), consistent with slower dynamics and a decreased response to the local pattern of stress in atktn1. This indirect evidence, together with the previous observation that the least aligned CMTs tend to respond faster to mechanical stress in the WT (see Figure S11 in Hamant et al., 2008Hamant O. Heisler M.G. Jönsson H. Krupinski P. Uyttewaal M. Bokov P. Corson F. Sahlin P. Boudaoud A. Meyerowitz E.M. et al.Developmental patterning by mechanical signals in Arabidopsis.Science. 2008; 322: 1650-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), supports a view in which CMTs are less competent to orient according to the local pattern of stress in the absence of katanin because of a slower microtubule dynamics. To test more directly whether the response to mechanical stress is decreased in atktn1, we next modified the pattern of stress in the SAM and compared the response of the CMTs in the WT and in the atktn1 mutant. First, we applied a compressive force of about 0.1N at the base of the meristem with a microvice (Figures 4C–4G). This is predicted to increase mechanical tension in the meristem epidermis, with an increased stress anisotropy parallel to the compressing blades (Figure 4C). As previously observed, this method increased the level of CMT bundling in the WT cells, leading to strongly anisotropic CMTs arrays, with a bias toward the direction parallel to the blades (Figures 4D and 4F) (Hamant et al., 2008Hamant O. Heisler M.G. Jönsson H. Krupinski P. Uyttewaal M. Bokov P. Corson F. Sahlin P. Boudaoud A. Meyerowitz E.M. et al.Developmental patterning by mechanical signals in Arabidopsis.Science. 2008; 322: 1650-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Although the increased CMT bundling could also be observed in atktn1, no dominant CMT orientation, i.e., nearly isotropic arrays, could be observed in each cell after compression, consistent with a scenario in which CMTs respond less efficiently to mechanical stress (Figures 4E and 4G). To confirm this result, we next modified the mechanical stress level using a pharmacological approach (Figures 4H–4L). Isoxaben is a well-known inhibitor of cellulose synthesis (e.g., Desprez et al., 2002Desprez T. Vernhettes S. Fagard M. Refrégier G. Desnos T. Aletti E. Py N. Pelletier S. Höfte H. Resistance against herbicide isoxaben and cellulose deficiency caused by distinct mutations in same cellulose synthase isoform CESA6.Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). When cellulose synthesis is inhibited, cell walls are predicted to become thinner or at least less resistant to turgor pressure, and thus mechanical stress is supposed to increase (Ryden et al., 2003Ryden P. Sugimoto-Shirasu K. Smith A.C. Findlay K. Reiter W.D. McCann M.C. Tensile properties of Arabidopsis cell walls depend on both a xyloglucan cross-linked microfibrillar network and rhamnogalacturonan II-borate complexes.Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) (Figure 4H). As previously reported, we observed the formation of CMT bundles in a circumferential pattern matching the predicted stress pattern in the WT after isoxaben treatment (Figures 4I and 4J) (Heisler et al., 2010Heisler M.G. Hamant O. Krupinski P. Uyttewaal M. Ohno C. Jönsson H. Traas J. Meyerowitz E.M.

In contrast, we were never able to see such a response in the atktn1 mutant. CMTs rema"

Utilizing chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing to map the regulon of the master virulence regulator ToxT, we identify a TCP island-encoded small RNA that reduces the expression of a previously unrecognized VSP-1-encoded transcription factor termed VspR. VspR modulates the expression of several VSP-1 genes including one that encodes a novel class of di-nucleotide cyclase (DncV), which preferentially synthesizes a previously undescribed hybrid cyclic AMP-GMP molecule. We show that DncV is required for efficient intestinal colonization and downregulates V. cholerae chemotaxis, a phenotype previously associated with hyperinfectivity. This pathway couples the actions of previously disparate genomic islands, defines VSP-1 as a pathogenicity island in V. cholerae, and implicates its occurrence in 7(th) pandemic strains as a benefit for host adaptation through the production of a regulatory cyclic di-nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W2044820159,"Growing microtubule ends serve as transient binding platforms for essential proteins that regulate microtubule dynamics and their interactions with cellular substructures. End-binding proteins (EBs) autonomously recognize an extended region at growing microtubule ends with unknown structural characteristics and then recruit other factors to the dynamic end structure. Using cryo-electron microscopy, subnanometer single-particle reconstruction, and fluorescence imaging, we present a pseudoatomic model of how the calponin homology (CH) domain of the fission yeast EB Mal3 binds to the end regions of growing microtubules. The Mal3 CH domain bridges protofilaments except at the microtubule seam. By binding close to the exchangeable GTP-binding site, the CH domain is ideally positioned to sense the microtubule's nucleotide state. The same microtubule-end region is also a stabilizing structural cap protecting the microtubule from depolymerization. This insight supports a common structural link between two important biological phenomena, microtubule dynamic instability and end tracking."

The genetic diversity within the human population, combined with variation in environmental influences, sets the stage for functional diversity across individual human brains. During primate evolution the brain has expanded greatly both in size and complexity, and the greatest expansion occurred in the human cerebral cortex (Carroll, 2003Carroll S.B. Genetics and the making of Homo sapiens.Nature. 2003; 422: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, Herculano-Houzel, 2009Herculano-Houzel S.

Evolution of the neocortex: a perspective from developmental biology.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). The cerebral cortex is overall a six-layered structure that is characterized by the differential prominence of these layers and by relative abundance and distribution of many different types of neurons. The expansion of the human cortex is associated with the prominent appearance and expansion of prefrontal, parietal, and temporal association regions that are considered to support the greater cognitive abilities of humans. A large body of evidence has shown that excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons, across and within cortical layers, can be divided into many different types based on their diverse molecular, morphological, physiological, and connectional properties, and together form the complex neural circuits of the cerebral cortex (Ascoli et al., 2008Ascoli G.A.

Gene expression change has been considered a major driver of species differentiation and evolution (King and Wilson, 1975King M.C. Wilson A.C. Evolution at two levels in humans and chimpanzees.Science. 1975; 188: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). However, comparative microarray studies have shown a high degree of conservation across species in overall gene expression, although there is considerable upregulation of gene expression in the brains of humans compared to nonhuman primates (Khaitovich et al., 2006Khaitovich P.

To date, because such gene expression profiling studies have typically been performed on homogenized tissues, we have been unable to discern cellular heterogeneity as well as spatial localization within the brain. From studies in mouse, it is clear that analysis of gene expression with high spatial resolution can identify cell type and other differences in gene expression among brain regions and among mouse strains with different genetic backgrounds (Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S.

USA. 2010; 107: 19049-19054Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is thus critical to examine gene expression with cellular resolution in the human brain to elucidate its contribution to cell types, neural circuits, and brain function. To this end, we profiled the expression of approximately 1,000 genes in the human visual cortex and midtemporal cortex at cellular resolution using a standardized in situ hybridization (ISH) platform, and created a public online database (http://human.brain-map.org/ish) for this extensive set of high-resolution human gene expression data. Through detailed analysis of individual genes, we compared gene expression among individuals and cortical areas, as well as between human and mouse using the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas data set. We found very little qualitative gene expression variation between cortical regions and among individual human subjects. A substantially higher degree of gene expression variation was observed when comparing putatively homologous human and mouse cortical areas. From these, differential gene expression signatures for different cortical cell types were derived. This large data set provides a rich public resource for the study of specific gene functions and their relation to cortical cell type diversity. Expression analysis of 995 genes was done by ISH in two functionally distinct cortical regions from multiple postmortem adult brain specimens: visual cortex (containing Brodmann's areas 17 and 18), and midtemporal cortex (containing mostly Brodmann's area 21 as well as parts of area 22 and sometimes 20), from individuals without any known neuropathology or history of neuropsychiatric illnesses. The visual cortex was chosen as one of the most studied and well-conserved cortical regions, allowing comparison of human brain gene expression with analogous data in mouse (Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S. Byrnes E.J. et al.Genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain.Nature. 2007; 445: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3669) Google Scholar). The midtemporal cortex was selected as a second, functionally distinct association region to assess regional difference in gene expression. Each gene was assayed in two to six brains, with most assayed in four brains, split approximately equally between men and women. A total of 46 donor cases (27 men and 19 women) were used (see Table S1, available online, for case details). About 92 genes were profiled per case. The resulting online resource includes approximately 31,000 ISH images from this study. Four categories of genes of broad scientific and clinical interest were selected: markers of cortical cell types (237 genes), gene families important to neural function, genes related to diseases of the central nervous system (382 genes), and genes identified from comparative genomics (111 genes) (Table S2). There was considerable overlap of genes across these categories. The cortical cell-type marker genes comprised genes identified in the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S.

The neural function genes included ∼80% of all ion channel genes, genes for nearly all neurotransmitter receptors, and genes for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), transporters, synaptic proteins, and secreted peptide or protein ligands and their receptors, among others. The disease-related genes were identified based on published literature as being relevant to schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, autism spectrum disorders, mental retardation, microcephaly, and other diseases. They include those genes linked to a brain disease, known to be involved in physiological pathways implicated in a disease, or encoding known drug targets. Lastly, the comparative genomics category comprised genes identified in the literature as showing accelerated evolution, being under positive selection, or showing microarray-based gene expression difference either between rodents and primates or between nonhuman and human primates (Abrahams et al., 2007Abrahams B.S.

Neurol. 2000; 425: 583-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To establish a metric for evaluating tissue quality for ISH analysis, a modified intensity score (Imod) was calculated for each control gene and each tissue sample (Supplemental Information). The average Imod score for all control genes for each tissue block was used as an index of tissue quality. An extremely low average Imod score for a tissue block almost always correlated with lower expression intensities of many other genes profiled in that block compared to other blocks. There was no direct correlation between postmortem interval (PMI) or RNA integrity number (RIN) and the Imod score (data not shown). Therefore, tissue blocks for which Imod was 2.0 standard deviations (SD) beyond the median Imod value (Imod < 2 [i.e., below −2 SD] or Imod > 4 [i.e., above +2 SD]) were excluded from the study (Figure S1B). Analysis of the control genes across all tissue blocks revealed differing degrees of expression consistency across different blocks (Figure S1C). GAP43 and PCP4 showed a higher degree of consistency in expression pattern and level, with deviations in only 7% and 21% of tissue samples, respectively. CTNND2 and CARTPT showed less consistency, and there were deviations in 31% and 41% of samples, respectively. Variation in expression levels of CTNND2 often correlated with Imod of the tissue block, indicating that as a moderate- to low-expressing gene CTNND2 may be more sensitive to tissue quality variation. Expression of CARTPT appeared to be independent of tissue quality variation. Analysis of the entire gene set reveals a broad range of expression patterns, consistent with the diverse functions of these genes. To compare expression effectively, and because of the intrinsic variation of postmortem human tissues and limited sample sizes, a rigorous manual scoring system was used to characterize the level (Figure S1D) and spatial pattern (Figure S1E) of expression for each gene (see Table S2 for detailed scoring of each gene). Overall, 79% of the genes were expressed above background. There was little correlation between expression characteristics and gene category. Similar distributions of expression patterns and levels were represented within each gene category (Figure 1A ), indicating that related genes could contribute differentially to the functions of different cell populations. For example, the voltage-gated potassium channels, a 17-gene subfamily of the ion channel gene family, comprises four groups with distinct physiological properties: Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, and Kv4 (Yu and Catterall, 2004Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. The VGL-chanome: a protein superfamily specialized for electrical signaling and ionic homeostasis.Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: re15Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). Genes within each group exhibited differential expression, suggesting that different cell types have different compositions of potassium channels that could result in different excitability properties. The Kv3-type genes showed predominantly scattered patterns, consistent with preferential expression in interneurons. The Kv1-type genes included those showing interneuron preference (e.g., KCNA2) and laminar enrichment in excitatory neurons (e.g., KCNA1 and KCNA6), as well as low or no expression. Many genes exhibit differential expression across cortical layers and thus can delineate anatomical boundaries and fine cytoarchitectural differences. In this study, the most prominent boundary is between primary and secondary visual cortices. Area 17 is anatomically characterized in anthropoid primates by a uniquely expanded layer 4 that is further divided into sublayers 4A, 4B, 4Cα, and 4Cβ. Over 15% of the genes showed a clear expression pattern change at this boundary (Figure 2A and Table S2), often due to higher or lower expression in layer 4 compared to other layers. For example, DKK3 exhibited a fairly uniform expression across layers 2 through 6, but not in layer 4, in which markedly lower expression was seen in area 17. PCP4 expression is generally enriched in layers 5 and 6 but is also prominently expressed in layer 4c in area 17. SYT6 has much stronger expression in layer 6 of area 17 than that of area 18. CTNNB1 has prominent expression in layer 4 of area 18 instead of area 17. In the regional comparison among areas 17, 18, and 21, 84% of the genes exhibited consistent expression patterns across the three areas. For the 16% of genes showing an expression pattern difference between any two of the three areas (Table S2), most differences could be attributed to the unique cytoarchitecture of area 17 (Figures 2A and 2B). Gene expression patterns were similar between areas 18 and 21 for the vast majority of the genes, and there were only subtle cytoarchitectural difference. Only 4% of genes exhibited expression pattern difference between areas 18 and 21 (Table S2), for example GRIN3A and SCN3B (Figure 2C), with a very small subset showing differential expression in all three regions, such as PENK, KCNC3, and SYT2 (Figure 2D). Individual donor comparison to assess expression difference for each gene is confounded by tissue quality variation, especially for expression level. To assess whether an expression level difference reflected tissue integrity or a donor difference, a Pearson rank correlation was performed on genes showing significant difference in intensity level (Supplemental Information). Only genes with level variations showing no significant correlation with tissue integrity were considered as having donor difference. Overall, 46 genes (5%) were determined to show donor variation in expression pattern or level (Table S2 and Supplemental Information). For example, RELN, which shows layer-1-specific expression, was also detected in layer 4C cells in some cases; DISC1 exhibited robust expression in scattered layers 1 and 2 cells in a subset of cases, and VAMP1 had variable expression levels across different cases (Figure 3). The donor difference for RELN was validated by RT-qPCR on laser capture microdissected layer 4C tissues from the three donors shown in Figure 3 (ΔCp values between RELN and GAPDH control are 8.3 ± 0.3 for donor 1, 9.2 ± 0.2 for donor 2, and 9.1 ± 0.2 for donor 3, means ± SD; p < 0.01 for both donors 1–2 and 1–3 comparisons, Student's t test). To explore the degree of conservation between human and a widely used animal model system, the mouse, we performed a systematic comparison of gene expression between human and mouse visual cortex on 941 genes with orthologs and expression data in both species. Because of the inevitable tissue quality difference between the two species and the demonstrated impact of tissue quality on expression intensity, only particularly striking expression level differences (e.g., + versus +++ or more) were called out. The comparison included both primary and secondary cortical areas (i.e., both areas 17 and 18 in human), and any significant difference in either area was recorded. Overall, gene expression showed a high degree of concordance between mouse and human visual cortices, and only 21% of the genes (199 genes) showed moderate or marked difference in either expression patterns or levels (Table S2). A wide range of pattern differences was observed, often restricted to particular anatomical domains or cell populations (Figure 4A ). Examples include increased expression in human in specific layers (e.g., ANXA1 and NNAT) or overall (e.g., BCL6); decreased expression density (e.g., NPY); decreased expression in specific layers (e.g., CALB1, GRIK1, and RELN); shifted localization from one layer to another (e.g., CRYM and SYT2) or from laminar to scattered (e.g., HCN1 and PDYN), etc. As an extreme example, CARTPT expression was variable in all three aspects—among regions (human areas 17/18 versus 21, or mouse visual versus somatosensory cortices), individuals, and species (Figure 4B). The proportion of genes with similar or variable cross-species expression was generally consistent across different gene categories (Figure 4C). For example, the disease genes (354) and comparative genomics genes (95) showed similarly low cross-species variability, with only 13% and 23% exhibiting expression difference, respectively. In marked contrast, the cell-type marker gene category exhibited significantly more cross-species difference. Approximately 50% of the 237 genes identified as cortical markers in the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas expressed differently in human. Among these, 59% of the laminar markers and 41% of the putative interneuron markers from mouse showed expression difference in human, whereas glial and vascular marker expression was relatively conserved. Because additional genes dropped out due to weak expression in mouse and undetectable in human (although not scored as “different”) as well as 25 newly identified human marker genes, a total of 165 genes were designated as human cortical markers (Table S2) and among these 38% had human-mouse difference in expression pattern or level. Looking at functional classes of genes, which overlap with the cortical markers, several showed high cross-species expression variation (Figure 4C). These include secreted protein (48%), extracellular matrix (50%), cell adhesion (36%), and peptide ligand (31%) genes, which are interestingly all involved in intercellular communication. Overall, cortical marker genes accounted for 68% of the total 199 genes having cross-species difference. Of the remaining genes with differences, some also have nonuniform expression patterns. Therefore, the small proportion of genes exhibiting differential expression in the visual cortex between human and mouse contains predominantly genes showing unique and nonwidespread expression patterns. We examined a group of genes hypothesized to be under positive selection or HLS genes that have increased copy number along the human lineage (Popesco et al., 2006Popesco M.C. Maclaren E.J. Hopkins J. Dumas L. Cox M. Meltesen L. McGavran L. Wyckoff G.J. Sikela J.M.

The jewels of our genome: the search for the genomic changes underlying the evolutionarily unique capacities of the human brain.PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e80Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nearly all of these genes, including those only present in human, were found to be expressed in human cortex, mostly in widespread pattern with variable expression levels (Figure S2 and Table S2). Among the genes present in both species, substantially more genes showed increased expression in human than decreased expression (number of genes 16:4, see Figure S2B for examples). These results indicate that the HLS genes may have more significant roles in the function of human brain. To extend the human-mouse comparison to a multimodal association area, we compared human area 21 with the caudal part of mouse temporal association cortex (TEa), likely to be the closest homolog of area 21. Because TEa can only be unambiguously identified in mouse coronal sections, only 611 genes that have mouse coronal data in Allen Mouse Brain Atlas were included in this analysis. Gene expression again showed a high degree of concordance between the two temporal cortical areas, similar to the visual areas (Table S2). Among the 611 genes, expression difference between human and mouse visual cortices was seen in 159 genes (26%), and an expression difference between human and mouse temporal cortices was seen in in 149 genes (24%). The majority (126) of these genes showed expression difference in both types of comparison, and only a small number of genes showed unique difference in one cortical area (5% visual area only and 4% temporal area only) (Figure 4D).

https://openalex.org/W2004979058,"The identification of PILS proteins, putative auxin transport facilitators, suggests that intracellular auxin transport might be evolutionarily older than directional, cell-to-cell PIN-dependent auxin transport, and highlights the developmental importance of intracellular auxin transport. Auxin is a key hormone regulating plant growth and development. Directed transport of auxin between cells is mediated by auxin-efflux carriers called PINs. Here, Jürgen Kleine-Vehn and colleagues identify a previously unknown auxin-transporter family called PIN-LIKES (PILS). These transporters, located in the endoplasmic reticulum, regulate intracellular auxin accumulation and metabolism and maintain cellular auxin homeostasis. This finding suggests that compartmentalization of auxin is important for developmental processes. The phytohormone auxin acts as a prominent signal, providing, by its local accumulation or depletion in selected cells, a spatial and temporal reference for changes in the developmental program1,2,3,4,5,6,7. The distribution of auxin depends on both auxin metabolism (biosynthesis, conjugation and degradation)8,9,10 and cellular auxin transport11,12,13,14,15. We identified in silico a novel putative auxin transport facilitator family, called PIN-LIKES (PILS). Here we illustrate that PILS proteins are required for auxin-dependent regulation of plant growth by determining the cellular sensitivity to auxin. PILS proteins regulate intracellular auxin accumulation at the endoplasmic reticulum and thus auxin availability for nuclear auxin signalling. PILS activity affects the level of endogenous auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), presumably via intracellular accumulation and metabolism. Our findings reveal that the transport machinery to compartmentalize auxin within the cell is of an unexpected molecular complexity and demonstrate this compartmentalization to be functionally important for a number of developmental processes."
https://openalex.org/W2002424170,"T cell development comprises a stepwise process of commitment from a multipotent precursor. To define molecular mechanisms controlling this progression, we probed five stages spanning the commitment process using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to track genome-wide shifts in transcription, cohorts of active transcription factor genes, histone modifications at diverse classes of cis-regulatory elements, and binding repertoire of GATA-3 and PU.1, transcription factors with complementary roles in T cell development. The results highlight potential promoter-distal cis-regulatory elements in play and reveal both activation sites and diverse mechanisms of repression that silence genes used in alternative lineages. Histone marking is dynamic and reversible, and though permissive marks anticipate, repressive marks often lag behind changes in transcription. In vivo binding of PU.1 and GATA-3 relative to epigenetic marking reveals distinctive factor-specific rules for recruitment of these crucial transcription factors to different subsets of their potential sites, dependent on dose and developmental context."
https://openalex.org/W2026932718,"The nematode C. elegans is attracted to nutritious bacteria and is repelled by pathogens and toxins. Here we show that RNAi and toxin-mediated disruption of core cellular activities, including translation, respiration, and protein turnover, stimulate behavioral avoidance of normally attractive bacteria. RNAi of these and other essential processes induces expression of detoxification and innate immune effectors, even in the absence of toxins or pathogens. Disruption of core processes in non-neuronal tissues was sufficient to stimulate aversion behavior, revealing a neuroendocrine axis of control that additionally required serotonergic and Jnk kinase signaling pathways. We propose that surveillance pathways overseeing core cellular activities allow animals to detect invading pathogens that deploy toxins and virulence factors to undermine vital host functions. Variation in cellular surveillance and endocrine pathways controlling behavior, detoxification, and immunity selected by past toxin or microbial interactions could underlie aberrant responses to foods, medicines, and microbes."

https://openalex.org/W2132640619,"Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is emerging as an important layer of gene regulation. Factors controlling APA are largely unknown. We developed a reporter-based RNAi screen for APA and identified PABPN1 as a regulator of this process. Genome-wide analysis of APA in human cells showed that loss of PABPN1 resulted in extensive 3' untranslated region shortening. Messenger RNA transcription, stability analyses, and in vitro cleavage assays indicated enhanced usage of proximal cleavage sites (CSs) as the underlying mechanism. Using Cyclin D1 as a test case, we demonstrated that enhanced usage of proximal CSs compromises microRNA-mediated repression. Triplet-repeat expansion in PABPN1 (trePABPN1) causes autosomal-dominant oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). The expression of trePABPN1 in both a mouse model of OPMD and human cells elicited broad induction of proximal CS usage, linked to binding to endogenous PABPN1 and its sequestration in nuclear aggregates. Our results elucidate a novel function for PABPN1 as a suppressor of APA."
https://openalex.org/W2144984120,"Behavior varies from trial to trial even when the stimulus is maintained as constant as possible. In many models, this variability is attributed to noise in the brain. Here, we propose that there is another major source of variability: suboptimal inference. Importantly, we argue that in most tasks of interest, and particularly complex ones, suboptimal inference is likely to be the dominant component of behavioral variability. This perspective explains a variety of intriguing observations, including why variability appears to be larger on the sensory than on the motor side, and why our sensors are sometimes surprisingly unreliable. Behavior varies from trial to trial even when the stimulus is maintained as constant as possible. In many models, this variability is attributed to noise in the brain. Here, we propose that there is another major source of variability: suboptimal inference. Importantly, we argue that in most tasks of interest, and particularly complex ones, suboptimal inference is likely to be the dominant component of behavioral variability. This perspective explains a variety of intriguing observations, including why variability appears to be larger on the sensory than on the motor side, and why our sensors are sometimes surprisingly unreliable. Even the simplest of behaviors exhibits unwanted variability. For instance, when monkeys are asked to visually track a black dot moving against a white background, the trajectory of their gaze exhibits a great deal of variability, even when the path of the dot is the same across trials (Osborne et al., 2005Osborne L.C. Lisberger S.G. Bialek W. A sensory source for motor variation.Nature. 2005; 437: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Two sources of noise are commonly blamed for variability in behavior. One is internal noise; that is, noise within the nervous system (Faisal et al., 2008Faisal A.A. Selen L.P. Wolpert D.M. Noise in the nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 292-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). This includes noise in sensors, noise in individual neurons, fluctuations in internal variables like attentional and motivational levels, and noise in motoneurons or muscle fibers. The other source of behavioral variability is external noise—noise associated with variability in the outside world. Suppose, for instance, that instead of tracking a single dot, subjects tracked a flock of birds. Here there is a true underlying direction—determined, for example, by the goal of the birds. However, because each bird deviates slightly from the true direction, there would be trial-to-trial variability in the best estimate of direction. Similar variability arises when, say, estimating the position of an object in low light: because of the small number of photons, again the best estimate of position would vary from trial to trial. Although internal and external noise are the focus of most studies of behavioral variability, we argue here that there is a third cause: deterministic approximations in the complex computations performed by the nervous system. This cause has been largely ignored in neuroscience. However, we argue here that this is likely to be a large, if not dominant, cause of behavioral variability, particularly in complex problems like object recognition. We also discuss why deterministic approximations in complex computations have a strong influence on neural variability although not so much on single cell variability. Instead, we argue that the impact of suboptimal inference will mostly be on the correlations among neurons and, possibly, the tuning curves. These ideas have important implications for current neural models of behavior, which tend to focus on single-cell variability and internal noise as the main contributors to behavioral variability. Although these arguments apply to any form of computation, we focus here on probabilistic inference. In this case, deterministic approximations correspond to suboptimal inference. For most models in the literature, the sole cause of behavioral variability is internal noise. Many of these models focus on discrimination tasks and their architectures are variations of the simple network depicted in Figure 1. The input layer contains a population of neurons encoding a sensory variable with a population code; for instance MT neurons encoding direction of motion (Law and Gold, 2008Law C.T. Gold J.I. Neural correlates of perceptual learning in a sensory-motor, but not a sensory, cortical area.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar; Shadlen et al., 1996Shadlen M.N. Britten K.H. Newsome W.T. Movshon J.A. A computational analysis of the relationship between neuronal and behavioral responses to visual motion.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1486-1510PubMed Google Scholar). These neurons are assumed to be noisy, often with a variability following either a Poisson distribution or a Gaussian distribution with a variance proportional to the mean activity. Typically, the population then projects onto a single output unit whose value determines the response of the model/behavior of the animal. In mathematical psychology, the input neurons are often replaced by abstract “channels.” These channels are then corrupted by additive or multiplicative noise (Dosher and Lu, 1998Dosher B.A. Lu Z.L.

USA. 1998; 95: 13988-13993Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar; Petrov et al., 2004Petrov A.A. Lu Z.L.

Despite these differences, the neural and psychological models are conceptually nearly identical. In particular, in both types of models behavioral performance depends critically on the level of neuronal variability, since eliminating that variability leads to perfect performance. Many models, including several by the authors of the present paper, explicitly assume that this neuronal variability is internally generated, thus blaming internal variability as the primary cause of behavioral variability (Deneve et al., 2001Deneve S.

Other studies are less explicit about the origin of the variability but, particularly in the attentional (Reynolds and Heeger, 2009Reynolds J.H. Heeger D.J.

Attention increases sensitivity of V4 neurons.Neuron. 2000; 26: 703-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) and perceptual learning domains (Schoups et al., 2001Schoups A.

Learning and adaptation in a recurrent model of V1 orientation selectivity.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 2086-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the variability is assumed to be independent of the variability of the sensory input and, as such, it functions as internal variability. For instance, it is common to assume that attention boosts the gain of tuning curves, or performs a divisive normalization of the sensory inputs. Importantly, in such models, the variability is unaffected by attention: it is assumed to follow an independent Poisson distribution (or variation thereof) both before and after attention is engaged, as if this variability came after the sensory input has been enhanced by attentive mechanisms (Reynolds and Heeger, 2009Reynolds J.H. Heeger D.J. The normalization model of attention.Neuron. 2009; 61: 168-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar; Reynolds et al., 2000Reynolds J.H. Pasternak T. Desimone R. Attention increases sensitivity of V4 neurons.Neuron. 2000; 26: 703-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). A similar reasoning is used in models of sensory coding with population codes. Thus, several papers have argued that sharpening or amplifying tuning curves can improve neural coding. These claims are almost always based on the assumption that the distribution of the variability remains the same before and after the tuning curves have been modified (Fitzpatrick et al., 1997Fitzpatrick D.C. Batra R. Stanford T.R. Kuwada S. A neuronal population code for sound localization.Nature. 1997; 388: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar; Teich and Qian, 2003Teich A.F. Qian N.

Sejnowski T.J. Neuronal tuning: To sharpen or broaden?.Neural Comput. 1999; 11: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This is a perfectly valid assumption if one thinks of the variability as being internally generated and added on top of the tuning curves. A common explanation of Weber's law relies on a variation of this idea (Dehaene, 2006Dehaene S. Symbols and quantities in parietal cortex: elements of a mathematical theory of number representation and manipulation.in: Haggard P. Rossetti Y. Kawato M.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10049-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Given that internal variability is indeed perceived as a primary cause of behavioral variability, neuroscientists have started to investigate its origin. Several causes have been identified; two of the major ones are fluctuations in internal variables (e.g., motivational and attentional levels) (Nienborg and Cumming, 2009Nienborg H. Cumming B.G. Decision-related activity in sensory neurons reflects more than a neuron's causal effect.Nature. 2009; 459: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and stochastic synaptic release (Stevens, 2003Stevens C.F. Neurotransmitter release at central synapses.Neuron. 2003; 40: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Another potential cause is the chaotic dynamics of networks with balanced excitation and inhibition (Banerjee et al., 2008Banerjee A. Seriès P. Pouget A. Dynamical constraints on using precise spike timing to compute in recurrent cortical networks.Neural Comput. 2008; 20: 974-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; London et al., 2010London M.

Sensitivity to perturbations in vivo implies high noise and suggests rate coding in cortex.Nature. 2010; 466: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar; van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996van Vreeswijk C. Sompolinsky H. Chaos in neuronal networks with balanced excitatory and inhibitory activity.Science. 1996; 274: 1724-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Chaotic dynamics lead to spike trains with near Poisson statistics—close to what has been reported in vivo, and close to what is used in many models. Although it is clear that there are multiple causes of internal variability in neural circuits, the critical question is whether this internal variability has a large impact on behavioral variability, as assumed in many models. We argue below that, in complex tasks, internal variability is only a minor contributor to behavioral variability compared to the variability due to suboptimal inference. To illustrate what we mean by suboptimal inference and how it contributes to behavioral variability, we turn to a simple example inspired by politics. Suppose you are a politician and you would like to know your approval rating. You hire two polling companies, A and B. Every week, they give you two numbers, dA and dB, the percentage of people who approve of you. How should you combine these two numbers? If you knew how many people were polled by each company, it would be clear what the optimal combination is. For instance, if company A samples 900 people every week, while company B samples only 100 people, the optimal combination is dˆopt=0.9dA+0.1dB. If you assume that the two companies use the same number of samples, the best combination is the average, dˆav=0.5dA+0.5dB. In Figure 2, we simulated what dA and dB would look like week after week, assuming 900 samples for company A and 100 for company B and assuming that the true approval ratings are constant every week at 60%. As one would expect, the estimate obtained from the optimal combination, dˆopt, shows some variability around 60%, due to the limited sample size. The estimate obtained from the simple average, however, shows much more variability, even though it is based on the same numbers as dˆopt, namely, dA and dB. This is not particularly surprising: unbiased estimates obtained from a suboptimal strategy must show more variability than those obtained from the optimal strategy. Importantly, though, the extra variability in dˆav compared to dˆopt is not due to the addition of noise. Instead, it is due to suboptimal inference—the deterministic, but suboptimal, computation dˆav=0.5dA+0.5dB, which was based on an incorrect assumption about the number of samples used by each company. Although this simple example might seem far removed from the brain, it is in fact similar to the problem of multisensory integration: for example, dA and dB could correspond to an auditory and a visual cue about the position of an object in space, and dˆav to the observer's estimate of the position of the object. The effect of suboptimal inference can even be seen in a simple discrimination task. For instance, consider the problem of discriminating between two Gabor patches oriented at either +5° or –5°, and containing a small amount of additive noise, as shown in Figure 3A, first column. Here, the additive noise is meant to model internal noise, such as noise in the photoreceptors. Figure 3A shows two linear discriminators, whose responses are proportional to the dot product of each image with the linear filter (Figure 3A, second column) associated with each discriminator. The linear filter for the top unit in the third column of this figure was optimized to maximize its ability to discriminate between the two orientations of the Gabor patches. The linear filter of the other unit (bottom one in the third column of Figure 3A) was optimized for Gabor patches with the same Gaussian envelope but half the wavelength. The unit at the bottom thus performs suboptimal inference; it assumes the wrong statistical structure of the task, just like the politician did with dˆav in the polling example. The graph in the right panel of Figure 3A shows the responses of the two units to a sequence of images with the same orientation but different noise. The responses have been normalized to ensure that the estimates are unbiased for both units. Given this normalization, greater response variability implies greater stimulus uncertainty and, therefore, greater behavioral variability. This simulation reveals two important facts. First, suboptimal inference has an amplifying effect on the internal noise. Indeed, if we set the noise to zero, the variability in both units would be zero. Second, most of the behavioral variability can be due to suboptimal inference. This can be seen by comparing the variability of the two units. For the top unit, all the variability is due to internal noise. In the bottom unit, all the extra variability is due to suboptimal inference, which in this case is 54 times the variability from the noise alone; more than 98% of the total variability. The fraction of variability due to suboptimal inference depends, of course, on the severity of the approximation, i.e., on the discrepancy between the optimal frequency and the one assumed by the suboptimal filter. As shown in Figure 3B, the information loss grows quickly as the difference between the filter and image wavelengths grows. The point of this example is to show that in psychophysics experiments, much of the behavioral variability might be due to suboptimal inference and not noise. This is true even in experiments in which external noise is minimized, as when the very same image is presented repeatedly across trials: suboptimal inference will amplify any internal noise (Figure 3A). In fact, we will also see that suboptimal inference can increase variability even in the absence of internal noise. In the polling and discrimination examples, we saw that suboptimal inference can amplify existing noise. In most real-world situations that the brain has to deal with, there are two distinct sources of such noise: internal and external. We have already discussed several potential sources of internal noise. With regard to external noise, it is important to point out that we do not just mean random noise injected into a stimulus, but the much more general notion of the stochastic process by which variables of interest (e.g., the direction of motion of a visual object, the identity of an object, the location of a sound source, etc) give rise to the sensory input (e.g., the images and sounds produced by an object). Here, we adopt machine learning terminology and refer to the state-of-the-world variables as latent variables and to the stochastic process that maps latent variables into sensory inputs as the generative model. For the purpose of a given task, all external variables other than the latent variables of behavioral interest are often called nuisance variables, and count as external noise. In situations in which there is both internal and external noise (i.e., a generative model), there are now three potential causes of behavioral variability: the internal noise, the external noise and suboptimal inference. Which of these causes is more critical to behavioral variability? To address this question, we consider a neural version of the polling example (Figure 2) with internal and external noise. The problem we consider is cue integration: two sensory modalities (which we take, for concreteness, to be audition and vision) provide noisy information about the position of an object, and that information must be combined such that the overall uncertainty in position is reduced. A network for this problem, which is shown in Figure 4A, contains two input populations that encode the position of an object using probabilistic population codes (Ma et al., 2006Ma W.J. Beck J.M. Latham P.E. Pouget A. Bayesian inference with probabilistic population codes.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1432-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). These input populations converge onto a single output population which encodes the location of the object. Output neurons are so-called LNP (Gerstner and Kistler, 2002Gerstner W. Kistler W.M. Spiking Neuron Models. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2002Crossref Google Scholar) neurons, whose internal state at every time step is obtained by computing a nonlinear function of a weighted sum of their inputs. This internal state is then used to determine the probability of emitting a spike on that time step. This stochastic spike generation mechanism acts as an internal source of noise, which leads to near-Poisson spike trains similar to the ones used in many neural models (Gerstner and Kistler, 2002Gerstner W. Kistler W.M. Spiking Neuron Models. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2002Crossref Google Scholar). We take the “behavioral response” of the network to be the maximum likelihood estimate of position given the activity in the output population, and the “behavioral variance” to be the variance of this estimate. Our goal is to determine what contributes more to the behavioral variance: internal noise or approximate inference. Figure 4B shows the behavioral variance of the network as a function of the number of neurons in the output population. The red line indicates the lower bound on this variance given the external noise (known as the “Cramer-Rao bound”; Papoulis, 1991Papoulis A. Probability, Random Variables, and Stochastic Process. McGraw-Hill, inc, New York1991Google Scholar); the variance of any network is guaranteed to be at or above this line. The blue line indicates the variance of a network that performs exact inference; that is, a network that optimally infers the object position from the input populations (see Ma et al., 2006Ma W.J. Beck J.M. Latham P.E. Pouget A. Bayesian inference with probabilistic population codes.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1432-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). The reason this variance is above the minimum given by the red line is that there is internal noise, which, as mentioned above, arises from the stochastic spike generating mechanism. As is clear from Figure 4B, for large numbers of neurons, this increase is minimal. This is because for a given stimulus, each neuron generates its spikes independently of the other neurons, and, as long as there are a large number of neurons representing the quantity of interest (which is typically the case with population codes), this variability can be averaged out across neurons. This demonstrates that, for large networks, internal noise due to independent near-Poisson spike trains has only a minor impact on behavioral variability. Of course, this is unsurprising: independent variability can always be averaged out. Nonetheless, many models focus on independent Poisson noise (Deneve et al., 2001Deneve S. Latham P.E. Pouget A.

In contrast, the green line shows the extra impact of suboptimal inference. In this case, the connections between the input and output layers are no longer optimal: the network now over-weights the less reliable of the two populations. As a result, the behavioral variance is well above the minimal value indicated by the red line. Importantly, the gap between the red and green lines cannot be closed by increasing the number of output neurons. Therefore, for large numbers of neurons, a large fraction of the extra behavioral variability is due to the suboptimal inference, with very little contribution from the internal noise. This example illustrates that internal noise in the form of independent Poisson spike trains has little impact on behavioral variability. This is counter to what appears to be the prevailing approach to modeling behavioral variability (Deneve et al., 2001Deneve S. Latham P.E. Pouget A.

https://openalex.org/W2054068279,"As with many other viruses, the initial cell attachment of rotaviruses, which are the major causative agent of infantile gastroenteritis, is mediated by interactions with specific cellular glycans. The distally located VP8* domain of the rotavirus spike protein VP4 (ref. 5) mediates such interactions. The existing paradigm is that 'sialidase-sensitive' animal rotavirus strains bind to glycans with terminal sialic acid (Sia), whereas 'sialidase-insensitive' human rotavirus strains bind to glycans with internal Sia such as GM1 (ref. 3). Although the involvement of Sia in the animal strains is firmly supported by crystallographic studies, it is not yet known how VP8* of human rotaviruses interacts with Sia and whether their cell attachment necessarily involves sialoglycans. Here we show that VP8* of a human rotavirus strain specifically recognizes A-type histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) using a glycan array screen comprised of 511 glycans, and that virus infectivity in HT-29 cells is abrogated by anti-A-type antibodies as well as significantly enhanced in Chinese hamster ovary cells genetically modified to express the A-type HBGA, providing a novel paradigm for initial cell attachment of human rotavirus. HBGAs are genetically determined glycoconjugates present in mucosal secretions, epithelia and on red blood cells, and are recognized as susceptibility and cell attachment factors for gastric pathogens like Helicobacter pylori and noroviruses. Our crystallographic studies show that the A-type HBGA binds to the human rotavirus VP8* at the same location as the Sia in the VP8* of animal rotavirus, and suggest how subtle changes within the same structural framework allow for such receptor switching. These results raise the possibility that host susceptibility to specific human rotavirus strains and pathogenesis are influenced by genetically controlled expression of different HBGAs among the world's population."
https://openalex.org/W2072182588,"Transcriptional cascades that operate over the course of lineage development are fundamental mechanisms that control cellular differentiation. In the developing central nervous system (CNS), these mechanisms are well characterized during neurogenesis, but remain poorly defined during neural stem cell commitment to the glial lineage. NFIA is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the onset of gliogenesis; we found that its induction is regulated by the transcription factor Sox9 and that this relationship mediates the initiation of gliogenesis. Subsequently, Sox9 and NFIA form a complex and coregulate a set of genes induced after glial initiation. Functional studies revealed that a subset of these genes, Apcdd1 and Mmd2, perform key migratory and metabolic roles during astro-gliogenesis, respectively. In sum, these studies delineate a transcriptional regulatory cascade that operates during the initiation of gliogenesis and identifies a unique set of genes that regulate key aspects of astro-glial precursor physiology during development."
https://openalex.org/W2002748750,"At the final step of homologous recombination, Holliday junction-containing joint molecules (JMs) are resolved to form crossover or noncrossover products. The enzymes responsible for JM resolution in vivo remain uncertain, but three distinct endonucleases capable of resolving JMs in vitro have been identified: Mus81-Mms4(EME1), Slx1-Slx4(BTBD12), and Yen1(GEN1). Using physical monitoring of recombination during budding yeast meiosis, we show that all three endonucleases are capable of promoting JM resolution in vivo. However, in mms4 slx4 yen1 triple mutants, JM resolution and crossing over occur efficiently. Paradoxically, crossing over in this background is strongly dependent on the Blooms helicase ortholog Sgs1, a component of a well-characterized anticrossover activity. Sgs1-dependent crossing over, but not JM resolution per se, also requires XPG family nuclease Exo1 and the MutLγ complex Mlh1-Mlh3. Thus, Sgs1, Exo1, and MutLγ together define a previously undescribed meiotic JM resolution pathway that produces the majority of crossovers in budding yeast and, by inference, in mammals."

In a wide search for adenosine receptor A2b (Adora2b)-elicited cardioadaptive responses, we identified the circadian rhythm protein period 2 (Per2) as an Adora2b target. Adora2b signaling led to Per2 stabilization during myocardial ischemia, and in this setting, Per2(-/-) mice had larger infarct sizes compared to wild-type mice and loss of the cardioprotection conferred by ischemic preconditioning. Metabolic studies uncovered a limited ability of ischemic hearts in Per2(-/-) mice to use carbohydrates for oxygen-efficient glycolysis. This impairment was caused by a failure to stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (Hif-1α). Moreover, stabilization of Per2 in the heart by exposing mice to intense light resulted in the transcriptional induction of glycolytic enzymes and Per2-dependent cardioprotection from ischemia. Together, these studies identify adenosine-elicited stabilization of Per2 in the control of HIF-dependent cardiac metabolism and ischemia tolerance and implicate Per2 stabilization as a potential new strategy for treating myocardial ischemia."

During polarization, GTP-Cdc42p becomes concentrated at the cortical site destined to be the “front” of the cell.

This complex is thought to mediate a positive feedback loop that enables small stochastic clusters of GTP-Cdc42p to become amplified (Kozubowski et al., 2008Kozubowski L. Saito K. Johnson J.M.

Mathematical modeling suggested that, although more than one stochastic cluster could be amplified in this manner, Bem1p complexes would soon become depleted from the cytoplasm, after which the clusters would compete with each other and the largest one would “win” (Goryachev and Pokhilko, 2008Goryachev A.B.

Thus, Bem1p-mediated positive feedback combined with competition for limiting Bem1p complexes could explain why rsr1Δ yeast cells polarize to one and only one site. The competition hypothesis predicts that polarity establishment should frequently proceed via a transient intermediate stage with more than one polarity cluster, but there is limited experimental evidence for such intermediates, as only rare, fleeting two-cluster instances were identified in rsr1Δ cells (Howell et al., 2009Howell A.S.

Thus, either competition occurs very rapidly, or some other mechanism ensures that only a single cluster develops. To distinguish between these possibilities, we developed higher-resolution filming conditions that circumvented the phototoxicity of previous protocols. We now document the frequent formation of more than one polarity cluster, and rapid competition between clusters, during symmetry-breaking polarization in rsr1Δ cells. Rapid filming of initial polarity establishment also revealed unexpected oscillatory clustering of polarity factors, indicative of negative feedback. Mathematical modeling suggested that negative feedback could confer advantageous features, including robustness and rapid competition between clusters even in the face of increasing polarity factor concentrations. Experimental tests confirmed these predictions, suggesting that negative feedback improves the robustness of the yeast polarity circuit. A major obstacle to filming cells at high resolution is phototoxicity (Carlton et al., 2010Carlton P.M. Boulanger J. Kervrann C. Sibarita J.B. Salamero J. Gordon-Messer S. Bressan D. Haber J.E. Haase S. Shao L. et al.Fast live simultaneous multiwavelength four-dimensional optical microscopy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 16016-16022Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We found that budding was delayed or blocked as light exposure was increased (Figure S1 available online). Reasoning that synchronizing cells would allow us to film for a shorter period prior to polarity establishment, thereby reducing total light exposure, we tested several synchrony protocols. We found that cells synchronized using hydroxyurea (HU) arrest/release were considerably less photosensitive than unsynchronized cells, allowing us to increase light exposure 4-fold without adverse effects (Figure S1). In diploid cells breaking symmetry, we detected two or three clusters of Bem1p-GFP in 28% of cells (n = 67) (Figure 1A and Movie S1). In all cases, either merging of nearby clusters (Johnson et al., 2011Johnson J.M. Jin M. Lew D.J. Symmetry breaking and the establishment of cell polarity in budding yeast.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2011; 21: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or competition between clusters left only a single cluster at what became the incipient bud site (Figure 1A). Growth of the clusters and resolution to a single cluster occurred within 2 min on average (Figure 1B). Similar fast resolution of multiple clusters to one was detected in unsynchronized cells (Figure S1). Thus, formation of multiple polarization clusters is a common occurrence, and cells rapidly and efficiently resolve the clusters by merging and competition.Figure 1Dynamic Behaviors of Bem1p-GFP during Polarity EstablishmentShow full captionInverted images (so dark spots represent concentrations of Bem1p-GFP) from movies of cells breaking symmetry.

Faster filming also revealed an unexpected behavior: oscillations in Bem1p-GFP concentration at the polarization site (Figure 1C and Movie S1). Rapid initial clustering was followed by equally rapid dispersal of Bem1p-GFP. Subsequent behavior generally involved one or two further cycles of clustering and dispersal, often with lower amplitude, before stabilizing prior to bud emergence (Figure 1D). Similar though less dramatic oscillations occurred in unsynchronized cells (Figure S1). These data suggest that the initial polarization process is oscillatory but is then damped due to either intrinsic or extrinsic factors. Oscillations were also apparent in cells with multiple clusters, once the rapid resolution to a single cluster had occurred. Despite cell-to-cell variability, oscillation was still apparent in the averaged behavior of cells aligned using the first peak (Figure 1E). Power spectrum analysis suggested a dominant oscillation frequency of 0.22/min (Figure 1F). In 15% of cells with a single cluster, the initial cluster disappeared entirely and a new cluster appeared at a different location (usually at what had been the mother-bud neck; Figure 1G). Similar “relocating” clusters were previously noted in cells overexpressing Bem1p-GFP (Howell et al., 2009Howell A.S. Savage N.S. Johnson S.A. Bose I. Wagner A.W. Zyla T.R. Nijhout H.F. Reed M.C. Goryachev A.B. Lew D.J. Singularity in polarization: rewiring yeast cells to make two buds.Cell. 2009; 139: 731-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Both the oscillatory and relocation behaviors suggest that initial Bem1p clustering is antagonized by some form of negative feedback. We next asked whether oscillatory and relocation behaviors were shared by other polarity regulators. The Cdc42p-directed GEF, Cdc24p, oscillated in parallel with Bem1p (Figure 2A and Movie S2). Fluorescent probes to detect GTP-Cdc42p (Tong et al., 2007Tong Z. Gao X.D. Howell A.S. Bose I. Lew D.J. Bi E.

Cell. 2000; 11: 773-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) also paralleled Bem1p behavior (Figures 2B and 2C and Movie S2). However, these probes were somewhat toxic (Figure S2), and the incidence of cells displaying high-amplitude oscillations was reduced when these probes were expressed. Cells displaying competing clusters, as well as relocation, were also observed with all probes (Figures 2D–2G), indicating that the core polarity regulators all concentrate, disperse, and reappear in concert.Figure S2Functionality and Toxic Effects of Expressing Probes to Detect Cdc42p Localization, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) MG-CDC42 and GFP-CDC42 probes are not fully functional. Most published data on Cdc42p localization were obtained using the myc-GFP-Cdc42p (MG-CDC42) probe (Slaughter et al., 2009Slaughter, B.D., Das, A., Schwartz, J.W., Rubinstein, B., and Li, R. (2009).

Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), but those studies expressed the probe in addition to endogenous Cdc42p. To assess whether or not that probe is functional, we integrated a single copy into the genome of a diploid cell (DLY12831: the probe was expressed at comparable levels to endogenous Cdc42p and the GFP localization was as previously reported), deleted one copy of endogenous CDC42, and sporulated and dissected the diploid. As shown in the left panel, the tetrads (4 spores in a row) exhibited 2:2 segregation for viability at room temperature, and markers indicated that all cdc42Δ spores failed to form colonies regardless of whether or not they contained the MG-CDC42 probe. Thus, at least in our strain background, this probe is not functional at endogenous levels of expression. We therefore tested a different GFP-Cdc42p probe, which was reported to complement cdc42Δ mutants in a temperature-sensitive manner (Bi et al., 2000Bi E. Chiavetta J.B. Chen H. Chen G.C. Chan C.S.

Consistent with that report, upon sporulation of a heterozygous diploid (DLY12833) we readily obtained viable cdc42Δ GFP-Cdc42p spore colonies at room temperature (circled in right panel). Because we filmed cells at 30°C, where this probe is unable to complement Cdc42p function, we used heterozygous diploids containing one copy of endogenous CDC42 and one copy of GFP-CDC42. We note that the lack of a fully functional probe for Cdc42p localization reduces confidence in the validity of this and all other published live-cell studies of Cdc42p localization.(B) The PBD-RFP (GTP-Cdc42p-binding) probe is somewhat toxic. A probe to specifically detect GTP-Cdc42p has been developed based on a fragment of the Cdc42p effector Gic2p that contains a CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) domain fused to tdTomato (Tong et al., 2007Tong Z.

Homozygous expression of this probe integrated at the URA3 locus led to the appearance of large cells and lysed cells (arrows), especially at elevated temperature. Panels show DIC images of fields of cells grown to mid-log phase in synthetic media at 37°C.

A previous study on rsr1Δ mutants reported wave-like motion of broad crescents of polarity factors along the cell cortex (Ozbudak et al., 2005Ozbudak E.M. Becskei A. van Oudenaarden A. A system of counteracting feedback loops regulates Cdc42p activity during spontaneous cell polarization.Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 565-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), unlike the focused, nonmotile, oscillatory clusters that we observed. We did detect cluster “movement” in G1-arrested rsr1Δ cells (data not shown) and in occasional cells expressing the GTP-Cdc42p-binding probe (Movie S3). In our filming conditions, all cells budded within 15 min of polarity establishment (Figure S1), but in the previous study cells took much longer (>50 min), raising the possibility that those cells were delayed in G1 (perhaps due to high light exposure and/or toxic fluorescent probes). We cannot rule out potential effects due to temperature or strain background differences, but we suspect that our filming conditions more accurately reflect physiological polarity establishment. What could cause the oscillations in polarity factor localization? The initial clustering of Bem1p, Cdc24p, and Cdc42p is thought to occur via positive feedback (Goryachev and Pokhilko, 2008Goryachev A.B. Pokhilko A.V.

Actin patches (labeled with Abp1p-mCherry) clustered at the polarization site ∼90 s after Bem1p (Howell et al., 2009Howell A.S. Savage N.S. Johnson S.A. Bose I. Wagner A.W. Zyla T.R. Nijhout H.F.

Actin-directed exocytosis could perturb polarity by inserting new membrane (Layton et al., 2011Layton A.T. Savage N.S. Howell A.S. Carroll S.Y. Drubin D.G. Lew D.J.

Cell. 2010; 21: 1237-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, treatment with Latrunculin A (Lat A) (Ayscough et al., 1997Ayscough K.R. Stryker J. Pokala N. Sanders M. Crews P. Drubin D.G. High rates of actin filament turnover in budding yeast and roles for actin in establishment and maintenance of cell polarity revealed using the actin inhibitor latrunculin-A.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) to depolymerize actin did not abolish oscillatory Bem1p clustering or relocation (Figures 3C–3E and Movie S4). Similar behaviors may correspond to the “unstable” polarization of GFP-Cdc42p previously noted in Lat A-treated cells (Wedlich-Soldner et al., 2004Wedlich-Soldner R. Wai S.C. Schmidt T. Li R. Robust cell polarity is a dynamic state established by coupling transport and GTPase signaling.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Indeed, Bem1p oscillations were prolonged in Lat A-treated compared to untreated cells. Thus, F-actin is not required for Bem1p oscillation but may contribute to damping such oscillation. The septins are filament-forming cytoskeletal proteins that are recruited by Cdc42p and form a ring surrounding the bud site (McMurray and Thorner, 2009McMurray M.A. Thorner J. Septins: molecular partitioning and the generation of cellular asymmetry.Cell Div. 2009; 4: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, Oh and Bi, 2011Oh Y. Bi E. Septin structure and function in yeast and beyond.Trends Cell Biol. 2011; 21: 141-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The septin Cdc3p accumulated ∼4 min after initial Bem1p clustering (Chen et al., 2011Chen H. Howell A.S. Robeson A. Lew D.J. Dynamics of septin ring and collar formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biol. Chem. 2011; 392: 689-697PubMed Google Scholar), correlating with the damping of oscillation (Figure 3F and Movie S5). In cells that either relocated the Bem1p cluster or had multiple clusters, Cdc3p only began to accumulate after relocation or competition had occurred (Figures 3G and 3H and Movie S5). The timing of septin recruitment suggests that septins do not account for the initial Bem1p dynamics but may contribute to damping the oscillations. Because Lat A treatment can impair septin recruitment (Kadota et al., 2004Kadota J. Yamamoto T. Yoshiuchi S. B"
https://openalex.org/W2007886762,"As a rule, organelles in eukaryotic cells can derive only from pre-existing organelles. Peroxisomes are unique because they acquire their lipids and membrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas they import their matrix proteins directly from the cytosol. We have discovered that peroxisomes are formed via heterotypic fusion of at least two biochemically distinct preperoxisomal vesicle pools that arise from the ER. These vesicles each carry half a peroxisomal translocon complex. Their fusion initiates assembly of the full peroxisomal translocon and subsequent uptake of enzymes from the cytosol. Our findings demonstrate a remarkable mechanism to maintain biochemical identity of organelles by transporting crucial components via different routes to their final destination."

A neuron integrates impinging synaptic inputs to generate action potentials for signal transmission to the next neuron; it conveys information by adjusting the action potential number, the “firing frequency,” or timing, the “firing pattern.” As action potential triggers transmitter release from axon terminals, the ensuing transmitter receptor activation leads to synaptic responses. Ca2+ signals generated during action potential and synaptic potentials activate Ca2+-activated ion channels thereby providing feedback regulation.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 6809-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In this study, we show CaCCs are present in hippocampal neurons and serve functions important for neuronal signaling. CaCC activation by Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors reduces the EPSP and the extent of temporal summation. CaCC also elevates the threshold for spike generation by excitatory synaptic potentials so as to further dampen EPSP-spike coupling. Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels that open during an action potential activates CaCC to modulate spike duration in the somatodendritic region. Likely encoded by TMEM16B rather than TMEM16A, CaCCs reside in the vicinity of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to regulate spike duration and in close proximity of NMDA receptors to modulate excitatory synaptic responses; both forms of regulation are eliminated by internal BAPTA but not EGTA. Activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels can lead to CaCC activation in smooth muscle and sensory neurons (Frings et al., 2000Frings S. Reuter D. Kleene S.J. Neuronal Ca2+-activated Cl− channels—homing in on an elusive channel species.Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 60: 247-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, Scott et al., 1995Scott R.H. Sutton K.G. Griffin A. Stapleton S.R. Currie K.P. Aspects of calcium-activated chloride currents: a neuronal perspective.Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 66: 535-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To look for CaCC in hippocampal neurons, we applied a 200 ms depolarization step from −70 mV to 0 mV to activate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. This depolarizing prepulse resulted in Ca2+ influx due to the large inward Ca2+ current, and was followed by a tail current (arrow, Figure 1A ) that reversed near the equilibrium potential of Cl− ions (ECl) (Figure 1A, right), in cultured pyramidal neurons at DIV (days in vitro) 14 and also in CA1 pyramidal neurons of acute slices from P14–21 (postnatal day 14–21) mice. Only Ca2+ and Cl− ions are possible charge carriers in these experiments because (1) Na+ was replaced by NMDG and Na+ channels were blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX) and (2) K+ ions were removed and K+ channels were blocked with Cs+ and tetraethylamonium (TEA) in the internal solution and 4-aminopyridine (4AP) in the external solution, which also included the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin (Figure 1A). So we went on to test whether Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels activates Cl− channels to generate the tail current. To verify that Cl− is the ion carrier for the tail current, we determined its reversal potential in three different internal Cl− concentrations. The voltage steps following the prepulse depolarization ranged from −100 mV to −25 mV (5 or 10 mV steps). After subtracting the background current elicited without a depolarization prepulse (−70 mV holding potential without 0 mV depolarization prepulse) from the tail current elicited with a depolarization prepulse (to 0 mV), we plotted the average tail current measured at 150–200 ms after the end of the 0 mV prepulse as a function of voltage to determine the reversal potential (Figure 1B). We found that the reversal potential, plotted as a function of log10 [Cl−]in, followed the Nernst equation with a slope of 58 mV (Figure 1C). These results reveal that this tail current is a Cl− current. To verify that this tail Cl− current is activated by Ca2+, first we eliminated Ca2+ current with 100 μM Cd2+ (Figure 2A ) and found the tail Cl− current absent (Figure 2A). By including 10 mM BAPTA in the whole-cell patch pipette solution to chelate Ca2+, we found that the tail current was nearly abolished (Figure 2B). Moreover, replacing external Ca2+ with Ba2+ (Figure 2C) also eliminated the tail current (Figure 2C). These experiments demonstrate that the tail current requires internal Ca2+ for activation. To test whether prepulse depolarization to levels approaching the equilibrium potential of Ca2+ (ECa) results in smaller tail current due to the diminishing driving force for Ca2+, we varied the prepulse from −70 mV (no depolarization) to +100 mV and measured the tail current (Figure 2D). Indeed, whereas Ca2+ influx was minimal at prepulse potentials more negative than −30 mV due to insufficient activation of Ca2+ channels and consequently there was little tail current, the tail current grew with further depolarization and reached a maximum near 0 mV prepulse, and then diminished as the prepulse depolarization approached ECa (calculated to be > 100 mV). We next test whether prolonging the prepulse depolarization to increase the Ca2+ influx increases the tail current. While the tail current in response to longer prepulse to 0 mV was larger (Figure 2E, white bars), it remained unchanged for prepulse to +100 mV regardless of the duration (Figure 2E, black bars). These experiments show that the tail current is a Ca2+-activated Cl− current. Next, we tested two classical CaCC blockers, niflumic acid (NFA) and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB). Whereas depolarization from −70 mV to 0 mV resulted in an inward Ca2+ current followed by a tail current (tail current measured at −90 mV, ECl = - 46.8 mV), both CaCC blockers reduced the tail current (Figure 3A ) while leaving the peak Ca2+ current intact. As shown in Figure 1D for recording from acute slices at 35°C with 2.5 mM external Ca2+, depolarization to 0 mV for one millisecond induced the CaCC tail current that reversed at ECl. We therefore tested whether CaCC can modulate spike waveform by injecting a 2 ms pulse of current to depolarize neurons in hippocampal slices at 35°C to barely reach the threshold for spike generation ∼90% of the time, and looked for the effect of NFA and NPPB. The resting membrane potential ranged from −65 mV to −70 mV in all our experiments, and we injected a small amount of hyperpolarizing current to bring the membrane potential to −70 mV at the start of the experiment. Indeed, 100 μM NFA caused spike broadening (Figure 3B, top); there was a dose-dependent increase of the spike width (measured at 33% of the spike height) with the maximal spike widening corresponding to an increase by ∼65% of the control spike width (Figure 3B, bottom). Similar results were obtained with a second CaCC blocker, NPPB (Figure 3C). The spike broadening following application of 100 μM NFA was reversible upon washout (see Figure S2A available online; see Figure S1 for time course plots of drug effects). When we shifted ECl from −70 mV to +54 mV by changing internal and external Cl− concentrations, 100 μM NFA narrowed the spike width instead (Figure S2B). Importantly, with 10 mM internal BAPTA to chelate Ca2+ and prevent CaCC activation, the spike duration was unaffected by NFA (Figure S2C). In these and all following studies, the CaCC blockers had no significant effects on the resting membrane potential or input resistance of hippocampal neurons. These controls verify that the observed NFA effect is specific for CaCC, thereby providing support for our conclusion that CaCC controls action potential repolarization. To explore the molecular identity of the hippocampal CaCC, we performed RT-PCR and found TMEM16B but not TMEM16A transcript in cultured hippocampal neurons (Figure 4A ). In situ hybridization further revealed that the TMEM16B mRNA is present in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, dentate granule cells and hilar interneurons of the hippocampus (Figure 4G). We next asked whether the TMEM16B protein is also expressed in the hippocampus, by raising a rabbit polyclonal antibody against an epitope in a putative extracellular loop of mouse TMEM16B. The antibody readily detected TMEM16B-mCherry (monomer ∼132 kDa) expressed in HEK293 cells, but not in control cells cotransfected with enzymatically prepared small interfering RNA (esiRNA) (Kittler et al., 2005Kittler R. Heninger A.K. Franke K. Habermann B. Buchholz F. Production of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs for gene silencing in mammalian cells.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) targeting TMEM16B (Figure S3B). Using this rabbit anti-TMEM16B antibody to probe for the endogenous TMEM16B, we detected a band migrating at the expected size of TMEM16B (∼105 kDa) in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons (Figure 4H). These studies reveal that TMEM16B is expressed in the hippocampus. To test for the involvement of TMEM16B in hippocampal CaCC, we cloned two independent small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting different parts of the TMEM16B mRNA, 16B-shRNAs #2 and #5, as well as a scrambled control shRNA into a lentiviral transfer vector that contains the coding sequence for green fluorescence protein (GFP). These TMEM16B-shRNAs reduced the expression of TMEM16B-mCherry fusion proteins in HEK293 cells (Figure S3C) as well as endogenous TMEM16B mRNA in cultured hippocampal neurons 10 days after lentivirus infection (Figure 4B). Whereas these infected neurons displayed normal Ca2+ current, shRNA #2 or shRNA #5 knockdown of TMEM16B reduced the tail current amplitude by 60% ± 4.5% and 61% ± 5%, respectively, 12 days after infection (Figures 4C and 4D). Significant reduction of the tail current was also observed at 9 and 10 days after infection (Figure 4D). In contrast, comparison of CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices from wild-type (n = 7) and TMEM16A KO mice (n = 11) revealed no significant difference in the tail current (109% ± 9% of control with 0 mV prepulse, p = 0.9) (Figure S3A), indicating that TMEM16B but not TMEM16A is required for the CaCC in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Knockdown of TMEM16B by shRNA #2 or shRNA #5, but not the scrambled control RNA, lengthened the action potential duration by 50% ± 7.6% and 40% ± 5.2% respectively; the action potential broadening was evident starting at 9 days after infection, as well as 10 and 12 days after infection (Figures 4E). We further tested the effect of shRNA knockdown of TMEM16B by performing whole-cell recording of CaCC elicited by raising intracellular Ca2+ in the patch pipette solution from 0 to 0.5 μM Ca2+, and found ∼80% reduction of CaCC current 10 days after lentivirus infection (Figure 4F). These studies indicate that TMEM16B is important for hippocampal CaCC that regulates the spike waveform. Blocking CaCC caused spike broadening in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons recorded at 35°C (Figures 3B and 5A) and room temperature (Figure S4), and the spike broadening persisted in the presence of 100 μM calcium/calmodulin activated kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor KN62 (Figure S4). Whereas 10 mM internal BAPTA prevented CaCC activation following the opening of Ca2+ channels (Figures S2C and 4A), 100 μM NFA still caused spike broadening when 10 mM EGTA was included in the internal solution (Figure S4A), indicating that CaCCs are in close vicinity of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. We next asked whether CaCC also affects spike duration in the axon terminals. If so, applying CaCC blocker should increase transmitter release from CA3 axon terminals that form synapses with CA1 neurons. First, we performed field recording of the pharmacologically isolated AMPA-fEPSP in the CA1 dendritic field, while stimulating Schaffer collaterals ten times at 10 Hz (Figure 5C). NFA did not alter the AMPA-fEPSPs (106% ± 8.4%, n = 7, p = 0.8). 100 μM NFA also did not alter the pharmacologically isolated NMDA-EPSCs recorded from individual CA1 pyramidal neurons (101% ± 3.1%, n = 5, p = 0.2; Figure 5D) (external Mg2+ was removed to facilitate NMDA receptor activation, and 10 mM internal Cl− was used to minimize the driving force for Cl− ions when ECl is −64.4 mV and holding potential is −65 mV). Thus, blocking CaCC alters the action potential waveform in the soma without altering transmitter release, indicating that functional CaCCs reside in somatodendritic regions but not the nerve terminals of CA3 pyramidal neurons. Next, we asked whether CaCCs are near NMDA-Rs to be activated during synaptic responses. To maximize the chance of detecting CaCC activation during voltage-clamp recording of isolated NMDA-EPSC in the presence of 20 μM CNQX, we replaced external Mg2+ with Ca2+ and increased the Cl− driving force by including 130 mM Cl− in the whole-cell patch pipette solution (ECl ∼0 mV) and holding the cell at −65 mV (65 mV driving force), so that CaCC activation would result in Cl− efflux thus enhancing the NMDA-EPSCs elicited from CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute slices (P14–21) by stimulating Schaffer collaterals every 20 s. As shown in Figure 5E, blocking CaCC with NFA reduced the NMDA-EPSC by 28% ± 4.3% (n = 10, p < 0.05), indicating that CaCC is in the vicinity of NMDA-Rs to be activated by the Ca2+ influx through NMDA-Rs. Importantly, when 10 mM of BAPTA was included in the 130 mM Cl− internal solution, NFA no longer had effect on NMDA-EPSC (100% ± 1.4%, n = 10, p = 0.13; Figure 5F), providing further evidence that NFA has no presynaptic effect on transmitter release. In contrast, when we included 10 mM EGTA in the patch pipette solution with 130 mM Cl−, 100 μM NFA still reduced NMDA-EPSC by 32 ± 9% (n = 5, p < 0.01; Figure 5G). As summarized in the histogram (Figure 5H), Ca2+ influx through NMDA-Rs is capable of activating CaCCs that are in close proximity so that the slower Ca2+ chelator EGTA, but not the fast Ca2+ chelator BAPTA, allows CaCC activation for feedback modulation of NMDA-EPSCs. To explore the physiological contribution of CaCCs, first we performed field recording of the pharmacologically isolated NMDA-fEPSP in the CA1 dendritic field in the presence of 2.5 mM Ca2+ and 1.3 mM Mg2. During a 10 Hz stimulation of Schaffer collaterals, the NMDA-fEPSPs gradually increased (Figure S5, left). Bath application of NFA enhanced the third, sixth, and tenth (n = 8; third, 138.4% ± 1.5%, p < 0.01; sixth, 145% ± 6.6%, p < 0.01; tenth, 140 ± 6.4%, p < 0.01) but not the first NMDA-fEPSP (105% ± 0.5%, n = 8, p = 0.8) (Figure S5, right), indicating that only when consecutive synaptic responses cause sufficient Ca2+ buildup for CaCC activation does NFA exert an effect on the synaptic response. Next, we recorded the pharmacologically isolated NMDA-EPSPs in CA1 pyramidal neurons while stimulating Schaffer collaterals at 10 Hz and asked whether CaCC plays a role in NMDA-EPSP-spike coupling. In the presence of 10 mM internal Cl−, 100 μM NFA enhanced NMDA-EPSP-spike coupling; NMDA-EPSPs summate to spike much later (first spike occurring most frequently at the tenth synaptic response) when CaCC is intact than when CaCC is blocked by 100 μM NFA (first spike occurring most frequently at the fourth or fifth responses) (Figure S6A). Thus, when CaCC is blocked by NFA, neurons fire spikes more readily with reduced average latency to first spike and increased average number of spikes per train (Figure S6B; n = 10, p < 0.001). The CaCC function depends on the Cl− concentration gradient because when we elevated the internal Cl− level to 130 mM (ECl ∼0 mV), reducing CaCC with 100 μM NFA delayed spike initiation, increased the average latency to first spike and reduced the average number of spikes generated (Figures S6C and S6D; n = 10, p < 0.001). Thus, whereas CaCC normally acts as an inhibitory brake on NMDA-EPSP to spike coupling, elevating internal Cl− concentration during neuronal activity or dysfunction could cause CaCC to provide positive feedback and enhance excitation. To further explore the physiological contribution of CaCCs to synaptic responses, we stimulated Schaffer collaterals at 100–200 microns from the CA1 pyramidal cell body layer every 30 s and recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons at 35°C in physiological solution plus picrotoxin to block GABAA receptors. Reducing CaCC with 100 μM NFA increased the amplitude of large but not small synaptic"

Although these loci have previously been associated with adult height, their effects on infant head circumference were largely independent of height (P = 3.8 × 10(-7) for rs7980687 and P = 1.3 × 10(-7) for rs1042725 after adjustment for infant height). A third signal, rs11655470 on chromosome 17q21, showed suggestive evidence of association with head circumference (P = 3.9 × 10(-6)). SNPs correlated to the 17q21 signal have shown genome-wide association with adult intracranial volume, Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, indicating that a common genetic variant in this region might link early brain growth with neurological disease in later life."
https://openalex.org/W2070501211,"Asymmetric division of progenitor/stem cells generates both self-renewing and differentiating progeny and is fundamental to development and regeneration. How this process is regulated in the vertebrate brain remains incompletely understood. Here, we use time-lapse imaging to track radial glia progenitor behavior in the developing zebrafish brain. We find that asymmetric division invariably generates a basal self-renewing daughter and an apical differentiating sibling. Gene expression and genetic mosaic analysis further show that the apical daughter is the source of Notch ligand that is essential to maintain higher Notch activity in the basal daughter. Notably, establishment of this intralineage and directional Notch signaling requires the intrinsic polarity regulator Partitioning defective protein-3 (Par-3), which segregates the fate determinant Mind bomb unequally to the apical daughter, thereby restricting the self-renewal potential to the basal daughter. These findings reveal with single-cell resolution how self-renewal and differentiation become precisely segregated within asymmetrically dividing neural progenitor/stem lineages."

A candidate neural substrate for this adult plasticity is the inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Using a large stimulus set, we explored the impact that long-term experience has on the response properties of two classes of neurons in ITC: broad-spiking (putative excitatory) cells and narrow-spiking (putative inhibitory) cells. We found that experience increased maximum responses of putative excitatory neurons but had the opposite effect on maximum responses of putative inhibitory neurons, an observation that helps to reconcile contradictory reports regarding the presence and direction of this effect. In addition, we found that experience reduced the average stimulus-evoked response in both cell classes, but this decrease was much more pronounced in putative inhibitory units. This latter finding supports a potentially critical role of inhibitory neurons in detecting and initiating the cascade of events underlying adult neural plasticity in ITC."
https://openalex.org/W2161919260,"Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by a progressive and irreversible loss of the articular cartilage, due in main part to the cleavage of type II collagen within the matrix by the enzyme matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)13. Here, we examined the methylation status of MMP13 promoter and report the demethylation of specific CpG dinucleotides within its promoter in osteoarthritic compared to normal cartilage, which correlates with increased MMP13 expression. Of the promoter CpG sites examined, the –104 CpG was consistently demethylated following treatment of human articular chondrocytes with 10μM DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine, again correlating with increased MMP13 expression. Methylation of the –104 CpG site resulted in reduced promoter activity in the chondrosarcoma cell line SW1353 as shown by CpG-free luciferase reporter. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we identified CREB as the regulating factor able to only bind to the MMP13 promoter when the –104 CpG is demethylated, and confirmed this binding by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Finally, we demonstrated that CREB induces MMP13 expression only following treatment of SW1353 with 0.5 μM Ca2+ ionophore A23187. In summary, the –104 CpG is demethylated in osteoarthritic cartilage, correlating with the elevated MMP13 expression and cartilage destruction, providing a highly novel link between epigenetic status and arthritic disease.—Bui, C., Barter, M.

Unexpectedly, we found that ASOs with 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro (2′-F) nucleotides, but not with other 2′ chemical modifications, have an additional property: they form heteroduplexes with RNA that are specifically recognized by the interleukin enhancer-binding factor 2 and 3 complex (ILF2/3). 2′-F ASO–directed recruitment of ILF2/3 to RNA can be harnessed to control gene expression by modulating alternative splicing of target transcripts. ILF2/3 recruitment to precursor mRNA near an exon results in omission of the exon from the mature mRNA, both in cell culture and in mice. We discuss the possibility of using chemically engineered ASOs that recruit specific proteins to modulate gene expression for therapeutic intervention."

To understand how RNAs fold uniquely despite a small number of tertiary interaction motifs, we mutated the major tertiary interactions in a group I ribozyme by single-base substitutions. The resulting perturbations to the folding energy landscape were measured using SAXS, ribozyme activity, hydroxyl radical footprinting, and native PAGE. Double- and triple-mutant cycles show that most tertiary interactions have a small effect on the stability of the native state. Instead, the formation of core and peripheral structural motifs is cooperatively linked in near-native folding intermediates, and this cooperativity depends on the native helix orientation. The emergence of a cooperative interaction network at an early stage of folding suppresses nonnative structures and guides the search for the native state. We suggest that cooperativity in noncoding RNAs arose from natural selection of architectures conducive to forming a unique, stable fold.

Recent genomic sequence analyses indicate that noncoding RNAs with complex structures are widespread in nature (Weinberg et al., 2009Weinberg Z. Perreault J. Meyer M.M. Breaker R.R.

Structural and computational studies of ribozymes and other noncoding RNAs have revealed tertiary motifs and organizational principles (Holbrook, 2008Holbrook S.R.

The interaction networks of structured RNAs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6587-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but how these sequence motifs encode the self-assembly of unique 3D RNA structures remains an open question with implications for the design and evolution of new RNA functions. Unlike globular proteins, noncoding RNAs lack extensive hydrophobic cores through which distant side chains interact (Creighton, 1990Creighton T.E. Protein folding.Biochem.

RNA and protein folding: common themes and variations.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4957-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Instead, RNA double helices are pinned together by a smaller number of tertiary interaction motifs that encode the native structure (Leontis et al., 2006Leontis N.B. Lescoute A. Westhof E. The building blocks and motifs of RNA architecture.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The orientation or topology of helices in the core of the RNA is important for biological function and invariably conserved within RNA families (Michel and Westhof, 1990Michel F. Westhof E.

By contrast the stability of the folded RNA often depends on peripheral tertiary structure modules that vary during molecular evolution (Baird et al., 2005Baird N.J. Westhof E. Qin H. Pan T.

Owing to their stable secondary structure and modular construction, noncoding RNAs have the potential to form incorrect structures that compete with the biologically active structure (Thirumalai and Hyeon, 2005Thirumalai D. Hyeon C. RNA and protein folding: common themes and variations.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4957-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Despite these “rough” energy landscapes for folding, many RNAs nevertheless achieve remarkable folding specificity (Fang et al., 1999bFang X.W. Pan T. Sosnick T.R.

An alternative route for the folding of large RNAs: apparent two-state folding by a group II intron ribozyme.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 639-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here, we use energy perturbation theory and double-mutant cycles to show that tertiary interactions are strongly coupled in the folding intermediates of a natural group I ribozyme. This cooperativity depends strongly on the native architecture of the ribozyme. Small perturbations to the ribozyme structure allowed the entire folding landscape to be determined. By separately monitoring the stability of the native state and near-native folding intermediates, our results unexpectedly reveal that thermodynamic cooperativity emerges early in the RNA folding process, suppressing incorrect structures and simplifying the search for the native state. We discuss these findings and previous observations to suggest that folding cooperativity arose during evolution by the natural selection of RNA topologies conducive to specific folding. For our analysis we used the 195 nt Azoarcus sp. bacterial group I ribozyme because it has a stable tertiary structure (Tanner and Cech, 1996Tanner M. Cech T. Activity and thermostability of the small self-splicing group I intron in the pre-tRNA(lle) of the purple bacterium Azoarcus.RNA. 1996; 2: 74-83PubMed Google Scholar) and well-characterized equilibrium folding pathway (Figure 1A ) (Rangan et al., 2003Rangan P. Masquida B. Westhof E. Woodson S.A. Assembly of core helices and rapid tertiary folding of a small bacterial group I ribozyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 1574-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In 0.2–0.4 mM Mg2+, assembly of the core helices produces native-like intermediates (IC) that are almost as compact as the native ribozyme (Perez-Salas et al., 2004Perez-Salas U.A. Rangan P. Krueger S. Briber R.M. Thirumalai D. Woodson S.A. Compaction of a bacterial group I ribozyme coincides with the assembly of core helices.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1746-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The IC intermediates are stabilized by tertiary interactions (Chauhan et al., 2005Chauhan S. Caliskan G. Briber R.M. Perez-Salas U. Rangan P. Thirumalai D. Woodson S.A. RNA tertiary interactions mediate native collapse of a bacterial group I ribozyme.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Chauhan et al., 2009Chauhan S.

Biol. 2009; 386: 1167-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but the tertiary contacts between double-helical domains are not fully stable, as judged by hydroxyl radical footprinting of the RNA backbone (Rangan et al., 2003Rangan P. Masquida B. Westhof E. Woodson S.A. Assembly of core helices and rapid tertiary folding of a small bacterial group I ribozyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 1574-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Local reorganization of the tertiary structure in 2–4 mM Mg2+ yields the fully folded and catalytically active native state (N) (Rangan and Woodson, 2003Rangan P. Woodson S.A. Structural requirement for Mg2+ binding in the group I intron core.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These folding transitions are well separated and can be distinguished by different experimental assays. We mutated five tertiary interaction motifs singly and in combination, avoiding active site residues and mutations likely to change the secondary structure of the RNA. Single-base substitutions were designed to disrupt the joining region J2/3, the central triple helix (TH), and paired region P6 within the ribozyme core, and two peripheral tetraloops (TLs) L2 and L9 that dock with helical receptors (TR) in P8 and P5, respectively (Figures 1B and 1C; see Table S1 available online for details). The single-base substitutions were combined in six double mutants, four triple mutants, and one quadruple mutant to measure the thermodynamic cooperativity between tertiary interaction motifs in different regions of the RNA. All of the mutant ribozymes, including the quadruple mutant, were active in a single-turnover oligonucleotide substrate cleavage assay (Herschlag and Cech, 1990Herschlag D. Cech T.R. Catalysis of RNA cleavage by the Tetrahymena thermophila ribozyme. 1. Kinetic description of the reaction of an RNA substrate complementary to the active site.Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10159-10171Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), with single mutants attaining 80%–200% of the wild-type (WT) activity in 15 mM MgCl2 (Figure 2A ; see Experimental Procedures and Figure S1 for details). To determine whether the mutants have the same structure as the WT RNA, we probed the solvent accessibility of the RNA backbone in several mutant ribozymes using hydroxyl radical footprinting under native conditions (Figures 2B and S2). A similar pattern of backbone solvent accessibility in the WT and mutant RNAs indicated that they form similar native-state ensembles. However, residues near the mutation site and in the catalytic core (J8/7 residues 167–172) were slightly more exposed in 15 mM Mg2+ than the corresponding regions in the WT ribozyme, consistent with increased unfolding due to the loss of a tertiary contact.Figure S1Assays of Ribozyme Folding, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) SAXS measurements of ribozyme collapse.

Band intensities were normalized to the total lane intensity and adjusted for the number of quantified bands in each sample. Relative cleavage values below 1 indicate protected regions. The hydroxyl radical footprinting results indicate that although the mutant ribozymes form an active structure, they are more likely than the WT RNA to populate extended or locally unfolded conformations. To evaluate this possibility, we obtained information about the average compactness and shape of each RNA under native conditions from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments (Figure S1). All of the mutant ribozymes formed globular structures above 3 mM MgCl2 similar to that of the WT RNA. However, the mutants were less compact than the WT RNA, as revealed by their larger radii of gyration (Rg) (Figure 2C) and longer maximum distances (r max) in the pair distribution function P(r) (Figure 2D). A triple mutant lacking both tetraloop-tetraloop receptor (TL-TR) interactions and the central TH (L2THL9) was the least tightly folded (gray; Figures 2C and 2D) but was still catalytically active (Figure 2A). Thus, the mutant ribozymes form compact, functional structures, although they are more likely than the WT ribozyme to explore extended conformations under native conditions. The contribution of each tertiary interaction to the folding free energy of the Azoarcus ribozyme was measured by titrating the WT and mutant ribozymes with Mg2+ (Figure 3). In general, stable RNA tertiary structures require less Mg2+ to form, and the steepness of the folding transition correlates with the free energy gap between the unfolded and folded states (see Experimental Procedures) (Fang et al., 1999aFang X. Pan T. Sosnick T.R.

USA. 1999; 96: 6149-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The tolerance of the Azoarcus ribozyme toward destabilizing mutations validated our energy perturbation approach, and allowed us to measure the complete free energy landscape for folding and coupling energies without having to assume that mutations ablate a tertiary interaction motif. The free energy change associated with forming the native state (ΔGI→N) was obtained from the increase in pre-steady-state ribozyme activity with Mg2+ (Figures 3A and S3). The free energy change between U and IC (ΔGU→I) was obtained from the decrease in Rg2 measured by SAXS, under the same conditions as the activity assays (Figures 3B and S3). Using previously validated folding models (Moghaddam et al., 2009Moghaddam S. Caliskan G. Chauhan S. Hyeon C. Briber R.M. Thirumalai D. Woodson S.A.

USA. 2003; 100: 1574-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) to extract populations of U, IC, and N (Figures 3C and 3D), free energies for each folding transition were evaluated at 0.8 mM Mg2+ for IC, 5 mM Mg2+ for N (Fang et al., 1999aFang X. Pan T. Sosnick T.R. A thermodynamic framework and cooperativity in the tertiary folding of a Mg2+-dependent ribozyme.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16840-16846Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These reference conditions correspond to 90% saturation of each transition, and were chosen to be near the midpoint of each transition where the assumptions underlying the free energy calculations are most valid (Leipply and Draper, 2010Leipply D. Draper D.E. Dependence of RNA tertiary structural stability on Mg2+ concentration: interpretation of the Hill equation and coefficient.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1843-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Full details of the analysis are given in Experimental Procedures, Figure S3, and Table S2. All of the single mutations destabilized both the IC intermediate and the native state N, demonstrating the importance of each tertiary interaction to folding stability (colored bars; Figures 3E and 3F). Surprisingly, IC was perturbed more than N, amounting to 0.5–2 kcal/mol or 35%–150% of the total free energy change of −1.3 kcal/mol for the WT U → IC transition. Among the single-base substitutions, only A39U in the J2/3 linker affected N more than IC, narrowing the energy gap for the second folding step (ΔΔGN>0, Figure 3E). The other single mutations raised the free energy of IC more than N, and ΔΔGN≤0. The large effect of each mutation on the IC state generalized previous conclusions that native tertiary contacts are present in compact folding intermediates of the Azoarcus ribozyme (Chauhan et al., 2005Chauhan S. Caliskan G. Briber R.M. Perez-Salas U. Rangan P. Thirumalai D. Woodson S.A. RNA tertiary interactions mediate native collapse of a bacterial group I ribozyme.J. Mol.

Because IC has considerable native character, the free energy surfaces for IC and N are similar (Figures 4 and S4). In other words the degree to which a mutation perturbs IC predicts how much that mutation destabilizes the native state. In the WT and all of the mutants, the energy gap between U and IC is much larger than the gap between IC and N. This observation and the large effects of the mutations on IC suggest that formation of the compact intermediate is the dominant step of tertiary folding, rather than formation of the native state as previously assumed.Figure S4Contributions of Tertiary Interactions to Folding Stability, Related to Figure 4Show full captionStacked plots showing the folding free energies of the ribozyme variants in different Mg2+ concentrations.

The free energy perturbations arising from the loss of each tertiary interaction motif show how the folding landscape is defined by the architecture of the ribozyme (Figures 1B and 4). Mutations in joining segments J2/3 and J6/7 (TH) were most destabilizing, reflecting their role in aligning double helices in the ribozyme core (Adams et al., 2004bAdams P.L. Stahley M.R. Kosek A.B.

Biol. 2000; 302: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas the TH between J6/7 and P4 aligns the P4-P6 and P3-P9 domains (Doudna and Cech, 1995Doudna J.A. Cech T.R.

Modelling of the three-dimensional architecture of group I catalytic introns based on comparative sequence analysis.J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 585-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Mutations that weaken these interactions hinder the ribozyme from achieving a compact fold. Second in importance were the peripheral TL-TR interactions (L2 and L9; Figure 4) previously identified as stability elements (Ikawa et al., 2000Ikawa Y. Naito D. Shiraishi H. Inoue T.

The reduced steepness of the folding transitions (Table S2; Figure S3) as well as a larger Rg in 1 mM Mg2+ indicate that a higher fraction of ribozymes containing L2 and L9 mutations forms nonnative structures that are more extended than native-like intermediates. Finally, the A-minor interaction between A97 in P6 and the P3 double helix (Rangan et al., 2003Rangan P. Masquida B. Westhof E. Woodson S.A.

https://openalex.org/W2006892361,"Homeostatic mechanisms operate to stabilize synaptic function; however, we know little about how they are regulated. Exploiting Drosophila genetics, we have uncovered a critical role for the target of rapamycin (TOR) in the regulation of synaptic homeostasis at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction. Loss of postsynaptic TOR disrupts a retrograde compensatory enhancement in neurotransmitter release that is normally triggered by a reduction in postsynaptic glutamate receptor activity. Moreover, postsynaptic overexpression of TOR or a phosphomimetic form of S6 ribosomal protein kinase, a common target of TOR, can trigger a strong retrograde increase in neurotransmitter release. Interestingly, heterozygosity for eIF4E, a critical component of the cap-binding protein complex, blocks the retrograde signal in all these cases. Our findings suggest that cap-dependent translation under the control of TOR plays a critical role in establishing the activity dependent homeostatic response at the NMJ."
https://openalex.org/W2050804229,"Trp-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) has a well-understood role in translation by facilitating aminoacylation of Trp-tRNAs. The discovery of a nuclear signaling role for TrpRS as a bridging protein for DNA-PK and PARP-1, resulting in p53 activation, explains a previously curious link between interferon-γ signaling and concomitant TrpRS overexpression. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) engenders strong antiproliferative responses, in part through activation of p53. However, the long-known IFN-γ–dependent upregulation of human Trp-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS), a cytoplasmic enzyme that activates tryptophan to form Trp-AMP in the first step of protein synthesis, is unexplained. Here we report a nuclear complex of TrpRS with the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) and with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), the major PARP in human cells. The IFN-γ–dependent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of DNA-PKcs (which activates its kinase function) and concomitant activation of the tumor suppressor p53 were specifically prevented by Trp-SA, an analog of Trp-AMP that disrupted the TrpRS–DNA-PKcs–PARP-1 complex. The connection of TrpRS to p53 signaling in vivo was confirmed in a vertebrate system. These and further results suggest an unexpected evolutionary expansion of the protein synthesis apparatus to a nuclear role that links major signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2044459308,"Activity-dependent modifications of chromatin are believed to contribute to dramatic changes in neuronal circuitry. The mechanisms underlying these modifications are not fully understood. The histone variant H3.3 is incorporated in a replication-independent manner into different regions of the genome, including gene regulatory elements. It is presently unknown whether H3.3 deposition is involved in neuronal activity-dependent events. Here, we analyze the role of the histone chaperone DAXX in the regulation of H3.3 incorporation at activity-dependent gene loci. DAXX is found to be associated with regulatory regions of selected activity-regulated genes, where it promotes H3.3 loading upon membrane depolarization. DAXX loss not only affects H3.3 deposition but also impairs transcriptional induction of these genes. Calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of DAXX is a key molecular switch controlling its function upon neuronal activation. Overall, these findings implicate the H3.3 chaperone DAXX in the regulation of activity-dependent events, thus revealing a new mechanism underlying epigenetic modifications in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1971221473,"In many cases, neurons acquire distinct identities as their axons navigate toward target cells and encounter target-derived signaling molecules. These molecules generate retrograde signals that activate subtype-specific gene transcription. Mechanisms by which axons convert the complex milieu of signaling molecules into retrograde signals are not fully understood. Here, we examine retrograde signaling mechanisms that specify neuronal identity in the trigeminal ganglia, which relays sensory information from the face to the brain. We find that neuron specification requires the sequential action of two target-derived factors, BDNF and BMP4. BDNF induces the translation of axonally localized SMAD1/5/8 transcripts. Axon-derived SMAD1/5/8 is translocated to the cell body, where it is phosphorylated to a transcriptionally active form by BMP4-induced signaling endosomes and mediates the transcriptional effects of target-derived BDNF and BMP4. Thus, local translation functions as a mechanism by which coincident signals are converted into a retrograde signal that elicits a specific transcriptional response.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIyZmRmYTZkZDhmNGUzYWVkYTlkZmVhNDBkY2RmZTY0ZiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NDQ5MzIwfQ.h7TE3yG2fSr8NfyJhZ0s1ZtFQKKJ1ZyBFXgNSvKNmoN74Z13y6umFh47PKDQ5CB95G8dkbHLUusIolNv2akgXNkqdssfMHFuSN_w90_5YtdoNIxZkssHguHUibbeigffMq9OJQPWqnBRCgmqcGhs9E1jqCe4tBZhf0uK0-THUQ8kJ4OGaqcq2Hg_AzO7xLf1xB8U1DIhZC5margpEHDalry_W9KEaDP7jPgf-NCto7SGWlrWN8Ty0ro309Xk04t12RK_sj4nnJTrNYUEnr5hgnXqDMWRk0VKBEEplRiD9C30pJIVEnajQ7kRQCmrPtGlPkYU1TOa4I3xEOpuJK-SAQ(mp4, (12.22 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W1991552631,"Cysteine string protein α (CSPα), a presynaptic cochaperone for Hsc70, is required for synapse maintenance. Deletion of CSPα leads to neuronal dysfunction, synapse loss, and neurodegeneration. We utilized unbiased, systematic proteomics to identify putative CSPα protein clients. We found 22 such proteins whose levels are selectively decreased in CSPα knockout synapses. Of these putative CSPα protein clients, two directly bind to the CSPα chaperone complex and are bona fide clients. They are the t-SNARE SNAP-25 and the GTPase dynamin 1, which are necessary for synaptic vesicle fusion and fission, respectively. Using hippocampal cultures, we show that CSPα regulates the stability of client proteins and synaptic vesicle number. Our analysis of CSPα-dynamin 1 interactions reveals unexpectedly that CSPα regulates the polymerization of dynamin 1. CSPα, therefore, participates in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and may facilitate exo- and endocytic coupling. These findings advance the understanding of how synapses are functionally and structurally maintained."

The Release of Neurotransmitter Substances. Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, UK1969Google Scholar). Many motorneurons trigger hundreds of thousands of action potentials a day (Hennig and Lømo, 1985Hennig R. Lømo T. Firing patterns of motor units in normal rats.Nature. 1985; 314: 164-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) driving synaptic vesicles into multiple cycles of rapid exo- and endocytosis (Maeno-Hikichi et al., 2011Maeno-Hikichi Y.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 1093-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The synaptic vesicle cycle is governed by precisely regulated, extremely fast, and spatially restricted protein-protein interactions. Exemplary reactions are the priming of SNARE complex to trigger fast Ca2+ dependent exocytosis and the dynamin1-dependent retrieval of plasma membrane (Slepnev and De Camilli, 2000Slepnev V.I.

The synaptic vesicle cycle.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Although not well known yet, the effect of the maintained synaptic activity is probably a source of protein-stress causing subtle, but nevertheless cumulative, damage in protein folding. Under those conditions, molecular chaperones act to save proteins from irreversible unfolding. Indeed, vertebrate synapses are probably endowed by chaperones that protect proteins from stress-dependent degradation and prevent long term failures of nerve terminal function (Muchowski and Wacker, 2005Muchowski P.J. Wacker J.L. Modulation of neurodegeneration by molecular chaperones.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). However, the most vulnerable synaptic proteins and the mechanisms protecting them are poorly understood.

CSP-α is an abundant synaptic vesicle protein that is composed of an N-terminal DNA-J domain and a C-terminal string of cysteine residues (Buchner and Gundersen, 1997Buchner E. Gundersen C.B.

We know that 1), CSP-α is not an essential molecular component to execute neurotransmitter release early postnatally in fast synapses like the calyx of Held, but it is required to maintain synaptic function after 3 weeks of age (Fernández-Chacón et al., 2004Fernández-Chacón R.

CSPα promotes SNARE-complex assembly by chaperoning SNAP-25 during synaptic activity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Perhaps, other synaptic proteins become functionally altered. A systematic functional study of the complete synaptic vesicle cycle in CSP-α KO mice would be useful to investigate further molecular alterations. Now, using quantal analysis at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) we describe a significant decrease in the number of vesicles available for release, likely explained by a priming defect as a consequence of reduced SNAP-25 levels. In addition, using synaptopHluorin (spH) imaging of the synaptic vesicle cycle at the NMJ, we have found specific alterations in synaptic vesicle recycling that might contribute to nerve terminal progressive degeneration when CSP-α is absent. Specifically, we demonstrate that motorneurons require CSP-α for the maintenance of synaptic release sites and synaptic vesicle recycling. CSP-α KO mice expressing spH developed the strong neurological phenotype that causes early lethality within 1–2 months of age as previously described (Fernández-Chacón et al., 2004Fernández-Chacón R. Wölfel M. Nishimune H. Tabares L. Schmitz F. Castellano-Muñoz M. Rosenmund C. Montesinos M.L. Sanes J.R. Schneggenburger R. Südhof T.C.

We used the levator auris longus (LAL) nerve–muscle preparation (Angaut-Petit et al., 1987Angaut-Petit D. Molgo J. Connold A.L. Faille L. The levator auris longus muscle of the mouse: a convenient preparation for studies of short- and long-term presynaptic effects of drugs or toxins.Neurosci. Lett. 1987; 82: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) to study synaptic transmission with electrophysiology (Rozas et al., 2011Rozas J.L. Gómez-Sánchez L. Tomás-Zapico C. Lucas J.J. Fernández-Chacón R. Increased neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction in a mouse model of polyglutamine disease.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 1106-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and with spH imaging (Tabares et al., 2007Tabares L. Ruiz R. Linares-Clemente P. Gaffield M.A. Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernandez-Chacón R. Betz W.J. Monitoring synaptic function at the neuromuscular junction of a mouse expressing synaptopHluorin.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5422-5430Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We first studied spontaneous release and detected fibers with “bursts” of miniature end-plate potentials (MEPP), as previously described in CSP-α KO mice (Ruiz et al., 2008Ruiz R. Casañas J.J. Südhof T.C. Tabares L. Cysteine string protein-alpha is essential for the high calcium sensitivity of exocytosis in a vertebrate synapse.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 27: 3118-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, when we excluded those fibers from our analysis, MEPP amplitude was similar in control and mutant synapses (1.03 ± 0.08 mV for wild-type (WT) and 1.19 ± 0.14 mV for CSP-α KO) (Figure S1A available online) and MEPP frequency was slightly, but not significantly, increased (0.58 ± 0.09 Hz in WT versus 0.83 ± 0.2 Hz in CSP-α KO NMJs) (Figure S1B). Next, we monitored end-plate potentials (EPP) evoked by nerve stimulation (Figure 1A ) and found a significant decrease in quantal content (QC) (36.4 ± 2.3 for WT and 23 ± 2.1 for KO synapses, p < 0.001 Student's t test) (Figure 1B), similar to the values in the CSP-α KO mice that do not express spH (40.7 ± 2.7 for WT and 28.6 ± 3.2 for CSP-α KO) (Figure S1C). Upon stimulation with long depolarizing trains (100 shocks, at 10, 30, and 100 Hz) (Figure 1 C), mutant and control terminals displayed initial similar levels of facilitation (Figure S1D) followed by synaptic depression, that was generally stronger in the mutants (Figure 1C) (10Hz: 55.0 ± 2.6% WT and 47.0 ± 3.8 CSP-α KO, p = 0.09; 30 Hz: 56.9 ± 2.4% WT and 44.1 ± 3.8% CSP-α KO, p = 0.006; 100 Hz: 48.7 ± 2.3% WT and 38.8 ± 4.6% CSP-α KO, p = 0.045). Interestingly, during the train, recordings from CSP-α KO revealed high fluctuations in EPP amplitude (Figure 1D), presenting a higher coefficient of variation (CV) for higher stimulation frequencies (Figure 1E). In contrast, at control recordings the CV was rather constant at different stimulation frequencies. Such a phenotype could be reflecting changes in the probability of release (p) or in the number of release sites (n). To clarify that issue, we investigated quantal properties of neurotransmitter release using binomial analysis (Boyd and Martin, 1956Boyd I.A. Martin A.R. The end-plate potential in mammalian muscle.J. Physiol. 1956; 132: 74-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, Searl and Silinsky, 2003Searl T.J. Silinsky E.M. Phorbol esters and adenosine affect the readily releasable neurotransmitter pool by different mechanisms at amphibian motor nerve endings.J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Amplitude distributions of EPPs (sets of 100 EPPs recorded at every terminal at 0.2 Hz stimulation frequency) (Figure 1F), were fitted to a binomial distribution to estimate the probability of release (p) and the number of synaptic release sites (n) (Figure 1G). The probability of release was similar in WT and CSP-α KO junctions (0.38 ± 0.01 WT versus 0.39 ± 0.02 CSP-α KO). In contrast, the mutant junctions presented a significant reduction in the number of release sites (n) (Figure 1H) (103.1 ± 12 versus 59.8 ± 6.9 for WT and CSP-α KO, p = 0.006, Student's t test). If parameter n is regarded as the number of vesicles that are docked and primed, then p refers to the probability that a vesicle is released from the pool (Miyamoto, 1975Miyamoto M.D. Binomial analysis of quantal transmitter release at glycerol treated frog neuromuscular junctions.J. Physiol. 1975; 250: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, Schneggenburger et al., 1999Schneggenburger R. Meyer A.C. Neher E. Released fraction and total size of a pool of immediately available transmitter quanta at a calyx synapse.Neuron. 1999; 23: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reduced n value at the mutant synapses could be interpreted as a reduction in the number of those vesicles that constitute the readily releasable pool (RRP) due to a defect in priming. Because SNAP-25 is very unstable at central synapses in CSP-α KO mice (Chandra et al., 2005Chandra S. Gallardo G. Fernández-Chacón R. Schlüter O.M. Südhof T.C. Alpha-synuclein cooperates with CSPalpha in preventing neurodegeneration.Cell. 2005; 123: 383-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, Sharma et al., 2011bSharma M. Burré J. Südhof T.C. CSPα promotes SNARE-complex assembly by chaperoning SNAP-25 during synaptic activity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we wondered if the same molecular phenomenon at motor nerve terminals could explain the priming deficit. We stained junctions with antibodies against green fluorescent protein (GFP) and CSP-α to demonstrate the colocalization between spH and CSP-α in control junctions (Figure 2A ). As expected, mutant junctions displayed no staining for CSP-α. The spH labeling with anti-GFP antibodies was, however, apparently normal and revealed a slightly reduced junction area (12% of reduction; 173.8 ± 5.8 μm2 for WT and 152.2 ± 4.9 μm2 for KO synapses, n = 64 from 7/7 mice, p = 0.005 Student's t test). Next, we carried out triple labeling of terminals with antibodies against GFP, SNAP-25, and synaptic vesicle protein-2 (SV2) and found an obvious reduction in the SNAP-25 staining normalized to GFP (69.1 ± 4.6% reduction) and even higher when normalized to SV2 (83.1 ± 1.7% p < 0.001 for both comparisons, one-way ANOVA test) (Figure 2B). No changes were detected for other synaptic markers, indicating that the SNAP-25 reduction was rather selective (Figure 2C). Interestingly, such a reduction was also detected at very early ages (P13, Figure S2). Next, we carried out immunoprecipitation (IP) of SNAP-25 from LAL muscles extracts to clearly detect SNAP-25 in preparations from WT. In contrast to WT, SNAP-25 was almost undetectable in preparations from CSP-α KO mice (Figure 2D). Such a reduction in SNAP-25 could be the molecular explanation for the deficit in synaptic vesicle priming reflected by a reduction in the number of release sites at the CSP-α KO junctions. In order to further investigate the implication of SNAP-25 in the priming defect we analyzed synaptic transmission upon different pharmacological manipulations.Figure 2Reduced Levels of SNAP-25 at CSP-α KO Motor TerminalsShow full caption(A) Maximum projection of confocal images from NMJs (asterisk) labeled with anti-GFP (green) and CSP-α (red) antibodies.(B) Triple immunolabeling of NMJs (arrowheads) (at P18) revealing GFP (spH), SV2, and SNAP-25.

On the other hand, CSP-α is also a substrate for PKA-dependent phosphorylation (Evans et al., 2001Evans G.J. Wilkinson M.C. Graham M.E. Turner K.M. Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A.

Reim K. Matti U. Brose N. Binz T. Rettig J. Neher E. Sørensen J.B.

We used forskolin to stimulate adenylate cyclase and PKA. At control synapses, forskolin induced a moderate EPP potentiation (47.2 ± 12.2%, n = 7) (Figures 3A and 3B) as previously observed at the rat NMJ (Santafé et al., 2009Santafé M.M. Garcia N. Lanuza M.A. Tomàs M. Tomàs J. Interaction between protein kinase C and protein kinase A can modulate transmitter release at the rat neuromuscular synapse.J. Neurosci. Res. 2009; 87: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutant synapses displayed a dramatic EPP potentiation (270.2 ± 75.4%, n = 7). EPPs recorded at CSP-α KO and WT junctions reached the same amplitude. The effect of cAMP involves membrane potential depolarization, Ca2+ influx, and an increase in the basal cytosolic [Ca2+] (Parramón et al., 1995Parramón M. González M.P. Oset-Gasque M.J. A reassessment of the modulatory role of cyclic AMP in catecholamine secretion by chromaffin cells.Br. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10545-10550Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To explore if the potentiation recorded in forskolin was rather due to increased Ca2+ influx, we measured EPP at two different external [Ca2+], 2 and 5 mM (Figure 3D). At 5 mM Ca2+, both in controls and mutants, the EPP amplitude was higher than at 2 mM Ca2+. EPP amplitudes were always lower in the mutants but the relative level of EPP potentiation at high Ca2+, compared to low Ca2+, was the same in WT and CSP-α KO synapses (62.5 ± 17.5% for WT and 40.5 ± 19.8% for CSP-α KO, n = 6 WT and 7 CSP-α KO) (Figure 3E). High external [Ca2+] slightly increased the synaptic depression during sustained release at 30 Hz in both WT (61.4 ± 5% in 2 mM versus 55.7 ± 2.5% in 5 mM of the EPP initial value, measured in terms of the average of the steady state, from EPP 20 to 50) and CSP-α KO synapses (48.4 ± 5.9% and 42.9 ± 3.4% for normal and high [Ca2+] conditions) (Figure 3F). Therefore, these results indicate that the forskolin induced potentiation could not be just solely explained by a secondary increase in Ca2+ influx. A possible interpretation of these results is that, in basal conditions, PKA-dependent stimulation of vesicle priming is much reduced at the CSP-α KO terminals. Likely, PKA-activation rises the proportion of phosphorylated SNAP-25 molecules to levels high enough to restore priming and EPP amplitude. That observation suggests that CSP-α is not a major PKA-target required for the late priming steps, and that there is another target that remains unknown. However, under high frequency stimulation, in the absence of CSPα, once vesicles are released, the synaptic release rate depends on priming rate that becomes compromised by the dramatic reduction of SNAP-25, even under PKA-activation conditions. On the other hand, intriguingly, forskolin did not rescue the synaptic depression during long stimulation trains in KO synapses (37 ± 5.1% and 36.4 ± 2.9% before and after forskolin), whereas in WT NMJs the depression was even reduced (46.4 ± 3.1% in control conditions and 56.7 ± 2.7% after forskolin treatment, p = 0.01 paired Student's t test) (Figure 3C). According to that observation, we could not rule out that a reduction in the recycling pool caused a shortage in vesicle supply for priming. To explore that possibility, we analyzed the synaptic vesicle recycling. We studied the spH fluorescence responses to action potential trains (10, 30, 50, and 100 Hz) (Figures 4A and 4B) at different ages. The responses from the youngest mutant mice litter-mate controls (P10–P15) had similar amplitudes (see Table S1). Older mutant mice (P16–P20) presented lower responses at higher stimulation frequencies (Figure 4C), whereas mice from the oldest age group (P21–P25) displayed significantly lower responses at all frequencies (Figures 4C and 4D). Thus, after 2 weeks of age, the phenotype progressed very rapidly with strong differences after 3 weeks of age. A concern in the study of synapses affected by neurodegeneration is that the functional phenotypes might be enhanced by secondary changes. We analyzed mice at P16–P20, the age window with a measurable phenotype when the nerve terminal degeneration is likely only incipient. Simultaneous recordings of spH fluorescence and EPP from control and mutant terminals are displayed at Figure 4E. In mutant and controls junctions, the spH fluorescence signal (ΔF) increased in parallel to the cumulative quantal content (ΣQC) (Figure 4E). We scaled up the WT ΔF signal to their corresponding ΣQC to better compare the time course of both sets of data (Figure 4F and Figures S3A and S3B). Interestingly, upon applying the WT scale factor to the CSP-α KO data, the ΔF signal corresponding to a given ΣQC turned out to be higher than in the WT. For every frequency tested, the cumulative QC (ΣQC) for KO NMJs was reduced by more than 50% of the WT (2,426 ± 178 versus 1,150 ± 73 at 10 Hz; 6,548 ± 449 versus 3,289 ± 289 at 30 Hz; 12,727 ± 1,159 versus 6,413 ± 446 at 100 Hz, estimated vesicle number in WT versus CSP-α KO). In contrast, the spH fluorescence responses of CSP-α KO synapses were above the electrophysiological measurements and closer to WT values (32.2 ± 3.7 versus 44.5 ± 6.9 at 10 Hz; 102 ± 13.3 versus 142.1 ± 17.6 at 30 Hz; 233.2 ± 25.8 versus 363.2 ± 41.8 at 100 Hz fluorescence units increase [ΔF] in WT versus CSP-α KO), indicating a disproportionate increase in ΔF. Literally, that could apparently mean that the membrane inserted was specifically brighter at the CSP-α KO terminals compared to controls. However, the hypothesis we pursued was that such a relationship between ΔF and ΣQC arose from a surplus of membrane leftover at the cell surface upon exocytosis followed by an inefficient compensatory endocytosis. If that were the case, we should expect the recovery of fluorescence to be slowed down at mutant synapses. The recovery phase was well fitted to a single exponential decay with longer time constants for stronger stimulations (Figure S3C). Surprisingly, however, at different frequency stimulations and postnatal ages, the kinetic recovery in the mutants was faster than in the controls (Figures S3C and S3D and Table S1). That observation was unexpected and apparently contradictory with an impairment in endocytosis. On the other hand, because mutant synapses release less synaptic vesicles, it could then happen that the endocytosis load was therefore less in the CSP-α KO. To clarify that, we analyzed the kinetics of recovery in WT and mutant recordings having a similar cumulative quantal content (6,039 ± 127 for WT and 5,611 ± 170 for KO, n = 17 and 14, respectively) (Figure S3E). We found that in such a subset of recordings, with a similar endocytic load, the fluorescence recovery in the mutants was slower than in the controls (17.2 ± 1.5 s for WT versus 24.5 ± 2.7 s for KO, p = 0.022 Student's t test) (Figures S3F and S3G). That observation also supported the notion that endocytosis depended on the amount of exocytosed vesicles, and endocytosis was impaired at synapses lacking CSP-α. Next, we carried out additional tests to further"

At early developmental stages, the simultaneous occurrence of GFOs in different brain regions suggests the existence of a long-ranging synchronizing mechanism at seizure onset. Here, we show that hippocamposeptal (HS) neurons, which are GABA long-range projection neurons, are mandatory to drive the firing of hippocampal interneurons in a high-frequency regime at the onset of epileptiform discharges in the intact, immature septohippocampal formation. The synchronized firing of interneurons in turn produces GFOs, which are abolished after the elimination of a small number of HS neurons. Because they provide the necessary fast conduit for pacing large neuronal populations and display intra- and extrahippocampal long-range projections, HS neurons appear to belong to the class of hub cells that play a crucial role in the synchronization of developing networks.

Although there is more resistance to acute seizure-induced cell loss than in the adult brain, both clinical (Baram, 2003Baram T.Z.

Neurol. 1998; 44: 845-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) studies have confirmed that frequent or prolonged seizures lead to long-term impairments in brain development and functional abnormalities. Transient gamma-frequency oscillations (GFOs; >40 Hz) occurring at the onset of most seizures are a marker of a chronic epileptic condition (Worrell et al., 2004Worrell G.A. Parish L. Cranstoun S.D. Jonas R. Baltuch G. Litt B. High-frequency oscillations and seizure generation in neocortical epilepsy.Brain. 2004; 127: 1496-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). GFOs have been proposed to participate in the induction of alterations of immature networks (Khalilov et al., 2005Khalilov I. Le Van Quyen M. Gozlan H. Ben-Ari Y. Epileptogenic actions of GABA and fast oscillations in the developing hippocampus.Neuron. 2005; 48: 787-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These GFOs occur simultaneously in different brain regions, suggesting a wide network-pacing system. Yet, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of GFOs and the control of their spatial synchronization are still unknown. In adult networks, the mechanisms underlying GFO genesis involve synaptic interactions between glutamatergic and GABA neurons, as well as gap junctions (Bartos et al., 2007Bartos M. Vida I. Jonas P. Synaptic mechanisms of synchronized gamma oscillations in inhibitory interneuron networks.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar, Whittington and Traub, 2003Whittington M.A. Traub R.D. Interneuron diversity series: inhibitory interneurons and network oscillations in vitro.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 676-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). At early stages of postnatal development, pyramidal cells are poorly developed, and most function depends upon activation of GABA synapses (Ben-Ari et al., 1997Ben-Ari Y. Khazipov R. Leinekugel X. Caillard O. Gaiarsa J.L. GABAA, NMDA and AMPA receptors: a developmentally regulated ‘ménage à trois’.Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 523-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). In this context, GFO mechanisms may differ from the adult situation and reflect the particular anatomical and functional organization of immature networks (Khalilov et al., 2005Khalilov I. Le Van Quyen M. Gozlan H. Ben-Ari Y. Epileptogenic actions of GABA and fast oscillations in the developing hippocampus.Neuron. 2005; 48: 787-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Hence, our goal was to identify the cellular and network mechanisms underlying the generation and synchronization of GFOs in various conditions during development. We used the intact in vitro septohippocampal preparation, in which various stimuli can be used to trigger epileptiform discharges characterized by GFOs at their onset (Khalilov et al., 2005Khalilov I. Le Van Quyen M. Gozlan H. Ben-Ari Y. Epileptogenic actions of GABA and fast oscillations in the developing hippocampus.Neuron. 2005; 48: 787-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, Quilichini et al., 2002Quilichini P.P.

Neurosci. 2002; 16: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), thus enabling the study of their underlying mechanisms. Field potential recordings performed in the intact septohippocampal formation (SHF) during the first postnatal (P) week (P5–7) in low Mg2+ conditions (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) revealed the presence of transient GFOs (peak frequency: 88 ± 6 Hz; duration: 143 ± 19 ms; n = 46 preparations) at the onset of regularly occurring ictal-like events (ILEs) (Quilichini et al., 2002Quilichini P.P. Diabira D. Chiron C. Ben-Ari Y. Gozlan H. Persistent epileptiform activity induced by low Mg2+ in intact immature brain structures.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A and S1A, available online). GFOs were coordinated throughout the preparation: they occurred simultaneously and were phase locked in the different regions of the hippocampus and in the septum (ϕDG − ϕCA1 = 13.8° ± 17.8°; ϕCA3 − ϕCA1 = 85.4° ± 30.4°; ϕseptum − ϕCA1 = 114.6° ± 31.5°; n = 3; Figure 1B). There is thus a mechanism in the septohippocampal region that is able to transiently synchronize networks in the gamma-frequency range at the initiation of ILEs across quite large distances. Because this mechanism is at least present throughout CA1 (Figure S1B), it was further investigated in this region. Large populations of neurons fire action potentials during GFOs, thus contributing to the field activity (Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1996Chrobak J.J. Buzsáki G. High-frequency oscillations in the output networks of the hippocampal-entorhinal axis of the freely behaving rat.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3056-3066PubMed Google Scholar). We thus determined the firing pattern of different neuronal classes during GFOs. By using cell-attached recordings, we found that CA1 pyramidal cells (n = 10) were either silent (n = 8) or fired a single action potential (n = 2) during GFOs, and CA3 pyramidal cells (n = 10) fired at low rate (<25 Hz) (Figure 2A ). Pyramidal cell always fired after GFO initiation (Figure 2A2). In contrast, all the CA1 interneurons recorded (n = 36; Figure S2), including basket cells (n = 3), O-LM cells (n = 7), and backprojecting cells (n = 4), fired at high frequency exclusively during GFOs, reaching a maximum firing rate of 72 ± 10 Hz (range: 40–100 Hz), i.e., at nearly the same frequency as GFOs (Figure 2B1). Before GFO occurrence, all GABA neurons, except hippocamposeptal (HS) cells, described below, had a low-firing rate (2 ± 2 Hz; range: 0–9 Hz; n = 36), and the transition to high-firing rate during GFOs was abrupt (Figure 2A2). Moreover, their action potentials were phase locked to GFOs, arising preferentially at the descending phase of each cycle (−34.4° ± 80°; R = 0.35; p < 0.001; Rayleigh test; Figure 2B2). These results are in agreement with the initial assumption that interneurons are the main contributors to GFO generation. Accordingly, we found that GFOs depend upon GABAA, but not AMPA, receptor activation (Figure S1C). One type of GABA neuron, the HS cells, showed a different firing pattern. They always fired before GFO onset, with a 10–300 ms time lag (69 ± 35 ms; n = 23), reaching a maximal peak frequency of 96 ± 25 Hz (Figure 3A ). These neurons belonged to the class of long-range projection GABA neurons (Figure 3A2) (Gulyás et al., 2003Gulyás A.I. Hájos N. Katona I. Freund T.F. Interneurons are the local targets of hippocampal inhibitory cells which project to the medial septum.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Morphological analysis revealed that HS cells, although still in an early developmental stage, exhibited an extensive axon arborization in the different CA1 layers along the septotemporal axis, as well as in the septum (Figure 3A2). During development, they are known to contact GABA neurons exclusively (Gulyás et al., 2003Gulyás A.I. Hájos N. Katona I. Freund T.F. Interneurons are the local targets of hippocampal inhibitory cells which project to the medial septum.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because of their early firing, we reasoned that HS cells might have a pivotal role in GFO emergence by synchronizing their target interneurons (i.e., GABA neurons with exclusive local projections) into high-frequency firing, thus generating field GFOs. The firing patterns of the different cell types during GFOs are consistent with this hypothesis. If HS cells play a leading role in synchronizing their targets, we propose the following scheme: (1) a progressive recruitment of HS cells, because transient network events may involve a progressive recruitment of leading cells (de la Prida et al., 2006de la Prida L.M. Huberfeld G. Cohen I. Miles R. Threshold behavior in the initiation of hippocampal population bursts.Neuron. 2006; 49: 131-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar); (2) a depolarizing action of GABA onto interneurons; and (3) a recruitment of the interneurons (with exclusive local projections) by the HS cells. Finally, if a causal link exists between HS firing and GFO emergence, preventing HS cell firing should abolish GFOs. We directly tested these proposals. We first investigated the possibility of a buildup mechanism among interconnected HS cells. We analyzed the firing behavior of eleven HS cell pairs (four reciprocal and seven unidirectional connections; Figures S3A and S3B). Before GFO genesis, HS cell firing started to accelerate at a mean instantaneous frequency of 28 ± 11 Hz until an abrupt transition to high-frequency firing occurred within 150 ± 65 ms before GFO onset (Figure 3B). In keeping with a progressive recruitment of HS cells, there was a regular increase in GABAergic currents received by both HS cells and interneurons (Figure 3B3). Dual recordings revealed that HS cells were connected together and to other GABA neurons (four unidirectional HS to O-LM connections, three HS to O-LM reciprocal connections; Figures S3A and S3B). During the buildup process, the frequency of GABA currents remained low, consistent with the low-frequency firing of HS cells before their transition to high-frequency firing (Figure 3B3). The switch to high-frequency firing of HS cells correlated with the high-frequency GABA currents received by the interneurons (Figure 3B3). Those results are thus in favor of a progressive recruitment of HS cells. We then analyzed the nature of the neurotransmission between HS cells and their targets in normal artificial cerebro-spinal fluid (four reciprocal and seven unidirectional HS pairs, four unidirectional HS to O-LM connections, three HS to O-LM reciprocal connections; Figure S3A and S3B). The neurotransmission was extremely reliable at these synapses (1.0 release probability; n = 25 connections). Intracellular chloride concentration increases in epileptic conditions in the immature brain, rendering GABA strongly excitatory (Dzhala et al., 2010Dzhala V.I. Kuchibhotla K.V. Glykys J.C. Kahle K.T. Swiercz W.B. Feng G. Kuner T. Augustine G.J. Bacskai B.J. Staley K.J. Progressive NKCC1-dependent neuronal chloride accumulation during neonatal seizures.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 11745-11761Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). By using noninvasive measurements of the resting membrane potential and the reversal potential of chloride in different classes of GABA neurons, we found that ECl was 19.1mV ± 1.9mV (n = 6 HS cells, 3 O-LM cells, 1 basket cell, and 2 unidentified interneurons; Figures S3C and S3D) above resting membrane potential (−69.7mV ± 2.8mV; n = 12), indicating a depolarizing action of GABA. We also found that high-frequency stimulation of HS cells evoked action potentials in their target cells (n = 5 SHFs; Figure S3E2b). These results show that HS cell firing can entrain their target neurons, probably via the depolarizing action of GABA. Our next proposal was a recruitment of interneurons by the HS cells. If HS firing entrained these interneurons, then two requirements should be met: (1) high-frequency GABA currents should occur in interneurons before GFOs, because HS cells, which contact interneurons, always fire before GFOs at high frequency; and (2) high-frequency GABA currents should occur in turn after GFO onset in pyramidal cells, because interneurons, which contact pyramidal cells, fire at high frequency during GFOs. Whole-cell recordings of interneurons revealed that large synaptic GABA currents with a high-frequency component always preceded field GFOs (mean: 183 ms; range: 40–450 ms; n = 17; Figure 3C). Because pyramidal cell-projecting interneurons fire at high frequency during GFOs (Figure 2A), pyramidal cells received a high-frequency barrage of GABAergic inputs during GFOs (Figure 3C). The frequency of GABAergic inputs in pyramidal cells (88 ± 17 Hz; n = 9) was similar to the firing frequency of interneurons and to the field GFOs. In contrast, the fast oscillatory component within the glutamatergic drive occurred after the initiation of GFOs in all recorded interneurons (n = 17) and pyramidal cells (n = 9) and had a lower magnitude than GABA currents (Figures 3C2 and 3C3). The analysis of synaptic activity thus reveals a sequential recruitment of the different actors in the network: at first, a population of GABA neurons (interneuron-specific GABA neurons), which contact interneurons, but not pyramidal cells, starts to fire before GFOs. This is consistent with the HS cells' specific targeting and firing pattern. This suggests that GABAergic currents provide the main synaptic drive onto interneurons. In turn, these interneurons fire during GFOs. Pyramidal cells also fire during GFOs, although to a lesser extent. If HS cells play a leading role and are necessary for GFO emergence, preventing their firing should abolish GFOs. To test causality, we used GIN (GFP-expressing inhibitory neurons) mice in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) is expressed via the GAD67 promoter only in somatostatin-containing neurons, including HS cells (Oliva et al., 2000Oliva Jr., A.A. Jiang M. Lam T. Smith K.L. Swann J.W. Novel hippocampal interneuronal subtypes identified using transgenic mice that express green fluorescent protein in GABAergic interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3354-3368PubMed Google Scholar). At P6, most GFP-containing neurons recorded in CA1 stratum oriens were identified post hoc as HS cells (72%; n = 18/25). The 28% that remained were all identified as O-LM cells (n = 7/25). Recordings of GFP-negative interneurons revealed the presence of O-LM cells, but not HS cells (n = 14 O-LM cells and 14 other types of interneurons; data not shown). This suggests that the vast majority of GFP-containing neurons in CA1 stratum oriens at P6 are HS cells (Figure S4A) and that many O-LM cells do not express GFP at this age. GFOs, cell-firing patterns, and synaptic inputs in GIN mice had properties similar to those found in rats (Figures 4A and S4B). We also used this preparation to test other models of acute seizures: high K+, kainic acid, and 4-AP. In all three models, GFOs (96 ± 7 Hz; range: 40–180 Hz; n = 22) were present at seizure onset, HS cells (115 ± 14 Hz; range: 40–208 Hz; n = 13) started to fire before the GFOs (mean time lag: −105 ± 19 ms), and the interneurons generated spikes only during the GFOs (81 ± 11 Hz; range: 34–117 Hz; n = 9, including 8 OLM cells and 1 backprojecting cell; Figures S4C–S4E). Whole-cell recordings of interneurons also showed large GABA synaptic currents preceding GFOs (102 ± 31 ms; range: 35–210 ms; n = 5; data not shown). These features are similar to the ones obtained in low Mg2+ conditions, demonstrating the generality of the mechanism involved in triggering GFOs at ILE onset at this stage of development. Because the disappearance of a critical number of long-range projection neurons disrupts long-range synchrony (Dyhrfjeld-Johnsen et al., 2007Dyhrfjeld-Johnsen J. Santhakumar V. Morgan R.J. Huerta R. Tsimring L. Soltesz I. Topological determinants of epileptogenesis in large-scale structural and functional models of the dentate gyrus derived from experimental data.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 1566-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), we eliminated stratum oriens GFP-positive cells successively along the septotemporal axis by using focused fluorescence illumination (Figure 4D; n = 8 SHFs). The elimination of between 10 and 20 GFP-positive cells (n = 8 SHFs) was sufficient to abolish GFOs without affecting the occurrence of ILEs (Figures 4A and 4B). The network structure and function did not appear damaged by this procedure: GFP-negative cells within the illuminated area and GFP-positive cells outside the illuminated area did not display apparent morphological damage (Figure 4D), and ILEs were still present (Figure 4B). The disappearance of GFOs could result from the loss of the trigger (HS cells) and/or the generator (interneurons). Because only a fraction of O-LM cells (GFP positive) were removed from the circuitry, and all the other generators (including GFP-negative O-LM and basket cells) were not affected, GFO disappearance most likely results from the loss of a critical mass of HS cells (Figure 4D). Accordingly, the elimination of up to 50 GFP-negative interneurons (n = 4 SHFs) did not affect the occurrence of GFOs at ILE onset (Figures 4E and 4F). Finally, while recording from pairs of HS cells, we generated simultaneous trains of action potentials at 100 Hz in each pair. This was not sufficient to entrain the system to produce field GFOs, in keeping with the proposal that a critical mass of HS cells needs to be recruited. In this study, we have shown in the immature SHF that (1) field GFOs are present at ILE onset; (2) long-range projection HS cells start to fire at high frequency before field GFOs; (3) all the interneuron types recorded fire in turn high-frequency action potentials arising preferentially at the descending phase of the GFOs; and (4) GFOs are abolished after the elimination of a small number of HS cells. Taken together, we propose that HS cells, via their target-selective excitatory GABA synapses and their extensive axonal projections, provide the necessary fast conduit for synchronizing the hippocampal interneurons into transient high-frequency firing, leading to GFO emergence at the onset of epileptiform discharges. The mechanisms that underlie GFOs in epileptogenic conditions at early stages of development contrast with those arising in physiological conditions. Several observations suggest that spontaneous GFOs are not present in developing networks. In rat pups, high-frequency (120–180 Hz) oscillations are observed in vivo in the hippocampus after the end of the second postnatal week (Buhl and Buzsáki, 2005Buhl D.L. Buzsáki G. Developmental emergence of hippocampal fast-field “ripple” oscillations in the behaving rat pups.Neuroscience. 2005; 134: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, various in vitro GFO-generating procedures or agents, such as bath application of the ACh receptor agonist carbachol of intact cortex of newborn rats (Kilb and Luhmann, 2003Kilb W. Luhmann H.J. Carbachol-induced network oscillations in the intact cerebral cortex of the newborn rat.Cereb.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2699-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), failed to generate GFOs during the first postnatal week. Because physiological GFOs are largely driven by glutamate in mature networks (Bartos et al., 2007Bartos M. Vida I. Jonas P.

Interneuron diversity series: inhibitory interneurons and network oscillations in vitro.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 676-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), these observations are consistent with the delayed maturation of glutamatergic synapses shown in a wide range of brain structures (Gozlan and Ben-Ari, 2003Gozlan H. Ben-Ari Y. Interneurons are the source and the targets of the first synapses formed in the rat developing hippocampal circuit.Cereb. Cortex. 2003; 13: 684-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As suggested previously (Traub et al., 1998Traub R.D. Spruston N. Soltesz I. Konnerth A. Whittington M.A. Jefferys G.R. Gamma-frequency oscillations: a neuronal population phenomenon, regulated by synaptic and intrinsic cellular processes, and inducing synaptic plasticity.Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 55: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), developing networks would lack the critical density of functional glutamatergic synapses required for these oscillatory activities. However, GFOs can emerge in epileptogenic conditions, signaling a pathological state. We showed that AMPA receptor activation is not necessary for GFO expression, and the glutamatergic drive always follows the GABAergic one in all neuron types. This is also consistent with other findings showing that synchronization of GABA neurons can occur in the absence of fast glutamatergic signaling via depolarizing GABA (Avoli and Perreault, 1987Avoli M.

Wong R.K. Excitatory synaptic responses mediated by GABAA receptors in the hippocampus.Science. 1991; 253: 1420-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this is also in agreement with the tetanic model of GFOs that displays comparable GABA mechanisms to the low Mg2+ model (Fujiwara-Tsukamoto et al., 2006Fujiwara-Tsukamoto Y. Isomura Y. Takada M. Comparable GABAergic mechanisms of hippocampal seizurelike activity in posttetanic and low-Mg2+ conditions.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 2013-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), because it also requires a depolarizing GABA action (Köhling et al., 2000Köhling R. Vreugdenhil M. Bracci E. Jefferys J.G. Ictal epileptiform activity is facilitated by hippocampal GABAA receptor-mediated oscillations.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6820-6829PubMed Google Scholar), which is due to intracellular chloride accumulation during recurrent seizures (Dzhala et al., 2010Dzhala V.I. Kuchibhotla K.V. Glykys J.C.

Although very high-frequency oscillations (HFOs in the ripples: 140–200 Hz; fast ripples: 200–500 Hz) can be recorded in adult epileptic networks in vitro (Khosravani et al., 2005Khosravani H.

High-frequency oscillations during human focal seizures.Brain. 2006; 129: 1593-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), the GFOs recorded in our conditions never reached such frequencies during the first postnatal week, probably reflecting the immature stage of development (Buhl and Buzsáki, 2005Buhl D.L. Buzsáki G. Developmental emergence of hippocampal fast-field “ripple” oscillations in the behaving rat pups.Neuroscience. 2005; 134: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that recurrent glutamatergic synaptic transmission (Dzhala and Staley, 2004Dzhala V.I. Staley K.J. Mechanisms of fast ripples in the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8896-8906Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and pyramidal axoaxonic gap junctions (Traub et al., 2002Traub R.D. Draguhn A. Whittington M.A. Baldeweg T. Bibbig A. Buhl E.H. Schmitz D. Axonal gap junctions between principal neurons: a novel source of network oscillations, and perhaps epileptogenesis.Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 13: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) are instrumental in the generation of HFOs in the adult brain. This implies that these additional mechanisms are not yet fully functional. Nevertheless, the immature hippocampus has already reached a sufficient level of organization to generate GFOs (40–100 Hz) under epileptogenic conditions. Collectively, our results provide strong support for the concept that, in different epileptogenic conditions at early stages of development, long-range projection neurons can trigger the high-frequency firing of interneurons with exclusive local connectivity, which leads to the emergence of GFOs. Although most of HS cells continued to fire at high frequency during GFOs, thus contributing to their expression, their main impact appears to be in coordinating the activity of their targets. In the adult brain, long-range projection neurons, which can contact both pyramidal cells and interneurons (Jinno et al., 2007Jinno S. Klausberger T. Marton L.F. Dalezios Y. Roberts J.D. Fuentealba P. Bushong E.A. Henze D. Buzsáki G. Somogyi P. Neuronal diversity in GABAergic long-range projections from the hippocampus.J.

Types and synaptic connections of hippocampal inhibitory neurons reciprocally connected with the medial septum.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 148-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), may fulfill the role of synchronizing elements (Tort et al., 2007Tort A.B. Rotstein H.G. Dugladze T. Gloveli T. Kopell N.J. On the formation of gamma-coherent cell assemblies by oriens lacunosum-moleculare interneurons in the hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 13490-13495Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In our conditions, HS cells do not appear to functionally contact pyramidal cells, because GABAergic currents should have occurred simultaneously in pyramidal cells and interneurons. Whether this discrepancy reflects a maturation process of these neurons and/or the existence of different classes of long-range projection neurons (Jinno et al., 2007Jinno S. Klausberger T. Marton L.F. Dalezios Y. Roberts J.D. Fuentealba P. Bushong E.A. Henze D. Buzsáki G. Somogyi P. Neuronal diversity in GABAergic long-range projections from the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8790-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) remains to be determined. Interestingly, GFP expression in GIN mice is driven via the GAD67 promoter. GAD67 expression is developmentally regulated and is lower at the end of the first postnatal week as compared to adults (Jiang et al., 2001Jiang M. Oliva Jr., A.A. Lam T. Swann J.W. GABAergic neurons that pioneer hippocampal area CA1 of the mouse: morphologic features and multiple fates.J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 439: 176-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Hence, at P6, GFP-negative neurons might include immature somatostatin-containing neurons (in which GAD67 expression is still low and would increase later in development) in addition to SST-negative neurons. This also suggests that HS cells, which form the vast majority of GFP-positive neurons, already display at P6 features of mature neurons, as compared to other future somatostatin-containing interneurons. We show here that these long-range projection neurons play a key role in triggering network synchronization and GFO expression. Interestingly, some “connector hub neurons” described in immature mouse hippocampal slices also show an extended axonal arborization (within the hippocampus), a similar coactivation (built up of synchronization) before the onset of network activity (giant depolarizing potentials), and orchestration of spontaneous network synchronization (Bonifazi et al., 2009Bonifazi P. Goldin M. Picardo M.A. Jorquera I. Cattani A. Bianconi G. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Cossart R. GABAergic hub neurons orchestrate synchrony in developing hippocampal networks.Science. 2009; 326: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Besides, early-generated GABA hub neurons preferentially express somatostatin and were recently proposed to develop into GABA projection neurons (Picardo et al., 2011Picardo M.A. Guigue P. Bonifazi P. Batista-Brito R. Allene C. Ribas A. Fishell G. Baude A. Cossart R. Pioneer GABA cells comprise a subpopulation of hub neurons in the developing hippocampus.Neuron. 2011; 71: 695-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that GABA neurons displaying long-range axonal arborization which extends the outside of the hippocampus would carry such a hub function and would support the emergence of network oscillations (Buzsáki et al., 2004Buzsáki G. Geisler C. Henze D.A. Wang X.J. Interneuron Diversity series: Circuit complexity and axon wiring economy of cortical interneurons.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 186-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Thus, HS cells are likely to belong to this class of hub neurons and to form such a hub network that is critical for broad network synchronization during development. In keeping with such an assumption, the elimination of some HS cells abolished GFOs, but not the ILEs themselves. Altogether, our results have two major implications. (1) In contrast to adult networks (Jirsch et al., 2006Jirsch J.D. Urrestarazu E. LeVan P. Olivier A. Dubeau F. Gotman J. High-frequency oscillations during human focal seizures.Brain. 2006; 129: 1593-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, Steriade and Demetrescu, 1966Steriade M. Demetrescu M.

Neurophysiol. 1966; 20: 576-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and with the caveat that we used an in vitro acute model of epilepsy, we propose that GFOs may not be causally linked to seizure genesis at early stages of development. They would sign the activity of a network before its transition to the ictal discharge. (2) Few hub-like GABA neurons, i.e., HS cells, are able to synchronize wide-reaching, large neuronal populations that enable GFOs to emerge, a phenomenon that may also be valid in physiological conditions. Intact septohippocampal formations were prepared from 5- to 7-day-old rats and GIN mice. Extracellular, cell-attached, and voltage-clamp whole-cell recordings were performed at 33°C from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons. GFOs were quantified using wavelet time-frequency analysis. GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic currents were measured at +10mV and −60mV, respectively. Resting membrane potential and the reversal potential of GABAergic currents were measured using single NMDA and GABAA receptor-channel recordings in the cell-attached configuration. Synaptic connections between cells were determined by making one cell fire an action potential and by detecting the presence of a postsynaptic GABA current in the second cell. Ablation of GFP-containing neurons was obtained after 5-min-long high-power fluorescence focused through a 60× objective. All recorded cells were filled with biocytin for post hoc morphological identification. They were reconstructed using the Neurolucida system. Immunohistochemical labelings for GFP- and somatostatin-containing neurons were performed by using polyclonal antisera directed against GFP and somatostatin, respectively.

However, the underlying mechanism of ADAM15-mediated tumor suppression is not clearly understood. This study demonstrates that ADAM15 is released as an exosomal component, and ADAM15 exosomes exert tumor suppressive activities. We found that exosomal ADAM15 release is stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a typical protein kinase C activator, in various tumor cell types, and this results in a corresponding decrease in plasma membrane-associated ADAM15. Exosomes rich in ADAM15 display enhanced binding affinity for integrin αvβ3 in an RGD-dependent manner and suppress vitronectin- and fibronectin-induced cell adhesion, growth, and migration, as well as in vivo tumor growth. Exosomal ADAM15 is released from human macrophages, and macrophage-derived ADAM15 exosomes have tumor inhibitory effects.

We investigated the roles of human Hsp105α, the constitutively expressed isoform, in the biogenesis and quality control of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Hsp105 facilitates CFTR quality control at an early stage in its biosynthesis but promotes CFTR post-translational folding. Deletion of Phe-508 (ΔF508), the most prevalent mutation causing cystic fibrosis, interferes with de novo folding of CFTR, impairing its export from the ER and accelerating its clearance in the ER and post-Golgi compartments. We show that Hsp105 preferentially associates with and stabilizes ΔF508 CFTR at both levels. Introduction of the Hsp105 substrate binding domain potently increases the steady state level of ΔF508 CFTR by reducing its early-stage degradation. This in turn dramatically enhances ΔF508 CFTR cell surface functional expression in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells. Although other Hsc70 nucleotide exchange factors such as HspBP1 and BAG-2 inhibit CFTR post-translational degradation in the ER through cochaperone CHIP, Hsp105 has a primary role promoting CFTR quality control at an earlier stage. The Hsp105-mediated multilevel regulation of ΔF508 CFTR folding and quality control provides new opportunities to understand how chaperone machinery regulates the homeostasis and functional expression of misfolded proteins in the cell. Future studies in this direction will inform therapeutics development for cystic fibrosis and other protein misfolding diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2084714593,"The biochemical means through which multiple signaling pathways are integrated in navigating axons is poorly understood. Semaphorins are among the largest families of axon guidance cues and utilize Plexin (Plex) receptors to exert repulsive effects on axon extension. However, Semaphorin repulsion can be silenced by other distinct cues and signaling cascades, raising questions of the logic underlying these events. We now uncover a simple biochemical switch that controls Semaphorin/Plexin repulsive guidance. Plexins are Ras/Rap family GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and we find that the PlexA GAP domain is phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). This PlexA phosphorylation generates a specific binding site for 14-3-3ε, a phospho-binding protein that we find to be necessary for axon guidance. These PKA-mediated Plexin-14-3-3ε interactions prevent PlexA from interacting with its Ras family GTPase substrate and antagonize Semaphorin repulsion. Our results indicate that these interactions switch repulsion to adhesion and identify a point of convergence for multiple guidance molecules."

The RDX-degrading P450 enzyme XplA is an unusual member of the P450 enzyme superfamily. The P450s are monooxygenase enzymes that catalyze reductive scission of dioxygen bound to their heme b cofactor and generally source electrons required from NAD(P)H with delivery via one or more redox partner systems (16Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. Schlichting I. Structure and chemistry of cytochrome P450.Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2253-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). In bacterial P450 systems, these are often soluble NAD(P)H-dependent ferredoxin reductase and iron-sulfur ferredoxin proteins. This is a so-called class I P450 redox system, analogous to the adrenodoxin reductase/adrenodoxin system responsible for driving steroidogenic P450s in eukaryotic mitochondria (17Munro A.W.

Biological variations of electron transport chains.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 330-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). However, the majority of mammalian and other eukaryotic P450s receive electrons from the diflavin enzyme NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in a membrane-associated class II redox system (16Denisov I.G.

Recent years have seen recognition of a wider diversity of redox systems driving P450 enzymes, including the well characterized Bacillus megaterium P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) fatty acid hydroxylase, a soluble P450-NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase fusion enzyme (18Hannemann F.

XplA receives electrons from a NADPH-dependent flavoprotein reductase (XplB) encoded by the xplB gene immediately upstream of xplA on the R. rhodochrous strain 11Y genome (23Seth-Smith H.M.

Reductive denitration of RDX nitro groups was observed in turnover studies performed using the XplA/XplB combination. Similar outcomes were observed whether the reaction was done anaerobically or aerobically, with nitrite, formaldehyde, and methylenedinitramine detected under anaerobic conditions and 4-nitro-2,4-diazabutanal (not methylenedinitramine) formed aerobically. P450-mediated oxidation was not considered to be responsible for differences observed (21Jackson R.G. Rylott E.L. Fournier D. Hawari J. Bruce N.C.

This was consistent with previous studies of RDX biotransformation in whole cells of Rhodococcus sp. strain DN22 cells and by mammalian CYP2B4 and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in vitro. The authors of this study concluded that monooxygenation of RDX was unlikely and that nitro group reduction by P450s occurs (25Bhushan B. Trott S. Spain J.C. Halasz A. Paquet L. Hawari J.

Studies using 18O2 and H218O also demonstrated that a labeled oxygen was incorporated into 4-nitro-2,4-diazabutanal product only from H218O, apparently ruling out redox partner-dependent P450 heme iron-mediated oxygen insertion chemistry from either CYP2B4 or the Rhodococcus (XplA) P450 (25Bhushan B.

This conclusion is also consistent with the observation that a phylogenetically conserved cytochrome P450 Ser/Thr residue that participates in oxygen activation is absent in XplA (1Rylott E.L.

These reveal several peculiar features, including unusually weak binding of FMN to the XplA flavodoxin module, high affinity of the P450 heme for imidazole (and Tris) that bind weakly to most P450s, and a very positive heme iron reduction potential. Our data reveal several non-standard properties for a P450 system adapted as a reductive (rather than an oxidative) catalyst. The xplA gene construct was codon-optimized for E. coli and synthesized (Entelechon, GmbH) and cloned into the expression vector pET15b (Novagen) using NdeI and BamHI sites placed at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene, respectively. The gene also encodes a His6 tag at the N-terminal end of XplA (supplemental Fig. S1). The expression plasmid pET15b(xplA) was transformed into HMS174 (DE3) (Novagen) cells. Conditions used for cell growth and protein expression were 37 °C in 1-liter cultures of LB medium (ForMedium, Hunstanton, UK), until A600 reached ∼0.6–0.8. At this point, the temperature was lowered to 20 °C, and cells were allowed to equilibrate prior to induction of xplA expression by the addition of 100 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and cell growth for a further 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C) using a Beckman JLA8.1 rotor. The cell pellet was washed in ice-cold 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2) and 1 mm EDTA buffer and stored frozen at −20 °C. The frozen pellet was thawed in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 250 mm KCl, 10% glycerol (buffer A) with 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), lysozyme (10 μg/ml), and DNase (10 μg/ml). Cells were lysed by sonication with 15-s bursts, at 50-s intervals and 40% amplitude for 30 min using a Bandelin SONOPULS sonicator. Temperature was kept at <10 °C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 22,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded directly onto a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with five column volumes of buffer A, followed by five column volumes of buffer A with 20 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted using a one-step gradient with 100 mm imidazole in buffer A. Alternatively, the column was washed in 5 mm histidine in buffer A prior to elution using 100 mm histidine. The partially purified XplA protein was concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration device with a 30,000 molecular weight cut-off and subsequently diluted with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2) and 1 mm EDTA. It was then dialyzed against 2 liters of the same buffer with four changes of buffer. Dialyzed protein was filtered using a 0.22-μm filter and concentrated using Vivaspin 20-ml concentrators (30,000 molecular weight cut-off; Generon) to a ∼500-μl final volume. Concentrated protein was loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column (24 ml, flow rate 0.5 ml/min) equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) (buffer B), collecting 0.5-ml fractions. Fractions containing XplA were analyzed for purity with SDS-PAGE and by their A418/A280 ratio. The purest fractions were pooled and concentrated using Vivaspin 20-ml concentrators to ∼1 ml and dialyzed against buffer B plus 50% glycerol prior to storage at −80 °C. To generate a plasmid construct expressing the XplA heme domain (XplA-HD, residues 159–552 of XplA), an NdeI restriction site was engineered in the linker region separating the FMN and heme domains. To achieve this, XplA-HD was generated by first using oligonucleotide primers XplA-HDF (5′-GTCGTGGTGGTCACCATATGACTGCGGCCTC-3′) and XplA-HDR (5′-GAGGCCGCAGTCATATGGTGACCACCACGAC-3′), where non-complementary nucleotides introduced are in boldface type and the new site generated for restriction enzyme NdeI is underlined. The mutagenesis PCR experiment was done using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmids from resulting transformants were sequenced to confirm the desired mutation and digested with NdeI to excise the FMN domain. The digestion products were run on a 0.8% agarose gel to separate plasmid and excised fragment. The plasmid was extracted and purified from the gel using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and religated to make the pET15b(xplA-HD) construct, with gene sequencing as before to confirm correct clones. pET15b(xplA-HD) was subsequently transformed into HMS174 (DE3) cells, and the XplA-HD was expressed and purified as done for intact XplA. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary UV-50 Bio UV-visible scanning spectrophotometer (Varian) using 1-cm path length quartz cells. Unless otherwise stated, spectra were recorded using ∼5–10 μm enzyme in 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.2) (buffer C). The concentration of the XplA was initially determined using the method of Omura and Sato (28Omura T. Sato R. The Carbon Monoxide-binding Pigment of Liver Microsomes. I. Evidence for Its Hemoprotein Nature.J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using an extinction coefficient of ϵ450–490 = 91 mm−1 cm−1 in the reduced CO-bound minus reduced absorption difference spectrum. CO binding to XplA was performed by reduction with a few grains of solid sodium dithionite (DT), followed by slow bubbling of CO into the reaction mixture. Spectral data for the XplA complex with β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) were collected in 50 mm potassium phosphate (KPi) at pH values from 6 to 8. Optical titrations to determine Kd values for XplA ligands were carried out at 20 °C with ligands solubilized in appropriate solvents. Spectra were recorded (250–800 nm) after each addition of the ligand. RDX substrate, trinitrobenzene (TNB) and polycyclic azole drugs were solubilized in DMSO. Dithiothreitol (DTT) and β-ME were solubilized in buffer C. 4-Phenylimidazole (4-PIM) solutions were in 50% ethanol, buffer C mixtures. Unless otherwise stated, other ligands used were prepared in buffer C, and binding titrations were done in the same buffer. Following completion of titrations, difference spectra were generated by subtraction of the ligand-free spectrum from those generated at each point in the titration. The Kd values were determined by fitting the data for the ligand-induced absorption change (normally peak minus trough data, using the same wavelength pair for each difference spectrum in a particular titration) versus ligand concentration using either a standard (Michaelis-Menten) hyperbolic function or a quadratic function (Equation 1) for tight binding ligands, using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Aobs=(Amax2Et)×(S+Et+Kd)−(((S+Et+Kd)2−(4×S×Et))0.5)(Eq. 1) In Equation 1, Aobs is the observed absorbance change at ligand concentration S, Amax is the absorbance change at ligand saturation, Et is the XplA concentration, and Kd is the dissociation constant for the XplA-ligand complex. In studies to determine the Kd value for TNB, the apparent Kd value for the competitive binding of RDX (which induces a large optical shift upon binding XplA) was determined at three different concentrations of TNB (250 μm, 500 μm, and 1 mm), and data were fitted using Equation 1. The Kd for TNB was then determined using Equation 2. Ki=Kd×[TNB]Kd(app)−Kd(Eq. 2) In Equation 2, Kd is the dissociation constant for RDX determined in the absence of TNB, [TNB] is the concentration of TNB used in the relevant titration with RDX, Kd(app) is the apparent Kd for RDX at the given [TNB], and Ki is the Kd value for TNB. The Kd reported for TNB is then the statistical average of the Ki values determined at the three different TNB concentrations. Intact XplA and XplA-HD protein samples for MALLS (5 μm) were in 50 mm KPi, 300 mm KCl (pH 7.5). Buffer was filtered and degassed immediately before experiments. A 500-μl sample was run on a size exclusion chromatography column (S-200) using a flow rate of 0.71 ml/min. The eluent passed through a DAWN-EOS MALS spectrometer (Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA) detector with an Optilab rEX refractometer (Wyatt Technologies) and a quasielastic light scattering detector (Wyatt) to measure the refractive index and the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) values, respectively. The average molecular mass was calculated using ASTRA version 5.21 (Wyatt) and was derived using a Zimm fitting procedure (29Kammera F.V. Baborowski M. Friese K.

To determine the XplA heme iron Fe3+/Fe2+, FMN oxidized/semiquinone (OX/SQ), and FMN semiquinone/hydroquinone (SQ/HQ) midpoint reduction potentials, redox titrations were performed in an anaerobic glove box (Belle Technology, Weymouth, UK) under a nitrogen atmosphere with O2 levels maintained at less than 2 ppm. All solutions were deoxygenated by sparging with nitrogen gas. Data fitting and analysis were done as described previously (30Dutton P.L. Redox potentiometry.

EPR spectra for the ligand-free and RDX-, DTT-, 4-PIM-, and TNB-bound forms of XplA (300 μm ligand in each case) were recorded on a Bruker ER-300D series electromagnet with microwave source interfaced with a Bruker EMX control unit and fitted with an ESR-9 liquid helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments) and a dual mode microwave cavity from Bruker (ER-4116DM). Spectra were recorded at 10 K with a microwave power of 2.08 milliwatts and modulation amplitude of 1 millitesla. Oxidized XplA (300 μm) was prepared in 50 mm HEPES plus 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5.

https://openalex.org/W2094989474,"The Gp59 protein of bacteriophage T4 plays critical roles in recombination-dependent DNA replication and repair by correctly loading the replicative helicase, Gp41, onto recombination intermediates. Previous work demonstrated that Gp59 is required to load helicase onto single-stranded DNA that is saturated with Gp32, the T4 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein. Gp59 and Gp32 bind simultaneously to ssDNA, forming a Gp59-Gp32-ssDNA complex that is a key intermediate in helicase loading. Here we characterize the assembly and dynamics of this helicase loading complex (HLC) through changes in the fluorescent states of Gp32F, a fluorescein-Gp32 conjugate. Results show that HLC formation requires a minimum Gp32-ssDNA cluster size and that Gp59 co-localizes with Gp32-ssDNA clusters in the presence of excess free ssDNA. These and other results indicate that Gp59 targets helicase assembly onto Gp32-ssDNA clusters that form on the displaced strand of D-loops, which suggests a mechanism for the rapid initiation of recombination-dependent DNA replication. Helicase loading at the HLC requires ATP binding (not hydrolysis) by Gp41 and results in local remodeling of Gp32 within the HLC. Subsequent ATPase-driven translocation of Gp41 progressively disrupts Gp32-ssDNA interactions. Evidence suggests that Gp59 from the HLC is recycled to promote multiple rounds of helicase assembly on Gp32-ssDNA, a capability that could be important for the restart of stalled replication forks."
