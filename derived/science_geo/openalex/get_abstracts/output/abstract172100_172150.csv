https://openalex.org/W2128158693,"We have studied activation by phorbol derivatives of TRPV4 channels, the human VRL-2, and murine TRP12 channels, which are highly homologous to the human VR-OAC, and the human and murine OTRPC4 channel. 4α-Phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4α-PDD) induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, in 1321N1 cells stably transfected with human VRL-2 (hVRL-2.1321N1) or HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with murine TRP12, but not in nontransfected or mock-transfected cells. Concomitantly with the increase in [Ca2+]i, 4α-PDD activated an outwardly rectifying cation channel with an Eisenman IV permeation sequence for monovalent cations that is Ca2+-permeable withPCa/PNa = 5.8. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also induced an increase in [Ca2+]i but was ∼50 times less effective than 4α-PDD. EC50 for Ca2+ increase and current activation was nearly identical (pEC50 ∼ 6.7). Similar effects were observed in freshly isolated mouse aorta endothelial cells which express TRP12 endogenously. By using 4α-PDD as a tool to stimulate TRP12, we showed that activation of this channel is modulated by [Ca2+]i; an increase in [Ca2+]i inhibits the channel with an IC50 of 406 nm. Ruthenium Red at a concentration of 1 μm completely blocks inward currents at −80 mV but has a smaller effect on outward currents likely indicating a voltage dependent channel block. We concluded that the phorbol derivatives activate TRPV4 (VR-OAC, VRL-2, OTRPC4, TRP12) independently from protein kinase C, in a manner consistent with direct agonist gating of the channel.

We concluded that the phorbol derivatives activate TRPV4 (VR-OAC, VRL-2, OTRPC4, TRP12) independently from protein kinase C, in a manner consistent with direct agonist gating of the channel. The TRPV subfamily of transient receptor potential cation channels (for a unified nomenclature, see Ref. 1.Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) consists of members with completely different mechanisms of gating. Proteins of this subfamily contain typically three to six ankyrin repeats in the N terminus and six transmembrane segments with a pore region between segments 5 and 6. The first identified nonmammalian member of this subfamily, theCaenorhabditis elegans OSM-9 channel, is activated by changes in osmolarity (2.Colbert H.A. Smith T.L. Bargmann C.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8259-8269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second protein identified in the TRPV family is the mammalian vanilloid receptor channel VR1, which is activated by vanilloid compounds such as capsaicin, pepper, hot chili, moderate heat, or protons (3.Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7050) Google Scholar). Unlike VR1, another close relative of this channel, VRL-1, is constitutively activated by growth factors (4.Kanzaki M. Zhang Y.Q. Mashima H. Li L. Shibata H. Kojima I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) or by noxious heat (5.Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Other members of this family are mechano-sensitive, such as the stretch-inactivated channel SIC, which seems to be gated by cell shrinkage (6.Suzuki M. Sato J. Kutsuwada K. Ooki G. Imai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6330-6335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, the highly Ca2+-selective ECaC1 (CaT2) and ECaC2 (CaT1) channels are down-regulated by intracellular Ca2+ and have been reported to be gated by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (7.Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We have studied, in the present report, the gating properties of yet another cation channel with a moderate Ca2+ permeability, TRPV4 (also known as OTRPC4, VR-OAC, or TRP12), which senses changes in cell volume (8.Wissenbach U. Bodding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 9.Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat.

In addition, we show that these phorbol esters activate a current in mouse aorta endothelial cells, which endogenously express TRP12 (8.Wissenbach U. Bodding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), which is identical to that in cells expressing recombinant TRP12. These novel findings may catalyze the search for an endogenous activator of this Ca2+-permeable TRPV channel and provide a reliable tool to study functional effects of TRPV stimulation. At the amino acid level, VRL-2 is 100% identical to hOTRPC4 (GenBankTM accession number AF258465) and differs in only one amino acid with the human hVROAC (GenBankTMaccession number AF263523). 1321N1 astrocytoma cells, stably transfected with VRL-2, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) human serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 2 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidity controlled incubator with 10% CO2. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis suggested that there was no expression of VRL-2 in wild type 1321N1 cells. We used the recombinant bicistronic expression plasmid pdiTRP12, which carries the entire protein coding region for TRP12 and the green fluorescent protein, GFP (8.Wissenbach U. Bodding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), for transient transfection. Human embryonic kidney cells, HEK-293, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) human serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 2 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidity-controlled incubator with 10% CO2. HEK-293 cells, transiently transfected with the above described vector, were visually identified in the patch clamp set up. GFP was excited at a wavelength between 425 and 475 nm. The emitted light was passed via a 495 nm dichroic mirror through a 500 nm long-pass filter. The TRP12-expressing cells were identified by their green fluorescence. Nontransfected cells from the same batch were used as controls. The “primary explant technique” was used to study freshly isolated endothelial cells from mouse aorta. This method is described in detail elsewhere (12.Suh S.H. Vennekens R. Manolopoulos V.G. Freichel M. Schweig U. Prenen J. Flockerzi V. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). As a reference we used the endothelial cell line EA.hyb926 (14.Edgell C.J. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), which does not respond to TRP12 activation. These cells were cultured as described elsewhere (15.Haburcak M. Wei L. Viana F. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16.Viana F. de Smedt H. Droogmans G. Nilius B.

For electrophysiological measurements, the standard extracellular solution contained (in mm): 150 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.5 or 5 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, buffered at pH 7.4 with NaOH. The osmolality of this solution, as measured with a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor 5500, Schlag, Gladbach, Germany), was 320 ± 5 mosmol. To compare volume-activated currents with 4α-PDD activated currents, we used a solution containing (in mm): 110 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 95 mannitol, buffered pH 7.4 with NaOH. The normal hypotonic stimulation (HTS) 1The abbreviations used are: HTShypotonic stimulationα4-PDD4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoateFfaradPKCprotein kinase CPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateRTXresiniferatoxin12-HPETE12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acidMAECmouse aorta endothelial cellsGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)RRRuthenium Redwas done by superfusion of the cells with this solution but without mannitol (240 mosmol, 25% reduction of osmolarity). Pipette solution was composed of (in mm): 20 CsCl, 100 cesium aspartate, 1 MgCl2, 4 Na2ATP, 0.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. If indicated, [Ca2+]iwas buffered in the presence of 10 mm BAPTA to 1 nm or respective intracellular concentrations. 4α-Phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4α-PDD), a non-PKC-activating phorbol ester, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, both from Sigma) were applied at concentrations between 10 nm and 30 μm from 30 mm stock solutions in ethanol. Ruthenium Red (Fluka) was used at a concentration of 1 μm. Resiniferatoxin (RTX, Sigma) and capsaicin (Sigma) were used in concentrations of 100, 500, and 1000 nm from a stock solution of 1 mm in ethanol. Capsazepine (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 10 μm. 12-HPETE (12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, Sigma) was used at a concentration of 10 μm in the pipette solution. Extra- and intracellular solutions contained Cs+salts to inhibit K+ currents, which are present in a few, but not all, HEK cells. For changes in acid load, we have omitted NaOH, which resulted in a pH of the HEPES-buffered solution of 5.5.

Patch electrodes had a DC resistance between 2 and 4 MΩ. An Ag-AgCl wire was used as a reference electrode. Capacitance and access resistances were monitored continuously. Between 50 and 70% of the series resistance was electronically compensated to minimize voltage errors. If not mentioned otherwise, we have applied one of two ramp protocols. (a) A protocol consisting of a voltage step to −100 mV for 20 ms followed by a 180-ms linear ramp to +100 mV, sampling interval: 0.1 ms. This protocol was repeated every 5 or 10 s. (b) A ramp protocol from −150 to +100 mV, lasting 400 ms and repeated every 5 s, sampling interval 0.8 ms. Time courses of the whole-cell current and current densities were obtained by averaging the current in a narrow window around −80 mV during the voltage ramp protocol. Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were monitored using FLIPRTM (Molecular Devices, Wokingham, UK) as described previously (17.Smart D. Gunthorpe M.J. Jerman J.C. Nasir S. Gray J. Muir A.I. Chambers J.K. Randall A.D. Davis J.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Briefly, hVRL-2.1321N1 cells, seeded into 96-well plates (25,000 cells per well), were incubated with culture medium containing the cytoplasmic Ca2+ indicator, Fluo-3 (4 μm; Teflabs, Austin, TX) at 25 °C for 120 min. The cells were then washed four times with Tyrode medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, before being incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with either Tyrode alone (control) or Tyrode containing various antagonists. The plates were then placed into a FLIPRTM to monitor cell fluorescence (λex = 488 nm, λEM = 540 nm) (18.Jerman J.C. Brough S.J. Prinjha R. Harries M.H. Davis J.B. Smart D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) before and after the addition of various agonists. Responses were measured as peak minus basal fluorescence intensity and where appropriate expressed as a percentage of a maximum carbachol-induced response. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. unless otherwise stated. Curve fitting and parameter estimation were carried out using GraphPad Prism 3.00 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Statistical comparisons were made where appropriate using Student's t test. For [Ca2+]i measurements combined with patch clamp, single cells were loaded with 100 μm Fura-II-potassium salt. The dye was excited alternately at wavelengths of 360 and 390 nm through a filter wheel rotating at 2 cycles/second. The fluorescence was measured at 510 nm and corrected for autofluorescence, measured from the cell-free background. Apparent free [Ca2+] was calculated from the fluorescence ratio R by [Ca2+]i = Keff(R − R0)/(R1− R), where Keff is the effective binding constant, R0 the fluorescence ratio at zero Ca2+, and R1 that at high Ca2+. These calibration constants were determined experimentally for the given set-up and the actual experimental conditions used. Electrophysiological data were analyzed using the WinASCD software (G. Droogmans, Leuven, Belgium). Pooled data are given as means ± S.E. from n cells. Significance was tested using Student's paired t test (p < 0.05 are marked with an asterisk). Dose-response curves were fitted with the following equation, y=Emax1+EC50/[c]Equation 1 where Emax is the maximal effect,c the agonist concentration, and EC50 the concentration of half-maximal response. Inhibitory effects were described by,y=11+IC50/[c]Equation 2 with IC50 as the half-maximal blocking concentration. The permeability of monovalent cations was obtained from the shift in the reversal potentials after complete substitution of extracellular divalent cations (1 nm free [Ca2+]i buffered by 5 mm EGTA and nominal Ca2+- and Mg2+-free extracellular solution) and was calculated by the following equation,PX/PNa=exp(ΔVrev∗F/RT)Equation 3 where Vrev is the measured shift in reversal potential. Permeability of the divalent cations Ca2+ and Ba2+ relative to Na+ was calculated from the reversal potential measured with 30 mm of the respective cation in the extracellular solution.PX/PNa=(1+exp(VrevF/RT))Equation 4 ∗([Na] i+α[Cs] i)exp(VrevF/RT)−[Na] e−α[Cs] e4[X] e PX represents the permeability of the divalent cation, [X]e its extracellular concentration, α isPCs/PNa obtained from Equation 3, [Na+]e, [Na+]i, and [Cs+]e, [Cs+]i are the extra- and intracellular concentrations for Na+ and Cs+, respectively, and Vrev is the reversal potential (19.Vennekens R.

In hVRL-2.1321N1 cells capsaicin and RTX were without effect, while PMA elicited a Ca2+ response with a slow onset reaching a maintained phase in ∼130 s (Fig. 1A). The phorbol ester 4α-PDD, which does not activate PKC, also elicited a Ca2+response, which was typified by an initially rapid, and later slower, onset that reached a maintained phase in ∼40 s (Fig. 1A). These responses were not observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, and all four ligands were inactive in wild type and mock-transfected 1321N1 cells (data not shown). In hVRL-2.1321N1 cells the 4α-PDD- and PMA-induced Ca2+responses were concentration-dependent, with pEC50 values of 6.73 ± 0.03 and 5.86 ± 0.10 (n = 5), respectively, although PMA was only a partial agonist (Emax = 65%) compared with 4α-PDD (Fig. 1B). Ruthenium Red (1 μm) abolished both the PMA (3 μm)- and 4α-PDD (1 μm)-induced responses in hVRL-2.1321N1 cells, whereas capsazepine (10 μm) was without effect (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows examples of combined current and Ca2+ measurements in the control human astrocytoma cell line 1321N1 and in hVRL-2.1321N1 cells. The control cell line showed background currents, which were outwardly rectifying with densities of −0.4 ± 0.2 pA/pF at −80 mV and ± 1.8 ± 0.4 pA/pF at +80 mV and a reversal potential of −7 ± 2 mV (n= 7). After application of 1 μm 4α-PDD neither [Ca2+]i nor the current was increased (Fig. 2,A–C). If the stable cell line expressing hVRL-2 was used, application of 4α-PDD increased [Ca2+]i, inward and outward currents, and shifted the reversal potential of the activated current toward more positive potentials (Fig. 2,D–I). The increase in [Ca2+]i was absent in Ca2+-free bath solutions (n = 7, data not shown). As shown later, monovalent ion current could be measured in nominally Ca2+-free solutions, indicating that 4α-PDD still functioned as an agonist in these conditions. Data obtained from all cells are shown in Fig. 3. Half-maximal increase of [Ca2+]i and the current measured at −80 mV (to avoid an eventual contribution of Ca2+-activated Cl− currents at positive potentials) occurred at pEC50 of 6.71 ± 0.04 and 6.86 ± 0.11 (n between 6 and 17), respectively (Fig. 3, A andB). The reversal potential shifted by ∼5 and 15 mV toward positive potentials after application of 0.1 and 1 μm4α-PDD, respectively (Fig. 3C). Obviously, 4α-PDD activated a Ca2+ influx and an outwardly rectifying current in hVRL-2-expressing, but not in hVRL-2-lacking cells. TRP12 is a channel cloned from mouse kidney and is ∼95% identical to human VRL-2 (mouse mTRP12; GenBankTM accession numberCAC20703), suggesting that it is the mouse orthologue of VRL-2. Fig. 4 shows combined current and Ca2+ measurements in nontransfected HEK cells and in HEK cells transiently transfected with murine TRP12. Background currents in the control cell line showed weak outward rectification, current densities of −3 ± 1 pA/pF at −80 mV and 8 ± 5 pA/pF at +80 mV, and a reversal potential of 5 ± 2 mV (n = 8). The background current in TRP12-expressing cells was −5 ± 3 pA/pF at −80 mV and 13 ± 5 pA/pF at +80 mV (n = 8). The reversal potential of this current was measured at 6 ± 2 mV (n = 8). Application of 1 μm 4α-PDD induced a small increase in [Ca2+]i in nontransfected cells, activated an outwardly rectifying current, and shifted the reversal potential of the net current toward more positive potentials (Fig. 4, A–C). These effects were significantly enhanced in TRP12-transfected cells (Fig. 4, D–F). Application of 1 μm 4α-PDD increased [Ca2+]i to 0.08 ± 0.02 μm in nontransfected cells (n = 8) and to 0.43 ± 0.1 μm in TRP12-transfected cells (n = 8). To compare the 4α-PDD stimulation of TRP12 with its previously described activation by cell swelling, we applied 4α-PDD during perfusion of the cell with a hypotonic solution. As shown in Fig. 4G, volume-activated TRP12 currents were stimulated with a latency and reached a constant level. This behavior has been described already elsewhere (11.Nilius B. Prenen J. Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Droogmans G. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 443: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Application of 4α-PDD further increased the current substantially. The activated current is a cation current, because its inward component disappeared when permeable cations were substituted by NMDG+ (Fig. 4G). The current component activated by 4α-PDD was 9.1 ± 2.2 times larger than the volume-activated component (n = 6, all measured at −80 mV). Under both conditions, currents are relatively slowly activated. Current activation appeared with a latency of 22 ± 5 s for 4α-PDD (n = 8) and 29 ± 4 s for cell swelling (n = 15). Peak currents appeared after 85 ± 26 s for 4α-PDD (n = 8) and 76 ± 9 s for HTS (n = 15). Concomitantly, the phorbol ester enhanced the amplitude of the outwardly rectifying current. Application of the phorbol ester PMA (10 μm) also activated TRP12 (Fig. 5, A and B). However, the maximal effects of PMA were approximately two times smaller than those of 4α-PDD, and the IC50 value was 10 times higher than for 4α-PDD (Fig. 5C), similar to the relative efficacy seen in VRL-2 (Fig. 1B). Fig. 5 shows the dose-response relationship of the current response during application of 4α-PDD and PMA in cells with a pipette solution with [Ca2+]i buffered at 1 nm. From the fit of the current responses at various concentrations of 4α-PDD to Equation 1, we obtained a maximal current of −131 pA/pF (−80 mV) with a pEC50 of 6.67 (Fig. 5C). The reversal potential shifted toward a more positive potential, reaching a maximal shift of about 10 mV at 1 μm 4α-PDD (Fig. 5D). The characteristics of the 4α-PDD-activated current are similar to those of the current activated by cell swelling in these same cells (11.Nilius B. Prenen J. Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Droogmans G. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 443: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The relative conductance measured at −80 mV changed in the sequence K+:Cs+:Na+:Li+= 1.34 ± 0.1:1.1 ± 0.11:1:0.68 ± 0.13 (n = 7, Fig. 6C). The permeability sequence of the 4α-PDD activated current for various monovalent cations, as determined from shifts in reversal potential upon extracellular cation substitution (Fig. 6, A and B), was Eisenman IV with PK:PCs:PNa:PLi = 1.21 ± 0.02:1.10 ± 0.015:1:0.85 ± 0.03 (n = 7, Fig. 6D). The cation channel activated by 4α-PDD was also permeable for Ca2+ as reported elsewhere (9.Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 11.Nilius B. Prenen J. Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Droogmans G. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 443: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows an example in which Ca2+ is the only charge carrier for inward current after substitution of all extracellular monovalent cations with NMDG+. Stimulation of TRP1-expressing HEK cells with 1 μm 4α-PDD increased the inward current at −80 mV as well as the outward current at +80 mV (Fig. 7A), but induced only very small effects in nontransfected cells. This increase of the current was transient and decreased in the maintained presence of 4α-PDD. Current-voltage relationships, as shown in Fig. 7B, indicate the activation of a strongly outwardly rectifying current with aPCa:PNa ratio of 5.8 ± 0.5, as calculated from Equations 3 and 4. The reversal potential of the current measured in the presence of intracellular Cs+and 30 mm extracellular Ca2+ as the only cation was 26.6 ± 1.4 mV. Ba2+ was much less permeable than Ca2+ with a ratio PBa:PNa of 0.7 ± 0.5 calculated from the reversal potential of 5.4 ± 2.6 mV in the presence of 30 mm Ba2+. Increasing [Ca2+]e from 1 to 30 mmshifted the reversal potential by 33 ± 2.5 mV, which is less than the expected 44-mV shift for a Ca2+-selective cation channel. Taken together these data indicate that the channel activated by 4α-PDD is a Ca2+-permeable cation channel as described for TRP12, OTRPC4, and VR-OAC activated by cell swelling.Figure 7Permeation of Ca2+though the 4α-PDD-activated channel.A, time course of the whole-cell current measured at −80 and +80 mV from linear voltage ramps. Up to the dotted line, TRP12-transfected HEK cells were perfused with normal bath solution. At the time indicated, all monovalent cations were substituted by NMDG+ and 30 mm Ca2+. Therefore, inward currents can only be carried by Ca2+. Application of 1 μm 4α-PDD induced a large but transient increase in both inward and outward current. Ca2+ in the pipette solution is buffered at 1 nm. B, current-voltage relationships measured at the times a and b, indicated in A. Note the rightward shift of the IV curve.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further evaluate whether the slow increase of [Ca2+]i is indeed the result of a slow influx of Ca2+ during the slow channel activation, we have activated TRP12 by 4α-PDD in Ca2+-free solutions and then applied extracellular Ca2+. Under these conditions, 4α-PDD, as expected, induced a delayed activation of an outward current (the inward component is absent because of substitution of all cation by NMDG+, Fig. 8, Aand C). After activation, 30 mm[Ca2+]e was applied, which induced a nearly instantaneous appearance of an inward current and a very fast increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 8B). These data indicate a fast entry of Ca2+ when the channel has been pre-activated. In addition, no Ca2+ signal was obtained during stimulation with 4α-PDD in the absence of [Ca2+]e, indicating the absence of Ca2+ release during activation (identical results in five cells). We have shown that Ca2+ entry through VRL-2 was blocked by Ruthenium Red (data not shown). Ruthenium Red at a concentration of 1 μm completely blocked the 4α-PDD-activated inward current through TRP12, but was less effective on the outward current (Fig. 9, A–D). Because several members of the TRPV family are modulated by [Ca2+]i (for a detailed example, see Ref. 21.Nilius B. Prenen J. Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we have also studied a possible modulation of the 4α-PDD-activated TRP12 channel by changes in [Ca2+]i. Fig. 10 gives an example for the response to 1 μm 4α-PDD of TRP12-expressing HEK cells that were dialyzed by intracellular solution in which [Ca2+]i was buffered at 1, 200, and 1000 nm. The response was clearly reduced when [Ca2+]i was increased (Fig. 10, A andB). Both inward and outward currents were reduced to the same extent. A concentration response plot of the maximal current at −80 mV evoked by 1 μm 4α-PDD showed a half-maximal inactivation at a Ca2+ concentration of 406 nm(Fig. 10C). Clearly, TRP12 is inhibited by elevation of [Ca2+]i. To test whether the novel agonist for TRP12 is also effective on native channels, we tested freshly isolated mouse aorta endothelial cells (MAEC). These cells express TRP12 as shown in Northern blots (8.Wissenbach U. Bodding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). As a reference we used human umbilical vein endothelial cell-derived EA cells, which do not express VRL-2. Stimulation with 1 μm 4α-PDD evoked, in both clamped and unclamped MAEC, a Ca2+ signal in the presence of 5 mm [Ca2+]e but not in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 11). The agonist was, however, ineffective in EA cells. 4α-PDD also activated in MAEC, but not in EA cells, an outwardly rectifying cation current and a concomitant shift of the reversal potential toward more positive potentials (Fig. 12). In conclusion, the agonist 4α-PDD induced the same responses in cells that express TRP12 endogenously as in VRL-2- or TRP12-transfected cells.Figure 12Increase of [Ca2+]iand current by 1 μm4α-PDD in MAEC.

Whereas binding by Pdx1 to elements of β-cell genes has been demonstrated in vitro, almost none of these genes has been demonstrated to be a direct binding target for Pdx1 within cells (where complex chromatin structure exists). To determine which β-cell promoters are bound by Pdx1 in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using Pdx1 antiserum and chromatin from β-TC3 cells and Pdx1-transfected NIH3T3 cells and subsequently quantitated co-immunoprecipitated promoters using real-time PCR. We compared these in vivofindings to parallel immunoprecipitations in which Pdx1 was allowed to bind to promoter fragments in in vitro reactions. Our results show that in all cells Pdx1 binds strongly to the insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide, glucagon, Pdx1, and Pax4 promoters, whereas it does not bind to either the glucose transporter type 2 or albumin promoters. In addition, no binding by Pdx1 to the glucokinase promoter was observed in β-cells. In contrast, in in vitroimmunoprecipitations, Pdx1 bound all promoters to an extent approximately proportional to the number of Pdx1 binding sites.

Nowhere is cell type-specific gene expression more evident than in the β-cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, where several genes including insulin, glucokinase, glucose transporter type 2 (Glut2),1 and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) demonstrate β-cell-specific expression patterns. Although a network of transcription factors likely directs the overall expression of these β-cell genes (1.Edlund H. Diabetes. 2001; 50 (Suppl. 1): 5-9Crossref Google Scholar, 2.Habener J.F.

Pdx1 expression has been demonstrated to occur in most cell types that comprise the developing pancreas (5.Guz Y. Montminy M.R. Stein R. Leonard J. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Teitelman G.

For example, the β-cell-specific disruption of the mouse Pdx1 gene results in animals that develop late-onset diabetes with impairments in insulin, IAPP, and Glut2 expression (10.Ahlgren U.

Whereas the functional data described above are important in establishing a link between Pdx1 and the expression of specific genes, these studies do not address the issue of whether Pdx1 is involved in a transcriptional complex that directly controls the expression of these genes. Only circumstantial evidence suggests direct involvement; specific elements within the promoter regions of these β-cell-specific genes have been demonstrated to be bound by Pdx1 in in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) (12.Ohneda K.

Pdx1 is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor and demonstrates sequence-specific DNA binding (to TAAT-containing motifs), similar to the homeobox genes of Drosophila (22.Draganescu A. Tullius T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,23.Ekker S.C. Young K.E. von Kessler D.P. Beachy P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because Pdx1 functions as an activator of gene transcription, it is therefore believed to activate gene expression by binding to upstream TAAT sequences (24.Peshavaria M. Henderson E. Sharma A. Wright C.V. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3987-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Critical evidence that is lacking to establish Pdx1 as an immediate regulator of β-cell gene expression includes the demonstration that Pdx1 is physically associated with β-cell gene promoters in vivo. An emerging theme in transcriptional regulation is the influence of chromatin structure within the nuclear environment on both DNA binding by transcription factors as well as the resultant regulation of transcription (25.Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar, 26.Spencer V.A. Davie J.R. Gene. 1999; 240: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The highly compacted nature of chromatin could conceivably hinder accessibility to some DNA binding sites but not to others, notwithstanding that these sites may display equal affinity for a given factor in vitro (27.Anderson J.D. Lowary P.T. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 28.Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). Thus, we cannot necessarily predict from studies in vitro which promoters Pdx1 binds in vivo. To determine which promoters Pdx1 might directly regulate in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using Pdx1 antiserum and chromatin from various cell lines and followed this by quantitative real-time PCR to determine the relative distribution of co-immunoprecipitated promoters. We performed these studies in vivo using a non-β-cell line (NIH3T3) and a β-cell line (β-TC3) as well as in an in vitro setting for comparison. We demonstrate that Pdx1 is associated with several, but not all, β-cell-specific genes in vivo. We show further that there is a significant difference in the binding distribution of Pdx1 to promoters in vitro and in vivo as well as in β-cells and non-β-cells. Our findings suggest a model in which the chromatin structure of a given cell type plays an important role in restricting target promoter binding by Pdx1. The mouse cell lines β-TC3 and α-TC1.6 were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The mouse fibroblast cell line, NIH3T3, was maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For transient mammalian cell transfections, 5 × 105 NIH3T3 cells were plated on 10-cm plates 1 day before transfection.

Cells were harvested for chromatin immunoprecipitation assays or Western blots ∼48 h later. Single-stranded oligonucleotide probes were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled oligonucleotides were column-purified and annealed to an excess of complementary strand. EMSA buffers and conditions were described previously (29.German M.S. Moss L.G. Wang J. Rutter W.J.

Oligonucleotide fragments were derived from elements of each promoter known to be important in the transcriptional regulation of that gene and that contained a Pdx1 binding motif (TAAT). The albumin promoter oligonucleotide was selected based entirely upon the presence of a TAAT motif. The following oligonucleotide probes were used (top strands shown): mouse I insulin promoter (A3/A4 element (12.Ohneda K. Mirmira R.G. Wang J. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Mol. Cell.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described in the literature (33.Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) with some modifications. A total of 1 × 107 NIH3T3 cells (from 3 confluent 10-cm plates) or 2.5 × 107 β-TC3 or α-TC1.6 cells (from 2 confluent 10-cm plates) were treated with 1% formaldehyde by adding 0.27 ml of 37% formaldehyde directly to 10 ml of culture medium. After incubating in formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, glycine was added to a final concentration of 0.125 m. The cells were then suspended in 0.6 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) plus protease inhibitors (leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin) and subjected to sonication (using a Fisher Scientific model 60 sonic dismembrator with a microtip at a setting of 10). Ten 5-s sonication pulses were required for NIH3T3 cells, and 15 5-s pulses were required for β-TC3 and α-TC1.6 cells to shear chromatin to 1000-bp fragments. The effectiveness of shearing was confirmed by incubating a 10-μl aliquot of the extract at 65 °C for 3 h (to reverse cross-links) and subsequently subjecting it to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. 0.25-ml aliquots of the clarified extracts were diluted to 1 ml in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and then incubated with either 5 μl of anti-Pdx1 antiserum or normal rabbit serum (25 μl was also divided into separate aliquots and stored for later PCR analysis as 10% of the input extract). Incubations occurred overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform, after which 40 μl of protein A-agarose slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 2 μl of a 10 mg/ml herring sperm DNA solution (Sigma) were added, and incubation was continued an additional 1 h. The agarose was pelleted by centrifugation, and the pellets were washed consecutively with 1 ml of lysis buffer, lysis buffer plus 500 mm NaCl, lysis buffer plus 0.25 m LiCl, and Tris/EDTA. DNA and protein were eluted from the pellets by incubating the pellets 2 times in 0.25 ml of elution buffer (0.1 mNaHCO3 with 1% SDS and 20 μg/ml herring sperm DNA, and protein-DNA cross-links were reversed by incubating at 65 °C for 3 h. DNA and protein were ethanol-precipitated overnight at −20 °C. The precipitated samples were pelleted and dissolved in proteinase K buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5 with 1% SDS) and incubated with 1 μg of proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 55 °C. The samples were extracted once with phenol/chloroform and ethanol-precipitated overnight at −20 °C. Samples were pelleted, washed with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in 100 μl of Tris/EDTA. 3-μl aliquots were used for each real time PCR reaction to quantitate co-immunoprecipitated promoter fragments (see below). In vitro reactions were set up similar to EMSA reactions. Briefly, each reaction consisted of 10 μg of poly(dI-dC), 100 μg bovine serum albumin, 1 fmol of each promoter, and 10 μg of either pBAT12- or pBAT12Pdx1-transfected NIH3T3 nuclear extract in a 200 μl solution of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9 with 75 mm KCl. The concentration of promoters in the reaction (5 × 10−12m each) was chosen such that the percentage of any given promoter that was immunoprecipitated was in the range 0.1–1.0% of the input quantity (to match the results obtained in the ChIP assays). The promoters used in these reactions (ranging in size from 100 to 250 bp) were excised from their respective pCR2.1 vectors by digestion with EcoRI (see below for details on the construction of these vectors). The reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 15 min, after which formaldehyde was added to a final concentration 1%, and the reactions were incubated an additional 5 min. Glycine was then added to a final concentration of 0.125 m. 90-μl aliquots were removed and diluted to 1 ml using lysis buffer and then incubated with either 5 μl of anti-Pdx1 antiserum or 5 μl of normal rabbit serum (9 μl was also divided in to separate aliquots and stored for later PCR analysis at 10% of input reaction). From this point onward, samples were treated identically to the chromatin immunoprecipitation samples. For standard PCR reactions, 1 μl of sonicated NIH3T3 DNA was used as template in 25-μl reactions containing 3 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mmdNTPs, 10 pmol of primers, and 0.5 units of Platinum®Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Thermal cycling was performed using an iCycler® (Bio-Rad). Cycling parameters for all amplifications were (95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s) × 30 cycles. Amplified promoter fragments were subcloned into the T/A cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and 3–4 clones from each PCR reaction were sequenced to confirm the identity of the amplified fragment.

Quantitative real-time PCR reaction conditions were identical to the standard PCR reactions, except that each reaction contained 3 μl of template DNA (from chromatin or in vitroimmunoprecipitations) and a 1:75,000 dilution of SYBR Green I dye (Molecular Probes). Real-time PCR reactions (for a total of 40 cycles) were performed using an iCycler IQ® (Bio-Rad), and continuous SYBR Green I monitoring was done according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The relative proportions of co-immunoprecipitated promoter fragments were determined based on the threshold cycle (TC) value for each PCR reaction. The TC value is determined as the cycle at which fluorescence rises 10 times above the mean S.D. of background levels in all reaction wells. Real time PCR data analysis followed the methodology described in a recent report (34.Christenson L.K. Stouffer R.L. Strauss 3rd., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27392-27399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For every promoter studied, a ΔTC value was calculated for each sample by subtracting the TC value for the input (to account for differences in amplification efficiencies and DNA quantities before immunoprecipitation) from the TCvalue obtained for the immunoprecipitated sample. A ΔΔTC value was then calculated by subtracting the ΔTC value for the sample immunoprecipitated with Pdx1 antiserum from the ΔTC value for the corresponding control sample immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit serum. Fold differences (Pdx1 ChIP relative to control ChIP) were then determined by raising 2 to the ΔΔTC power. The equation used in these calculations is summarized as fold difference (Pdx1 ChIP relative to control ChIP) = 2[TC(control) −TC(Pdx1)], where TC =TC(immunoprecipitated sample)TC(input). TC values for immunoprecipitated samples ranged from 25 to 30, whereas the TC values for the 10% input samples ranged from 18 to 24; thus, recovery of promoters in immunoprecipitated samples ranged from 0.1 to 1% of the input values. For every promoter fragment analyzed, each sample was quantitated in duplicate on at least two separate occasions and from at least two (and in many cases, three) independent immunoprecipitations to give a minimum of four independent quantitations of each sample for each promoter. Mean ± S.D. values were determined for each fold difference, and these values were subsequently used in two-tailed paired t tests to determine statistical significance, as reported in the figures. A melt curve analysis was performed for each sample after PCR amplification to ensure that a single product of expected melt curve characteristics was obtained. Nuclear extracts from NIH3T3, β-TC3, and α-TC1.6 cells were prepared from single, confluent 10-cm plates of cells according to methods described previously (35.Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). 5 μg of nuclear extract were subject to Western blot analysis after electrophoresis on a 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel using Pdx1 antiserum. Western blots were visualized using the ECL-Plus® system (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots from immunoprecipitated samples proceeded similarly, except that 20 μl of protein after elution (in 100 μl of Laemmli buffer) from the protein A-agarose was used in the analysis. Several studies document the sequence-specific DNA binding properties of Pdx1 (12.Ohneda K. Mirmira R.G. Wang J. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13.Peers B. Leonard J. Sharma S. Teitelman G. Montminy M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1798-1806PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Ohlsson H. Thor S. Edlund T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that Pdx1 can bind to key promoter elements from a variety of β-cell-specific genes, we performed EMSAs (Fig. 1) using Pdx1 protein from transfected NIH3T3 nuclear extract and duplexed oligonucleotide fragments corresponding to known regulatory elements of the insulin, Glut2, and glucokinase genes. Fig. 1 shows that Pdx1 binds to upstream promoter elements from these genes and also demonstrates that when the TAAT sequences in the insulin promoter are mutated by a single base pair (TAAT to TAGT), DNA binding by Pdx1 is completely abolished (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). Fig. 1 also shows that Pdx1 is capable of binding to promoter elements from genes not expressed in the β-cell (Albumin and Glucagon, lanes 8–11), suggesting that Pdx1 binding to DNA elements in vitro is dependent primarily upon the presence of binding sites. Importantly, it should be noted that variations do exist in the extent of binding to each of these promoter elements, due presumably to variations in the DNA sequences that flank the TAAT motif (37.Catron K.M. Iler N. Abate C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2354-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 1 are unchanged when Pdx1 protein is obtained from β-cell nuclear extract (β-TC3 cells) or from an in vitro translation system using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (data not shown). Because the data in Fig. 1 demonstrate poor promoter selectivity by Pdx1 in vitro, we sought to determine the distribution of Pdx1 promoter binding in vivo by use of the ChIP assay. The ChIP assay is a recently developed method that has typically been used to assess the association of abundant histone complexes with specific genes (33.Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). When the ChIP assay is coupled to PCR-based detection methods, however, the association of far less abundant transcription factor complexes with specific genes can be reliably assessed (38.Wells J. Boyd K.E. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5797-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Fig. 2a shows the general scheme of our ChIP assays. Assays were performed using chromatin from three cell types: (a) NIH3T3 cells (a mouse fibroblast-derived cell line, which serves as a non-β-cell line control for our studies) transfected with either a vector containing the Pdx1 cDNA (referred to as “NIH3T3/Pdx1”) or the empty vector (referred to as “NIH3T3/EV”), (b) β-TC3 cells, an insulin-secreting mouse β-cell-derived cell line (39.Efrat S.

One of APG gene products essential for autophagy in yeast, Apg3p, is a protein-conjugating enzyme for Apg8p lipidation (Ichimura, Y., Kirisako, T., Takao, T., Satomi, Y., Shimonishi, Y., Ishihara, N., Mizushima, N., Tanida, I., Kominami, E., Ohsumi, M., Noda, T., and Ohsumi, Y. (2000) Nature 408, 488–492). In this study, the cloning of a human Apg3p homologue (hApg3p) as an E2 enzyme essential for human Apg8p homologues (i.e. GATE-16, GABARAP, and MAP-LC3) is shown, and its unique characteristics are described. The predicted amino acid sequence of the isolated clone shows 34.1% identity and 48.1% similarity to yeast Apg3p. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Cys264 of hApg3p is an authentic active-site cysteine residue essential for the formation of hApg3p·hApg8p homologue intermediates. Overexpression of hApg7p enhances the formation of a stable E2-substrate complex between hApg3pC264S and each of the hApg8p homologues, and MAP-LC3 is preferred as the substrate over the other two Apg8p homologues. These results indicate that hApg3p is an E2-like enzyme essential for three human Apg8p homologues. Co-immunoprecipitation of hApg7p with hApg3p indicates that hApg3p forms an E1·E2 complex with hApg7p as in the case of yeast Apg3p and Apg7p. Furthermore, hApg3p coimmunoprecipitates with hApg12p, and the overexpression of hApg3p facilitates the formation of the GFPhApg12p·hApg5p conjugate, suggesting that hApg3p cross-talks with the hApg12p conjugation system.

Autophagy is a process of bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components by the lysosomal/vacuolar system (1.Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar). In the initial step of macroautophagy, a cup-shaped membrane sac surrounds cytosolic components to form an autophagosome (4.Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J.

Unlike the other modifiers, the target of Apg8p is a lipid, not a protein. Apg8p is activated by an E1 enzyme, Apg7p, and transferred to an E2 enzyme, Apg3p/Aut1p (9.Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T.

Wolf D.H. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1068-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the last step, Apg8p is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine on a preautophagosomal membrane sac (9.Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). After the formation of the autophagosome, luminal Apg8p is released into the luminal space and degraded in the vacuole (12.Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 16.Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). At the same time, Apg8p on the cytosolic surface of the autophagosome is detached into the cytosol by Apg4p, a cysteine protease that is also essential for the activation of Apg8p (9.Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Apg8p/Aut7p also interacts with two ER-to-Golgi vacuole SNAREs (Bet1p and Sec22p) and vacuolar target SNARE and vacuole SNARE (Vam3p and Nyv1p) (17.Legesse-Miller A. Sagiv Y. Glozman R. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32966-32973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For the reaction, the carboxyl-terminal Gly in Apg8p is essential as in ubiquitin and other modifiers. Furthermore, in addition to the Apg8p-lipidation system, the Apg12p-conjugation system is also essential for the Cvt pathway and autophagy (8.Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Apg12p is activated by the common E1 enzyme, Apg7p, transferred to a second E2 enzyme, Apg10p, and finally conjugates with Apg5p (8.Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 10.Tanida I. Mizushima N. Kiyooka M. Ohsumi M. Ueno T. Ohsumi Y. Kominami E. Mol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5234-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal Gly of Apg12p is also essential for conjugation. After the formation of the Apg12p·Apg5p conjugate, Apg16p attaches to Apg5p, forming an Apg12p·Apg5p·Apg16p complex for autophagy (18.Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 15: 3888-3896Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Apg5p and the Apg12p·Apg5p conjugate localize to the membrane fraction but not the autophagosome, suggesting that they play a role in an initial step in the formation of autophagosomes and Cvt vesicles (8.Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Unlike other modifier-conjugation systems, two conjugation systems play indispensable roles in the formation of membrane structures including autophagosomes and Cvt vesicles. Apg7p is a unique E1 enzyme for two substrates in two independent modification systems of autophagy and the Cvt-pathway and exists as a homodimer (19.Komatsu M. Tanida I. Ueno T. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9846-9854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). More interestingly, Apg3p/Aut1p forms an E1·E2 enzyme complex with Apg7p, and Apg3p also interacts with Apg12p, which is a substrate for Apg7p and Apg10p but not Apg3p (19.Komatsu M. Tanida I.

Nature. 2000; 403: 601-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the E1·E2 complex is a key to the cooperative regulation of two modification systems. In mammalian cells, two modification systems seem to be conserved. A human Apg12p homologue (hApg12p) conjugates with the human Apg5p homologue (hApg5p), which was first identified as an apoptosis-specific protein (21.Hammond E.M. Brunet C.L. Johnson G.D.

Recently, experiments using embryonic stem cells that knocked out the mouse APG5 gene demonstrated that a murine Apg5p homologue is essential for autophagy (23.Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M.

With regard to mammalian Apg8p modification, there are three mammalian Apg8p/Aut7p homologue candidates, the Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa (GATE-16), GABAA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (MAP-LC3) (16.Kirisako T.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The mRNA for GATE-16 is expressed ubiquitously but at significantly higher levels in brain tissue. GABARAP interacts with GABAAreceptors, the cytoskeleton, and gephyrin, suggesting its functional importance in brain or neuronal cells (24.Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W.

Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). These results suggest that mammalian Apg8p homologues have divergent functions in mammalian cells, especially in neuronal cells. Recently, we showed that the human Apg7p homologue (hApg7p) is an E1 enzyme essential for multiple substrates such as hApg12p, GATE-16, GABARAP, and MAP-LC3 and forms a homodimer (27.Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1701-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Considering the functional divergence of GATE-16, GABARAP, and MAP-LC3, it is assumed that a regulatory system for the conjugation system exists in mammalian cells. To reveal the three mammalian Apg8p homologue-modification systems, we are interested in the human Apg3p homologue (hApg3p). In this paper, we report the isolation and characterization of hApg3p as an E2 enzyme for mammalian Apg8p homologues. Furthermore, we showed a functional relationship between hApg3p- and the hApg12p-conjugation system. Escherichia coli strain DH5α cells, the host for plasmids and protein expression, were grown in Luria Broth medium in the presence of antibiotics as required (32.Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed.

A membrane blotted poly(A) RNA derived from human tissues for Northern analysis was purchased from CLONTECH, and Northern analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using the cDNA of the open reading frame of hAPG3 as a probe. Based on the DNA sequence of two EST clones (GenBankTM accession numbers AI830763 and AI857615), two oligonucleotides were synthesized (hAPG3-GSP1, 5′-AAGTTCTCCCCCTCCTTCTG-3′, and hAPG3-GSP2, 5′-TGCCGTTGCTCATCATAGCC-3′). Using these primers, 5′-RACE was performed by high fidelity PCR with human brain MarathonTM-ready cDNA (normal whole brain from a 50-year-old Caucasian male) as a template according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH). Based on the obtained DNA sequence of the human APG3 homologue, we amplified an open reading frame of the human APG3 cDNA by PCR with high fidelity introducing a BglII site before the start codon, and a SalI site after the termination codon cloned the fragment into pGEM-T and designated the resultant plasmid as pGEMhAPG3. To express GFPhApg3p under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, a BglII-SalI fragment of the pGEMhAPG3 plasmid was introduced into a pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) and designated pEGFPhAPG3. To express FLAGhApg3p in COS7 cells, a BglII-SalI fragment of the pGEMhAPG3 plasmid was introduced into theBamHI-SalI site of pCMV-Tag2B vector (Stratagene) and designated pTag2BhAPG3. Mammalian expression vectors for each of the enhanced GFP modifier fusion proteins (EGFPhApg12p, EGFPhMAP-LC3, EGFPhGATE-16, and EGFPhGABARAP) have been described previously (27.Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1701-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To express both hApg7p and enhanced GFP modifier fusion proteins, we inserted the internal ribosome entry site sequence between the DNA sequences of each of the enhanced GFP modifiers and hApg7p using the pIRES vector. Cys264 within hApg3p was replaced by Ser, mutagenized by the Gene-Editor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) with an oligonucleotide (hAPG3CS, 5′-ATGTGTTCAGTTCACCCAAGCAGGCATGCTGA-3′) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The expression plasmid for mutant hApg3pC264S was constructed as in the case of pEGFP-hAPG3 and designated pEGFPhAPG3CS. A polyclonal antibody against a synthetic polypeptide corresponding to residues 550–571 of hApg7p has been described previously (27.Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1701-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). For the preparation of antiserum against hApg3p, rabbits were immunized with a glutathioneS-transferase-hApg3p fusion protein. The resultant antiserum against hApg3p recognized a recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP)-hApg3p fusion protein in COS7 cells. The polyclonal and monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies were purchased from CLONTECH. The monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma. Co-immunoprecipitation of interacting proteins has been described previously (27.Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1701-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). COS7 and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection, 2 × 105 cells were seeded on 60-mm dishes. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the cells were transfected with a mixture of 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 15 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). For co-transfection, 1 μg of each plasmid was used. The transfectant was harvested after incubation for an additional 48 h. The subcellular fractionation of HEK293 cells has been described by Kabeya et al. (25.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). To investigate factors in the modification system for mammalian hApg8p homologues, we isolated a cDNA to hApg3p. A BLAST search of the EST data base with the amino acid sequence of yeast Apg3p indicated candidate hApg3p homologues (GenBankTM accession numbers AI830763 and AI857615). Based on the DNA sequences of two EST clones, a cDNA to hApg3p was amplified by 5′-RACE with a human brain cDNA library as a template. The DNA sequence of each of the four isolated clones contains a single open reading frame and a 5′ sequence identical to that of another EST clone (GenBank accession number AW408464). The predicted amino acid sequence of the isolated clone (calculated molecular mass of 35.8 kDa) shows 34.1% identity and 48.1% similarity to yeast Apg3p, and the region corresponding to the predicted active-site cysteine residue is significantly conserved between the isolated clones and yeast Apg3p (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we conclude that the clone is a cDNA to hApg3p. To investigate the expression of the human APG3 mRNA in human tissues, we performed Northern blot analysis using a multiple tissue-specific mRNA blot and a DNA fragment encoding the open reading frame of hApg3p. The human APG3 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously in all human tissues examined with especially high levels of expression in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, and placenta (Fig. 1B). If the isolated clone encodes an authentic E2 enzyme essential for hApg8p homologues, its gene product, hApg3p, will form E2·hApg8p intermediates. To investigate this possibility, we employed site-directed mutagenesis of the predicted active-site cysteine residue within hApg3p (Fig. 1A, Cys264). Wild type hApg3p forms an enzyme/substrate intermediate via a thiol ester bond. Because of the rapid turnover of the Apg3p reaction, it is difficult to recognize such an intermediate in sufficient quantity. If the active-site cysteine residue of Apg3p is replaced by serine, a stable O-ester bond instead of a thiol ester bond will be formed between the enzyme and substrate(s), and the formation of a high molecular mass Apg8p·Apg3p intermediate will be clearly detected in immunoblots as demonstrated previously with hApg7p (27.Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1701-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We changed Cys264 within hApg3p to serine by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed both the mutant GFPhApg3pC264S and each GFPhApg8ps (GFPhGATE-16, GFPhGABARAP, and GFPhMAP-LC3) in COS7 cells (Fig. 2). Wild type GFPhApg3p, mutant GFPhApg3pC264S, and GFP-hApg8ps were well expressed in COS7 cells; however, contrary to our expectations, no high molecular mass band corresponding to the predicted intermediate was recognized (Fig. 2, Short Exposure and Long Exposure, lanes 2, 4, and 6). We reasoned that because of the sparse content of endogenous Apg7p, the overexpressed Apg8p homologues could not be activated efficiently and could not be subsequently transferred to hApg3p. When hApg7p was expressed together with mutant GFPhApg3pC264S and GFPhApg8ps, higher molecular mass bands consistent with stable GFPhApg8p·GFPhApg3pC264S intermediates (∼105 kDa) were recognized by immunoblot with anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 2, Long Exposure, lanes 8, 10, and 12). hMAP-LC3 preferentially forms an intermediate with hApg3pC264S in COS7 cells (Fig. 2, Short Exposure, lane 12). The interactions of hApg3p with hApg8ps were also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (data not shown). These results indicate that hApg3p is an authentic E2 enzyme essential for hGATE-16, hGABARAP, and hMAP-LC3, and that the activation of the hApg8p homologue by hApg7p is essential for a further reaction mediated by hApg3p. To investigate the intracellular localization of hApg3p, we performed subcellular fractionation. HEK293 cells expressing GFPhApg3p and FLAGhMAP-LC3 were lysed and fractionated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Total proteins in the supernatant and pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and GFPhApg3p was recognized by immunoblot with anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 3, WB: anti-GFP). GFPhApg3p fractionated mainly in the supernatant, and the FLAGhMAP-LC3·GFPhApg3pC264S intermediate also fractionated in the supernatant (Fig. 3, WB: anti-GFP, LC3-GFPhApg3p). The results suggest that hApg3p is present in the cytosol, and that the reaction of hMAP-LC3 mediated by hApg3p occurs predominantly in the cytosol. In yeast, Apg3p forms an E1·E2 complex with Apg7p, which is one of its unique characteristics compared with other protein-conjugation systems. To investigate whether hApg3p interacts with hApg7p as in the case of yeast, co-immunoprecipitation was performed. We expressed FLAGhApg3p and hApg7p in COS7 cells (Fig. 4, Expression, lanes 1–3), and FLAGhApg3p in the lysate of the transfectant was immunoprecipitated well with anti-hApg3p antibody (Fig. 4, IP: anti-hApg3, WB: anti-FLAG, lanes 1 and 3). When both FLAGhApg3p and hApg7p were expressed in the cells, hApg7p co-immunoprecipitated with FLAGhApg3p by the anti-hApg3p antibody (Fig. 4, IP: anti-hApg3, WB: anti-hApg7, lane 3). When hApg7p alone was expressed in the cells, hApg7p was not immunoprecipitated by the anti-hApg3p antibody (Fig. 4, IP: anti-hApg3, WB: anti-hApg7, lane 2). The co-immunoprecipitation of hApg7p with hApg3p was confirmed using another hApg3p fusion protein (Fig. 4, GFPhApg3p,lanes 4–6). When GFPhApg3p was expressed in COS7 cells, GFPhApg3p in the lysate immunoprecipitated with anti-hApg3p antibody, whereas GFP itself did not immunoprecipitate with this antibody (Fig. 4, Expression, IP: anti-hApg3, WB: anti-GFP, lanes 4–6). Only when both GFPhApg3p and hApg7p were co-expressed in COS7 cells did hApg7p co-immunoprecipitate with GFPhApg3p using the anti-hApg3p antibody (Fig. 4, IP: anti-hApg3, WB: anti-hApg7, lane 6). Finally, we confirmed the interaction using an anti-hApg7p antibody. When hApg7p was expressed in COS7 cells, the hApg7p immunoprecipitated well with anti-hApg7p antibody (Fig. 4, IP: hApg7, WB: anti-hApg7, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). When FLAG-hApg3p or GFP-hApg3p was co-expressed with hApg7p in COS7 cells, they co-immunoprecipitated with hApg7p using the anti-hApg7p antibody (Fig. 4, IP: anti-hApg7, WB: anti-FLAG, WB: anti-GFP, lanes 3and 6). Considering these results, we conclude that hApg3p forms an E1·E2 complex with hApg7p as is the case in yeast. Another characteristic feature of Apg3p is that it also interacts with a second modifier protein, Apg12p, which is a substrate for Apg7p but not for Apg3p in yeast (19.Komatsu M. Tanida I. Ueno T. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9846-9854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20.Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S.

Nature. 2000; 403: 601-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We then investigated the interaction of hApg3p with hApg12p in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation. We expressed GFPhApg12p and FLAGhApg3p in COS7 cells (Fig. 5, Expression, WB: anti-FLAG, anti-GFP, lanes 1–3). When FLAGhApg3p was expressed in the cells, FLAGhApg3p in the cell lysate immunoprecipitated well with the anti-hApg3p antibody (Fig. 5,IP: anti-hApg3, WB: anti-FLAG, lanes 1 and3). When FLAGhApg3p and GFPhApg12p were expressed together in the cells, GFPhApg12p co-immunoprecipitated with FLAGhApg3p (Fig. 5,IP: anti-hApg3, WB: anti-GFP, lane 3). These results indicate that hApg3p interacts with hApg12p. Recent analyses using murineAPG5 gene-deficient embryonic stem cells revealed that the Apg12p·Apg5p conjugate cooperates sequentially with MAP-LC3 in the formation of a preautophagosomal membrane sac (23.Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). As described in the previous section, hApg3p interacts with both hApg7p and hApg12p (Figs.4 and 5). Considering these interactions, it is interesting to see whether the hApg7p·hApg3p complex and/or the hApg3p·hApg12p complex play some roles in the two conjugation reactions. As reported previously (27.Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1701-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), when both hApg7p and GFPhApg12p were expressed in COS7 cells, the formation of the GFPhApg12p-hApg5p conjugate was recognized (Fig. 6,GFPhApg12p-Apg5p, lane 5). We next examined the effects of the overexpression of hApg3p, hApg12p, and hApg7p in conjugate formation. When GFPhApg3p was expressed together with hApg7p and GFPhApg12p, the amount of the hApg12p·hApg5p conjugate increased significantly (Fig. 6, GFPhApg12p-Apg5p conjugate,lane 7). The carboxyl-terminal Gly in hApg12p is reported to be essential for the formation of the conjugate (22.Mizushima N. Sugita H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33889-33892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). We constructed a mutant hApg12pΔG with a deletion of the carboxyl-terminal Gly. When mutant GFPhApg12pΔG was expressed in cells instead of GFPhApg12p, no conjugate was formed even in the presence of both hApg7p and hApg3p (Fig. 6, lanes 6 and 8). The enhanced conjugate formation is dependent on hApg7p, because when hApg7p was not expressed, the conjugate was not recognized even in the presence of overexpressed hApg3p and hApg12p (Fig. 6, lane 9). These results indicate that the overexpression of hApg3p in addition to hApg12p and hApg7p further facilitates the formation of the hApg12p·hApg5p conjugate. In this study, we show that the human Apg3p homologue is an authentic E2 enzyme for the hApg8p-conjugation system(s), and that human GATE-16, GABARAP, and MAP-LC3, the three hApg8p homologues, are substrates for hApg3p (Table I). We show that hApg3pC264S in which the active-site cysteine is changed to serine can bind to GATE-16, GABARAP, and MAP-LC3 to form stable enzyme-substrate intermediates. The overexpression of hApg7p facilitates this reaction. Overexpressed hApg7p may be required for the efficient activation of overexpressed hApg8p homologues, which is necessary for the accumulation of substantial quantities of hApg3p·hApg8p intermediate via an O-ester bond. Alternatively, overexpressed hApg7p may enhance the formation of the E1·E2 complex with hApg3p, which may facilitate the sequential E2 reaction after the activation of hApg8p homologues by hApg7p. Furthermore, the overexpressed hApg3p facilitates the formation of hApg12p·hApg5p, whereas hApg3p is not an E2 enzyme for hApg12p (Table I).Table ISummary of two conjugation systems in yeast and humanApg12p-conjugation systemModifierE1E2Target YeastApg12pApg7pApg10pApg5p HumanhApg12phApg7pN.I.hApg5pApg8p-lipidation systemModifierE1E2Target YeastApg8pApg7pApg3pPE HumanMAP-LC3hApg7phApg3pN.I.GABARAPGATE-16N.I., not identified.

There are two unique characteristics of hApg3p. 1) It forms an E1-E2 complex with hApg7p. 2) It interacts with hApg12p. More importantly, we showed for the first time that the overexpression of hApg3p together with hApg7p and hApg12p enhances the formation of the hApg12p-hApg5p conjugate. The overexpression of hApg12p and hApg3p in the presence of endogenous hApg7p did not cause an enhancement of conjugate formation. Thus, the enhancement appears to be attributed to the formation of the hApg7p-hApg3p (E1-E2) complex rather than the hApg12p-hApg3p complex. These results strongly suggest that the formation of a complex between hApg7p and hApg3p, two indispensable members of the hApg8p-conjugation system, also plays an important role in the hApg12p-conjugation system. Mizushima et al. (23.Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar) reported that the formation of the mApg12p·mApg5p conjugate precedes the lipidation and subsequent targeting of MAP-LC3 to autophagosomal precursors. Our data on the facilitation of the hApg12p-conjugation reaction by hApg3p indicate that there is intimate cross-talk between hApg12p-conjugation and the hApg8p-modification systems in the formation of autophagosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of a cooperative relationship between the two different conjugation systems. In Fig. 7, we present a hypothetical scheme based on our experimental results. Although the precise mechanism by which the hApg7p·hApg3p complex facilitates hApg12p·hApg5p conjugation is still unknown, it is reasonable to assume that it may be possible by the activation of some step(s) in the hApg12p-conjugation pathway. For example, hApg7p complexed with hApg3p may be more active as an E1 enzyme than uncomplexed hApg7p. It is also possible that the presumptive hApg10p may be directly or indirectly involved in this mechanism. So far, authentic hApg10p has not been identified (Table I). We are now attempting to isolate and characterize an hApg10p homologue. In summary, hApg3p, which interacts with hApg12p on the one hand, forms an E1-E2 complex with hApg7p on the other and functions as a facilitating factor in the hApg12p-conjugation system in addition to an authentic E2 enzyme for hApg8p homologues. An enhanced level of the hApg12p-hApg5p conjugate in turn promotes the recruitment of the lipidated form of MAP-LC3 onto autophagosomal membranes. In the end, the activation of hApg12p-conjugation by the hApg7p-hApg3p complex promotes hApg8p-conjugation reaction. Thus, the two autophagic conjugation systems, which comprise the one activation enzyme (E1, hApg7p) in common, two distinct E2 enzymes (hApg3p and hApg10p) and four different modifiers (hApg12p and three hApg8p homologues) interact and cooperate with each other. GATE-16, which interacts with NSF and 28 kDa Golgi SNARE protein, is localized in the Golgi and is expressed in the largest amounts in brain (26.Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). GABARAP is a GABAA-receptor-associated protein that co-localizes with the GABAA receptor in cultured cortical neurons and interacts with gephyrin (24.Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 28.Kneussel M. Haverkamp S. Fuhrmann J.C. Wang H. Wassle H. Olsen R.W. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8594-8599Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). MAP-LC3 is localized on autophagosomal membranes (25.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). Considering the divergent functions and intracellular localizations of the three Apg8p homologues, it is surprising that all three hApg8p homologues, MAP-LC3, GATE-16, and GABARAP, are substrates for hApg3p. The affinity of hApg3p for these substrates differs from that of hApg7p. hApg3p preferentially conjugates with MAP-LC3 in COS7 cells, whereas hApg7p conjugates almost equally with each of the hApg8p homologues. What are the implications of the difference in substrate specificity between the E1 and E2 enzymes? The higher affinity of hApg3p for MAP-LC3 is coincident with the autophagosomal localization of MAP-LC3 considering the function of hApg3p in autophagy (25.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). With regard to GATE-16 and GABARAP, it is possible that there is another Apg3p homologue specific for GATE-16 and/or GABARAP. But no further candidate was obtained from further BLAST search on the EST data base and 5′-RACE, and genomic Southern analysis of the murine genome suggests that there are no further Apg3p homologues. 2M. Komatsu, I. Tanida, T. Ueno, and E. Kominami, unpublished results. Another possibility is that there is a cofactor or E3-like complex that determines the specificity for substrates. In COS7 cells, MAP-LC3 is expressed, whereas little GABARAP or GATE-16 is expressed. 3I. Tanida and E. Kominami, unpublished results. The expression of each of the hApg8p homologues in mammalian tissues and cultured cell lines is diverse, whereas hApg7p and hApg3p are expressed ubiquitously. 4I. Tanida, T. Ueno, and E. Kominami, unpublished results. In some cases of ubiquitylation, an E3 complex specifies the target protein. It is probable that there is a regulatory factor(s) that facilitates the conjugation of hApg3p with MAP-LC3 in COS7 cells. We are now investigating whether there is a regulatory factor or not by co-immunoprecipitation using anti-hApg3p antibody. Considering the divergent functions and intracellular localizations of the three Apg8p homologues, MAP-LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16, it is necessary to determine the final target of each hApg8p homologue and to investigate the regulatory system. Recent findings suggest that the Apg machinery plays an important role at least in brain and in cardiac and skeletal muscles. Clinical and biochemical analyses of a group of severe inheritable neurodegenerative disorders and X-linked vacuolar cardiomyopathy, myopathy in humans, and lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein-deficient mice have also suggested that lysosomal degradation via autophagy occurs actively during neuronal development and in normal mammalian bodies (33.Gardiner R.M.

https://openalex.org/W2046090148,"Abstract Our recent investigations have postulated a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC)-associated prekallikrein activator (PKA). When prekallikrein (PK) assembles on high molecular weight kininogen on HUVEC, PK is activated to kallikrein. PKA was found in the 15,800 × g pellet of HUVEC lysates using an assay that measures PK activation only when bound to high molecular weight kininogen linked to microtiter plates. Sequential DEAE, wheat germ lectin affinity, and hydroxyapatite chromatography resulted in four protein bands on SDS-PAGE. One protein in the 73-kDa band was identified by amino acid sequencing as prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP). On gel filtration, PKA activity was a single homogenous peak identical in migration to the 73-kDa immunoblot of PRCP. Anti-PRCP inhibits PKA activity and PK activation on HUVEC. Purified PKA was blocked by diisopropyl fluorophosphate (1 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (3 mm), leupeptin (100 μm), antipain (IC50 = 2 μm), HgCl2 (IC50 = 500 μm), Z-Pro-Pro-aldehyde-dimethyl acetate (IC50 = 1 μm), and corn trypsin inhibitor (IC50 = 40 nm). PKA did not correct the coagulant defect in factor XII deficient plasma, was purified from HUVEC cultured in factor XII-deficient serum, was not detected by antibody to factor XII, did not activate FXI, and was not inhibited by a neutralizing antibody to FXII. Angiotensin II (IC50 = 2 μm) or bradykinin (IC50 = 100 μm), but not angiotensin II-(1–7) or bradykinin1–5, and the prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitor Fmoc-Ala-Pyr-CN (IC50 = 50 nm) also blocked purified PKA activation of PK. The K m of PK activation by PRCP is 6.7 nm. PRCP antigen is present on the membrane of fixed but not permeabilized HUVEC. PRCP appears to be a HUVEC-associated PK activator."

We demonstrate that PEL cell lines have a constitutively active NF-κB pathway, which is associated with persistent phosphorylation of IκBα. To elucidate the mechanism of NF-κB activation in PEL cell lines, we have investigated the role of viral FLICE inhibitory protein (vFLIP) in this process. We report that stable expression of HHV8 vFLIP in a variety of cell lines is associated with persistent NF-κB activation caused by constitutive phosphorylation of IκBα. HHV8 vFLIP gets recruited to a ∼700-kDa IκB kinase (IKK) complex and physically associates with IKKα, IKKβ, NEMO/IKKγ, and RIP. HHV8 vFLIP is incapable of activating NF-κB in cells deficient in NEMO/IKKγ, thereby suggesting an essential role of an intact IKK complex in this process. Our results suggest that HHV8 vFLIP might contribute to the persistent NF-κB activation observed in PEL cells by associating with and stimulating the activity of the cellular IKK complex.

IκB proteins retain NF-κB in the cytoplasm by masking its nuclear localization signal. Stimulation by a number of cytokines, such as TNFα and interleukin-1, results in the activation of a large molecular mass (600–900 kDa), IκB kinase complex that leads to inducible phosphorylation of the IκB proteins at two N-terminal serine residues (5.Mercurio F.

Several members of the NF-κB family have been associated with the development of tumors as a result of overexpression, gene amplification, or gene rearrangement (14.Luque I. Gelinas C. Semin.

We and others have previously demonstrated that overexpression of HHV8 vFLIP can protect against death receptor-induced apoptosis in vitro and to promote tumor growth in vivo (33.Chaudhary P.M.

Furthermore, unlike MC159L and E8, HHV8 vFLIP was found to activate the NF-κB pathway when overexpressed in 293T and NIH3T3 cells by transient transfection (33.Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to better understand the mechanism of NF-κB activation by HHV8 vFLIP. pGEX-KG IκBα (1–54) and pGEX-KG IκBα (S32A/S36A) were generous gifts from Dr. Richard Gaynor. Retrovirus constructs containing C-terminal FLAG epitope tag vFLIP or MRIT/cFLIP were constructed in MSCVneo-based retroviral vectors, and the amphotropic retroviruses were generated as described previously (36.Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant IκBα pGEX-KG constructs were transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21 DE3. Cultures (400 ml) of E. coli were grown to an A600 nm of 0.6–0.8 and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 50 mm manitol, 10 mm sodium ascorbate, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)), mildly sonicated, and centrifuged. The supernatant was incubated with 0.5 ml of glutathione-agarose matrix (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The matrix was then washed four times with buffer A and two times with buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF). These GST fusion proteins were eluted off the matrix by buffer B containing 10 mm glutathione, dialyzed with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm PMSF, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Human non-small cell lung cancer cell line H460 (a kind gift of Dr. John Minna) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Murine pre-B-cell line 70Z/3 and its NEMO-deficient mutant 1.3E2 (a kind gift of Dr. Carol Sibley) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Retrovirus-infected H460 cells were maintained in medium with 1000 μg/ml of G418, whereas clones of 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 cells were selected in 300 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen). To obtain cytoplasmic proteins, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), resuspended in buffer C (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycophosphate, 5% glycerol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and incubated on ice for 15 min. At the end of incubation, 1:20 volume of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added. The cells were vortexed for 30 s and then subjected to centrifugation for 30 s. The supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic extracts. The protein concentrations of the cytoplasmic extracts were determined by using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Nuclei from parental and virus-infected H460, 70Z/3, or 1.3E2 were resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture and extracted at 4 °C on a rocker for 30 min, followed by Eppendorf centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were collected as nuclear extracts. To prepare whole cell extracts, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-glycophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the mixture was pippetted five or six times to disperse the cells followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatants were collected as whole cell extracts, and protein concentration was determined as described above. 10 μg of each nuclear extract sample was incubated with 0.1 pmol of32P-labeled double-stranded κB binding oligonucleotide (5′-GCTGGGGACTTTC-3′) or SP1 binding oligonucleotide (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCG GGGCGAGC-3′) in buffer containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, 5 mm MgCl2, and 12% glycerol at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were analyzed by 5% native PAGE followed by autoradiography. For competition and antibody-mediated supershift experiments, κB-specific or -nonspecific oligonucleotides or specified antibodies were added to reaction for 15 min at room temperature before the addition of radio isotope-labeled κB probe. Immobilized monoclonal antibody against FLAG (M2, Sigma) or mouse IgG-Sepharose beads as control was added to cellular extracts (4 mg) prepared from virus-infected H460 cells and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. In the case of immunoprecipitation with α-NEMO antibody, 10 μl of soluble antibody were added to cellular extracts for 30 min on ice. Protein G-Sepharose Cl-4B were then added to the mix, and incubation was performed at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with buffer containing 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycophosphate, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. In vitro kinase assay or Western blotting experiments were then performed. Beads from the immunoprecipitation experiments were used to incubate with soluble GST-IκBα proteins (10 μg/reaction) in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8 μm MgCl2, 3.3 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 4 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mm NaF, 5 mmβ-glycophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 30 min. 30 μl of reaction solution was added to each sample. 10 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added at the end of reaction, and the mixture was heated at 95 °C for 5 min and pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatants were then resolved on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. For in-solution kinase assay, protein samples (10 μl each of fractions from Superdex 200 column) were incubated with soluble GST-IκBα protein in the same reaction conditions mentioned above. 100–200 μg of whole cell extracts, cytoplasmic extracts, or proteins immunoprecipitated on agarose beads were heated in the presence of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE gel followed by transferring to nitrocellulose membranes. These membranes were incubated with antibodies against specified proteins in Tris-buffered-saline with Tween 20 followed by incubation with secondary antibody and development with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The primary antibodies used in these experiments were α-IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-371, 1:5000), p-IκBα (New England Biolabs, 9241S, 1:1000), α-FLAG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-807, 1:5000), α-NEMO (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-8330, 1:4000), α-RIP (Transduction Laboratories, R41220, 1:1000), α-IKKα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-7182, 1:4000), and α-IKKβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-7607, 1:5000). S100 extracts were prepared from H460 cells infected with retroviruses encoding HHV8 vFLIP or MRIT/cFLIP as described previously (37.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). These extracts were fractionated on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm PMSF. NF-κB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm of cells because of its association with a family of inhibitory proteins, called IκB (1.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 4.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). However, NF-κB is persistently present in the nuclei of human T-cell leukemia virus type I- and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cells and has been shown to contribute to the transforming ability of these viruses (15.Mosialos G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We were interested in checking whether infection by HHV8 virus might also lead to persistent NF-κB activation. To test this hypothesis we used electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to examine the DNA binding activity of nuclear NF-κB in three HHV8-infected PEL cell lines, BC-1, BC-3, and BCBL, respectively. We also used two non-HHV8-infected lymphoid cell lines, CEM and Jurkat, respectively, as controls for the above experiment. Consistent with a recent report (38.Keller S.A. Schattner E.J. Cesarman E. Blood. 2000; 96: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), persistent NF-κB activation was seen in all three HHV8-infected PEL cell lines, with the BC-1 cell line showing the highest and BCBL cell line showing the least NF-κB activation. In contrast, NF-κB binding activity was absent in the nuclear extracts of CEM and Jurkat cell lines (Fig. 1A). We next sought to analyze the nature and composition of the observed complex in the BC-1 cell line. As shown in Fig. 1B, the observed complex in the BC-1 cell line could be effectively competed with an excess cold probe containing κB binding sites but was unaffected by competition with a nonspecific DNA duplex. Finally, a supershift assay utilizing subunit-specific antibodies demonstrated that the observed complex contained the p65 and p50 subunits of NF-κB (Fig. 1B). To determine the mechanism of persistent NF-κB activation in PEL cell lines, we examined the phosphorylation status of IκBα protein by Western blot analysis. Consistent with the EMSA results, phosphorylation of IκBα was totally absent in CEM and Jurkat cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, phosphorylation of IκBα was readily detected in all three PEL cell lines and was present in the following order of magnitude: BC-1 > BC-3 > BCBL (Fig. 1C). Of interest, persistent phosphorylation of IκBα observed in BC-1 and BC-3 cell lines was significantly stronger than the TNF-induced IκBα-phosphorylation observed in Jurkat cells. Reprobing of the above blot with an IκBα antibody revealed a decrease in the level of total IκBα protein in the PEL cell lines (Fig. 1C). The above results suggest that the constitutive NF-κB activation in the PEL cell lines is probably due to persistent phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the IκBα protein. We have previously demonstrated that transient transfection-based overexpression of HHV8 vFLIP can lead to NF-κB activation (33.Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We were interested in determining whether the constitutive NF-κB activation observed in PEL cell lines might be mediated by HHV8 vFLIP. To test this hypothesis, we began by checking whether stable expression of HHV8 vFLIP can lead to constitutive NF-κB activation. For this purpose, we used retroviral-mediated gene transfer to generate mass culture of H460 cells with stable expression of FLAG epitope-tagged HHV8 vFLIP or MRIT/cFLIP. As shown in Fig. 2A, stable expression of HHV8 vFLIP in H460 cells lead to strong NF-κB binding activity as measured by gel shift assay. In contrast, cells expressing an empty vector or MRIT/cFLIP demonstrated low level basal NF-κB binding activity. The specificity of the NF-κB complex seen in the vFLIP-expressing cells was confirmed by competition with a cold NF-κB probe or a nonspecific probe (Fig. 2A). A supershift assay utilizing subunit specific antibodies demonstrated that the complex was a heterodimer of p65 and p50 subunits of NF-κB (Fig. 2A). Essentially similar results were obtained upon stable expression of HHV8 vFLIP in 293T and TF-1 cells (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Finally, expression of vFLIP in 293T and H460 cells was associated with an increase in NF-κB transcriptional activity as measured by a luciferase-based reporter assay (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Next, we examined the status of total and phosphorylated IκBα in H460 cells expressing empty vector, HHV8 vFLIP, or MRIT/cFLIP. Consistent with previous results with the PEL cell lines, expression of HHV8 vFLIP was associated with a decrease in the steady-state level of total IκBα and an increase in its phosphorylated form (Fig. 2D). Taken together, the above results suggest that HHV8 vFLIP leads to persistent NF-κB activation by constitutive phosphorylation of IκBα. To test the possibility that HHV8 vFLIP leads to persistent IκBα phosphorylation by interacting with and activating the IKK complex, FLAG-tagged HHV8 vFLIP was immunoprecipitated from the cytosolic extracts of H460-vFLIP cells using FLAG antibody beads and assayed for the IκBα kinase activity in an in vitro kinase reaction using GST-IκBα and [γ-32P]ATP. Parallel experiments utilizing a nonspecific antibody or an antibody against NEMO/IKKγ served as negative and positive controls. As shown in Fig. 3A, immunoprecipitate of vFLIP with the FLAG antibody was able to phosphorylate GST-IκBα, whereas an immunoprecipitate using a control antibody failed to do so. Similarly, immunoprecipitates of MRIT/cFLIP- or empty vector-expressing cells failed to phosphorylate GST-IκBα (Fig. 3A,top and bottom panels). The vFLIP-associated IKK activity was specific for Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IκBα, because it failed to phosphorylate a GST-IκBα mutant substrate in which both the above residues were mutated to alanine (Fig. 3A,middle panel). Collectively, these results suggest that HHV8 vFLIP associates with a cytosolic complex that possesses IKK activity. To determine the components of the HHV8 vFLIP-associated IKK activity, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were carried out. FLAG-tagged vFLIP and MRIT/cFLIP were immunoprecipitated using a FLAG monoclonal or a control mouse antibody, and the nature of the coimmunoprecipitated proteins was determined by Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, IKKα, IKKβ, and NEMO/IKKγ readily coimmunoprecipitated with vFLIP but were not detected in the immunoprecipitate of MRIT/cFLIP. In contrast, RIP was detected in the immunoprecipitates of both vFLIP and MRIT/cFLIP. Previous studies have demonstrated that cytokine-induced IKK activity is present in a multiprotein signalsome complex of ∼700 kDa (5.Mercurio F. Young D.B. Manning A.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 109-125PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). To determine whether HHV8 vFLIP stimulates IKK activation by interacting with this large molecular mass complex, we compared the chromatographic distribution of vFLIP in extracts prepared from H460-vFLIP cells. A parallel experiment with cellular extracts prepared from H460-MRIT/cFLIP cells served as a negative control. Following Superdex-200 fractionation of the above extracts, the column fractions were immunoprecipitated with FLAG (M2) monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitate was subsequently used for Western analysis with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the FLAG tag to detect the presence of FLAG-tagged vFLIP or MRIT/cFLIP as well as in an in vitrokinase assay using GST-IκBα as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, the majority of vFLIP was found migrating between 600 and 700 kDa, which also correlated with the fraction containing the IKK activity. In contrast, MRIT/cFLIP was found migrating between 443 and 200 kDa (Fig. 5A). We also examined the distribution of NEMO/IKKγ in the cell extracts prepared from vFLIP- and MRIT/cFLIP-expressing cells. Although the majority of NEMO/IKKγ was found migrating between 600 and 700 kDa, a smaller peak migrating near 450 kDa was detected in both cell lines (Fig. 6, A and B). As compared with MRIT-expressing cells, a relatively larger amount of NEMO/IKKγ in vFLIP-expressing cells was found in the ∼700-kDa fraction. Because this fraction has been previously shown to contain the IKK activity (5.Mercurio F. Young D.B. Manning A.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 109-125PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), these results suggest that expression of vFLIP leads to incorporation of NEMO/IKKγ into a constitutively active high molecular mass IKK complex. Finally, we examined the elution profile of IKKα and IKKβ in the cell extracts prepared from vFLIP-expressing cells using Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 6C, both of the above kinases were found to coelute with vFLIP in the column fractions 8–10, thereby demonstrating that vFLIP coelutes with both the catalytic and regulatory subunits of the IKK complex. Because the majority of vFLIP and the IKKs were detected in the same elution fractions, we next examined whether they are physically associated with each other. For this purpose, FLAG-tagged vFLIP or MRIT/cFLIP present in the various column fractions obtained following Superdex-200 fractionation were immunoprecipitated using the M2 FLAG antibody, and the presence of any associated NEMO/IKKγ was detected using Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 7A, NEMO/IKKγ was found to coimmunoprecipitate with vFLIP in the column fractions 8–10, suggesting that the two proteins not only comigrate but are the components of the same IKK signalsome complex. Similarly, both IKKα and IKKβ were found to coimmunoprecipitate with vFLIP (see below). Consistent with previous results, no NEMO/IKKγ was found to coimmunoprecipitate with MRIT/cFLIP (Fig. 7B). We next examined the proportion of the IKKs that associate with vFLIP in various column fractions. For this purpose, various column fractions were immunoprecipitated with M2 FLAG antibody beads, and the amount of IKKs found"

Here, we demonstrate that this pathway functions in cells that also contain voltage-gated Ca2+channels, neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores elicited a prolonged increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ dependent on extracellular Ca2+. Inhibitors of store-operated channels but not L-type channels diminished this response. The importance of this pathway to cardiac hypertrophy, which often is dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent transcription factors, was also assessed in this model. Hypertrophy and atrial natriuretic factor expression induced by angiotensin II or phenylephrine was more effectively attenuated by inhibitors of capacitative entry than of L-type channels. Additionally, cardiomyocytes were transfected with a construct encoding a fluorescent nuclear factor of activated T-cells chimeric protein to follow nuclear localization in response to thapsigargin, angiotensin II, and phenylephrine. This translocation was completely prevented by inhibitors of capacitative Ca2+ entry and only partially abrogated by inhibitors of L-type channels.

These agonists have been shown to elevate the concentration of cytoplasmic free Ca2+([Ca2+]i) in cardiomyocytes and to have positive inotropic effects on the heart (1.Liu S.J. Kennedy R.H. Am. J.

In addition to their importance in the acute regulation of cardiac function, their significance has increased further as the transcriptional pathways that lead to cardiac hypertrophy have been elucidated. Although initially compensatory, prolonged hypertrophy is often associated with decompensation, dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, fibrotic disease, and heart failure (3.Levy D. Garrison R.J.

Dorn II, G.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). One well studied mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy involves the overexpression of a constitutively active form of a G protein subunit, Gαq, which leads to chronic activation of PLC and the continuous production of IP3 and diacylglycerol (5.D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn 2nd., G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression in the heart of the PLC-activating angiotensin II (Ang II) type I receptor also leads to hypertrophy (6.Hein L. Stevens M.E. Barsh G.S. Pratt R.E. Kobilka B.K. Dzau V.J.

More clinically relevant, hypertrophied hearts induced by volume overload are commonly characterized by high levels of IP3-generating agonists such as Ang II (8.Dell'Italia L.J. Balcells E. Meng Q.C. Su X. Schultz D. Bishop S.P. Machida N. Straeter-Knowlen I.M. Hankes G.H. Dillon R. Cartee R.E. Oparil S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H961-H970PubMed Google Scholar). There are multiple signaling pathways downstream of PLC leading to cardiac hypertrophy. One involves diacylglycerol, protein kinase C, small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (9.Clerk A. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the MEK1-ERK1/2 branch of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (10.Bueno O.F. DeWindth L.J.K.M.T.

Biol. 2001; 21: 7460-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Two others involve IP3 and elevated levels of [Ca2+]i. One of these is dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent calmodulin kinase and the transcription factor MEF2 (13.Passier R. Zeng H. Frey N. Naya F.J. Nicol R.L. McKinsey T.A. Overbeek P. Richardson J.A. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and the other is mediated by the Ca2+/calmodulin-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin and the transcription factor NFAT3 (14.Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). The latter signaling pathway was first defined in lymphocytes (15.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar) and is fundamental to an array of biological responses in a variety of cell types (16.Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 17.Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). A rise in [Ca2+]i triggered by ligands generating IP3 leads to the activation of the phosphatase activity of calcineurin, the dephosphorylation of NFAT family members, and their translocation to the nucleus to initiate transcription. Rapid export of NFAT from the nucleus when [Ca2+]i levels drop prevents brief [Ca2+]i pulses from initiating transcription of NFAT-dependent genes (15.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar, 16.Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). A critical, unresolved issue for cardiac hypertrophy is the mechanism leading from IP3-mediated stimuli to elevated [Ca2+]i. In most cell types, the initial increase in [Ca2+]i in response to IP3-generating agonists is due to the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The subsequent depletion of ER Ca2+ stores results in an influx of extracellular Ca2+ into the cytoplasm, causing sustained elevations in [Ca2+]i, a process termed store-operated or capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) (18.Putney J.W.J. Capacitative Calcium Entry. Landes Biomedical, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar). Although highly characterized in nonexcitable cells, this pathway has not previously been identified in cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, it has recently been shown to coexist with L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in both smooth (19.Trepakova E.S. Csutora P. Hunton D.L. Marchase R.B. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26158-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and skeletal (20.Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 533: 185-199Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar) muscle cells. Here, we sought to determine whether a CCE pathway was present in NRVMs and to investigate whether this pathway contributes to the elevated [Ca2+]i associated with cardiac hypertrophy. Animal procedures conformed to the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, issued by the United States Institute for Laboratory Resources. Primary cultures of NRVMs were obtained from 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats and isolated from ventricular tissue by enzymatic dissociation as previously described (21.Sabri A. Byron K.L. Samarel A.M. Bell J. Lucchesi P.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). After isolation NRVMs were preplated for 10 min on laminin-coated 60-mm culture dishes to deplete fibroblasts and then plated at a final density of 40–400 cells/mm2 on either collagen-coated coverslips or 8-well slides. NRVMs were cultured overnight in a 4:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and M199 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 10 μmarabinose C. They were maintained for up to 3 days in a serum-free 4:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and M199 supplemented with 2% Nutridoma (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Invitrogen) (22.Taigen T. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1196-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) (medium). Confocal images were obtained using a Leica DMIRBE inverted Nomarski/epifluorescence microscope outfitted with Leica TCS NT Laser Confocal optics through a 40× objective lens. NRVMs were sparsely plated so as to discourage spontaneous beating and loaded with 3 μm Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 AM (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C in a 4:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and M199. At 20 min, the medium was changed to a dye-free Hanks buffer, and the NRVMs were incubated for 30 min. The 488-nm argon laser line was used to excite the Ca2+ indicator, and the emitted fluorescence was collected at 530 ± 30 nm. All confocal experiments were performed at 36 ± 1 °C on nonbeating cells. Digital imaging utilized NRVMs loaded with 2 μm Fura 2-AM (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C in Hanks' buffer for 30 min. NRVMs were washed twice and incubated for 10 min more. The cells were imaged on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope through a 20× objective with dual excitation at 340 and 380 nm and monitored at 510 nm (23.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The imaging was performed at room temperature. NRVMs were maintained for 48 h in medium alone or in the presence of agonists and/or blockers as described for the various experimental conditions. The media and drug treatments were replaced daily. For immunocytochemistry NRVMs were fixed in ice-cold 100% methanol for 10 min, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked in saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Anti-α-actinin antibody (Sigma) and anti-atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) polyclonal antiserum (Peninsula Laboratories) were added at dilutions of 1:500 and 1:300, respectively, in saline containing 2% albumin and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies (Alexa fluoro 488 goat anti-rabbit and 568 goat anti-mouse; Molecular Probes) were used at a dilution of 1:400 in saline containing 5% rat serum and incubated for 30 min. Cell size was determined using Universal Imaging Image 1 software. Mean cell areas were determined for >100 cells in each of the treatment groups for each experiment. Percentages of NRVMs positive for ANF were determined by counting the total number of NRVMs in a field based on α-actinin staining and then determining the number with nuclear rings of ANF. At least 150 cells /condition/experiment were counted, and each experiment was performed with at least three independent isolates. Four hours after plating, NRVMs were transfected with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-NFAT4 construct under a Myc promoter using the pcDNA3 plasmid (24.Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). At 3 h the medium was replaced, and the cells were incubated for 36–60 h. Transfection efficiency ranged from 6 to 11%. The cells were treated with various agonists for 15 min in the presence or absence of inhibitors and then fixed with methanol as described above. In these experiments the EGFP-NFAT chimera utilizes the nuclear localization signal of the NFAT4 isoform instead of the NFAT3 isoform that is more highly expressed in cardiomyocytes (17.Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Both of these isoforms have calcium/calmodulin/calcineurin-dependent nuclear localization signals (17.Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 24.Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). A recombinant adenovirus expressing EGFP-NFAT was constructed (25.Hitt M.M. Addison C.L. Graham F.L. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 40: 137-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the chimeric construct (24.Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) was cloned into the adenovirus transfer vector pCA13 (Microbix Biosystems), which allows expression of the target gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The plasmid containing the cDNA was cotransfected into low passage 293 cells (26.Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3445) Google Scholar) along with pJM17 (containing the entire Ad5 genome except the E1 region) (27.McGrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) to allow in vivo homologous recombination of the two plasmids. Following the recombination, replication-deficient adenovirus expressing EGFP-NFAT formed plaques on monolayer 293 cells. Individual plaques were picked and screened for recombinant adenovirus by PCR using cDNA-specific primers. Recombinant adenovirus was identified and purified through several rounds of plaque purification. High titer stocks of purified recombinant adenoviruses were generated by the virus production core at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The MEK1 adenovirus was kindly provided by Dr. J. D. Molkentin. Four hours after plating, cardiomyocyte cultures were coinfected with MEK1 and EGFP-NFAT recombinant adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 25 plaque-forming units/cell in 250 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 18 h at 37 °C and cultured for an additional 36 h. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is associated with elevated [Ca2+]i (28.Chien K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Previous work has focused on enhanced Ca2+ influx through L-type channels (29.Schroder F. Handrock R. Beuckelmann D.J. Hirt S. Hullin R. Priebe L. Schwinger R.H. Weil J. Herzig S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) or via the reverse mode of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger (30.Dipla K. Mattiello J.A. Margulies K.B. Jeevanandam V. Houser S.R. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Here, however, we asked whether sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)/ER Ca2+ store depletion activates an influx of extracellular Ca2+ that manifests as a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i. In initial experiments we utilized confocal microscopy and sparsely plated NRVMs that were not exhibiting spontaneous beating. We compared [Ca2+]iresponses to SR/ER store depletion achieved using the irreversible SR/ER Ca2+ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin to [Ca2+]i increases because of KCl-induced depolarization. Sections of quiescent NRVMs detecting the Ca2+-sensitive indicator Oregon Green were examined prior to exposure to either thapsigargin or KCl and then at selected intervals. Both stimuli resulted in significant increases in [Ca2+]i that persisted for more than 10 min with extracellular Ca2+ present (Fig. 1A). Control experiments with thapsigargin in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ detected increases in [Ca2+]ithat persisted only for up to 1 min (data not shown). When extracellular Ca2+ was chelated, both the signal caused by thapsigargin and that caused by KCl rapidly decreased (Fig. 1B), further illustrating the dependence of the sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i on extracellular Ca2+. The experiments with thapsigargin thus support the premise that SR/ER Ca2+ store depletion, even in the absence of agonist-induced second messengers, leads to Ca2+influx, CCE, in cardiomyocytes. We next examined the effects of various inhibitors on the sustained [Ca2+]i increases induced by thapsigargin or KCl. Increases caused by thapsigargin treatment were more sensitive to inhibition by the CCE inhibitors glucosamine (31.Darbha S. Marchase R.B. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and SKF96365 (18.Putney J.W.J. Capacitative Calcium Entry. Landes Biomedical, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar) than to the L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor verapamil (Fig. 1, C–E). In contrast, increases caused by KCl were relatively insensitive to the CCE inhibitors but were effectively blocked by verapamil (Fig. 1, C–E). These data (summarized in Fig. 1F) are consistent with a CCE pathway for extracellular Ca2+ that is dependent upon a class of Ca2+-permeant channels distinct from voltage-gated channels. A conventional protocol for defining CCE calls for the depletion of ER/SR Ca2+ stores in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, resulting in an increase in [Ca2+]i that returns to base line after the stores are thoroughly depleted (18.Putney J.W.J. Capacitative Calcium Entry. Landes Biomedical, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar). The subsequent addition of extracellular Ca2+ then results in a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i if CCE has been activated. This protocol was carried out with NRVMs, employing the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fura-2 and whole cell digital imaging that allowed for more rapid detection of [Ca2+]i changes. Treatment with thapsigargin resulted in a transient increase in [Ca2+]i that lasted for about 90 s as Ca2+ in the SR stores released to the cytoplasm. When 1.8 mm Ca2+ was restored to the medium, a robust and persistent increase in [Ca2+]i was observed that remained at about 80% of the maximal increase 4 min after Ca2+ addition (Fig. 2A). The addition of the L-type channel inhibitors verapamil and nifedipine 90 s after the addition of Ca2+ did not substantively affect the [Ca2+]i profiles (Fig. 2, B andF). Amiloride, an inhibitor of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (32.Slaughter R.S. Garcia M.L. Cragoe J.E.J. Reeves J.P. Kaczorowski G.J.

However, when glucosamine (Fig. 2D) or SKF96365 (Fig. 2E) was added, [Ca2+]i decreased to less than 20% of the control value. Comparable results were observed in both sparsely plated, quiescent cells as well as in more densely plated cells that were spontaneously beating prior to the removal of extracellular Ca2+. All conditions were pooled in the summary data shown (Fig. 2F). These results provide further support for the existence of CCE in cardiomyocytes. We next determined whether physiological agonists also induce an apparent CCE in cardiomyocytes. As noted above and by previous authors (33.Lukuta A. Kirby M.S. Gaa S.T. Lederer W.J. Rogers T.B. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1994; 5: 50-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), substantial cell-to-cell variability in [Ca2+]iresponse profiles depends in large part on the local density of the NRVMs being examined. Two IP3-generating hypertrophic agonists, phenylephrine (PE) and Ang II, produced [Ca2+]i increases consistent with CCE across this spectrum of phenotypes. In sparsely plated cells there was usually no spontaneous activity prior to treatment (Fig. 3A), whereas in more dense cultures spontaneous beating produced correlative fluctuations in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3, B, C,E, and F). Despite this variability, IP3-inducing agonists produced an increase in resting [Ca2+]i that in all cases was insensitive to verapamil and inhibited by blockers of CCE, suggesting a common mechanism. In the example shown in Fig. 3A, PE led to an increase in [Ca2+]i and then to the initiation of sporadic beating. The addition of verapamil abolished the [Ca2+]i spikes, but [Ca2+]iremained elevated. In moderately dense cultures prior to treatment, [Ca2+]i spikes were often apparent at about 15-s intervals (Fig. 3B). Following the addition of PE there was a substantial increase in time-averaged [Ca2+]ias well as an acceleration of the beat amplitude and frequency. Again, the addition of verapamil abolished the spikes, but [Ca2+]i remained elevated. In even more dense cultures, spontaneous beating was usually more rapid and resulted in larger fluxes in [Ca2+]i. Agonists led to an increase in time-averaged [Ca2+]i, as shown for Ang II in Fig. 3C. The addition of verapamil stopped the beating, although [Ca2+]i remained elevated. To further address whether the increase in time-averaged [Ca2+]i was through L-type channels, we added PE in the presence of verapamil. PE still led to a rapid elevation in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3D), indicating that the time-averaged increase was not dependent on L-type Ca2+channels. However, the subsequent addition of the CCE inhibitor glucosamine dropped [Ca2+]i levels precipitously, although they returned to the elevated level when the inhibitor was washed out. When glucosamine treatment preceded the addition of PE (data not shown) or Ang II (Fig. 3E), there was little or no increase in base-line [Ca2+]i, and the frequency of the [Ca2+]i spikes failed to accelerate. Lastly, resting [Ca2+]i increases caused by Ang II in rapidly beating cells were reversed by glucosamine (Fig. 3F), although beating was unaffected. Thus, in NRVMs exhibiting a wide variety of spontaneous phenotypes, both of these IP3-mediated agonists led to increases in [Ca2+]i (43 of 52 cells) that were relatively insensitive to inhibitors of L-type channels (19 of 20 cells) and sensitive to inhibitors of CCE (13 of 17 cells). Taken together, these data define a Ca2+ entry pathway independent of L-type channels and implicate a role for CCE in cardiomyocytes following treatment with IP3-mediated agonists. Cultured NRVMs undergo cellular responses that parallel many of the responses seenin vivo in hypertrophying hearts (10.Bueno O.F. DeWindth L.J.K.M.T. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E.

These include an increase in contractile protein content, an increase in cell size, elevated [Ca2+]i, enhanced sarcomeric organization, and the induction of fetal isoforms of cardiac genes (35.Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The induction of ANF gene expression is a highly conserved and cardinal feature of ventricular hypertrophy (35.Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and is readily detectable with immunocytochemistry as perinuclear staining (22.Taigen T. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1196-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). NRVMs were plated overnight and then cultured for 48 h in the presence of agonists and/or inhibitors. In the experiment shown in Fig. 4, NRVMs were stained for α-actinin (red) and ANF (green). The selected photomicrographs represent data from at least three different cell preparations, and the averaged data are presented in Fig. 4K. Both Ang II and PE markedly increased the percentage of cells expressing ANF. Inclusion of CCE inhibitors more potently blunted ANF expression than verapamil or nifedipine. In addition, both Ang II and PE also led to cell size increases that were attenuated more effectively by inhibitors of CCE than of L-type channels (Fig. 4L). In other experiments, the cells were cultured for 48 h in thapsigargin. This proved to be completely lethal in controls and in the presence of all inhibitors except glucosamine, in which an estimated one-third of the cells survived (data not shown). To further establish the involvement of CCE in NFAT-mediated hypertrophic responses, we transfected NRVMs with an EGFP-NFAT plasmid (24.Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and were able to fluorescently monitor the stimulus-induced translocation of the NFAT chimera into the nucleus. Transfected NRVMs were subjected to a 15-min treatment with Ang II, PE, or thapsigargin in the presence or absence of inhibitors and then fixed and assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Without treatment, fluorescence was restricted to the cytoplasm in >90% of the transfected cells (Fig. 5, A and F). Treatment with Ang II or PE for 15 min led to the translocation of EGFP-NFAT into the nucleus in the majority of transfected cells (Fig. 5, B and G). The presence of either CCE inhibitor, glucosamine or SKF96365, prevented the nuclear translocation of the NFAT chimera in response to either agonist (Fig. 5,C, D, H, and I). In contrast, verapamil had only a partial effect (Fig. 5, E andJ), and nifedipine had almost no effect (Fig. 5K). The commitment to hypertrophy caused by a physiological stimulus such as Ang II or PE is likely to require the simultaneous involvement of multiple signaling pathways, all perhaps only modestly activated and likely to be essential (4.Molkentin J.D.

We treated mouse fibroblasts with H2O2 and found that sublethal doses of H2O2 induced a transient multi-phase cell cycle arrest at the G1, S, and G2 phases but not the M phase. Western blot analysis demonstrated that this transient cell cycle arrest is associated with the down-regulation of cyclins D1 and D3 and up-regulation of the CKI p21Cip1 expression. We also demonstrate that the induction in p21Cip1 expression by H2O2 is at least partially mediated at the transcriptional level and can occur in the absence of p53 function. Further immunoprecipitation kinase and immunodepletion assays indicated that in response to H2O2 treatment, the down-regulation of cyclin Ds expression are associated with repression of cyclin D-CDK4, whereas the accumulation of p21Cip1 is responsible for the inhibition of cyclin E and A-CDK2 activity and associated with the down-regulation of cyclin B-CDC2 activity. These data could account for the cell cycle arrest at the G1, S, and G2 phases following H2O2stimulation. Deletion of p21Cip1, restoration of cyclin D expression, or overexpression of cyclin E alone is insufficient to effectively overcome the cell cycle arrest caused by sublethal doses of H2O2. By contrast, overexpression of the humanHerpesvirus 8 K cyclin, which can mimic the function of cyclin D and E, is enough to override this transient cell cycle arrest. On the basis of our findings, we propose a model in which moderate levels of H2O2 induce a transient multi-phase cell cycle arrest at least partially through up-regulation of p21Cip1 and down-regulation of cyclin D expression.

Accumulation of excess ROS, which are toxic to cells, can cause oxidative stress leading to damage to proteins, nucleic acid, and cell membranes (4.Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 5.Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidative stress has also been implicated in a variety of human diseases, including atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and aging (2.Cerutti P.A. Lancet. 1994; 344: 862-863Abstract PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 3.Cerutti P.A. Science. 1985; 227: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar, 6.Cross C.E. Halliwell B. Borish E.T. Pryor W.A. Ames B.N. Saul R.L. McCord J.M. Harman D. Ann. Intern. Med. 1987; 107: 526-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). To protect against the potentially detrimental effects caused by elevated levels of ROS, cells deploy antioxidant defenses and activate damage removal, repair, and replacement systems. To counter oxidative stress, cells constitutively express enzymes that neutralize ROS and repair and replace the damage caused by ROS (4.Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 5.Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cells also mount “adaptive responses” to elevated levels of oxidative stress. Mammalian cells respond to oxidative stress with an increase in expression of antioxidant enzymes, including glutathioneS-transferases, peroxidases, and superoxide dismutases, and activation of protective genes, including those encoding the heat shock proteins. Stationary phase (noncycling) cells are intrinsically resistant to high levels of ROS, whereas actively dividing cells are prone to oxidative damage, because their DNA is uncoiled and exposed while they engage in rapid DNA replication. To defend against the potential damages induced by oxidative stress, proliferating cells enter a transient cell cycle arrest, during which DNA is protected by histone proteins, energy is conserved through reduced expression of nonessential genes, and the expression of shock and stress proteins is increased. This transient growth arrest also allows time to repair and/or replace the damaged DNA so that the mutated DNA will not be replicated and/or transferred to daughter cells. This also gives the cells extra time to mount an adaptive response to counteract further oxidative damage. Thus, this transient growth arrest is a crucial component of the cellular response to oxidative stress (7.Davies K.J. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 41-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Davies K.J. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). However, besides transient cell cycle arrest, the cell also exhibits a wide range of adaptive cellular responses ranging from transient growth arrest, to permanent growth arrest, to apoptosis, and ultimately to necrosis, depending on the level of oxidative stress experienced (7.Davies K.J. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 41-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,8.Davies K.J. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Sublethal levels of ROS induce a temporary cell cycle arrest that is believed to protect cells from DNA damage itself, consuming excess energy and resources and incorporating mutations following DNA damages. Following repair or detoxification, the dividing cells reinitiate cell cycle progression. However, when the oxidative stress is too severe and the cells do not have the ability to adapt or resist the stress or to repair the damaged cellular components, the cells may respond by undergoing permanent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. At even higher levels of ROS, cells undergo cell death by necrosis. Nevertheless, recent emerging evidence also demonstrates that ROS are physiological mediators of cell signaling and functions and are produced by a variety of cells after stimulation with cytokines, peptide growth factors, and agonists of receptors (9.Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 10.Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7120) Google Scholar, 11.Finkel T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). For example, cytosolic ROS produced in response to stimulation by growth factors are involved in mediating the proliferative response (11.Finkel T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Therefore, depending on the level, ROS exerts two physiological effects: damage to various cell components and activation of specific signaling pathways. The mammalian cell division cycle is traditionally divided into G1 (gap phase 1), S (DNA synthesis), G2 (gap phase 2), and M (mitosis) phases. Progression through each phase of the cell cycle is controlled by co-operative activity of distinct cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their regulatory subunits, cyclins (12.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). The cyclins have specificity for different CDK subunits. The D-type cyclins (cyclins D1, D2, and D3) bind to and activate CDK4 and CDK6 preferentially, whereas cyclin E interacts predominantly with CDK2, cyclin A associates primarily with CDK2 and CDC2 (12.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar, 13.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M.

Dev. 1993; 3: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and cyclin B associates specifically with CDC2 (also called CDK1) (12.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar, 15.Lauper N. Beck A.R. Cariou S. Richman L. Hofmann K. Reith W. Slingerland J.M. Amati B.

Biol. 1999; 19: 612-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The association of CDK4 or CDK6 with D-type cyclins is important for G1 phase progression, whereas the CDK2-cyclin E complex is essential for initiation of the S phase. Progression through the S phase is regulated by the CDK2-cyclin A complex, whereas the transition from G2 to M is mediated by CDC2-cyclin B. The principal cellular substrates of the cyclin-CDKs are members of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) family of pocket proteins (pRB, p107, and p130) (17.Lam E.W.-F. La Thangue N.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 18.Grana X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 19.Mulligan G. Jacks T. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 223-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In their hypophosphorylated forms, these pocket proteins bind to members of the E2F family of transcription factors, thereby negatively regulating transcription of E2F-dependent genes that are required for entry into and transition through S phase of the cell cycle (17.Lam E.W.-F. La Thangue N.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20.Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Sardet C. LeCam L.E.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). During G1 to S transition, phosphorylation of pRB is initiated by cyclin D-dependent kinases and is completed by cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 (12.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar, 13.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). CDKs are negatively regulated by two classes of CDK inhibitors (CKIs): the CIP/KIP and the INK4 families of proteins. The CIP/KIP proteins (p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2) target both cyclin D-CDK4/6 and cyclin E/A-CDK2 by binding to the cyclin-CDK complexes, whereas the INK4 family (p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d) specifically inhibit cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes through direct association with the CDK components, thereby preventing their interaction with D-type cyclins (12.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar, 13.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). The CIP/KIP proteins are inhibitors of cyclin E- and A-dependent CDK2, but p21Cip1 (more than p27Kip1) at low stoichiometric levels acts as positive regulator of cyclin D-dependent CDK4/6 kinases (23.Cheng M.

An understanding of the cellular responses to oxidative stress will provide useful insights into the mechanisms of aging and transformation as well as the pathogenesis of a variety of aging-related diseases. The cellular responses to oxidative stress, in particular those in response to sublethal doses of ROS, has not been thoroughly characterized. Several recent studies using human diploid fibroblasts showed that H2O2 induced a permanent G1 growth arrest, which is phenotypically similar to replicative senescence (25.Chen Q. Fischer A. Reagan J.D. Yan L.J. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4337-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 26.Chen Q.M. Bartholomew J.C. Campisi J. Acosta M. Reagan J.D. Ames B.N.

In this study, we investigated the nature of the transient cell cycle arrest induced by H2O2, as a source of ROS, in mouse fibroblasts and go on to explore the mechanisms by which H2O2 induced this proliferation arrest. Wild type mice and mice with deletion of p21Cip1 (28.Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) genes were maintained at the animal facilities of the Imperial College (London, United Kingdom). Primary MEFs were isolated from day 13.5 embryos derived from the corresponding colonies of wild type or gene knock-out mice as described previously (29.Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3861) Google Scholar). Each embryo was dispersed and trypsinized for 20 min at 37 °C, and the resulting cells were grown for 1 day in a 10-cm-diameter tissue culture plate. After which, the cells were replated onto a 15-cm dish and allowed to grow for 2 days. These cells, designated passage number 0 cells, were stored in liquid nitrogen for later use. The MEFs were cultured and passaged as described previously (30.Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). 106 cells were replated every 3 days onto 100-mm plates. NIH 3T3, Swiss 3T3, and p21Cip1-null (31.Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar) fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The NIH 3T3-D1, NIH 3T3-E, and NIH 3T3-K cell lines have been described previously (32.Child E.S. Mann D.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3311-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and exogenous cyclin expression was induced by incubation with 3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG; Sigma) for 24 h. H2O2 was purchased from Sigma (H-1009, 30% w/w solution) and was administered to the cells as a 10× solution in growth medium. For H2O2 treatment, fibroblasts were grown to 60% confluence, and the tissue culture medium was changed before the addition of H2O2. For synchronizing cells at the G0/G1 phase by serum deprivation (33.Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), SWISS 3T3 fibroblasts were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% fetal calf serum for 48 h, before 10% fetal calf serum was added to induce the cells to re-enter the cell cycle. For synchronization at the G1/S transition, NIH 3T3 cells were first incubated with thymidine (25 mm; Sigma) for 16 h, released into the cell cycle for 12 h after removal of thymidine, and then treated again with thymidine for another 16 h. After the second block, thymidine was washed away and replaced with culture medium. Typically, 65–75% of cells re-entered the cell cycle and progressed into the S phase after the double thymidine block. To block cells at the metaphase/anaphase of M, the cells were treated with nocodazole (50 ng/ml; Sigma) for 16 h. The rounded up cells were detached by “mechanical shake-off,” washed, and resuspended in nocodazole-free culture medium for them to re-enter the cell cycle. Cell cycle analysis was performed by combined propidium iodide and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) staining. Subconfluent fibroblasts with or without H2O2treatment were incubated for 30 min with 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma). The cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in PBS before fixing in 90% ethanol. The fixed cells were incubated first with 2 m HCl, then with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature, and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibodies (BD Biosciences) at 1:3 dilution for 30 min, with PBS washes between each treatment. The cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), 0.1 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% trisodium citrate for 30 min prior to analysis using a Becton Dickinson FACSort analyzer. The cell cycle profile was analyzed using the Cell Quest software. Western blot cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells with three times packed cell volume of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, pH.8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate) on ice for 20 min. The protein yield was quantified by Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The samples corresponding to 50 μg of lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and recognized by appropriate antibodies. The antibodies against p21Cip1 (M-19), p27Kip1 (C-19), CDK4 (C-22), CDK6 (C-21), CDK2 (M-2), CDC2 (C-19), cyclin D1 (HD11), cyclin D1–3 (H-295), cyclin A (C-19), cyclin E (M-20), and cyclin B1 (M-433) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-p27Kip1(K25020) and anti-p21Cip1 (F-5) monoclonal antibodies were acquired from Transduction Laboratories and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. The exogenous cyclins in the inducible NIH 3T3-D1, NIH 3T3-E, and NIH 3T3-K cell lines were detected by antibodies against FLAG (M2 from Sigma), human cyclin E (HE12 from Santa Cruz), and hemagglutinin (12CA5 from Roche Molecular Biochemicals), respectively. Cyclin D1 was FLAG-tagged, the K cyclin was hemagglutinin-tagged, and the human cyclin E can be distinguished from the endogenous mouse protein by the use of an antibody specific for human cyclin E. The anti-α-tubulin, monoclonal TAT-1 has been described previously (32.Child E.S. Mann D.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3311-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Dako) and visualized by the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For kinase assays, cells collected were washed with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 27 trypsin inhibitor unit/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4. 200 μg of protein lysate was immunoprecipitated with 1–2 μg of antibody (CDC2, CDK4, cyclin E, or cyclin A for CDK2 immunoprecipitation, 100 μg of protein, and 1 μg of antibody was used) and protein-Sepharose G beads (Amersham Biosciences) (50% v/v) overnight at 4 °C. The G beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with assay buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 μm cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor). The kinase assay was performed with 500 ng of histone H1/assay or C-terminal GST-Rb (C-terminal 792–928) (34.Godden-Kent D. Talbot S.J. Boshoff C. Chang Y. Moore P. Weiss R.A. Mittnacht S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4193-4198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as substrate, 20 μm ATP, and 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in 20 μl of assay buffer. The samples were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with the addition of 50 μl of sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. The samples were resolved on a 12% gel (15 μl/15-well mini gel). The gel was then fixed and Coomassie-stained, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described for the kinase assay. For immunodepletion experiments, two extra immunoprecipitations were performed with either the anti-p21Cip1 or the anti-p27Kip1 monoclonal antibody cross-linked to protein G beads with the dimethylpimelidate method (35.Barnouin K. Fredersdorf S. Eddaoudi A. Mittnacht S. Pan L.X. Du M.Q. Lu X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6388-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The subsequent immunodepleted supernatants were then analyzed by Western blotting. Cells cultured on coverslips were treated with or without 250 μmH2O2 for 4 h. The cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and then washed and permeablized for 5 min with 0.5% (v/v) Triton/PBS. The cells were then incubated for 1 h to overnight with monoclonal antibodies against p21Cip1 or p27Kip1, washed, and incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary FITC-conjugated antibodies (Molecular Bioprobes) to visualize the staining. For mitotic index assay, exponentially growing fibroblasts were cultured on coverslips and synchronized by double thymidine block and release. After entering the G2/M phase, these cells were treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole (to trap cells that had progressed through G2 into mitosis) in the presence or absence of 250 μm H2O2. The cells were fixed and stained as above except 20 μg/ml of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) was added with the secondary antibody for 1 h to visualize the DNA. The nuclear morphology of the cells was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. The number of cells displaying condensed chromosome morphology was counted and scored as mitotic and expressed as a percentage of the total. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. 20 μg of RNA, prepared as above, was resolved on 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gels. Following electrophoresis, RNA were transferred to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and subjected to Northern blotting as previously described (33.Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). p21Cip1 mRNA was detected by hybridization with its full-length 32P-labeled mouse cDNA probe (36.el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). Actin mRNA was detected by a β-actin probe (37.Deininger M.W. Vieira S.A. Parada Y. Banerji L. Lam E.W.-F. Peters G. Mahon F.X. Kohler T. Goldman J.M. Melo J.V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8005-8013PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of NIH3T3 cells were performed using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method as described previously (33.Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Briefly, calcium phosphate precipitates containing 10 μg of the wild type mouse p21Cip1 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3b-4542) (38.Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) together with 2 μg of a β-galactosidase transfection control plasmid (pJ4Ωβ-gal) (33.Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) were incubated overnight with cycling 5 × 106 NIH3T3 cells in a 10-cm dish. The transfected NIH3T3 were then washed, treated with H2O2, and harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays, as described previously (33.Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that sublethal doses of H2O2 induced senescence-like permanent G1 cell cycle arrest in human fibroblasts 48 h after stimulation (26.Chen Q.M. Bartholomew J.C. Campisi J. Acosta M. Reagan J.D. Ames B.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 27.Chen Q.M. Liu J. Merrett J.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To investigate the more imminent and short term effects of H2O2 on cell cycle progression, we treated NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with sublethal doses (100–500 μm) of H2O2 and discovered that H2O2 caused cells to transiently arrest progression through the cell cycle (data not shown). Initial examination of the propidium iodide staining alone indicated that there was no significant change in cell cycle distribution after H2O2 treatment. However, more detailed analysis of BrdUrd incorporation demonstrated a dramatic decrease in DNA synthesis detectable as early as 2 h after the addition of 250 μm of H2O2 (Fig. 1). DNA synthesis was almost completely abolished between 4–8 h after H2O2 treatment, after which the cells were temporarily delayed in the G2/M phases. At 48 h, the cells attained a more normal cell cycle profile, although proportionately more cells were found in the G1 phase, perhaps reflecting the build up of senescent-like cells previously reported (26.Chen Q.M. Bartholomew J.C. Campisi J. Acosta M. Reagan J.D. Ames B.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Notably, there was no apparent change in the proportion of cells in the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle accompanying the transient arrest in DNA synthesis induced by the H2O2treatment. This indicated that the H2O2-induced growth arrest was not confined only to the S phase and also involved other phases of the cell cycle. Taken together, these findings suggested that sublethal doses of H2O2 induced a rapid but transient multi-phase cell cycle arrest in mouse fibroblasts. To demonstrate that this effect was not restricted to the NIH3T3 cell line, we also examined the effect of H2O2 on the proliferation of low passage (<2 passages) MEFs and found that H2O2 also induced temporary cell cycle arrest in normal primary cells (see Fig. 8).Figure 8Cell cycle analysis of wild type, and p21 null mouse embryo fibroblasts after H2O2treatment. Low passage (≤2) wild type or p21−/−MEFs were treated with 250 μmH2O2, labeled with BrdUrd for 30 min, and collected at the times indicated. The cells were permeablized and stained with propidium iodide and FITC-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibodies prior to FACS analysis. The percentages of cells in each cell cycle phase (G1, S, and G2/M) determined by DNA contents and stained positive for BrdUrd are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm this hypothesis and investigate the nature of this multi-phase cell cycle arrest, we tested the ability of H2O2 to arrest fibroblasts at different phases of the cell cycle. To synchronize cells at different cell cycle phases, Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were first arrested at G0 by serum starvation and then stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by reintroduction of serum (Fig. 2). After serum stimulation, the fibroblasts traversed the late G1, early S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle at 12, 16, and 24 h, respectively. At 28 h after serum stimulation, the majority of the cells re-entered the G1 phase from the G2/M phase (Fig. 2A). To study the effects of H2O2 on different cell cycle phases, these serum-stimulated cells were either untreated or treated with 250 μm H2O2 and harvested 4 h later for cell cycle analysis. H2O2 prevented the fibroblasts from progressing further"

We previously reported that overexpression of TIMP-3 inhibits MMPs and induces apoptotic cell death in a variety of cell types and demonstrated that apoptosis is mediated through the N terminus of TIMP-3, which harbors the MMP inhibitory domain. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying TIMP-3-induced apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of TIMP-3 induced activation of initiator caspase-8 and -9 and promoted caspase-mediated cleavage of the death substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and focal adhesion kinase. Furthermore, TIMP-3 induced mitochondrial activation as demonstrated by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c. Intervention studies demonstrated that overexpression of Bcl-2, the anti-apoptotic mitochondrial membrane protein, or CrmA, a viral serpin inhibitor of caspase-8, completely inhibited TIMP-3-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, a dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain mutant inhibited TIMP-3-induced death substrate cleavage and apoptotic death. Taken together, these results indicate that TIMP-3 overexpression induces a type II apoptotic pathway initiated via a Fas-associated death domain-dependent mechanism.

The N-terminal domain contains a highly conserved CXC motif deemed responsible for MMP inhibition, whereas the smaller C-terminal domain confers specific functions such as the ability of TIMP-1 to interact with pro-MMP-9 and of TIMP-2 to interact with pro-MMP-2 (7.Gomez D.E.

Thus, TIMPs play important roles in regulating cellular functions that are dependent on matrix composition such as invasion, migration, differentiation, and proliferation. Several additional functions have also been attributed to individual TIMPs such as regulation of angiogenesis, activation of pro-MMP-2, and mitogenesis (14.Takigawa M. Nishida Y. Suzuki F. Kishi J.

Using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, we recently demonstrated that overexpression of TIMP-3 in human vascular smooth muscle cells and cancer cell cultures reduces cell migration and promotes apoptotic cell death, the latter being evoked through an unknown mechanism (19.Baker A.H. George S.J. Zaltsman A.B. Murphy G. Newby A.C. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 20.Ahonen M. Baker A.H. Kahari V.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2310-2315PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this unique phenotype induced by TIMP-3 translates to a beneficial reduction in vascular neointima formation in a human model of late vein graft failure (21.George S.J. Lloyd C.T. Angelini G.D. Newby A.C. Baker A.H. Circulation. 2000; 101: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The pro-death domain of TIMP-3 has recently been localized to the N terminus, the region associated with MMP inhibitory activity (22.Bond M. Murphy G. Bennett M. Amour A. Knauper V. Newby A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41358-41363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); and it has been proposed, at least in colon cancer lines, that TIMP-3 promotes death through stabilization of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) receptors on the cell surface, leading to increased susceptibility to apoptosis (23.Smith M.R. Kung H.F. Durum S.K. Colburn N.H. Sun Y. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Interestingly, deficiency of TIMP-3 in homozygous knockout mice results in enhanced apoptosis during mammary gland involution (24.Fata J.E. Leco K.J. Voura E.B. Yu H.Y.E. Waterhouse P. Murphy G. Moorehead R.A. Khokha R. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), suggesting that the physiological levels of TIMP-3 play an important role in regulating apoptosis during a number of physiological and pathological processes. It is therefore important to define the mechanism(s) through which TIMP-3 regulates apoptotic mediators when overexpressed. Apoptotic cell death can be induced by a variety of stimuli, including death ligands such as TNF-α, Fas ligand, and TRAIL; DNA-damaging agents; and loss of matrix attachment in adherence-dependent cells. Many of these stimuli activate the apoptotic cascade through the action of two distinct initiator caspases, caspase-8 and -9. Caspase-9 is an important regulator of downstream effector caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7) in response to signals generated by the mitochondria (25.Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar,26.Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.D. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6230) Google Scholar). Its activation requires the formation of a cytosolic complex with apoptosis protease activating factor, ATP, and cytochromec released from the mitochondria (26.Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.D. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6230) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 is typically recruited to activated death receptors via interactions with adaptor proteins such as FADD, where they form part of the death-inducing signaling complex (27.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V. Science. 1998; 277: 1305-1308Crossref Scopus (5151) Google Scholar). Two caspase-8-initiated apoptotic signaling pathways have been described (28.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). A strong activation of caspase-8 in response to death receptor activation can directly activate downstream effector caspases (type I pathway), whereas a weaker activation of caspase-8 can initiate mitochondrial activation, resulting in mitochondrial membrane depolarization, release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and effector caspases (type II pathway) (28.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). During a type II pathway, the mitochondria act as amplifiers, resulting in additional caspase-8 activation (28.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the cellular mechanism activated by overexpression of TIMP-3 in primary cultures of both vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and a HeLa carcinoma cell line. We show that TIMP-3 induces a FADD-dependent type II apoptotic signaling pathway. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were purchased from Microbix (Toronto, Canada), and HeLa cells were from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Salisbury, United Kingdom). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Poole, UK) and were of the highest quality available. Culture media and additives were obtained from Invitrogen (Paisley, Scotland). Rabbit anti-human TIMP-3 polyclonal antibody was purchase from Chemicon International, Inc. (Harrow, UK). Recombinant human TNF-α and rabbit anti-cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (p85) antibody were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Lewes, UK). Anti-CrmA, anti-Bcl-2, anti-focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and anti-cytochrome c antibodies and caspase substrates and inhibitors were obtained from CN Biosciences (Nottingham, UK). Anti-TNF-α antibody was purchased from R & D Systems. MitoTracker® Orange CMTMRos was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Leiden, The Netherlands). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Rat smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were prepared from thoracic aortas as described previously (29.Bennett M.R. Anglin S. McEwan J.R. Jagoe R. Newby A.C. Evan G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 820-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Rat SMCs and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide. The adenoviral construct rAd/TIMP-3 has been described previously (30.Baker A.H. Zaltsman A.B. George S.J. Newby A.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The control adenoviral construct rAd/β-galactosidase was a gift from Dr. G. W. G. Wilkinson (University of Wales College of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK). rAd/DN-FADD was a gift from Dr. C. Trautwein (Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mediziniche Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany). The rAd/CrmA adenoviral construct was a gift from Dr. G. Nabel, and the rAd/Bcl-2 adenoviral construct was a gift from Dr. J. Uney. Primary rat aortic SMCs (passages 2–4) and HeLa cells were cultured in six-well plates or on sterile glass coverslips until 80% confluent. An accurate cell number was determined pre-infection by trypsinization of three wells and counting using a Neubauer hemocytometer. The remaining wells were infected at 300 (rat SMCs) and 100 (HeLa cells) plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell in 1 ml of fresh complete medium for 2 h. The medium was then replaced with 2 ml of fresh complete medium and left for the required length of time prior to analysis. For adenoviral co-infections, cells were pre-infected with either the control adenovirus or the test adenovirus at 50 pfu/cell for 2 h. Cells were then incubated in growth medium for an additional 2 h and subsequently infected with the second adenovirus at 100 pfu/cell for an additional 2 h, after which the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium. Total cell lysates were prepared in SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad micro-BCA protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins (150 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to Bio-Rad polyvinylidene difluoride nylon membranes. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline/Tween (200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk powder, followed by incubation with primary antibody. Following washing with Tris-buffered saline/Tween, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 60 min, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in ice-cold methanol 72 h post-infection. After air drying, cells were washed twice with 1× TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA) and incubated in labeling mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mm dATP, 0.01 mm dCTP, 0.01 mmdGTP, 0.01 mm biotin-dUTP, and 8 units/ml DNA polymerase I (Klenow)) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed in 1× TE buffer, and endogenous peroxidase activity was reduced by incubation in 2% H2O2 for 5 min. After further washing, biotin was labeled with ExtrAvidinTM-peroxidase conjugate (1:200). Incubation with diaminobenzidine and subsequent counterstaining with hematoxylin were carried out to distinguish between positive apoptotic nuclei containing nicked DNA and non-apoptotic nuclei. Apoptotic cell death was quantified using a photometric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of cytoplasmic histo-associated DNA fragments (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, cell lysates were incubated with a biotin-conjugated anti-histone antibody and a peroxidase-conjugated anti-DNA antibody for 2 h. Complexes were captured on streptavidin-coated microtiter plates and quantified using ABTS colorimetric substrate. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm) was measured using the MitoTracker® Orange CMTMRos fluorescent dye (31.Macho A. Decaudin D. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Cytometry. 1996; 25: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with MitoTracker®Orange CMTMRos (150 nm) for 30 min in culture medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2. As a positive control for Ψm loss, cells were incubated with 2 μmstaurosporine for 2 h. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation at 200 ×g, and fixed in 2 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 10 min at 4 °C. Fixed cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD PharMingen FACScan) using CellQuest acquisition software. Cells were collected by trypsinization and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), followed by an additional centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of extraction buffer containing 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture. After 30 min of incubation on ice, cells were homogenized with a glass Dounce homogenizer and a small clearance pestle until the majority of the cells had been disrupted. Cell homogenates were spun at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were removed and analyzed by Western blotting for cytochrome c. In agreement with previously published data (19.Baker A.H.

TIMP-3-induced apoptosis was characterized by cell shrinkage, cell rounding, membrane blebbing, and cell detachment from the substratum. In situ end labeling staining of rAd/TIMP-3-infected cells revealed intense brown nuclear staining indicative of fragmented DNA, with nuclear condensation and fragmentation (data not shown). Cells expressing TIMP-3 also exhibited phosphatidylserine externalization as indicated by strong annexin V staining without uptake of propidium iodide (data not shown). To characterize the intracellular downstream mechanism(s) activated by TIMP-3, we first measured the effect of TIMP-3 overexpression on caspase activity. Primary cultures of both rat VSMCs and HeLa cells infected with rAd/TIMP-3 exhibited increased effector caspase activity (50.1 ± 0.5- and 4.5 ± 0.2-fold (n = 3), respectively; p < 0.05) as measured by cleavage of the synthetic fluorescent substrate DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin 72 h post-infection (Fig. 1A). Activation of initiator caspase-8 and -9 was also analyzed to identify possible mechanisms through which TIMP-3 initiates the apoptotic cascade. The activity of caspase-8 as measured by cleavage of IETD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin was elevated 18.61 ± 1.36- and 2.95 ± 0.36-fold (n = 3), respectively (p < 0.05) in rat VSMCs and HeLa cells, whereas cleavage of the caspase-9-specific substrate LEHD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin was elevated 10.88 ± 1.76- and 2.53 ± 0.35-fold (n = 3), respectively (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1A). Anti-activated caspase-8 and -9 antibodies also detected activated caspase-8 (p14) and caspase-9 (p37) in total HeLa cell lysates infected with rAd/TIMP-3, but not with rAd/β-galactosidase (Fig. 1B). We performed a detailed time course experiment to evaluate caspase-8 and -9 cleavage following TIMP-3 overexpression. The activated fragments of caspase-8 and -9 were first detected 36 h post-infection and were both detected throughout the remaining time course of the experiment (Fig. 2A).Figure 2Time course of TIMP-3-induced caspase activation and death substrate cleavage.A, HeLa cells were infected with rAd/TIMP-3 (100 pfu/cell), and total cell lysates were prepared at the times indicated. Cell lysates (150 μg) were analyzed for activated caspase-8 and -9 and cleavage of PARP and FAK by Western blotting. B, cells infected with rAd/TIMP-3 were cultured in the presence of 100 μmbenzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (ZVAD) or 100 μmN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN). Cell lysates were prepared 72 h post-infection and analyzed for PARP and FAK cleavage by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Caspase-mediated cleavage of death substrates is an important event during the commitment to and execution of apoptotic death. Cleavage of PARP and FAK has previously been reported in numerous cell types undergoing apoptosis (32.Margolin N. Raybuck S.A. Wilson K.P. Chen W. Fox T. Gu Y. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7223-7228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 33.Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed PARP and FAK cleavage status in TIMP-overexpressing cells. Infection of HeLa cells with rAd/TIMP-3 (but not with rAd/β-galactosidase) resulted in the formation of two prominent lower molecular mass FAK fragments between 70 and 80 kDa and the appearance of an 85-kDa fragment of PARP detected with an anti-cleaved PARP antibody (Fig. 2A). Cleaved forms of FAK and PARP were first detectable 32–36 h after rAd/TIMP-3 infection and increased through the time course of the experiment (Fig. 2A). As expected, overexpression of TIMP-3 preceded the appearance of PARP and FAK cleavage by ∼20 h (Fig. 2A). The time course of PARP and FAK cleavage mirrored that of initiator caspase-8 and -9 activation, suggesting that TIMP-3 induces caspase-mediated cleavage of FAK and PARP. To test this hypothesis, we incubated HeLa cells overexpressing TIMP-3 with either the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone or the calpain peptide inhibitorN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal. Incubation with benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (but not withN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal) completely inhibited the formation of the lower molecular mass forms of FAK and the p85 PARP fragment, demonstrating caspase-mediated cleavage of these proteins in response to TIMP-3 overexpression (Fig. 2B). Activation of the mitochondria and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol have been shown to participate in activation of caspase-9 (26.Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.D. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6230) Google Scholar). As we observed activation of caspase-9 in response to TIMP-3, we first measured changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) using CMTMRos and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol in rat VSMCs and HeLa cells infected with rAd/TIMP-3. rAd/β-galactosidase-infected rat VSMCs and HeLa cells showed polarized Ψm as indicated by a high level of CMTMRos fluorescence (Fig. 3A). As expected, treatment with 2 μm staurosporine, a potent stimulus for mitochondrial activation, resulted in a marked reduction in CMTMRos fluorescence in both rat SMCs and HeLa cells, demonstrating a reduction in Ψm (Fig. 3A). Infection with rAd/TIMP-3 resulted in a similar reduction in Ψm (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, TIMP-3 overexpression resulted in a larger reduction in CMTMRos fluorescence than that evoked by staurosporine. To confirm these observations, efflux of cytochromec into the cytosol, another indicator of mitochondrial activation, was evaluated (28.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar, 34.Yang J. Liu X.S. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J.Y. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar). Low levels of cytochromec were detectable in cytosolic extracts from HeLa cells (but not from rat VSMCs) infected with the control virus rAd/β-galactosidase (Fig. 3B). However, infection of both VSMCs and HeLa cells with rAd/TIMP-3 dramatically increased the levels of cytosolic cytochrome c (Fig. 3B). Numerous reports have described the role of Bcl-2 as a negative regulator of apoptosis-specific mitochondrial functions (reviewed in Refs. 35.Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar and 36.Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The ratio between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members is thought to regulate such functions as permeability transition pore formation and release of apoptosis inducing factor and cytochrome c into the cytosol and ultimately activation of caspase-9 (26.Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.D. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6230) Google Scholar). To determine whether mitochondrial activation is an important step in the apoptotic cascade initiated by TIMP-3, we used an adenoviral vector to up-regulate Bcl-2. Infection of HeLa cells with rAd/Bcl-2 (but not with rAd/β-galactosidase) strongly elevated levels of Bcl-2 (Fig. 4A). For coexpression studies, we pretreated cells with rAd/Bcl-2 prior to rAd/TIMP-3 infection to allow sufficient inhibitor expression to precede expression of TIMP-3. Pre-infection with rAd/β-galactosidase prior to co-infection with rAd/TIMP-3 failed to rescue cleavage of PARP and FAK (Fig. 4B). Pre-infection of HeLa cells with rAd/Bcl-2 prior to subsequent infection 3 h later with rAd/TIMP-3 blocked TIMP-3-induced cleavage of PARP and FAK death substrates (Fig. 4B). Additionally, overexpression of Bcl-2 inhibited activation of caspase-9, implying that the mitochondria function as regulators of caspase-9 activation in response to TIMP-3 (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, Bcl-2 co-overexpression also inhibited activation of caspase-8, suggesting that TIMP-3-induced caspase-8 activation occurs downstream of mitochondrial activation (Fig. 4B). Although we have demonstrated activation of caspase-8 following adenovirus-mediated overexpression of TIMP-3, we further assessed the direct involvement of this caspase by co-overexpression of CrmA, a viral serpin inhibitor of caspase-8 (37.Bennett M. Macdonald K. Chan S.W. Luzio J.P. Simari R. Weissberg P. Science. 1998; 282: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. As expected, infection of HeLa cells with rAd/CrmA (but not with rAd/β-galactosidase) resulted in high level expression of CrmA (Fig. 5A). Pre-infection of HeLa cells with rAd/CrmA (but not with rAd/β-galactosidase) blocked cleavage of PARP and FAK induced by TIMP-3 and activation of caspase-8 (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, CrmA expression also inhibited activation of caspase-9 (Fig. 5B), implying that TIMP-3-induced caspase-9 activation occurs downstream of caspase-9. Caspase-8 is typically activated in response to engagement of death receptors, which contain cytoplasmic death domains (38.Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J.

Caspase-8 is recruited to activated death receptors through interactions with the adaptor protein FADD, which contains a C-terminal death domain and an N-terminal death effector domain and which is responsible for recruitment and activation of caspase-8 (27.Ashkenazi A.

It is tyrosine-phosphorylated following β1 integrin and/or T cell receptor stimulation and is thus considered to be important for immunological reactions. CasL has several structural motifs such as an SH3 domain and a substrate domain and interacts with many molecules through these motifs. To obtain more insights on the CasL-mediated signal transduction, we sought proteins that interact with the CasL SH3 domain by far Western screening, and we identified a novel human molecule, MICAL (a Molecule Interacting withCasL). MICAL is a protein of 118 kDa and is expressed in the thymus, lung, spleen, kidney, testis, and hematopoietic cells. MICAL has a calponin homology domain, a LIM domain, a putative leucine zipper motif, and a proline-rich PPKPP sequence. MICAL associates with CasL through this PPKPP sequence. MICAL is a cytoplasmic protein and colocalizes with CasL at the perinuclear area. Through the COOH-terminal region, MICAL also associates with vimentin that is a major component of intermediate filaments. Immunostaining revealed that MICAL localizes along with vimentin intermediate filaments. These results suggest that MICAL may be a cytoskeletal regulator that connects CasL to intermediate filaments.

CasL (also known as HEF1) was originally identified as a highly phosphorylated protein of 105-kDa in human lymphocytes after β1 integrin stimulation (1.Nojima Y. Rothstein D.M. Sugita K.

It belongs to the p130Cas (Cas) family that includes Cas, CasL/HEF1, and Efs/Sin (4.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H.

They contain an SH3 domain at the NH2terminus, followed by a substrate domain composed of a cluster of potential SH2-binding sites, and a COOH-terminal domain, which contains consensus binding motifs for the SH3 and SH2 domains of c-Src (CasL does not have binding motifs for c-Src SH3 domain). This structural profile indicates that the Cas family proteins serve as docking molecules that assemble and transduce intracellular signals. Since Cas was the first characterized member of the Cas family proteins, the study of Cas is most advanced, and it has established a framework for the studies of the other family members. In fibroblasts, Cas has been shown to reside primarily at focal adhesions and along adhesion-proximal regions of stress fibers (7.Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Honda H. Ogawa S. Ueno H. Suzuki T. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell.

Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). When cells attach to extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, laminin, or vitronectin through integrin molecules, they form focal adhesion structures (also simply called “focal adhesions”) at the adhesion sites. At focal adhesions, stress fibers are tethered, and a variety of molecules that mediate many cellular functions such as proliferation and migration are integrated (10.Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar, 11.Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar). Cas, localizing at focal adhesions, plays important roles in the integrin-induced signaling. By generating and examining Cas knockout mice, we have demonstrated that Cas is essential for bundling actin filaments and cellular transformation induced by the oncogenic Src (12.Honda H. Oda H.

In the mammalian cells, there are three types of cytoskeletal filaments, actin-containing microfilaments, tubulin-containing microtubules, and intermediate filaments (IFs). Among them, IFs are important for structure and mechanical integration of cellular space, and they are composed of cell type-specific proteins (13.Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 14.Robson R.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15.Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev.

Humbert J. Mericskay M. Li Z. Paulin D. Vicart P. Biol. Cell. 1997; 89: 85-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vimentin is one of such proteins and is a major component of IFs in cells of mesenchymal tissues. Recently, an increasing number of studies are reported on the CasL-mediated functions. As suggested by its structural similarity to Cas, CasL is considered to be important for β1integrin-induced signal transduction and cytoskeletal regulation (18.Sattler M. Salgia R. Shrikhande G.

In T lymphocytes, CasL also plays a critical role in T cell receptor (TCR)-induced migration (19.Ohashi Y. Iwata S. Kamiguchi K. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3727-3734PubMed Google Scholar). These CasL (or Cas)-mediated functions are carried out by its interaction with many molecules. CasL has several domains that interact with other molecules, such as the SH3 and the substrate domain. The SH3 domain of CasL interacts with FAK or Pyk2/Cakβ/RAFTK/CADTK, and this interaction is considered to be one of the triggers of the signal transduction following β1 integrin stimulation (3.Law S.F.

Therefore, there may exist other unknown SH3-binding molecules and pathways in the CasL-mediated signal transduction. With this point of view, we sought molecules that interact with the CasL SH3 domain by far Western screening, and we identified a novel molecule that interacts with CasL. We also found that this molecule associates with vimentin and that it could be a regulational component of vimentin filaments. The human T cell lines H9, Jurkat, and other hematopoietic cell lines HL60 and HEL cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. COS7, HeLa, and 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Rabbit antisera against MICAL C1 and C2 were obtained as described below. Polyclonal antibodies were purified from these antisera by affinity chromatography (HiTrap NHS-activated, Amersham Biosciences, described below). Mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) V9 against vimentin and mAb M2 against the FLAG epitope were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibody HA.11 against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was obtained from Babco. Goat polyclonal antibodies C-20 against vimentin and N-17 against CasL/HEF1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The mAb 9E10 against the Myc epitope was obtained by culturing 9E10 hybridomas in the non-serum culture system. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit donkey antibody and Texas Red-conjugated anti-goat donkey antibody were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. The human thymus 5′-STRETCH PLUS cDNA library (HL5010b) was purchased from CLONTECH and was used in the far Western screening. The cDNA fragment encoding the human CasL SH3 domain (amino acid residues 2–66) was generated by PCR using customized primers. BglII and EcoRI sites were added to the 5′- and 3′-ends and subcloned into theBamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences) to generate pGEX2TK-CasL SH3. This plasmid was transfected into Escherichia coli cells, and the expressed proteins were purified using the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). They were labeled with 32P isotope by bovine heart kinase (Sigma) and used as the first probe. Competent E. coli cells were infected with phages from the cDNA library (20,000 plaque-forming units/plate) and were incubated for 3 h at 43 °C. Then the Hybond-C-extra membranes (Amersham Biosciences) soaked in 10 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were overlaid on phage plaques for 4 h at 37 °C, and these membranes were blocked in TBST buffers (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk. The membranes were incubated with 0.75 μg of the isotope-labeled GST-CasL SH3 probe for 2 h at 25 °C, washed, and then autoradiographed (Eastman Kodak Co.). To obtain a genomic fragment containing theMICAL gene, a PAC library, RPCI-1 (Roswell Park Cancer Institute) was screened by the PCR method with a pair of MICAL cDNA-specific primers, P1 and P2 (described below), and we obtained clone 231G18. To identify the chromosomal location of the MICAL gene, we screened a Radiation Hybrid Panel, GeneBridge 4 (Research Genetics), by PCR with the same primers P1 and P2. The results were analyzed by the manufacturer. Total RNA was extracted from freshly prepared H9 cells by the acid guanidine/phenol chloroform method, and a poly(A) RNA-rich fraction was prepared by the poly(A) selection procedure (Oligotex-dT30 super, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). This RNA fraction was subjected to reverse transcription reaction with a gene-specific primer P3 by heat-resistant reverse transcriptase (Thermoscript, Invitrogen) at 62 °C. We carried out the first PCR on this synthesized cDNA with primers P4 and P6 followed by the second PCR with primers P5 and P6 at the presence of 5% Me2SO. The following MICAL gene-specific primers were used: P1, CTGCCCCAGTACCACAAGAT (corresponding to nucleotides 445–464); P2, GAGAACTTGGTGCGCTTTTC (nucleotides 652–671); P3, AGGTGGAGCACGTTGTGGCGAGAG (nucleotides 669–692); P4, CCCAAGACTGTCCCCGCTGGAG (nucleotides 1–22); P5, GCTGGAGGCGGTAGAGGGAT (nucleotides 16–35); and P6, CAGCAGCTGGGCAGAGACGAGT (nucleotides 272–293). A poly(A) RNA fraction was obtained from freshly prepared murine tissues or cultured cells as described above. Two μg of this RNA fraction was loaded, electrophoresed, and hybridized with the isotope-labeled MICAL cDNA fragment. The cDNA fragments corresponding to the amino acid residues 884–1063 (C1) and 999–1063 (C2) of MICAL were generated by PCR, and they were inserted into pGEX1 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate GST-MICAL C1 and GST-MICAL C2 constructs. These plasmids were transfected into E. coli cells, and expressed fusion proteins were purified. Rabbits were immunized with these fusion proteins, and antisera against these antigens were raised (anti-MICAL C1 and anti-MICAL C2). The antisera were purified by affinity chromatography. At first, the antisera were passed through the GST-conjugated column removing anti-GST antibodies. The flow-through fraction was then applied onto the antigen-conjugated column, and specific antibodies bound to the column were eluted out and collected. The cDNA for HA tag or FLAG tag was added to the 3′ terminus of the coding sequence of MICAL, and this was inserted into pUC-CAGGS (27.Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar) or pSSRαbsr (28.Ueno H. Hirano N. Kozutsumi H. Sasaki K. Tanaka T. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

To make mMICAL mutant, the cDNA sequence CCACCCAAGCCT (corresponding to amino acid sequence PPKP) was mutated to CCACCGGCGCCT (PPAP) by in vitro mutagenesis with the Chameleon Double-stranded, Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The FLAG tag sequence was added to its 3′ terminus, and mMICAL-FLAG was inserted into the pSSRαbsr vector. To generate M1, M2, M3, and M4 mutants, cDNA fragments corresponding to each mutant protein were generated by PCR using specific primers, and the M5 mutant was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis (ExSite PCR-based Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene). Generated cDNA fragments were ligated with the HA tag sequence, and they were inserted into the pSSRαbsr vector. The generation of c-Myc-tagged CasL was described previously (20.Tachibana K. Urano T. Fujita H. Ohashi Y. Kamiguchi K. Iwata S. Hirai H. Morimoto C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29083-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To generate the FLAG-tagged vimentin expression vector, the FLAG tag sequence was ligated to the end of the murine vimentin sequence, and this DNA fragment was inserted into the pUC-CAGGS vector. These expression vectors were transfected into COS7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method essentially as described previously (29.Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were incubated with indicated antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by additional incubation with the protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed with 1% Triton X-100 buffer and treated with sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.001% bromphenol blue). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The electrophoresed proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore) and were subjected to immunoblotting, followed by detection with the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega). Cells were grown on a cover glass. They were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and they were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). After incubation with the primary and the secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, the samples were mounted in a 1:1 mixture of 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline and glycerol. The cells were observed under the MRC1024 confocal microscopic system (Bio-Rad). For pull-down assay, expressed GST fusion proteins were incubated with the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C for immobilization. We prepared aliquots of cell lysates from COS7 cells transfected with MICAL and mMICAL constructs, and these aliquots were incubated with the beads for 1 h, and the proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by immunoblotting. Ten percent of the immobilized proteins were subjected to Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain, and we confirmed that an almost equal volume of GST fusion proteins was loaded. The GST-p130Cas SH3 fusion protein encodes amino acid residues 6–64 of p130Cas. The details of the GST-Crk SH3, GST-Abl SH3, GST-Grb2 SH3, and GST-Src SH3 constructs were described previously (29.Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Isotope-labeled GST-CasL SH3 fusion protein was used as a probe for the far Western screening to screen a λgt11 cDNA expression library (CLONTECH) that was derived from normal human thymuses. Approximately 1.5 million phages were screened, and we obtained 8 discrete positive clones. Among them, one clone was identified as FAK, one as PTP-1B, two clones as PTP-PEST, and two as C3G; these molecules have already been known to interact with the Cas SH3 domain (9.Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 23.Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol.

To obtain more information on this unknown gene, we continued serial screening procedures using the identified cDNA fragments as probes by the DNA hybridization method. Consequently, we could obtain one conceptional cDNA sequence. However, as the deduced start codon (ATG) of this cDNA did not meet the “Kozak's rule” (30.Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar) optimally, we searched for a potential upstream coding region. We screened a PAC genomic library, and obtained a PAC clone, RPCI-1 231G18, that harbored this unknown gene. Sequence analysis of this genomic fragment revealed that an intron sequence was inserted between the cDNA nucleotide 268 and 269 (Fig. 1 A), and we obtained an additional 5′-side genomic nucleotide sequence. To examine if this 5′-side genomic region is transcribed into mRNA, we prepared three kinds of primers, P4, P5, and P6 (described under “Experimental Procedures”), and we carried out reverse transcriptase-PCR for the mRNA extracted from the human T lymphocyte cell line, H9. Because the nucleotide component around the target region was extremely GC-rich, we carried out reverse transcription at 62 °C with thermoresistant reverse transcriptase. Then we performed the first PCR with P4 and P6 primers and the second PCR with P5 and P6 primers in the presence of 5% Me2SO. Consequently, we obtained an amplified fragment at the size of ∼280 bp, and the sequence analysis of this fragment revealed that this fragment did not contain any intron sequences. These results suggest that this amplified fragment was derived from mRNA and that it was a part of the cDNA. Because this cDNA sequence contained an in-frame stop codon at the nucleotide 48 (Fig. 1 A), we concluded that we obtained the full-length coding region of this unknown gene.Figure 1Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of human MICAL and its schematic representation. A, nucleotide and predicted amino acid (single-letter code) sequences of human MICAL are presented. Sequence numbers are shown on the right. Shown in lowercase letters are non-coding regions. Amino acid residues corresponding to the calponin homology domain, the LIM domain, and the putative leucine zipper motif are underlined with single lines, bold lines, and double lines, respectively. The boxed amino acid residues represent the proline-rich sequence that is responsible for CasL SH3 binding. The “/” in the 5′-side non-coding region indicates the in-frame stop codon, and the asterisk indicates the stop codon of the open reading frame. B, schematic representation of the human MICAL and the KIAA0750/MICAL-2 molecules. MICAL consists of a calponin homology domain (CH), a LIM domain (LIM), a proline-rich region (PR), and a putative leucine zipper motif (L-Zip). KIAA0750/MICAL-2 is a protein composed of 1124 amino acids, and it has homology with MICAL by 65 (NH2-terminal half) to 35% (COOH-terminal region). Unlike MICAL, MICAL-2 has neither proline rich regions nor L-Zip motifs. The numbers in the scheme indicate amino acid numbers. The C1and C2 lines indicate regions used for generating polyclonal antisera.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cDNA of this newly isolated gene consists of ∼3700-bp nucleotides, which corresponds to the result of the Northern blotting described below. Molecular mass of the translated protein is predicted to be 118 kDa composed of 1067 amino acids. Search of the GenBank™ data base showed that this isolated gene encodes a novel molecule, and its amino acid sequence has prominent homology with that of KIAA0750 (35∼65% homology) which had been isolated from the human brain (Fig. 1 B) (31.Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This data base also told us that MICAL has homology with KIAA1364 derived from human brain by 50–63%. At present, the complete cDNA sequence of KIAA1364 is not determined. Sequence analysis of this novel molecule indicates that it contains a calponin homology (CH) domain in the central region followed by a LIM domain. In addition, a proline-rich region (Pro-Pro-Lys-Pro-Pro, PPKPP) and a putative leucine zipper (L-Zip) motif are located at the COOH terminus. Because this novel molecule interacts with CasL (described below), we named this novel molecule “MICAL,” for aMolecule Interacting withCasL. We also call the KIAA0750 molecule “MICAL-2” based on its homology. Whereas the MICAL-2/KIAA0750 molecule has a CH domain and a LIM domain, it does not have any L-Zip motifs or PPKPP sequences. To determine the chromosomal location of the MICAL gene, we screened a Radiation Hybrid Panel following the manufacturer's instruction. The result showed that MICAL is located on the long arm of chromosome 6, 6q16. To assess the expression profile of the MICAL mRNA, we examined various hematopoietic cell lines and murine tissues by Northern blotting. We detected a single discrete transcript of ∼3.7 kb in the hematopoietic cell lines Jurkat, HL60, and HEL (Fig. 2 A). Although we could find another larger transcript in HEL cells, the main transcript was ∼3.7 kb. Northern blotting of the various murine tissues revealed that MICAL mRNA expression is restricted to the several specific tissues; we could find prominent expression in the thymus, lung, spleen, and testis and faint expression in the kidney (Fig. 2 B), whereas no obvious expression was detected in the brain, heart, and liver. Even though the size of the transcript in the testis seemed to be slightly larger than 3.7 kb, this may be a spliced variant. It has been reported that CasL is expressed prominently in the lung, kidney, placenta, and lymphocytes (2.Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 3.Law S.F. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of MICAL corresponds to that of CasL, and this accordance supports the biological relationship between the two molecules. To characterize MICAL protein, we generated polyclonal antibodies against MICAL. We used COOH-terminal regions as immunogens, C1 region spanning amino acid residues 884–1063 and C2 region spanning residues 999–1063. We immunized rabbits and obtained antisera to each antigen (anti-MICAL C1 and anti-MICAL C2). The antisera were purified by affinity chromatography, and we generated specific antibodies. To check the quality of these antibodies and to detect MICAL proteins, we performed an immunoblot assay. We used lysates from COS7 cells transiently transfected with pSSRαbsr/MICAL and lysates from normally growing HeLa, 293, H9, and Jurkat cells. By using both antibodies, we could find endogenous expression of MICAL at the size of ∼120 kDa in the HeLa, 293, H9, and Jurkat cells and prominent expression in the transfected COS7 cells (Fig. 3). To test the in vivo interaction between MICAL and CasL, we analyzed their interaction by transiently coexpressing MICAL and CasL proteins in COS7 cells. When we cotransfected the FLAG-tagged MICAL (MICAL-FLAG) together with the Myc-tagged CasL (Myc-CasL), we could detect CasL in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates containing MICAL proteins (Fig. 4 A). Alternatively, we were able to find MICAL in the anti-Myc immunoprecipitates containing CasL proteins (Fig. 4 A). These results indicate that these two proteins can make a complex in mammalian cells in vivo. To confirm that MICAL and CasL interact with each other through the CasL SH3 domain, we cotransfected MICAL-FLAG together with the Myc-tagged CasL whose SH3 domain was deleted (Myc-ΔSH3 CasL) and performed immunoprecipitation. In this experiment, we could not find Myc-ΔSH3 CasL in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates nor MICAL-FLAG in the anti-Myc immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 B). This result indicates that MICAL and CasL interact through the CasL SH3 domain. This interaction was also demonstrated by the in vitropull-down assay. We immobilized various GST-SH3 fusion proteins on the glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated them with COS7 cell lysates expressing MICAL-FLAG. As shown in Fig. 4 D, we could detect prominent existence of MICAL in the complex that contains the CasL SH3 domain or Cas SH3 domain, whereas only faint MICAL bands were observed in the Src SH3, Grb2 SH3, Abl SH3, or Crk SH3 containing complex. This result shows that MICAL preferentially interacts with the CasL (or p130Cas) SH3 domain. It has been reported that the Cas SH3 domain preferentially binds to “Pro-X-Lys-Pro, PXKP” (X, any amino acid) sequence (25.Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25673-25679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because MICAL has a consensus sequence of “PPKPP” at the COOH terminus, we examined whether MICAL interacts with the CasL SH3 domain through this proline-rich sequence. We constructed a mutant, mMICAL-FLAG, whose proline-rich sequence PPKPP (amino acid residues 830–834) was mutated into PPAPP (Fig. 4 C). When we incubated the immobilized GST-CasL SH3 and GST-Cas SH3 fusion proteins with lysates of COS7 cells expressing mMICAL-FLAG, we could not find mMICAL proteins in the complexes (Fig. 4 D). These results indicate that MICAL"

We showed previously that oxidized lipids including 8-isoprostaglandin E2 (isoPGE2) inhibit osteoblastic differentiation of preosteoblasts. Since osteoporosis is mediated both by decreased osteoblastic bone formation and by increased osteoclastic bone resorption, we assessed whether oxidized lipids regulate the osteoclastic potential of marrow hematopoietic cells. Treatment of marrow-derived preosteoclasts with isoPGE2 enhanced osteoclastic differentiation as evidenced by increased tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity and multinucleation, which were inhibited by calcitonin, and increased numbers of resorption pits. The enhanced osteoclastic differentiation by isoPGE2 was observed whether preosteoclasts were in coculture with stromal cells or in monoculture in the presence of receptor-activated NFκB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Receptor antagonist studies suggest that isoPGE2 effects were mediated by prostaglandin receptor subtypes EP2/DP on preosteoclasts and subtype EP1 and thromboxane receptors on stromal/osteoblast cells. The enhanced TRAP activity was also inhibited by cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors, and isoPGE2 elevated intracellular cAMP levels of preosteoclast monocultures. Other oxidized lipids also enhanced the TRAP activity of preosteoclast monocultures. These data suggest that isoPGE2 enhances osteoclastic differentiation of marrow preosteoclasts and that this regulation occurs via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway.

Similar to cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandins, they have biological activity including potent contractile and mitogenic activities in vascular smooth muscle cells (4.Fukunaga M. Makita N.

However, the biological effects of isoprostanes and their isomeric prostaglandins appear to vary depending on the tissue systems. In the vascular bed, prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) (6.Zhang H. Stockbridge N. Weir B. Krueger C. Cook D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 195: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), isoPGE2, and isoPGF2α have vasoconstrictor effects (7.Morrow J.D. Minton T.A.

In porcine small intestine, PGE2, PGF2α, and isoPGE2 induce similar electrical responses, whereas isoPGF2α elicits no response (9.Unmack M.A. Rangachari P.K. Skadhauge E. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

The renal vasoconstricting actions of isoprostanes are mediated by thromboxane receptor (TP), whereas platelet aggregation by isoprostanes may be acting through a unique receptor similar to but distinct from that of TP (1.Liu T.Z.

Isoprostane levels are altered in many diseases putatively associated with oxidative stress, including vascular, cerebral, and pulmonary disorders (2.Lawson J.A. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol.

Isoprostanes have been shown to contribute to a multitude of diseases including atherosclerosis (2.Lawson J.A. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol.

Demer L.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that diet-induced hyperlipidemia, which increases tissue deposition of lipid oxidation products, also reduces the numbers of marrow osteoblastic precursors (25.Parhami F. Jackson S.M. Tintut Y. Le V. Balucan J.P. Territo M. Demer L.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) as well as bone mineral content and density (26.Parhami F. Tintut Y. Beamer W. Gharavi N. Goodman W. Demer L.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We also found that among the oxidized lipids, the isoprostane isoPGE2 potently regulates osteoblastic differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells in both artery wall and bone (22.Parhami F. Morrow A.D. Balucan J. Leitinger N. Watson A.D. Tintut Y. Berliner J.A. Demer L.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Although the effects of isoprostanes and other lipid oxidation products on vascular and osteoblastic cells have been reported, their effects on osteoclastic differentiation are not known. Osteoclasts are of hematopoietic origin, and their precursors are present in bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood (27.Martin T.J. Romas E. Gillespie M.T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts express tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and calcitonin receptor, both of which are widely regarded as markers of osteoclastic differentiation (27.Martin T.J. Romas E. Gillespie M.T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28.Suda T. Jimi E. Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). When they are actively resorbing, osteoclasts are highly polarized and adhere to the bone surface through specialized gasket-like “actin rings,” which are recognized as a marker for fully activated osteoclasts (28.Suda T. Jimi E. Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Differentiation of osteoclasts is closely coupled with the function of osteoblasts through a variety of cytokines including macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) released by the bone-forming cells (29.Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1999; 256: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 30.Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R. Burgess T. Elliott R.

Cell. 1998; 93: 165-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4656) Google Scholar). PGE2, the isomeric prostaglandin of isoPGE2 and an important regulator of local bone metabolism, has been shown to induce osteoclast formation from hematopoietic precursors and to inhibit bone resorption in mature osteoclasts (31.Kaji H. Sugimoto T. Kanatani M. Fukase M. Kumegawa M. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The induction of osteoclast differentiation by PGE2 has been shown to occur directly through osteoblasts (31.Kaji H. Sugimoto T. Kanatani M. Fukase M. Kumegawa M. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It induces the cAMP pathway in osteoblasts, leading to release of cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, which in turn induce the osteoclast (31.Kaji H. Sugimoto T. Kanatani M. Fukase M. Kumegawa M. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32.Amano S. Naganuma K. Kawata Y. Kawakami K. Kitano S. Hanazawa S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1931-1936PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the loss of bone density associated with hyperlipidemia is due in part to altered osteoclastic activity, we assessed the osteoclastic potential of marrow hematopoietic precursors treated with isoprostanes. Results showed that isoPGE2 induced osteoclastic differentiation and increased resorption pits of marrow preosteoclasts. The results also suggested that the direct effects of isoPGE2 on preosteoclasts were mediated by prostaglandin receptor subtype EP2/DP, whereas the indirect effects of isoPGE2 through stromal/osteoblast cells were mediated by EP1/TP receptors. In addition, the intracellular cAMP pathway is involved in mediating isoPGE2-stimulated osteoclast formation. Other oxidized lipids, oxLDL and 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (oxPAPC), also enhance osteoclast formation. These data suggest that isoPGE2 enhances osteoclastic differentiation of marrow hematopoietic precursor cells via prostaglandin/thromboxane receptor induction of the cAMP pathway. Recombinant murine M-CSF and murine RANKL were from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). 1,25-(OH)2D3 and SC 51089 were from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Osteologic discs for resorption assays were purchased from BD PharMingen(San Diego, CA). The cyclic AMP assay kit was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Salmon calcitonin, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, and dexamethasone were from Sigma. Isoprostanes (both isoPGE2 and isoPGF2α), AH6809, and SQ29548 and U46619 were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and PKA-specific inhibitors KT5720 and H89 were from Calbiochem. ST2, a murine marrow stromal cell line, was obtained from Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). ST2 cells were maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone; Logan, UT), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml). The medium was changed every 3–4 days. Bone marrow cells were isolated from 3–6-month-old C57BL/6 mice using protocols established previously by Lacey et al. (33.Lacey D.L. Erdmann J.M. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.L. Ohara J. Shioi A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2367-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, non-adherent cells containing preosteoclasts were plated either in 96-well plates or onto osteologic discs (0.2 × 106 cells/well) in 25 ng/ml murine M-CSF. After 3 days of culture, the adherent cells were treated with control media or 30 μm isoPGE2 (calcitonin or inhibitors, where applicable) in the presence of 25 ng/ml murine M-CSF. After 2 days, medium was removed, and ST2 cells (0.2 × 105 cells/well) in the medium containing 10−8m1,25-(OH)2D3 (vitamin D) and 10−7m dexamethasone together with fresh reagents were added to the wells containing preosteoclasts. After 8 additional days, TRAP activity, actin rings formation, or resorption assays were performed. The above non-adherent cells containing preosteoclasts were plated in 96-well plates in the presence of 25 ng/ml murine M-CSF. After 3 days in culture, cells were treated with agents in the presence of 25 ng/ml murine M-CSF and 40 ng/ml murine RANKL. TRAP activity was assayed 6 days after the treatment. In the experiments with inhibitors, the cells were pretreated with inhibitors for 2 h followed by cotreatment with isoPGE2, M-CSF, and RANKL. No TRAP-positive cells were observed in the absence of M-CSF/RANKL even when supplemented with vitamin D/dexamethasone, confirming that stromal cells were not present in the culture. Cells were washed once with PBS and fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min, washed once with PBS, and incubated with substrate solution napthol AS-BI phosphate (Sigma) in the presence of 50 mm sodium tartrate at 37 °C for 10 min. Resulting red-stained TRAP activity was visualized by light microscopy. To quantify TRAP activity, a solution assay adapted from Simonetet al. (34.Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.S. Lüthy R. Nguyen H.Q. Wooden S. Bennett L. Boone T. et al.Cell. 1997; 89: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4374) Google Scholar) was performed. Briefly, cells (in 96-well plates) were washed once with PBS and lysed in 80 μl of cold lysis buffer (90 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.8, 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 80 mm sodium tartrate) for 10 min. After lysis, 80 μl of substrate solution (20 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate in the above lysis buffer) was added and incubated for an additional 3–5 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 40 μl of 0.5 m NaOH. The optical density was read at a 405-nm wavelength. A standard curve was determined as specified by the manufacturer (Sigma kit no. 387). Actin ring formation was visualized by staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin as described previously (28.Suda T. Jimi E. Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed once with PBS, fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min, permeated by treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min, and incubated for 40 min with 0.3 mm rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. The cells were washed with water, and actin rings were visualized under a fluorescence microscope. Resorption assays using osteologic discs were performed as described previously (35.Azuma Y. Kaji K. Katogi R. Takeshita S. Kudo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4858-4864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on the osteologic discs as described above and removed by addition of bleach solution (∼6% NaOCl) and agitation for ∼5 min. The discs were washed with distilled water and air-dried. The resorption lacunae were visualized and quantified under light microscopy. Non-adherent overnight cultures of marrow preosteoclasts were grown in the presence of murine M-CSF in 6-well plates. After 3 days in culture, cells were treated for 30 min with either control media or 30 μm isoPGE2 in the media supplemented with 1 mm IBMX. After the incubation, cells were washed once with PBS and scraped in PBS containing 4 mm EDTA and 1 mm IBMX. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in the boiling assay buffer (Amersham Biosciences) and sonicated briefly. Cellular proteins were precipitated by boiling for 7 min, and the extract was clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was assayed for cAMP level using cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). To determine the effects of isoprostanes on osteoclastic differentiation, bone marrow preosteoclasts were isolated using the techniques and protocols established by Lacey et al. (33.Lacey D.L. Erdmann J.M. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.L. Ohara J. Shioi A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2367-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and cocultured with ST2 stromal cells. Treatment of cocultures with 30 μm isoPGE2 enhanced TRAP activity and the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells (MNC) (Fig. 1, a and b). TRAP activity was enhanced over a range of isoPGE2 concentrations but not by 30 μm isoPGF2α (Fig. 1c). The TRAP activity and multinucleation induced by isoPGE2 was inhibited by 1 nm calcitonin (Fig. 2,upper and lower). Staining of isoPGE2-induced MNC with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin revealed actin ring formation (Fig. 3A, arrows). To test whether the TRAP-positive MNC induced by isoPGE2 were able to resorb mineral, marrow preosteoclasts were cocultured with ST2 cells on calcium phosphate-coated (osteologic) discs, which have been validated previously as providing results comparable with the dentin assay (35.Azuma Y. Kaji K. Katogi R. Takeshita S. Kudo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4858-4864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). At the end of the 8-day culture, the adherent cells were removed from the discs, and the resorption lacunae were viewed under the light microscope. Results showed that isoPGE2 increased the resorption activity as evidenced by the increased number of lacunae (Fig. 3,B and C, arrowheads).Figure 2Effects of calcitonin on cocultures of preosteoclasts/ST2 cells. Cocultures were treated with vehicle alone (control), 30 μm isoPGE2, or 30 μmisoPGE2 plus 1 nm salmon calcitonin.

Results showed that isoPGE2 enhanced multinucleation (data not shown) and TRAP activity (control 2.59 ± 0.70, isoPGE2 9.97 ± 1.90). Induction of both TRAP activity and multinucleation was attenuated by 10 μg/ml osteoprotegerin (3.26 ± 0.76), suggesting that the mechanism involves the receptor activator of NFκB. To assess the isoPGE2-mediated intracellular signaling pathway, cocultures of preosteoclasts with ST2 cells were pretreated for 2 h with the PKA inhibitor KT5720 (5 μm), the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (1 μm), and the oxygen radical scavenger pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (10 μm). Results showed that PKA inhibition attenuated isoPGE2-induced TRAP activity, whereas indomethacin had a small effect, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate had little or no effect (Fig. 4A). Similarly, KT5720 and H89, another PKA inhibitor, each attenuated isoPGE2-induced TRAP activity in the preosteoclast monocultures (in the absence of ST2) (data not shown). To determine whether the PKA pathway mediates isoPGE2 effects, we measured intracellular cAMP levels in preosteoclast monoculture or stromal ST2 monoculture treated with isoPGE2. Results showed that isoPGE2 caused a 2.6-fold increase in intracellular cAMP preosteoclasts (Fig. 4B) but not in ST2 cells (data not shown). To assess whether isoPGE2 acts through a known receptor in mediating osteoclastic potential, we examined the involvement of both prostaglandin and thromboxane receptors, both of which have been shown to mediate specific activities of isoprostanes in different systems (1.Liu T.Z. Stern A. Morrow J.D. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 5: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,9.Unmack M.A. Rangachari P.K. Skadhauge E. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1198-1205PubMed Google Scholar). First, receptor antagonist studies were performed in monocultures of preosteoclasts. They were pretreated with a prostaglandin receptor antagonist, AH6809 (EP1/EP2/DP antagonist) (14.Schmitz T. Dallot E. Leroy M.J. Breuiller-Fouche M. Ferre F. Cabrol D. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,15.Pelletier S. Dube J. Villeneuve A. Gobeil Jr., F. Yang Q. Battistini B. Guillemette G. Sirois P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), or the thromboxane receptor antagonist, SQ29548 (TP antagonist) (9.Unmack M.A. Rangachari P.K. Skadhauge E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 434-441PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Bhattacherjee P. Williams B.S. Paterson C.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 3047-3053PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Elmhurst J.L. Betti P.A. Rangachari P.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1198-1205PubMed Google Scholar), for 2 h followed by cotreatment with isoPGE2, M-CSF (25 ng/ml), and RANKL (40 ng/ml). Results revealed that AH6809, but not SQ29548, attenuated the isoPGE2 response (Fig. 5A). Treatment of preosteoclast monocultures with 5 μm thromboxane receptor agonist U46619 (36.Elmhurst J.L. Betti P.A. Rangachari P.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1198-1205PubMed Google Scholar) also failed to induce osteoclast-like cell formation (data not shown), suggesting that thromboxane receptor does not mediate isoPGE2 response. Pretreatment with SC51089 (EP1 antagonist) (11.Bhattacherjee P. Williams B.S. Paterson C.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 3047-3053PubMed Google Scholar) also did not inhibit isoPGE2 response (data not shown). Second, the receptor antagonist studies were repeated in cocultures of preosteoclasts with ST2 stromal cells. TRAP activity assay revealed that in the presence of ST2 stromal cells, all three antagonists (AH6809, SC51089, and SQ29548) attenuated the isoPGE2 response (Fig. 5B). The effects of these antagonists on PGE2-induced osteoclastogenesis also paralleled those on isoPGE2-induced osteoclastogenesis for both monoculture and coculture (data not shown). To assess whether other oxidized lipids affect the formation of osteoclasts, preosteoclast monocultures were treated with isoPGE2 (1 μm), oxLDL (1 μg/ml), or oxPAPC (1 μg/ml), a biologically active component of oxidized lipids, such as minimally oxidized LDL in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL. Results showed that both types of oxidized lipids enhanced TRAP activity of preosteoclasts (Fig. 6, A andB). In the present study, we investigated the effects of lipid oxidation products on osteoclastic differentiation of marrow hematopoietic precursor cells. Results showed that isoPGE2 enhancesin vitro osteoclastic potential and activity based on TRAP activity, multinucleation, actin ring formation, and functional resorptive activity. Results also indicate that isoPGE2 directly affects preosteoclasts based on the finding that isoPGE2 enhanced osteoclastic differentiation in the preosteoclast monoculture lacking a stromal feeder layer. IsoPGE2 may have the same or different effects as compared with other isoprostanes depending on tissue systems. In the present system, unlike isoPGE2, the isoprostane, isoPGF2α, was not osteoclastogenic. The two isoprostanes also have different effects in osteoblastic differentiation (22.Parhami F. Morrow A.D. Balucan J. Leitinger N. Watson A.D. Tintut Y. Berliner J.A. Demer L.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and in electrical responses of the small intestine (9.Unmack M.A. Rangachari P.K. Skadhauge E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 434-441PubMed Google Scholar). However, in other tissues, these two isoprostanes have the same effects (1.Liu T.Z. Stern A. Morrow J.D. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 5: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7.Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4317-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IsoPGE2 may also have the same or different effects as compared with its isomeric prostaglandin PGE2. In this system, PGE2 had the same effects as isoPGE2. Similar findings of PGE2 effects on osteoclastogenesis have been reported (12.Ono K. Akatsu T. Murakami T. Nishikawa M. Yamamoto M. Kugai N. Motoyoshi K. Nagata N. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: R1-RR5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Tomita M. Li X. Okada Y. Woodiel F.N. Young R.N. Pilbeam C.C. Raisz L.G.

Fuller K. Kim N.S. Choi Y. Chambers T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other systems, isoPGE2 has opposite effects to those of PGE2 (7.Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4317-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Downey G.P. Gumbay R.S.

Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). One explanation, as Morrow and Roberts (10.Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) suggested, is that these differential effects may depend on which part of the molecule is active, the ring structure or the stereochemistry of the side chains. The receptor(s) by which isoprostanes exert their biological effects also varies with tissue systems. In the present study, prostanoid-receptor antagonist treatments revealed that isoPGE2 as well as PGE2 may be acting directly on preosteoclasts through EP2/DP receptors but not EP1 or TP. In contrast, in cocultures of preosteoclasts with stromal/osteoblast cells, both EP and TP receptor antagonists inhibited the isoPGE2 response, suggesting that isoPGE2 is enhancing osteoclastic differentiation in part by acting on osteoblasts through EP1 and TP receptors. These results are consistent with other reports suggesting a possible involvement of EP receptor subtypes in isoprostane signaling (9.Unmack M.A. Rangachari P.K. Skadhauge E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 434-441PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Elmhurst J.L. Betti P.A. Rangachari P.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1198-1205PubMed Google Scholar). The EP4 receptor subtype has also been shown to be involved in mediating PGE2 effects in osteoclast formation (12.Ono K. Akatsu T. Murakami T. Nishikawa M. Yamamoto M. Kugai N. Motoyoshi K. Nagata N. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: R1-RR5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Tomita M. Li X. Okada Y. Woodiel F.N. Young R.N. Pilbeam C.C. Raisz L.G. Bone (NY). 2002; 30: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The results also indicate that osteoclastic differentiation induced by isoPGE2 is independent of production of reactive oxygen species and minimally dependent on prostaglandin synthesis based on results with oxygen radical scavengers and cyclooxygenase inhibitors. However, PKA inhibition clearly attenuated osteoclastic differentiation, suggesting that this pathway mediates the effects of isoPGE2. This was further supported by evidence of cAMP elevation in isoPGE2-treated preosteoclast monocultures. These findings are in agreement with reports by Lacey et al. (33.Lacey D.L. Erdmann J.M. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.L. Ohara J. Shioi A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2367-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and Wani et al. (37.Wani M.R. Fuller K. Kim N.S. Choi Y. Chambers T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showing that cAMP analogs induce osteoclastogenesis in non-adherent bone marrow hematopoietic precursor cells. PGE2 also acts through cAMP; however, this effect is in osteoblasts, which in turn affect osteoclastogenesis (13.Tomita M. Li X. Okada Y. Woodiel F.N. Young R.N. Pilbeam C.C. Raisz L.G.

It is generally believed that hypo/unacetylated histones associate with basal/repressed chromatin, whereas hyperacetylation of histones has been linked to transcriptionally active chromatin domains.

Given that histone acetylation plays an important role in modulating transcription, it is conceivable that the processes leading to histone acetylation are regulated and that their misregulation by cellular and viral proteins could have significant influences on chromatin modification and gene expression (7.Seo S.B.

Regulation of histone acetylation has been shown to be mediated by activities that bind either to the acetylases or the substrate histones. For example, while E1A inhibits histone acetylation by directly binding to p300/CBP and PCAF, RbAp 46/48 stimulates histone acetylation and transcription by p300/CBP by directly binding to histones (22.Chakravarti D.

Additionally, although acetylation of histones by p300/CBP, PCAF, and ACTR promotes transcription, acetylation of ACTR by p300/CBP destabilizes interactions between nuclear receptors and ACTR, resulting in attenuation of hormonal signaling (28.Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Therefore, protein acetylation may have both positive and negative regulatory roles in transcription.

INHAT binds to histones and inhibits p300/CBP- and PCAF-mediated histone acetylation. We referred to this mechanism as histone-masking (7.Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). INHAT is a multiprotein complex with the putative oncoprotein Set/TAF-Iβ, TAF-Iα, and a nuclear protein, pp32, as the major subunits. We had previously shown that Set inhibits HAT-mediated transcription when overexpressed in intact cells. These results suggest that INHAT may play a role in transcription by binding to histones. Although we have previously characterized the role of Set/TAF-Iβ in regulation of histone acetylation and transcription, very little is known about the role of pp32 in HAT regulation and transcription. Among the subunits, pp32 belongs to a family of acidic leucine-rich nuclear proteins that includes April, LANP, PHAP1, and Mapmodulin (29.Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Gotz H. Awni L.A. Cole T.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Additionally, LANP was shown to associate with ataxin-1, although the significance of that interaction is unclear (35.Matilla A. Koshy B.T. Cummings C.J. Isobe T. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). pp32 has also been reported to suppress cell transformation induced by multiple oncogenes, including Ras and Myc (30.Chen T.H. Brody J.R. Romantsev F.E. Yu J.G. Kayler A.E. Voneiff E. Kuhajda F.P. Pasternack G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 36.Brody J.R. Kadkol S.S.

Like Set/TAF-Iβ and TAF-Iα, pp32 also has a long C-terminal acidic tail, indicating an evolutionary conserved role for this domain in the function of these proteins. Besides their C-terminal acidic domains, little is known about any common or distinct characteristics of Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 in HAT and transcriptional regulation. Additionally, it is not clear how the activity of the individual INHAT subunits contributes to the overall activity of the complex and whether the activity of the subunits can be dictated based on whether they are free or part of the complex. In this report, we have analyzed the HAT inhibitory characteristics of INHAT subunits with emphasis on pp32. We show that the INHAT complex and each of its subunits show overlapping but distinct specificities in their HAT inhibitory activity by targeting different histone subunits. The colocalization studies show that although the full-length pp32 colocalizes with distinct histone domains in the nucleus, a mutant pp32 defective in HAT inhibition and histone binding fails to colocalize with histones, indicating that histone binding is a prerequisite for pp32 function in the regulation of histone acetylation and transcription. For bacterial and eukaryotic expression constructs of Set/TAF-Iβ, TAF-Iα, pp32, CBP, and their derivatives, the appropriate PCR-amplified fragments were cloned into pGEX4T2, CMX-PL1, RHNCMX-PL1, CMXGAL4, and pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) vectors. Sequences of all constructs surrounding the cloning sites were verified by automated sequencing. Recombinant GST proteins were purified using glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of baculovirus-expressed FLAG-p300 and FLAG-PCAF was carried out as described (22.Chakravarti D. Ogryzko V. Kao H.Y. Nash A. Chen H. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The INHAT complex was purified from HeLa cells as described (7.Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Histone and nucleosome acetyltransferase assays were performed as described previously (7.Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). [35S]methionine-labeled INHAT subunits and pp32-deletion mutant proteins were generated by in vitrotranscription/translation and used in histone binding and immunoprecipitation assays as described (7.Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). For histone binding specificities of INHAT subunits, individual histones were used for each assay instead of total histones. CV-1 cells were seeded at 20,000 cells/well of a 48-well dish as described (7.Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) with internal control pRLSV40 (5 ng) and MH100-TK-LUC (100 ng) as reporter. CMXGal4·CBP (200 ng) and CMXRHN·pp32 derivatives (100 and 50 ng) used for Fig. 6were added where indicated. The amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by addition of pCDNA3 vector. The results in Fig. 6are representative of three independent experiments. The margin of error was less than 10% between the mean values of each assay. The pp32 peptide (residues 150–180) was synthesized commercially (Annovis, Aston, PA). Product purity was greater than 85%, and the molecular weight of synthesized peptide was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. For endogenous pp32 detection, NIH3T3 cells seeded in 35-mm2 plate were fixed and incubated with anti-pp32 antibodies and immunocytostained with secondary antibody conjugated with FITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). NIH3T3 cells were seeded overnight and transiently transfected with pEGFP·C1-INHAT subunits and pEGFP-C1-pp32-C2 as indicated. After 24 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 50% acetone/methanol. For histone staining, cells were incubated with antihistone antibodies (Chemicon International), followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For nucleus detection, cells were incubated with DAPI (Molecular Probes) stain and mounted with Gel/Mount. Slides were examined under oil immersion with a confocal microscope with Bio-Rad 1024-ES using the Confocal AssistantTM program and Nikon Eclipse E-600 with X60 objectives. Raw data images were processed further using the Confocal AssistantTM program. Using baculovirus-expressed FLAG-tagged p300, PCAF, and pp32 purified as GST fusion proteins from Escherichia coli, we tested the ability of pp32 to inhibit histone and nucleosome acetylation. In agreement with previous results, the acetylation of core histones by p300 and PCAF was inhibited by addition of saturating concentrations of pp32 (Fig. 1, comparelanes 1 and 3 to lanes 2 and4, respectively). Additionally, nucleosomal histone acetylation by p300 and PCAF was also inhibited by pp32 (data not shown). No proteolytic degradation of histones in the presence of pp32 was evident (Fig. 1, Coomassie and data not shown). These observations demonstrate that pp32 inhibits histone acetylation and prompted us to finely map the HAT inhibitory domain(s) of pp32. pp32 contains previously characterized structural domains, including a highly acidic C-terminal domain homologous to that of TAF-I (amino acids 167–249), an α-helical N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–206), and a central domain containing the tumor suppressive activity that spans amino acids 150–174 (30.Chen T.H. Brody J.R. Romantsev F.E. Yu J.G. Kayler A.E. Voneiff E. Kuhajda F.P. Pasternack G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 36.Brody J.R. Kadkol S.S. Mahmoud M.A. Rebel J.M. Pasternack G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20053-20055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We generated and purified a series of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of pp32 as GST fusion proteins and examined their HAT inhibitory activity in order to identify the HAT inhibitory domain(s) of pp32 (Fig. 2A). Approximately the same amount of expressed mutant proteins was used for the HAT inhibitory activity assay, and purified GST protein alone had no effect on the assay system (data not shown). When compared with the full-length protein (Construct 1), deletion of large parts of the acidic C-terminal residues 181–249 of pp32 (pp32-C1,Construct 2) overall had no effect on the INHAT activity. However, further deletion of additional C-terminal sequences (residues 151–180) resulted in the loss of the entire inhibitory activity (pp32-C2, Construct 3). Interestingly, this domain overlaps with the tumor suppressor domain of pp32 (36.Brody J.R. Kadkol S.S. Mahmoud M.A. Rebel J.M. Pasternack G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20053-20055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results suggest that a major HAT inhibitory domain of pp32 resides between amino acids 151 and 180. A series of pp32 N-terminal deletion mutant proteins was also generated and tested for the ability to inhibit histone acetylation. It is interesting that the deletion of the first 1–59 residues of pp32 (pp32-N1, Construct 4) showed a slight increase in INHAT activity when compared with that of the full-length pp32. This suggests the possible existence of a negative autoregulatory domain in the N terminus of pp32 (residues 1–59). The overall role of this domain in pp32 activity in vivo remains to be determined. Consistent with the results of C-terminal deletion analysis, both pp32-N2 (Construct 5), which lacks residues 1–119, and pp32-N3 (Construct 6), which lacks residues 1–149 of the N terminus, showed strong HAT inhibitory activity. Although deletion of residues 181–249 did not significantly affect the HAT inhibitory activity of pp32-C1 (Construct 2), pp32-N5, which only contains the C-terminal residues 190–249, still retained reasonably strong INHAT activity (Construct 7). Thus, the removal of amino acids 150–180 uncovered a direct role for the C-terminal acidic domain of pp32 that is similar to the INHAT domain of Set/TAF-Iβ and TAF-Iα in the inhibition of histone acetylation (7.Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Together, these results putatively map the HAT inhibitory domains of pp32 at the C terminus of the protein in two separable subdomains termed pp32 INHAT domain I (residues 151–180) and domain II (residues 190–249). To directly test whether pp32 INHAT domain I functions independently in inhibiting histone acetylation, a peptide covering the INHAT domain I of pp32 (residues 150–180) was synthesized and analyzed in HAT assays. A schematic diagram of pp32 illustrating the putative INHAT domain and the amino acid composition of peptide pp32 is shown in Fig. 2B. The pp32 INHAT peptide strongly inhibited p300-mediated acetylation of core histones (data not shown) and four individually purified histone subunits in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). The relative IC50 values of this peptide toward the individual histones H2B, H2A, H3, and H4 ranged between 0.6 and 1.5 μm (Fig. 2C). These results are consistent with those obtained with purified full-length pp32 protein and further directly implicate INHAT domain I, spanning amino acids 150–180, as a major determinant of the INHAT activity of pp32. Histone and chromatin binding activity of both TAF-I proteins has been previously reported (37.Matsumoto K. Nagata K. Okuwaki M. Tsujimoto M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown that the INHAT complex associates with histones on chromatin in vivo and blocks them from serving as acetylase substrates, implying a critical role for histone binding in the INHAT-mediated inhibition of acetylation (7.Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To determine whether HAT inhibitory properties of pp32 mutants correlate with their histone binding characteristics, we compared the histone binding properties of pp32 mutants. In vitro immunoprecipitation experiments utilizing radiolabeled full-length and mutant pp32 proteins with total histones were carried out to determine the histone binding properties of pp32. pp32-C1, which retained histone acetylation inhibitory activity, was efficiently immunoprecipitated with antihistone antibodies (Fig. 3A, lane 3) in a manner similar to the histone binding properties of full-length pp32 (Fig. 3A, lane 8). Importantly, however, pp32-C2, which lacks INHAT domains I and II and had lost its HAT inhibitory activity (Fig. 2), did not bind to histones (Fig. 3A,lane 6), providing a strong correlation between histone binding and the HAT inhibitory activity of pp32. The N-terminal mutant proteins were also tested for their histone binding ability, and as predicted from their HAT inhibitory activity, all N-terminal mutants tested bound to histones with comparable affinity (Fig. 3B,lanes 3, 6, and 9). Together these results suggest histone binding as a prerequisite for HAT inhibition by pp32. We also tested the hypothesis that pp32 and other INHAT subunits might have distinct binding affinities toward different histone subunits. To address this question of histone binding specificity, we analyzed the binding properties of pp32 and the other INHAT subunits to individual histones in vitro. For that purpose, radiolabeled full-length pp32 was incubated with each histone subunit separately and immunoprecipitated with antihistone antibodies. The antihistone antibodies bound specifically to an antigenic determinant that is present on all four histone subunits and pulled down approximately the same amount of isolated histone subunits (data not shown). Histones H2B and H3 showed stronger interaction with pp32 (Fig. 4, panel I). Analysis of histone subunit binding by Set/TAF-Iβ demonstrated that this subunit has the strongest affinity to histone H3 and histone H4 (Fig. 4,panel II). TAF-Iα bound with higher affinity to histones H4 and H2B (Fig. 4, panel III). It is interesting that the reconstituted INHAT complex, where all three INHAT subunits are combined, showed stronger interactions with histones H3 and H4 (Fig. 4,panel IV) and little interaction with histone H2B. Binding to histone H2A was very low with all three individual subunits of the INHAT complex. The above results indicate the INHAT complex displays a histone binding property that is overall different from that of its individual subunits. From these in vitro results we have concluded that INHAT and its subunits have distinct but overlapping histone binding properties, and we suggest that individual INHAT activity of subunits may be regulated by their physical association with other subunits. To determine whether histone binding properties of INHAT and its subunits correlate with the ability to inhibit individual histone acetylation, the inhibitory activity of INHAT and its subunits toward each histone subunit was titrated (Fig. 4B). In agreement with the histone subunit binding properties of pp32 (Fig. 4A), inhibition of histone H2B acetylation by pp32 was slightly higher than that of the other subunits (Fig. 4B,panel pp32). Inhibition by purified Set/TAF-Iβ protein was very similar for all histone subunits, although it displayed a lower binding affinity for histone H2B. However, the INHAT complex showed slightly lower inhibitory activity toward histone H2B, in agreement with its histone subunit binding properties. Together these results indicate that INHAT and its individual subunits display distinct but overlapping histone substrate preferences in vitro and that the inhibition of histone acetylation specificity of INHAT subunits may be regulated by their physical association with other subunits. The observation that pp32 and other INHAT subunits associate with histonesin vitro led us to investigate whether they would individually colocalize with histones in vivo. We have previously shown, using ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays, that INHAT forms a complex with histones in vivo (7.Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Localization of endogenous pp32 was examined using anti-pp32 antibodies and a secondary antibody conjugated with FITC. Next we generated C-terminal GFP fusions of pp32, TAF-Iα, and TAF-Iβ proteins and carried out colocalization studies to demonstrate the association between individual INHAT subunits and histones in intact cells. NIH3T3 cells transfected with expression constructs coding individual GFP-fused INHAT subunits were immunostained with antihistone antibodies and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies. They were DAPI stained and analyzed by confocal fluorescence imaging microscopy. Intact histones and nuclei were detected by anti-Cy3-histone antibodies and DAPI staining, respectively. Endogenous pp32 was predominantly found in the nucleus, with some cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 5A, FITC-pp32). The overlay and individual detection of endogenous pp32 and histones show both proteins are in the nucleus (Fig. 5A). In agreement with the localization of endogenous pp32, GFP·pp32 was also detected mainly in the nucleus (Fig. 5, A and B,FITC-pp32 and GFP·pp32), whereas GFP·TAF-Iα and GFP·Set/TAF-Iβ exhibited both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining (Fig. 5, D and E,GFP·TAF-Iα andGFP·Set/TAF-Iβ) in our assay conditions. No specific immunofluorescence signal was detected in the nuclei of NIH3T3 cells when primary antibodies were substituted with anti-mouse control antibodies (data not shown). Based on the hypothesis that INHAT binds to histones on chromatin, prevents them from being acetylated, and serves as a component of the repressive/basal state of chromatin, one would expect that under normal circumstances INHAT and histones would localize on some but not all chromatin domains. The overlay of staining of endogenous as well as GFP·pp32 and histones showed colocalization of pp32 and histones inside the cell nucleus. As expected, it was also evident that a significant fraction of histones did not colocalize with pp32 under these assay conditions, suggesting that the histone-INHAT interaction is specific and implying that binding of histones to pp32 may be regulated at different chromatin loci in the nucleus. It remains to be determined whether pp32-histone colocalized domains represent repressed/basal chromatin and whether histone domains lacking pp32 represent the active state of chromatin. Although a significant amount of TAF-I proteins displayed cytoplasmic localization, it nonetheless showed nuclear colocalization with histones at varying levels (Fig. 5, D and E). Our in vitro binding studies demonstrated that pp32-C2 failed to inhibit histone acetylation and did not bind to histones. We utilized GFP·pp32-C2 in colocalization analysis to further demonstrate the interaction specificity between pp32 and histonesin vivo. Like GFP·pp32, GFP·pp32-C2 localized in the nucleus (Fig. 5C). However, in contrast to the GFP·pp32, which showed extensive colocalization with histones (Fig. 5B, overlay), a dramatic reduction in colocalization of GFP·pp32-C2 and histones, as judged by the decreased number of bright yellow speckles, was observed (Fig. 5C, overlay). These results again demonstrate the specificity of the in vivo interactions between histones and pp32. Taken together, these in vivo colocalization studies are consistent with the hypothesis that the HAT inhibitory activity of the individual INHAT subunits is accomplished through mechanisms that at least in part involve histone binding. The demonstration that HAT inhibition by pp32 occurs through histone binding mediated by its INHAT domain implies that this domain may play a regulatory role in HAT-mediated transcription. We and others have shown that a Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion of CBP (Gal4·CBP: 1092–2002) activates transcription in a HAT-dependent manner (7.Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 38.Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bannister A.J. Martin K. Haus-Seuffert P. Meisterernst M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that Gal4·CBP-mediated transcriptional activation was severely inhibited by the overexpression of Set/TAF-Iβ in an INHAT domain-dependent mannerin vivo (7.Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of pp32 and its INHAT domains on CBP-HAT-directed transcription, the Gal4·CBP (1092–2002) construct was cotransfected with various pp32 constructs, and the expression of the Gal4 responsive reporter gene was analyzed. The Gal4·DBD fusion of CBP activated transcription as expected (Fig. 6, lane Gal4·CBPand Ref. 7.Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). This Gal4·CBP HAT-mediated transcription was severely inhibited at varying degrees by all pp32 constructs tested except for pp32-C2, which does not contain the INHAT domains (Fig. 6). These overexpression studies imply a regulatory role for pp32 in HAT-mediated transcription and suggest that pp32 may serve as a component of the basal/repressive state of genes. In this study we have characterized differential HAT inhibitory activity of the INHAT subunits with special emphasis on pp32 and have proposed a role for INHAT in the maintenance of a basal/repressive chromatin state. We provide in vitro evidence demonstrating that the INHAT complex and its individual subunits show distinct but overlapping histone target and HAT inhibition specificities and that these properties may be regulated based on their physical existence in free or complexed form with other subunits. In vivocolocalization and transcription studies suggest a role for the INHAT domain of pp32 in histone binding, HAT inhibitory activity, and transcriptional repression. Using N- and C-terminal deletion mutagenesis, we show that pp32 contains two independent HAT inhibitory domains. Although the pp32 INHAT domain I maps between amino acids 150 and 180, pp32 INHAT domain II, which is similar to the INHAT domain of TAF-I proteins, resides between amino acids 190 and 249. Because the INHAT domain I overlaps with the tumor suppressor domain, it will be important to determine in the future whether the INHAT activity plays any role in this latter property of pp32. In agreement with the HAT inhibitory properties, a pp32 mutant defective in HAT inhibition also fails to bind histones, suggesting that histone binding is an integral part of pp32-mediated HAT inhibition. Although isolated pp32 binds to and inhibits acetylation of histone H2B and H3 with high affinity, this H2B preference is lost when pp32 is incorporated into the INHAT complex, which predominantly binds to and inhibits acetylation of histones H3 and H4. These results are consistent with the distinct HAT inhibitory properties of INHAT and its subunits and are quite remarkable in that they suggest that the in vivo function of TAF-Iα, Set/TAF-Iβ, and pp32 may well be determined by their existence either as free proteins or as subunits of the INHAT complex. This prediction becomes more relevant because the INHAT subunits have also been purified in other biological contexts, either in free forms or as part of a complex with other proteins (31.Matsuoka K. Taoka M. Satozawa N. Nakayama H. Ichimura T. Takahashi N. Yamakuni T. Song S.Y. Isobe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9670-9674Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 33.Ulitzur N.

The in vivo implication of these differential histone binding and HAT inhibitory properties of the INHAT subunits remains to be determined. Consistent with previous reports, our colocalization studies demonstrate that pp32 is predominantly nuclear and show that it associates with certain subnuclear domains of histones, suggesting the pp32 and/or INHAT bind to selected sites on chromatin. Although the identities of these sites have not been determined, it is possible that pp32-targeted histones may represent repressed chromatin, and histone domains free of pp32 and INHAT may indicate the active state of chromatin. This in vivo binding of pp32 to histones is specific, because a pp32 mutant defective in HAT inhibition andin vitro histone binding demonstrated a significant reduction in colocalization with histones in vivo. When overexpressed, pp32 inhibits Gal4·CBP-mediated transactivation, implicating a role for pp32 in regulating HAT-mediated transcriptional events and suggesting a role for pp32 in the maintenance of the basal/repressive state of genes. Based on the implication that INHAT subunits are components of the basal/repressive state of genes, we propose that the regulation of INHAT activity by cellular mechanisms, which prevent their binding to histones, will play an important role during activation of transcription. In summary, our results describe overlapping but distinct HAT inhibitory and histone binding properties of INHAT and its subunits. The recently proposed histone code hypothesis envisions that the level and combination of epigenetic marking, including acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation on histones, will play a fundamental role in chromatin-based processes, including transcription (2.Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar,6.Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7709) Google Scholar). An extension of this hypothesis is that the epigenetic marking of histones (including acetylation) therefore should be regulated. Given that the histone code dictates the transition between transcriptionally active and silent chromatin states, we propose that INHAT and other yet to be identified parallel complexes will play a significant role in the establishment and maintenance of the histone code, reflecting the transcriptional off or on states of chromatin domains.

We determined the solution structure of AcpM using protein NMR spectroscopy to define the similarities and differences between AcpM and the typical structures.

FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In contrast, the type II system found in bacteria and plants consists of a set of discrete monofunctional proteins, each encoded by a separate gene (2Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C.

ACP1 is central to both of these pathways because it functions to ferry the pathway intermediates between active site centers or enzymes. ACPs are also critical to the function of other metabolic pathways such as polyketide synthases (4Hopwood D.A. Sherman D.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 37-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The type II fatty acid synthase ACPs are abundant, small, acidic proteins that carry the acyl intermediates attached as thioesters to the terminus of the 4′-PP prosthetic group (2Cronan Jr., J.E.

This prosthetic group is added post-translationally to apoACP by holo-(acyl carrier protein) synthase (AcpS), which transfers the 4′-PP moiety of CoA to Ser-36 of apoACP.

These proteins are very similar and are composed of a four-α-helix bundle with the prosthetic group attached to a conserved Ser-36 located in helix II.

The high degree of similarity among these structures is consistent with the ACPs from one species being used efficiently by the fatty acid synthase enzymes from another species.

AcpM is highly expressed in E. coli and is isolated as a mixture of apoAcpM, AcpM, and AcpM acylated by long-chain fatty acids, primarily palmitate (data not shown) (16Schaeffer M.L. Agnihotri G.

Although AcpM functions with the type II enzymes in E. coli (16Schaeffer M.L. Agnihotri G. Kallender H. Brennan P.J. Lonsdale J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it is unique compared with all other bacterial type II ACPs. The protein is similar to the other ACPs in the amino terminus but contains an extended carboxyl terminus of about 35 residues for which the structure and function are unknown. In this report, we define the solution structure of AcpM by protein NMR spectroscopy. The goals are to determine whether this novel ACP has a core structure similar to the typical bacterial ACPs, to define the structure of the unique carboxyl-terminal extension on AcpM, and to gain insight into the dynamics of the 4′-PP prosthetic group, which the published ACP NMR structures have not addressed. The acpMgene was amplified from M. tuberculosis λgt11 genomic library using primer pair 5′-CATATGCCTGTCACTCAGGAAG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCAAGGCTGACTCACTT-3′ to introduce a NdeI site at the initiator methionine and a BamHI site downstream the stop codon. The PCR product was ligated into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The clone with the correct DNA sequence was digested withNdeI and BamHI and ligated into the pET11a vector. The uniform 15N or15N/13C-labeled AcpM was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RP growing in MOPS minimal medium containing 0.1% 15NH4Cl or 0.1%15NH4Cl and 0.2%d-[U-13C]glucose. Cell pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Cells were lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. The AcpM protein in the cell-free extract was purified using gradient elution from a DEAE-cellulose column followed by gel filtration on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 column. The purified protein sample was subjected to mass spectral analysis and determined to be a mixture of apoAcpM, AcpM, acyl-AcpM (acylated with a variety of saturated long-chain fatty acids consisting of 14, 16, and 18 carbon acyl chains), and AcpM dimers. To get a sample containing only apoAcpM and AcpM for NMR spectroscopy, protein purified by gel filtration chromatography was treated with 100 mm DTT at 37 °C overnight to reduce the dimer to monomer AcpM, and to remove acyl chains, converting acyl-AcpM to AcpM. A precipitate formed during the reaction because of the formation of acyl-DTT, which is insoluble. The apo- and holoforms were separated from the precipitate by centrifugation and dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, at 4 °C overnight. E. coliHis-tagged, purified AcpS protein was used to convert apoAcpM to holoAcpM. The reaction contained 2 mm AcpM (a mixture of apo- and holoforms), 10 mm CoA, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, and 3.6 μg of E. coliAcpS in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. After incubation at 37 °C overnight, the AcpM was repurified. Two types of AcpM samples were generated for the structural studies. One was 15N-labeled, and another one was dual labeled with 15N/13C. The15N/13C-labeled sample was converted to 100% holoAcpM as described above, and the 15N-labeled sample was a mixture of apo- (about 40%) and holoforms (about 60%). Because15N/13C-labeled protein was synthesized using an 15N/13C enriched medium and unlabeled CoA was used to convert apoAcpM to AcpM, only about 40% of the bound 4′-PP groups in the sample were 15N/13C-labeled, and the rest of them were unlabeled. Protein samples were dialyzed against 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.1 mm DTT and 0.1% NaN3 at 4 °C. The dialyzed samples were concentrated to about 2 mm for NMR spectroscopy studies. All NMR data were acquired with Varian Inova 600-MHz spectrometers at 27 °C.

Side-chain resonances were assigned on the basis of three-dimensional 15N-edited TOCSY, HCCH-COSY, and HCCH-TOCSY spectra. The NOE connections were assigned on the basis of three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY and13C-edited NOESY with the help of four-dimensional15N/13C NOESY and four-dimensional13C/13C HMQC-NOESY-HSQC. An automated program, NOAH (22Mumenthaler C. Guntert P. Braun W. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), was used for the NOE assignment and all the assignments were manually checked. A total of 2043 meaningful distance constraints were derived from NMR data. Integrated NOE peaks were calibrated and converted to distance constraints with the program CALIBA (23Guntert P. Braun W. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). In the final structural determination, the program DYANA (24Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar) was used, and torsion angle dynamics (TAD) combined with a simulated annealing algorithm was employed in the calculation. A sequence alignment of the ACPs from M. tuberculosis andM. leprae with typical bacterial ACPs is shown in Fig.1. The proteins have a high degree of similarity, especially around the serine residue where the prosthetic group is attached and extending along helix II. The most notable difference between AcpM and other ACPs that function in the type II fatty acid synthase systems is the carboxyl-terminal extension. A search of current sequence data bases failed to detect any significant similarity between the unique AcpM carboxyl-terminal extension and other sequences. The structure of AcpM from M. tuberculosis was studied by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The resonance assignments were obtained from an array of heteronuclear experiments. The backbone assignments were achieved through conventional strategy by using CBCANH and HN(CO)CBCA experiments (25Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 26Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 27Wong H.C. Mao J. Nguyen J.T. Srinivas S. Li, L., Wu W. Zhang D. Zheng J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The side-chain assignments were mainly derived from 13C-HCCH-TOCSY and13C-HCCH-COSY data. The NOE constraints were obtained from both 15N-edited NOESY and15N/13C-edited NOESY spectra. A total of 2043 unique NOE distance restraints were identified; a summary of these constraints is illustrated in Fig. 2. On the basis of resonance assignments using the program CSI (20Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar) and the chemical shift values (mainly the Cα and CO chemical shifts), four helical regions were clearly identified. This result was consistent with the distribution of NOEs; within these regions, helical characteristic medium range, Hαi-HNi+3and Hαi-Hβi+3, as well as strong sequential HNi-HNi+1 NOEs were clearly observed. In the carboxyl-terminal extension, a few helical elements were detected by CSI. However, other than intra-residence and sequential NOE distance constraints, few NOEs were found, which indicates that there was no defined structure in this section of the protein. The structure of the AcpM was determined based on 2043 NOE distance constraints and 48 hydrogen bond restraints derived from NMR measurements. In the final calculation, a total 320 structures were calculated using the program DYANA (24Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar); 20 structures with the lowest target functions were selected and superimposed (Fig. 3). The structural statistics are given in Table I. All experimental NMR constraints were well stratified, and there were no NOE constraint violations of more than 0.35 Å. Although no dihedral torsion angle constraint was applied in the structural calculation, most residues have Φ and Ψ dihedral angles in the most favorable or favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table I). The only residue that is in the disallowed region is Phe-33, which is located in the long loop between two helices. The solution structure was of high precision. The average root mean square deviation from the average structure for backbone heavy atoms (C′, Cα, N) of the first 90 residues was 0.42 Å. Within the four well folded helical regions, the average root mean square deviation for backbone heavy atoms was 0.31 Å.Table IStatistics for AcpM structureNumber of restraintsNOE distance restraints Intra-residue1108 Inter-residueShort range465Medium range340Long range130 Total NOE distances2043 Hydrogen bonds48Residues 3–84Secondary structureAverage r.m.s.d. from the mean structure (Å)1-aThe average root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between the 20 structures of the lowest target functions and the mean coordinates of the protein.

Open table in a new tab The structure of AcpM consists of a folded amino-terminal region and a highly flexible and structurally undefined carboxyl terminus. The four α-helices in the structure of AcpM comprise a “right-turn” helical bundle (Fig. 1). Its topology is “square,” as classified by Cohen and co-workers (28Harris N.L. Presnell S.R. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In antiparallel helix packing, all four helices (I–IV) are connected by “underhand” loops. Helix I (residues Gln-5 to Val-19), II (Asp-40 to Lys-54), and IV (Val-70 to Glu-81) are of approximately equal length with an up-down-down topology. Helix III (Asp-61 to Leu-67) is relatively short compared with the other helices. The length of the loops that connect these four helices is also variable. The loop between helices I and II is the longest and contains about 20 residues. The four-helix bundle is the central architectural feature of the AcpM, and this helical bundle is maintained by hydrophobic interactions between the helices. The helix I contains seven hydrophobic residues. Ile-12, Ile-15, and Val-19 form hydrophobic contacts with Met-44 and Ile-47 (contacts with both Ile-15 and Val-19) from helix II, and residues Ile-8 and Ile-12 are in close contact with Val-74 and Val-73 of helix IV. Helix III, which is the shortest helix, has contacts with Ala-48 in helix II and Tyr-76 in helix IV through residue Leu-64. The three loops that connect the four helices in the ACP domain are all highly ordered. Loop 1, which connects helices I and II, is the longest, and despite the large number of residues, it is not flexible and has a defined structure. Several hydrophobic contacts between the residues within the loop and residues in the helical core keep the loop in close contact with the helical bundle. Notably, the side chains of residues Ile-27 and Pro-29 within the loop have contacts with Ile-16 and Ile-9 in helix I. The loop is further stabilized by an intra-loop salt bridge, Glu-26 and Lys-31. Loop 2 and Loop 3 connect helix III to the main helical bundle, and residues in both loops have contacts to the main helical core. For example, Ile-59 in Loop 2 and Leu-67 in Loop 3 form hydrophobic contacts with Ile-77 and Tyr-76 in helix IV, respectively. Furthermore, Lys-58 forms a salt bridge with Glu-81 in the carboxyl terminus of helix IV. These interactions function to reduce the flexibility of the helix III, the shortest helix in the structure. NMR structures of the E. coli ACP (29Kim Y. Prestegard J.H. Proteins. 1990; 8: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Holak T.A. Kearsley S.K. Kim Y. Prestegard J.H.

Structure. 2001; 9: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), as well as the crystal structure of the B. subtilis ACP in the ACP·AcpS complex (8Parris K.D. Lin L. Tam A. Mathew R. Hixon J. Stahl M. Fritz C.C. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Structure. 2000; 8: 883-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) have been reported. The secondary structure elements and overall folding of these proteins are very similar. Comparison of the AcpM solution structure with these ACP structures indicates that the structured amino-terminal domain of AcpM possesses the common ACP fold. The superposition of AcpM with each of the known ACP structures over backbone atoms of the helical core is illustrated in Fig.4. The structural homology is obvious and extends to all four helices. Variations in the structures are apparent in the loop regions, although it is not clear whether any of these differences could be attributed to the conditions of data collection and structural refinement. Despite the differences in sequences among the ACPs (Fig. 1), a detailed examination revealed that the interhelical hydrophobic interactions, which stabilize the helical bundle of ACPs, are very similar. For example, in our AcpM structure, Ala-48 in helix II forms hydrophobic contacts with Val-73 in helix IV. In the three other bacterial ACP structures, the residue corresponding to the AcpM Ala-48 in helix II is valine (Val-43 in E. coliACP sequence), whereas the residue in helix IV corresponding to Val-73 is alanine (Ala-68 in E. coli ACP). Therefore, the nature of the alanine-valine contact is the same in all the ACPs. The DSL motif (Asp-40, Ser-41, and Leu-42 in the AcpM sequence) is conserved in all of the ACP sequences, and the 4′-PP prosthetic group is covalently linked via a phosphodiester bond to the serine residue. Closer examinations of all four ACP structures revealed that a high degree of structure homology exists in the region adjacent to the DSL motif. In all four structures, the DSL sequence is present at the amino terminus of helix II (Fig. 4). This strong structural homology of the DSL region in AcpM to other bacterial ACPs provides a rationale for why AcpS and the enzymes of E. coli type II fatty acid synthesis use ACPs from other species as well as the species-specific ACP. The similarities are strongest along helix II, a domain of the protein referred to as the recognition helix, which is responsible for the interaction of ACPs with the enzymes of type II fatty acid synthesis (10Zhang Y.M. Rao M.S. Heath R.J. Price A.C. Olson A.J. Rock C.O. White S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8231-8238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Increased mobility in the carboxyl-terminal segment is clear from both the relaxation (Fig. 5) and solvent exchange/accessibility data (data not shown), suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal domain of AcpM exists as a “molten domain.” The steady-state heteronuclear 15N[1H] NOE value versus the residue number is shown in Fig. 5. Because the lengths of the N–H bonds are fixed, the15N[1H] NOE values report information about the dynamics of N–H bonds and are used to determine whether a particular amide is in a folded or unfolded region of a protein. The value of the heteronuclear 15N[1H] NOE for folded residues is ∼0.7–1; the NOE value for a flexible loop is ∼0.3–0.5; and the NOE value for the unstructured residues is between −1.0 and 0 (31Fushman D. Najmabadi-Haske T. Cahill S. Zheng J. LeVine III, H. Cowburn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2835-2843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although we did not detect any defined secondary structural elements in the carboxyl-terminal domain, the structure of this region remains relatively ordered until Glu-96. Past this point, the values of 1H[15N] NOEs are less than zero, indicating a completely melted down random coil. The dynamic study showed the gradual loss of NOEs in this region, which is characteristic for an unfolded structure. Nevertheless, the AcpM NOESY data indicate several close contacts between the carboxyl-terminal domain and helix I in the amino-terminal ACP fold, mainly in the first few residues of the sequence. Specifically, we observed NOE contacts between Thr-4 and Gln-5 in helix I with Gln-89. A special term, “natively unfolded,” is applied to protein domains that have little or no ordered structure under physiological conditions (32Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar, 33Ma C.J. Tsai B. Sham Y.Y. Kumar S. Nussinov R. Proteins. 2001; 44: 418-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 34Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar); many intrinsically unstructured proteins have been identified and studied (34Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Unstructured proteins are inherently flexible, and their conformations are readily shaped through interactions with other molecules (32Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar, 35Xu C.J. Tsai D. Nussinov R. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: R71-R80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The intrinsic plasticity of “natively folded” proteins offers several important advantages in regulatory systems in which the unstructured protein is induced to interact with a number of different partners (32Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). Indeed, the requirement for a folding transition upon binding of a disordered protein domain to a target contributes significantly to the specificity of the interaction (32Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). The molten down, unfolded structure of the carboxyl-terminal extension of AcpM has the hallmark features of a natively folded domain, suggesting that it plays multiple roles in the function of the AcpM. The mycobacterial type II fatty acid synthase produces very long chain mycolic acids that give rise to the unique cell envelope structure of this group of organisms (36Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). Thus, one possible function of the unique AcpM carboxyl-terminal domain is to interact with the variety of long-chain fatty acid intermediates carried by the protein (15Barry III, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 37Kolattukudy P.E. Fernandes N.D. Azad A.K. Fitzmaurice A.M. Sirakova T.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). More than half the residues in the unstructured AcpM domain are classified as hydrophobic, and the domain may function to sequester from solvent the steadily elongating acyl chain bound to the prosthetic group. In this scenario, the unstructured carboxyl-terminal domain in AcpM would fold to a different extent to accommodate the spectrum of long-chain and very long chain acyl intermediates in mycolic acid biosynthesis. Experimental validation of this idea awaits the development of technologies that allow the synthesis of very long-chain acyl-AcpM. On the other hand, it is also plausible that the carboxyl-terminal extension may be involved in protein-protein interactions. In the type II fatty acid synthase, ACP interacts with a variety of functionally different enzymes (10Zhang Y.M. Rao M.S. Heath R.J. Price A.C. Olson A.J. Rock C.O. White S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8231-8238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The unstructured domain may allow AcpM to interact specifically with pathway enzymes, perhaps by presenting a slightly different structure for each acyl intermediate and thereby directing the cargo to the appropriate pathway enzyme. The carboxyl-terminal domain may also act as an inhibitor of the interaction of acyl-AcpM with acyltransferases. It is interesting that long-chain acyl-AcpM accumulate in E. coli, suggesting that AcpM is able to productively interact with the enzymes of type II fatty acid synthesis but is not a substrate for the glycerol-phosphate acyltransferases involved in the formation of membrane phospholipids. Thus, the carboxyl terminus may function to prevent the acyl chains destined for mycolic acids from being diverted to membrane phospholipid formation. Clearly, further studies of the AcpM structure(s) in the presence of proteins that it interacts with will shed the light on the role of the carboxyl-terminal domain mycolic acid synthesis. The 4′-PP prosthetic group is covalently attached to the Ser-41 in AcpM. Based on the observation that no NOE was detected between the 4′-PP and ACP residues in B. subtilis ACP, it was suggested that the 4′-PP is readily accessible at the protein surface. Because our15N/13C-labeled AcpM sample had about 60% of the 4′-PP molecules unlabeled, we were able to perform a number of “filtered-edited” experiments (38Zwahlen C. Legault P. Vincent S. Greenblatt J. Konrat R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6711-6721Crossref Scopus (533) Google Scholar) to study the interaction between 4′-PP and protein. Consistent with the observations reported in previous NMR ACP structures (7Xu G.Y. Tam A. Lin L. Hixon J. Fritz C.C. Powers R. Structure. 2001; 9: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), no inter-NOEs between the prosthetic group and protein itself were detected in our experiments. Our analysis of the differences in the amide proton and nitrogen chemical shift of residues in apoAcpM and AcpM revealed a clearer picture of the prosthetic group dynamics. 15N-HSQC spectrum of the mixture of apo- and holoforms of 15N labeled AcpM showed that majority of the residues in the AcpM have same amide proton and nitrogen chemical shift. However, about a dozen residues had different amide proton and/or nitrogen chemical shifts in the apo- compared with the holoform. The differences were small enough so that we were easily able to assign every residue in the apo form based on the resonance assignment in the holoprotein. No significant chemical shift differences were noted between apoAcpM and AcpM, suggesting that the structures of the two forms are essentially the same. Nevertheless, the observation of the chemical shift differences between the two forms shows that the bound 4′-PP group interacts with the protein. Using the equation provided by Kurt Wuthrich and co-workers (39Pellecchia M. Sebbel P. Hermanns U. Wuthrich K. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) to combine the chemical shift difference of proton and nitrogen shift together, we summarized the chemical shift changes between apoAcpM and AcpM (see Fig. 6). The diameter of the sausage corresponds to the sum of 1H and 15N shift perturbation due to the bound 4′-PP group. The chemical shift perturbations were detected in residues that range from helix I to the loop that connects helix III and helix IV. No perturbations were observed for helix IV and the carboxyl-terminal coil. Large perturbations were observed for Phe-33, Asp-40, Ser-41, Leu-42, Thr-51, Glu-52, Ala-65 and Gly 66. These residues, with the exception of Thr-51 and Glu-52, are structurally close to Ser-41, which is covalently linked to the 4′-PP group. Thr-51 and Glu-52, located in the carboxyl terminus of the helix II, were also perturbed, indicating transient interaction with the prosthetic group. Small perturbations were also found in the loop region that connects helix II with helix III (Fig.6). Together, those residues form an extended hydrophobic region around Ser-41. The chemical shift of a nucleus is sensitive to changes in the local environment, including aromatic ring-current effects, peptide bond anisotropy, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding. When a ligand binds to a protein, the interactions between them cause changes in the environment of the nuclei at the interfaces, resulting in chemical shift changes. The analysis of the AcpM chemical shift data clearly points to the 4′-PP group spending part of the time bound to the hydrophobic pocket. It is likely that the attached 4′-PP group experiences a rapid exchange between two states, one that is bound to the hydrophobic pocket and another that is solvent-exposed. These two states are consistent with the dual function of ACPs, which need to both load and unload cargo (acyl intermediates) into the active sites of the type II enzymes while protecting the cargo from solvent when shuttling the fatty acyl intermediates between the enzymes of type II fatty acid synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W1968858083,"CD40 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. CD40 expression on antigen-presenting cells (including macrophages and microglia) is crucial for T-cell activation. Aberrant expression of CD40 has been associated with autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. We have recently shown that the cytokine interferon (IFN)-γ is the most potent inducer of CD40 expression in macrophages and microglia, and this induction is mediated by the IFN-γ-activated transcription factor STAT-1α and constitutively expressed PU.1 and/or Spi-B. In this study, we have discovered that a major component of IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression involves the endogenous production of the cytokine TNF-α. The inclusion of anti-TNF-α-neutralizing antibody significantly inhibits IFN-γ-induced CD40 mRNA and CD40 promoter activity. IFN-γ-induced CD40 protein expression is attenuated in TNF-α-deficient microglia and can be restored with exogenous TNF-α. Site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrate that three of the four NF-κB elements in the CD40 promoter are required for IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity. IFN-γ treatment leads to the activation of NF-κB in a time-dependent manner, which is inhibited in the presence of anti-TNF-α-neutralizing antibody. These results indicate that IFN-γ-induced TNF-α production and subsequent NF-κB activation are integral parts of the mechanism of IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression.

CD40 is expressed by a wide variety of cells such as B-cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, keratinocytes, endothelial cells, thymic epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and tumor cells. The interaction between CD40 and its cognate ligand, CD40L (CD154), is critical for a productive immune response (for review see Ref. 1.Schönbeck U. Libby P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). X-linked hyper IgM syndrome individuals have defects in CD154-CD40 interactions between their T-cells and antigen-presenting B-cells, exhibit elevated levels of IgM with the virtual absence of other antibody isotypes, and are extremely susceptible to bacterial, viral, and opportunistic infections (for review see Ref. 2.Fuleihan R.L. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 321-331PubMed Google Scholar). CD154-CD40 interactions promote B-cell growth, differentiation, and immunoglobulin class switching. Also, up-regulation of various co-stimulatory molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, LFA-3, B7.1, B7.2, and CD40) occurs upon CD40-CD154 contact, as does production of numerous cytokines and chemokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-α, and MIP-1α) and cytotoxic radicals (for review see Ref. 1.Schönbeck U.

Because CD40 is functionally critical and nonredundant for the activation of immune responses, blocking the interaction between CD40-CD154 with anti-CD154 or CD40-Ig has been shown to be beneficial in animal models of autoimmune diseases (10.Becher B.

These findings illustrate the importance of CD40-CD154 interactions for homeostasis of immune responses. Despite the importance of CD40 in regulating the immune system, little is known about the regulation of CD40 expression. We have previously shown that microglia/macrophages constitutively express CD40 at a low level, which is enhanced by IFN-γ (15.Nguyen V. Walker W.S. Benveniste E.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16.Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 271: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In these cells, IFN-γ-activated STAT-1α cooperates with the constitutive transcription factors PU.1 and/or Spi-B that directly bind to the CD40 promoter to activate CD40 gene expression (16.Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 271: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition to the binding sites for STAT-1α, PU.1, and Spi-B, the CD40 promoter also contains four potential NF-κB-binding sites (16.Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 271: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that TNF-α alone is a very weak inducer of CD40 expression and modestly enhances IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression (15.Nguyen V. Walker W.S. Benveniste E.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we attempted to unravel the potential role of TNF-α in IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression. In this study, we demonstrate that production of TNF-α is critical for IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression, because blocking endogenous production of TNF-α significantly attenuates the ability of IFN-γ to induce CD40 expression. TNF-α-deficient microglia express low levels of CD40 in comparison with wild type cells upon treatment with IFN-γ, emphasizing the importance of endogenous TNF-α in this response. We further show that blocking NF-κB activation by the use of dominant-negative IκB kinase (IKK) constructs reduces IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity. IFN-γ-activated NF-κB, both the p65 and p50 members, binds to the distal NF-κB site (dNBS) at −530, the medial NF-κB site (mNBS) at −494, and another medial NF-κB site (m2NBS) at −442, in the human CD40 promoter. Inclusion of anti-TNF-α-neutralizing antibody prevents IFN-γ activation of NF-κB. Targeted disruption of these NF-κB elements significantly decreases IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity. These data indicate that IFN-γ-induced production of TNF-α and subsequent NF-κB activation are an integral part of CD40 gene expression in microglia/macrophages. Recombinant murine IFN-γ was purchased from Genzyme (Boston, MA), and murine TNF-α and neutralizing antibody was purchased from Endogen (Woburn, MA). Rat IgG2a-κ anti-mouse CD40 antibody (clone 3/23), biotinylated mouse anti-rat IgG2a, and phycoerythrine-conjugated strepavidin were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-human NF-κB p50, p65, p52, c-Rel, and RelB antisera were a generous gift from Dr. Nancy Rice (National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD). The expression vectors of wild type and dominant-negatives of IKK-α and -β (17.Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Rudolph Noelle (Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH). The microglial cell line EOC13 was derived from C3H/HeJ CH-2k mice using a nonviral immortalization procedure as described previously (15.Nguyen V. Walker W.S. Benveniste E.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These colony stimulating factor-1-dependent lines are B7.1+, Mac-1+, CD45+, and class I MHC+, as well as phagocytic. The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (16.Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 271: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Primary microglia from wild type B6129SF2 mice and TNF-α-deficient mice were prepared as described previously (16.Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 271: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). TNF-α-deficient mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The targeting vector was constructed by replacing with a MC1neopA cassette the 438-bpNarl-BglII fragment containing 40 bp of the 5′-untranslated region, all the coding region, including the ATG translation initiation codon of the first axon and part of the first intron of the murine TNF-α gene. The characterization of the human CD40 promoter construct (hCD40p0.7) was described previously (16.Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 271: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The NF-κB mutant constructs were generated on the hCD40p0.7 plasmid backbone using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions and were confirmed by sequencing. Total cellular RNA was isolated from confluent monolayers of EOC13 and RAW264.7 cells. The riboprobes for murine CD40, IRF-1, and GAPDH prepared from in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase are 576, 367, and 270 nucleotides, respectively. 20 μg of total RNA from RAW264.7 or EOC13 cells was hybridized with CD40, IRF-1, and GAPDH riboprobes (25 × 103 cpm) at 42 °C overnight in 20 μl of 40 mm PIPES (pH 6.4), 80% deionized formamide, 400 mm NaOAc, and 1 mmEDTA. The hybridized mixture was then treated with RNase A/T1 (1:200 dilution in 200 μl of the RNase digestion buffer) at room temperature for 1 h and analyzed by 5% denaturing (8 m urea) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gels were exposed to x-ray film for varying periods of time. The protected fragments of the CD40, IRF-1, and GAPDH riboprobes are 419, 314, and 212 nucleotides in length, respectively. Quantification of the protected RNA fragments was performed by scanning with the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The values for CD40 and IRF-1 mRNA expression were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels for each experimental condition. GAPDH mRNA was utilized as a “housekeeping gene,” because its levels are not affected by cytokine treatment. The cells were incubated with medium or IFN-γ (5 ng/ml) for various time periods (0–24 h), and nuclear extracts were prepared. EMSA was performed with 5–10 μg of nuclear extract in a total volume of 15 μl of binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 μg of polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycytidyl acid, and 20,000 cpm of32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Bound and free DNA were then resolved by electrophoresis through a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer at 250 V for 1 h. For supershift analysis, 1 μg of indicated antibody was added, or for competition analysis, a 100-fold molar excess of the indicated cold oligonucleotide was added to the nuclear extracts and incubated on ice for 30 min, followed by an additional incubation for 15 min with the labeled probe. 0.2 μg of the hCD40 promoter constructs were co-transfected with 0.02 μg of the pCMV-β-galactosidase construct into 2 × 105RAW264.7 cells in 12-well plates using the LipofectAMINE Plus method as described previously (16.Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 271: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). pGL3-Basic was used as a negative (background) control in all experiments. After 3 h of transfection, the cells were allowed to recover for 6 h prior to treatment with IFN-γ (5 ng/ml) for 12 h, which we have previously determined to be optimal for IFN-γ-induced activation of the hCD40p0.7 construct (16.Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 271: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 250 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm trisphosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm diaminocyclohexane tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). The extracts were assayed in triplicate for luciferase activity in a total volume of 130 μl (30 μl of cell extract, 20 mm Tricine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCO3, 2.67 mmMgSO4, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.27 mm coenzyme A, 0.47 mm luciferin, and 0.53 mm ATP), and light intensity was measured using a luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was integrated over a 10-s time period. The extracts were also assayed in triplicate for β-galactosidase enzyme activity as described previously (16.Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 271: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity of each sample was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to yield relative luciferase activity. Fold induction was calculated as the ratio of relative luciferase activity between IFN-γ and medium-treated samples that were transfected with the same construct. For comparison between different constructs, the percentage of wild type was calculated as the ratio of fold induction of mutated constructs to that of the full-length promoter, which was set at 100%. For transfections that include the IKK-α and IKK-β expression constructs, differences in the amount of DNA were adjusted with appropriate empty vector. TNF-α activity in culture supernatants was determined in a biologic assay by using the WEHI 164 clone 13 mouse fibrosarcoma cells as described previously (18.Chung I.Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2999-3007PubMed Google Scholar). TNF-α activity was expressed as TNF-α pg/μg protein of total cell lysate. The absolute amount of TNF-α was determined by extrapolation from the standard curve that was generated by using known amounts of mouse recombinant TNF-α. All samples were tested in triplicate. We have previously shown that IFN-γ is the most potent inducer of CD40 expression in microglia and macrophages (15.Nguyen V. Walker W.S. Benveniste E.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,16.Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 271: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Curiously, TNF-α stimulation had a minimal influence on CD40 expression (protein, mRNA, or promoter activity) and only modestly augmented IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression (15.Nguyen V. Walker W.S. Benveniste E.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The CD40 promoter contains four putative NF-κB sites, suggestive of an influence of TNF-α on this particular gene. Based on this, we sought to elucidate the potential involvement of TNF-α in CD40 gene expression. Because IFN-γ is known to induce TNF-α expression in a variety of cell types, including microglia and macrophages (19.Frei K. Siepl C. Groscurth P. Bodmer S. Schwerdel C. Fontana A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 20.Renno T. Krakowski M. Piccirillo C. Lin J.-Y. Owens T. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 944-953PubMed Google Scholar), we assessed whether the inclusion of neutralizing antibody against TNF-α would influence IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression. The murine microglial cell line EOC13 and the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 were incubated with medium or IFN-γ in the presence of 10 μg/ml of TNF-α-neutralizing antibody or isotype control antibody, and then total RNA was harvested and analyzed for CD40, IRF-1, and GAPDH mRNA expression using ribonuclease protection assay (Fig. 1A). Low levels of CD40 mRNA were expressed constitutively (lanes 1 and5), and IFN-γ enhanced CD40 mRNA expression by ∼22-fold in RAW264.7 cells and ∼37-fold in EOC13 cells (lanes 2 and 6). The inclusion of isotype antibody had no effect on IFN-γ-induced CD40 mRNA expression (lanes 3and 7), whereas incubation with anti-TNF-α-neutralizing antibody inhibited IFN-γ-induced CD40 mRNA expression by ∼73 and ∼85% in RAW264.7 and EOC13 cells, respectively (lanes 4 and 8). Anti-TNF-α antibody treatment had a minimal effect on the ability of IFN-γ to induce IRF-1 expression, suggesting specific suppression of IFN-γ-induced CD40 mRNA expression (Fig. 1A). Comparable results were obtained when examining the effect of anti-TNF-α-neutralizing antibody on IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity in RAW264.7 cells (∼66% inhibition) (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that endogenously produced TNF-α contributes to IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression and that the effect of TNF-α is on CD40 gene transcription. To formally demonstrate that IFN-γ stimulation led to the production of TNF-α, cells were incubated with medium or IFN-γ for 24 h, and then the supernatants were harvested and analyzed for biologically active TNF-α (Table I). RAW264.7 cells constitutively produced TNF-α protein, which was enhanced upon IFN-γ treatment. Also, EOC13 cells constitutively expressed low levels of TNF-α that were elevated with IFN-γ stimulation. IFN-γ enhancement of TNF-α production was observed as early as 4 h and persisted for 48 h (data not shown).Table IIFN-γ enhances TNF-α productionCell typeTNF-α production1-aTNF-α levels were detected by the WEHI assay and normalized to total protein levels.Medium-treated1-bCells were treated with medium for 24 h.IFN-γ-treated1-cCells were treated with IFN-γ (5 ng/ml) for 24 h.pg/μg proteinRAW264.719 ± 41-dMean ± S.E. of three experiments.244 ± 30EOC132 ± 0.264 ± 151-a TNF-α levels were detected by the WEHI assay and normalized to total protein levels.1-b Cells were treated with medium for 24 h.1-c Cells were treated with IFN-γ (5 ng/ml) for 24 h.1-d Mean ± S.E. of three experiments. Open table in a new tab To further confirm the importance of TNF-α in IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression, primary microglia from TNF-α-deficient mice were examined. Wild type or TNF-α-deficient primary microglia were incubated with medium or IFN-γ for 48 h, and then CD40 surface protein expression was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. IFN-γ induced expression of CD40 in wild type primary microglia, whereas only a modest induction of CD40 expression was seen in TNF-α-deficient cells (Fig. 2). The inclusion of exogenous TNF-α modestly augmented IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression in wild type microglia, whereas in TNF-α-deficient cells, the addition of TNF-α plus IFN-γ induced CD40 levels comparable with wild type microglia (Fig. 2). These results illustrate that optimal expression of CD40 in response to IFN-γ requires TNF-α. We have shown that an autocrine response to IFN-γ-induced TNF-α is important for IFN-γ-induced CD40 mRNA expression and CD40 promoter activity (Fig. 1). Because the activation of NF-κB is one of the major signaling pathways that TNF-α initiates (for review see Ref. 21.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar), we wished to determine the involvement of NF-κB in IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression. Dominant-negative (DN) expression constructs of IKK-α or -β (17.Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar) that contain substitutions of alanine for an essential lysine in the ATP-binding site, rendering the proteins catalytically inactive, were utilized. The DN constructs, as well as wild type IKK-α and IKK-β constructs, were co-transfected with hCD40p0.7 into RAW264.7 cells, treated with medium or IFN-γ, and then assayed for luciferase activity (Fig. 3). The IKK-α DN partially suppressed IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity (∼50% inhibition), whereas the IKK-β DN construct abolished IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity (Fig. 3A). Inclusion of both IKK-α and -β DN led to levels of inhibition comparable with that of IKK-β DN alone. Co-transfection with IKK-α or -β wild type constructs did not significantly affect IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity. IKK-α and -β DN inhibition of IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B), with the IKK-β DN having the more pronounced effect. These data indicate that activation of NF-κB is critical for IFN-γ induction of CD40 promoter activity. Within the human CD40 promoter, we identified at least four potential NBS. They are named according to their position with respect to the transcription initiation sites: dNBS, mNBS, m2NBS, and pNBS (Fig. 4A). To ascertain the functional roles of these NF-κB cis-regulatory elements, site-directed mutagenesis was performed either individually or in combination (see “Experimental Procedures”). Mutation of the dNBS led to a partial inhibitory effect on IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity (∼60%) compared with the full-length promoter construct (Fig. 4B). Also, mutation of the mNBS and m2NBS caused a 40% inhibition in IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activation. Curiously, mutation of the pNBS led to a reproducible increase in IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity. Combining mutations of the dNBS with the mNBS, m2NBS, or both did not significantly affect CD40 promoter activity relative to that of the dNBS mutation alone (Fig. 4B), whereas the combination mutation of mNBS and m2NBS led to a ∼50% inhibition of IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity. These results suggest that the dNBS, mNBS, and m2NBS elements are involved in IFN-γ induction of CD40 promoter activity. To confirm that NF-κB actually binds to the NBS identified functionally as important for CD40 promoter activity, EOC13 cells were treated with IFN-γ for 30 min to 24 h, nuclear extracts were prepared, and EMSA were performed using dNBS oligonucleotides as probes and/or competitors. Fig. 5Ademonstrates a low basal binding activity using nuclear extracts from untreated cells (lane 1), which increases in intensity upon IFN-γ stimulation (lanes 2–8). Optimal complex formation over the dNBS probe was detected after 6–12 h of IFN-γ stimulation (lanes 6 and 7). The complexes were competed by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled dNBS oligonucleotide (data not shown). The identity of the IFN-γ-induced complex was confirmed by supershifting with antibodies to NF-κB family members. Anti-p50 antibody partially supershifted the upper complex (Fig. 5B,lane 2), whereas anti-p65 antibody supershifted both the upper and lower complexes (lane 3). Incubation of nuclear extracts with antibodies against p50 and p65 led to a complete supershift of both complexes (lane 4). Normal rabbit serum (lane 1) and antibodies against p52, c-Rel, or RelB (lanes 5–7) did not affect complex formation. These data suggest that the IFN-γ-induced protein complexes bound to the dNBS of the CD40 promoter are composed of p65 homodimers and p65/p50 heterodimers. Similar binding patterns and composition of the complexes were observed using mNBS and m2NBS oligonucleotides as probes (data not shown). Similar results were obtained using nuclear extracts from RAW264.7 cells (data not shown). To demonstrate the involvement of IFN-γ-induced TNF-α production in NF-κB activation, nuclear extracts were prepared from cells treated with IFN-γ alone, IFN-γ plus isotype control antibody, or IFN-γ plus neutralizing TNF-α antibody for 6 h. As shown in Fig. 5C, the inclusion of anti-TNF-α antibody prevents IFN-γ induction of NF-κB (lane 4), whereas the isotype-matched control has no effect (lane 3). These findings indicate that IFN-γ treatment leads to TNF-α production, which is subsequently responsible for activation of NF-κB. As another measure of the involvement of NF-κB in this response, we utilized broad spectrum pharmacological inhibitors of NF-κB such as TPCK and PDTC. RAW264.7 cells were incubated with medium or IFN-γ in the absence or presence of TPCK (30 μm) or PDTC (30 μm) for 8 h, and then CD40 mRNA expression was examined. As shown in Fig. 5D, low levels of CD40 mRNA were expressed constitutively (lane 1) and were not influenced by the inclusion of TPCK or PDTC (lanes 2 and 3). Stimulation with IFN-γ enhanced CD40 mRNA levels (lane 4), and addition of TPCK and PDTC strongly inhibited expression by ∼74 and ∼63%, respectively (lanes 5 and 6). These findings confirm the importance of NF-κB in IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression. CD40 has been implicated as a proinflammatory molecule that is involved in a variety of critical immunologic functions, yet its regulation remains an enigma. This study is a extension of our previous report describing the involvement of IFN-γ-activated STAT-1α and constitutively expressed PU.1/Spi-B transcription factors in IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression in macrophages and microglia (16.Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 271: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this study, we present data that IFN-γ induction of CD40 gene expression is critically dependent on the endogenous production of TNF-α, which then leads to NF-κB activation and binding to NF-κB regulatory elements within the CD40 promoter. Our results indicate that co-treatment of macrophages and microglia with IFN-γ and neutralizing antibodies to TNF-α attenuates the induction of IFN-γ-induced CD40 mRNA expression and CD40 promoter activity (Fig. 1). To substantiate the importance of endogenous TNF-α production in this response, microglia from TNF-α-deficient mice were examined for IFN-γ induction of CD40 protein expression. Such cells were refractive to IFN-γ stimulation; however, the inclusion of exogenous TNF-α plus IFN-γ induced CD40 protein levels comparable with wild type primary microglia (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the autocrine response to IFN-γ-induced TNF-α production in macrophages and microglia is critical for optimal CD40 expression. Indeed, we demonstrated that IFN-γ treatment of RAW264.7 and EOC13 cell lines induced the production of TNF-α (Table I). The levels of TNF-α produced are clearly sufficient for subsequent CD40 expression, because the addition of exogenous TNF-α (50 ng/ml) only modestly enhanced IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression (15.Nguyen V. Walker W.S. Benveniste E.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Synergistic interactions between IFN-γ and TNF-α are known for many genes such as class I MHC, IP-10, IRF-1 and ICAM-1 (22.Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1322-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23.Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D.

However, these synergistic responses are achieved upon inclusion of exogenous sources of both TNF-α and IFN-γ. In contrast, for IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression in macrophages and microglia, the autocrine response to IFN-γ-induced endogenous TNF-α production is sufficient for optimal CD40 expression. Signaling through TNF receptors leads to the activation of the NF-κB pathway and subsequent expression of a wide array of genes (for review see Refs. 27.Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar and 28.Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar). NF-κB is sequestered in an inactive form in the cytoplasm through interaction with inhibitory proteins, the IκBs. Exposure to TNF-α leads to the rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteolytic degradation of IκB, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription. The multi-subunit IKK, which is responsible for inducible IκB phosphorylation, contains several catalytic subunits; among them are IKK-α and IKK-β (27.Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). We employed a variety of strategies to assess the importance of NF-κB in IFN-γ induction of CD40 gene expression. First, blocking the activation of NF-κB by transfection of DN constructs of IKK-α and IKK-β inhibited IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity (Fig. 3). Differences were observed using the two constructs; the IKK-α DN partially inhibited CD40 promoter activity, whereas the IKK-β DN construct abolished IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activation. DN versions of IKK have been shown to inhibit TNF-α activation of VCAM-1 promoter activity (29.Tu Z. Kelley V.R. Collins T. Lee F.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6839-6846Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this system, similar to ours, DN IKK-β was a more potent inhibitor than IKK-α. These findings may reflect the fact that IKK-β may be the IKK isoform critical for inflammatory responses. Broad spectrum pharmacological inhibitors of NF-κB such as TPCK and PDTC also suppressed IFN-γ-induced CD40 mRNA expression (Fig. 5D). Collectively, these results suggest that the pathways leading to NF-κB activation are important for subsequent IFN-γ-induced CD40 gene expression. Within the human CD40 promoter, there are four potential NBS. Mutation of each NBS individually or in combination suggested that the dNBS, mNBS, and m2NBS are involved in IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity, with the dNBS being most important for IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity (Fig. 4). Nuclear extracts from IFN-γ-stimulated cells formed a complex over the dNBS probe (Fig. 5). This complex contains both p50 and p65 NF-κB family members as determined by gel shift analysis. The importance of TNF-α in this response was demonstrated by the inclusion of anti-TNF-α neutralizing antibody, which inhibited IFN-γ induction of NF-κB activation (Fig. 5C). The kinetics of IFN-γ-induced NF-κB activation are delayed (optimal response after 6–12 h of IFN-γ stimulation); this reflects the need for TNF-α synthesis in response to IFN-γ treatment. We have previously observed that inclusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin partially inhibits (∼50%) IFN-γ induction of CD40 mRNA expression in EOC13 cells (15.Nguyen V. Walker W.S. Benveniste E.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This effect may be due in part to inhibition of TNF-α production. Interestingly, we consistently observed an enhancement of IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity when the pNBS was mutated, suggesting that negative regulatory element(s) may reside in this region. Curiously, IFN-γ induced NF-κB binding to the pNBS (data not shown) similar to what was observed with the dNBS, mNBS, and m2NBS. The importance of this region in regulating CD40 expression is currently under investigation. The results from this study suggest the importance of autocrine responsiveness to IFN-γ-induced TNF-α and the subsequent activation of NF-κB in IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression. The combination of the data from this study and our previous reports promoted us to provide a revised model of IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression (Fig. 6). In this model, sevencis-regulatory elements are involved in IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activation; two Ets elements, two γ activated sequence elements, and three NF-κB elements. Constitutively expressed PU.1/Spi-B binds to EtsA and EtsB sites, IFN-γ-activated STAT-1α binds to the medial and distal γ activated sequence elements, and IFN-γ-induced TNF-α-activated NF-κB binds to the dNBS, mNBS, and m2NBS. Together, these transcription factors recruit and coordinate a complex that we tentatively call “integrator,” which mediates CD40 gene transcription. The cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein is a likely candidate given its ability to interact with PU.1, STAT-1α, and NF-κB (for review see Ref. 30.Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, we have preliminary data that inclusion of a cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein expression construct enhances IFN-γ-induced CD40 promoter activity (data not shown). The involvement and components of this integrator are currently being investigated in our laboratory. The model proposed above has only been tested thus far in macrophages and microglial cells. CD40 gene expression occurs in a cell type-specific manner, depending on the stimulus utilized. For example, in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells, IFN-γ and TNF-α alone induce only a modest increase in CD40 expression, whereas combined stimulation leads to a significant increase in CD40 (31.Krzesz R. Wagner A.H. Cattaruzza M. Hecker M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IL-1β alone induced significant levels of CD40 in these cells (31.Krzesz R. Wagner A.H. Cattaruzza M. Hecker M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In human endothelial cells and thymic epithelial cells, IFN-γ, IL-1β, and TNF-α individually enhance CD40 expression (32.Karmann K. Hughes C.C.W. Schechner J. Fanslow W.C. Pober J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4342-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 33.Galy A.H.M. Spits H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 775-782PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts do not express CD40 in response to IFN-γ alone and are weakly inducible by TNF-α, and IFN-γ plus TNF-α synergistically induce CD40 mRNA expression (34.Ouaaz F. Li M. Beg A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 999-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the induction by IFN-γ plus TNF-α was abrogated in fibroblasts from p65-deficient mice, demonstrating a role for NF-κB in this response (34.Ouaaz F. Li M. Beg A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 999-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The inability of IFN-γ alone to induce CD40 in fibroblasts may reflect the fact that IFN-γ alone has no influence on NF-κB binding activity, likely because of the inability to induce TNF-α production (24.Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5235-5244PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Suk K. Chang I. Kim Y.H. Kim S. Kim J.Y. Kim H. Lee M.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13153-13159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Macrophages/microglia are one of the few cell types that can produce TNF-α in response to IFN-γ alone; most cell types need a combination of stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide plus IFN-γ or IL-1β plus IFN-γ (for review see Ref. 36.McDermott M.F. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 619-635PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular mechanisms underlying CD40 gene expression are complex and will reflect the availability of transcription factors such as PU.1/Spi-B, NF-κB, and STAT-1α and possibly others. CD40 expression by resident cells of the central nervous system, most likely microglia, is critical for the infiltration/retention of inflammatory cells in the central nervous system, leading to the disease of experimental allergic encephalomyclitis (10.Becher B. Durell B.G. Miga A.V. Hickey W.F. Noelle R.J. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Given the important role of CD40 in inflammatory events in the central nervous system as well as other organ systems (for review see Refs. 6.Grewal I.S. Flavell R.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholarand 37.Vogel L.A. Noelle R.J. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it is imperative to understand the molecular mechanisms contributing to both CD40 induction and repression in various cell types. We have previously shown that IL-4 inhibits IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression in microglia in a STAT-6-dependent manner (38.Nguyen V. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6235-6243Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have shown that IL-4 inhibits E-selectin gene transcription and osteoclastogenesis through STAT-6-dependent inhibition of NF-κB (39.Bennett B.L. Cruz R. Lacson R.G. Manning A.M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 272: 10212-10219Google Scholar, 40.Au-Amer Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1375-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Given our findings of the importance of NF-κB in IFN-γ-induced CD40 expression, future studies will assess whether IL-4/STAT-6 inhibition is operative by antagonism of NF-κB binding. Other inhibitors of CD40 expression on microglia include neurotrophins, IL-10, and IL-11 (41.Wei R. Jonakait G.M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 95: 8-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to elucidate the molecular basis of their inhibitory actions."

Although circulating bacterial toxins trigger inflammation in sepsis, little is known about the composition of bacterial products released into the blood during sepsis or the contribution of various bacterial components to the pathogenesis of sepsis. We have shown that diverse Gram-negative bacteria release bacterial peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) into serum. The present studies explored release of PAL into the blood during sepsis and tested the hypothesis that PAL contributes to bacterial virulence and inflammation in Gram-negative sepsis. Released PAL was detected in the blood of 94% of mice following cecal ligation and puncture. Picomolar to nanomolar levels of PAL stimulated macrophages and splenocytes from lipopolysaccharide-hyporesponsive (C3H/HeJ) mice. Injection of PAL into C3H/HeJ mice stimulated production of serum cytokines and increased pulmonary and myocardial expression of inflammatory markers. PAL caused death in sensitized C3H/HeJ mice. Mutant Escherichia coli bacteria with reduced levels of PAL or truncated PAL were less virulent than wild-type bacteria, as indicated by higher survival rates and lower circulating levels of interleukin 6 and bacteria in a model of peritonitis in lipopolysaccharide-responsive mice. The studies suggest that PAL may be an important bacterial mediator of Gram-negative sepsis. Gram-negative bacterial sepsis commonly causes organ dysfunction and death in humans.

The present studies were performed to explore the release of PAL into the blood in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of polymicrobial sepsis in mice and to test the hypotheses that PAL has inflammatory effects and may contribute to bacterial virulence during GNS. Released PAL was present in the blood of 94% of mice following CLP. Low concentrations of PAL stimulated splenocytes and macrophages in vitro and stimulated multiple responses in vivo, including induction of cytokines in the blood, transcription of proinflammatory pulmonary and myocardial genes, and death in sensitized mice. Survival was higher, and circulating levels of IL-6 and bacteria were lower in mice infected with PAL mutant versus wild-type bacteria in a peritonitis model of GNS. These data indicate that PAL is released by Gram-negative bacteria into the bloodstream during polymicrobial sepsis, that PAL induces inflammation, and that PAL may be an important factor in the development and severity of GNS induced by Gram-negative bacterial peritonitis.

Release of PAL was studied in 20–25-g C3H/HeOuJ mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) and C3H/HeN mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). Inflammatory and lethal effects of purified PAL were studied in 20–25-g C3H/HeJ mice (Jackson Laboratories), which have a point mutation in the TLR4 gene that renders them hyporesponsive to the effects of LPS (23.Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6451) Google Scholar). Inflammatory and lethal effects of wild-type and PAL mutant bacteria were studied in LPS-responsive C3H/HeN mice. Rabbit IgGs were prepared using female 2–3-kg New Zealand White rabbits (ARI Breeding Laboratories, East Bridgewater, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-PAL IgG (mouse anti-PAL IgG) was produced as described previously (37.Hellman J. Loiselle P.M. Tehan M.M. Allaire J.E. Boyle L.A. Kurnick J.T. Andrews D.M. Kim K.S. Warren H.S. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2566-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38.Hellman J. Loiselle P.M. Zanzot E.M. Tehan M.M. Boyle L.A. Kurnick J.T. Warren H.S. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 1034-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-PAL IgG (rabbit anti-PAL IgG) was prepared by immunizing rabbits with purified PAL in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Immunoblot analysis revealed that anti-PAL-specific IgGs do not react with components of mouse serum. PAL release was studied in a CLP model of sepsis as described by Wichterman and others (52.Wichtermann K. Baus A. Chaudry I. J. Surg. Res. 1980; 28: 189-201Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 53.Ebong S. Call D. Nemzek J. Bolgos G. Newcomb D. Remick D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6603-6610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized and given a 1-ml subcutaneous normal saline bolus, and a laparotomy was performed. The cecum was ligated, and both walls were punctured with a 19-gauge needle distal to the ligature. A small amount of fecal material was expressed through each puncture site, the bowel was returned to the abdomen, and the wound was closed. Bupivacaine was placed between the fascia and skin during closure, and buprenorphine was administered subcutaneously for analgesia. Control (sham) mice underwent an identical operation, but without ligation or puncture of the cecum. At 20 h, blood was drawn via the tail artery, and the concentration of Gram-negative bacteria was determined by culturing serial dilutions of the blood on MacConkey agar plates. Mice were then given an intramuscular injection of ceftazidime (80 mg/kg), and blood was collected by cardiac puncture 2 h later. PAL release was assessed using previously described methods (36.Hellman J. Zanzot E.M. Loiselle P.M. Amato S.F. Black K.M. Ge Y. Kurnick J.T. Warren H.S. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 176: 1260-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 38.Hellman J. Loiselle P.M. Zanzot E.M. Tehan M.M. Boyle L.A. Kurnick J.T. Warren H.S. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 1034-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmas were prepared and filter-sterilized to remove intact bacteria. Filtered plasmas (250 μl) were diluted 4-fold and incubated overnight with mouse anti-PAL IgG that was covalently conjugated to magnetic beads (200 μg IgG/ml). The beads were then washed, and PAL was eluted from the beads by heating in SDS (36.Hellman J. Zanzot E.M. Loiselle P.M. Amato S.F. Black K.M. Ge Y. Kurnick J.T. Warren H.S. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 176: 1260-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PAL was detected by immunoblotting half of the eluted material using rabbit anti-PAL IgG as the primary antibody. Immunoblots were developed using biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Vectastain; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Total bacterial membranes were prepared from 20-liter overnight cultures of E. coli K12 CH202(pRC2) as described by Nikaido (54.Nikaido H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and processed using differential extraction with SDS essentially as described by Mizuno (48.Mizuno T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). LPS and non-PAL proteins were then removed by size separation using continuous gel electrophoresis on a 14% SDS-PAGE tube gel, (Prep Cell model 491; Bio-Rad) and 1% SDS in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, and 192 mm glycine as the elution buffer. This procedure was repeated twice to maximize removal of LPS and protein impurities. Trace amounts of a contaminating protein were then removed by anion-exchange chromatography using DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences). PAL was eluted from the DEAE column with 80 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 2% Triton X-100, and 6 m urea and precipitated with 75% chilled acetone and 10 mm MgCl2. PAL was then resuspended in and dialyzed extensively against 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4 (carrier). A single protein band was present on gold stains of the final product and identified as PAL by immunoblotting. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). LPS levels were quantitated using the Limulus-ameobocyte lysate assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Falmouth, MA) (55.Novitsky T.J. Roslansky P.F. Siber G.R. Warren H.S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1985; 20: 211-216Crossref Google Scholar). All PAL preparations contained < 400 pg LPS/μg protein. Splenocytes were prepared from C3H/HeJ mice and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech Cellgro) supplemented with l-glutamine, 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and gentamicin (50 μg/ml) as described previously (56.Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2001Crossref Google Scholar). Cells were placed in wells of 96-well microtiter plates (4 × 105cells/well), treated with PAL and controls in replicates of 6 wells/condition for 48 h, and then pulsed for 18 h with [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 1 μCi/well). The cells were harvested (PHD Cell Harvester; Cambridge Technology, Inc.), and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was assessed by liquid scintillation counting. In some experiments, cells were treated with PAL plus polymyxin B or with LPS alone to test the potential effects of the low levels of LPS that co-purified with PAL. Thioglycollate-elicited C3H/HeJ peritoneal macrophages were prepared as described previously (56.Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2001Crossref Google Scholar). Four days after intraperitoneal injection of 3% thioglycollate, macrophages were obtained by peritoneal lavage with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech Cellgro) supplemented with glucose, l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were added to wells of 96-well plates at a concentration of 106 cells/ml and incubated for 2 h to allow macrophage adherence. Adherent cells were incubated with PAL in replicates of 6 wells/concentration of PAL. Levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were quantitated in the supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after 18 h (Quantikine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Nitrite levels were measured in supernatants of macrophages treated with mouse IFN-γ (10 units/ml; R&D Systems) and PAL or media using the Greiss reagent reaction and nitrite standards (56.Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2001Crossref Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were treated with PAL plus polymyxin B or with LPS alone to test the potential stimulatory effects of the low levels of LPS that co-purified with PAL. C3H/HeJ mice received an intravenous injection of PAL (10 μg) or an equivalent volume of carrier (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). At specified time points, mice were euthanized, and blood and organs were collected. Blood was obtained by cardiac puncture up to 16 h after injection, and serum was prepared and analyzed for TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (n = 5–6 mice/group). Lungs and hearts (myocardia) were collected up to 4 h after injection and blotted free of blood. Pulmonary and myocardial cytokine expression and adhesion molecule expression were assessed using RNA blot hybridization and random primed cDNA templates (n ≥ 4/group). RNA was isolated using homogenization in guanidine isothiocyanate and centrifugation on a CsCl cushion (57.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). The murine TNF-α probe was generated by Bruce Beutler (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The IL-1β probe was made using polymerase chain reaction, sense (5′-atgaaagacggcacacccac-3′) and antisense primers (5′-cccacacgttgacagct-3′), and cDNA generated from reverse transcription using 2 μg of RNA isolated from LPS-treated mouse lungs, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, RNasin, and the antisense primer, as described previously (58.Roberts Jr., J.D. Chiche J.-D. Weimann J. Steudel W. Zapol W.M. Bloch K.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The ICAM probe was made using HinDIII and a murine expressed sequence tag fragment cloned into pBluescript SK (American Type Culture Collection). To confirm that equal quantities of RNA were analyzed, the blots were stripped of the labeled cDNA probes and then hybridized with a 15m excess of an oligonucleotide corresponding to rat 18 S ribosomal RNA (5′-acggtatctgatcgtcttcgaacc-3′) that had been end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (59.Chan Y.L. Gutell R. Noller H.F. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 224-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lung MPO levels were measured 4 h after injection of PAL (n = 7/group), essentially as described previously (60.Takano T. Fiore S. Maddox J.F. Brady H.R. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1693-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar,61.Salkowski C.A. Detore G. Franks A. Falk M.C. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3569-3578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The right lung was weighed, homogenized in 50 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.4), and centrifuged (12,000 ×g). Lung homogenates were resuspended in 0.5 ml of hexadecyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide (Sigma) in 50 mmsodium phosphate (pH 6.2), homogenized, sonicated, freeze-thawed three times, and sonicated again. The solution was centrifuged, and MPO levels were measured in the supernatants (62.Renkema T.J.E. Postma D.S. Noorhoek J.A. Sluiter H.J. Kaufmann H.F. Eur. Respir. J. 1991; 4: 1237-1244PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty μl of the supernatants were mixed with 70 μl of o-dianisidine dihydrochloride (0.357 mg/ml; Sigma) in Hanks' balanced salt solution and 60 μl of 0.1% hydrogen peroxide in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.2), and absorption was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm (reference, 620 nm) after 15 min. MPO concentrations (units/g lung) were determined using human MPO standards (Sigma). Lethal effects of PAL were studied ind-galactosamine-sensitized mice (n = 7–8 mice/group) (63.Galanos C. Freudenberg M.A. Reutter W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5939-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). d-Galactosamine (800 mg/kg) was administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection 5 min before intravenous injection of 1, 10, and 100 μg of PAL or an equivalent volume of carrier. Survival was assessed up to 96 h after treatment. E. coli K12 wild-type (p400 and JC1129) and PAL mutant (CH202 and JC2721) strains were grown to mid-log phase and washed in sterile normal saline, and the optical density at 550 nm was adjusted to ∼0.8 using normal saline. Bacteria were then pelleted and resuspended in normal saline at one-twentieth the original volume, and quantitative cultures were performed to ensure that mice received comparable amounts of wild-type and PAL mutant bacteria. Live bacteria were administered to C3H/HeN mice by intraperitoneal injection. Bacterial doses were 3.7 × 108 (± 1.9 × 107) and 3.4 × 108 (± 7.3 × 107) CFU for the PAL-deficient strain and its progenitor wild-type strain, respectively, and 1.7 × 108 (± 5.9 × 106) and 1.7 × 108 (± 7.4 × 106) CFU for the PAL nonsense strain and its progenitor wild-type strain, respectively. Blood was collected via the tail artery at 20 h, and IL-6 levels were measured, and quantitative blood cultures were performed. Survival was followed for 72 h. Data were compiled from three separate experiments for each PAL mutant strain (n = 18/group) and paired wild-type control (n = 12–18/group). The data from the two wild-type E. coli K12 strains were combined into one group for the figures and for statistical analysis because mortality, IL-6 levels, and degree of bacteremia were not statistically different between these groups (final wild-type n = 30). Representative data from at least three experiments are presented in the figures. Error barsin the figures represent S.D. A two-way Fisher's exact test was used to analyze PAL release in the CLP model. One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post hoc test was used to assess macrophage and splenocyte responses to purified PAL and plasma IL-6 levels in mice infected with PAL mutant and wild-type E. coli K1"
https://openalex.org/W1967936579,"We utilized 2-aminoethyoxydiphenyl borane, an agent that blocks store-operated Ca2+ entry, as well as an antisense approach to characterize endogenous Ca2+ entry pathways in HEK-293 cells. The thapsigargin- and carbachol-induced, but not the 1-oleolyl-2-acytyl-sn-glycerol (OAG)-induced, entry was blocked by 2-aminoethyoxydiphenyl borane. Both reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western blot analyses demonstrated endogenous expression for HTRP1, HTRP3, and HTRP4 and specific suppression of mRNA levels and Trp protein levels in cells stably expressing antisense constructs. Expression of HTRP4 antisense inhibited 35% of the carbachol (CCh)-stimulated Ba2+ entry and 46% of the OAG-stimulated Sr2+ entry but in contrast had no effect on the thapsigargin-stimulated Ba2+ or Sr2+ entry. HTRP3 antisense reduced, while HTRP1 antisense had no effect on, OAG-induced Sr2+ entry. Of greater importance, HTRP4 antisense expression, but not HTRP3 antisense expression, blocked the sustained Ca2+ oscillations produced by low doses of CCh (15 μm), arguing that receptor-stimulated rather than store-operated channels are involved in these sustained oscillations. HTRP4 antisense also inhibited 75% of the arachidonic acid-induced Ca2+ entry. In summary, these data suggest that HTRP4 proteins in HEK-293 cells, differing from HTRP3 and HTRP1 proteins, do not serve as functional subunits of store-operated channels but do function as subunits for CCh- and OAG-stimulated channels. Furthermore, evidence is provided for the first time for the involvement of a Trp isoform (HTRP4) in the formation of the channel responsible for both arachidonic acid-induced Ca2+ entry and the Ca2+ entry needed to sustain long term Ca2+ oscillations induced by low doses of carbachol.

It is widely accepted that Ca2+ serves as an essential signaling molecule, and for that reason, the level of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) is strictly controlled. This control extends beyond regulating static levels of Ca2+ to include regulation of Ca2+ levels in subregions of the cell and regulation of the frequency and amplitude of Ca2+oscillations within the cell. This multifaceted regulation is required for countless cellular functions including muscle contraction, protein secretion, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (1.Berridge M. Lipp P. Bootman M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4451) Google Scholar). Mutations inducing drastic alterations in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis are most likely not compatible with life (2.Missiaen L. Robberecht W. van den Bosch L. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. Wuytack F. Raeymaekers L. Nilius B. Eggermont J. De Smedt H. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In most cells, there are two sources of Ca2+ that can be tapped in order to modify resting Ca2+ levels, the intracellular Ca2+ stores and the extracellular space. Intracellularly, Ca2+ is released from the sarco- and endoplasmic reticulum stores via two types of Ca2+channels: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors and ryanodine receptors. Cytosolic Ca2+ is taken up into the sarco- and endoplasmic reticulum by one of the three sarco- or endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase Ca2+-pumps. Extracellular Ca2+ can enter the cell via cation channels in the plasma membrane (1.Berridge M. Lipp P. Bootman M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4451) Google Scholar), and in nonexcitable cells it is well documented that depletion of internal Ca2+ stores leads to the activation of store-operated channels (SOCs) 1The abbreviations used are: SOCstore-operated channelSOCEstore-operated calcium entryInsP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateOAG1-oleolyl-2-acytyl-sn-glycerol2-APB2-aminoethyoxydiphenyl boraneRTreverse transcriptaseHBSSHanks' balanced salt solutionCChcarbacholin the plasma membrane. This allows Ca2+ to enter the cell on a continual basis during times of elevated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels, resulting in sustained elevations of cytosolic Ca2+ levels. When inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels decline, the Ca2+entry persists only until the internal Ca2+ stores are refilled, at which time the SOCs turn off (3.Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar). The net result is that, at high doses of agonist, one normally sees a biphasic Ca2+response made up of a high transient peak representing release of internal Ca2+ stores followed by a long sustained plateau phase that results from Ca2+ entry. store-operated channel store-operated calcium entry inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 1-oleolyl-2-acytyl-sn-glycerol 2-aminoethyoxydiphenyl borane reverse transcriptase Hanks' balanced salt solution carbachol Sometimes changes in [Ca2+]i in response to receptor agonists can be far more complex. The signal patterns can include repetitive oscillations or waves of elevated [Ca2+]i. The functional importance of Ca2+ oscillations may relate to regulation of kinases and phosphatases, energy metabolism, secretion, and certain transcriptional events (1.Berridge M. Lipp P. Bootman M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4451) Google Scholar, 4.Thomas A.P. Bird G.S. Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney Jr., J.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Oscillation of Ca2+ often occurs at low concentrations of agonist that generates levels of InsP3, which release submaximal amounts of Ca2+ but sufficient amounts to trigger the positive feedback effect of Ca2+ on the release of store Ca2+ via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. In many instances Ca2+ influx is required in order to sustain [Ca2+]i oscillations (4.Thomas A.P. Bird G.S. Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney Jr., J.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 5.Yule D.I. Gallacher D.V. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6.Sage S.O.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the Drosophila eye, photoactivation of rhodopsin leads to the opening of the light-sensitive cation influx channels Trp (transient receptor potential) and Trpl (Trp-like) (8.Ranganathan R. Harris G.L. Stevens C.F. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1991; 354: 230-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). When expressed in a heterologous cell system, Trp channels can be activated by depletion of Ca2+ from the internal stores (9.Vaca L. Sinkins W.G. Hu Y. Kunze D.L. Schilling W.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1501-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, SOCs may be functionally related to Trp proteins. To date, seven mammalian Trp homologs (short isoforms) have been cloned, and they vary significantly in their channel behavior and mode of activation (10.Harteneck C. Plant T.D. Schultz G. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Human Trps are found at highest levels in brain, heart, testis, and ovary; they are ∼450 amino acids shorter than Drosophila Trp; they have six-transmembrane domain regions; and regions in the N-terminal domain have similarity to domains found in ankyrin and in the C terminus similar to dystrophin (11.Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 634-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12.Montell C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although, when expressed in a heterologous cell system, the Drosophila Trp channel appears to be store-operated, there is considerable evidence to suggest that Trp is regulated by a different mechanism during the phototransduction process (13.Scott K. Zuker C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A similar controversy has arisen from numerous studies where various mammalian Trp homologs have been overexpressed in various cell systems; results suggest that mammalian Trps either may (14.Zhu X.

For example, if we focus on the overexpression studies for the Trp4 isoform, there are significant disagreements concerning whether the channel is regulated by store depletion. The initial reports on bovine Trp4 described it as a capacitative calcium channel, since its overexpression in HEK-293 cells (16.Philipp S. Cavalie A. Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Zimmer S. Trost C. Marquart A. Murakami M. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6166-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) or Chinese hamster ovary cells (22.Warnat J. Philipp S. Zimmer S. Flockerzi V. Cavalie A. J. Physiol. 1999; 518: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) led to channel activity that could be stimulated by depletion of Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin. A role for rat Trp4 in capacitative calcium entry was suggested by the demonstration of a potentiated capacitative calcium entry-mediated chloride current in oocytes expressing rat Trp4 (23.Kinoshita M. Akaike A. Satoh M. Kaneko S. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and was further supported by the observation that expression of a Trp4 antisense significantly reduced calcium release activated channel-like currents in adrenal cells (24.Philipp S. Trost C. Warnat J. Rautmann J. Himmerkus N. Schroth G. Kretz O. Nastainczyk W. Cavalie A. Hoth M. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23965-23972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, two recent studies argue that Trp4 does not participate in forming store-operated calcium channels. The expression of murine Trp4 in HEK-293 cells was reported to have no effect on channel activity following depletion of intracellular calcium stores but was reported to enhance the channel activity in response to activation of Gq-coupled receptors or receptor tyrosine kinases (25.Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17517-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The expression of HTRP4 in HEK-293 cells was reported to have no effect on barium entry stimulated by calcium store depletion, supporting the findings for murine Trp4. However, in contrast to results for murine Trp4, the HTRP4 produced a constitutively active channel which was not stimulated by either phospholipase C-linked receptor activation or by OAG (26.McKay R.R. Szymeczek-Seay C.L. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Zitt C. Jungling E. Luckhoff A. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Given these dramatically different results from previous Trp4 overexpression studies, there is a compelling need to utilize alternative approaches to help resolve the role of Trp4 in the regulation of capacitative calcium entry. Similar discrepancies in findings between laboratories exist for Trp1 (14.Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L.

One can think of a number of theoretical reasons for overexpression studies to produce results that may not reflect the role of endogenous Trps in native Ca2+ channel activity. The endogenous channels may be heterotetramers, and the channels formed in the overexpression studies may be homotetramers due to their high expression level, or the expressed Trp may be unable to form the appropriate heterotetramer channels due to the lack of the appropriate Trp isoforms in the cell being tested. We have also published data on clone-to-clone variation within the HEK-293 cell population that points out the potential pitfalls of interpreting data based on studies with a small number of stable clones expressing Trps (36.Babnigg G. Heller B. Villereal M.L. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To circumvent many of the problems of overexpression studies, we have used an antisense approach to investigate these questions. In a previous study, we reported that HEK-293 cells express mRNA for HTRP1, HTRP3, HTRP4, and HTRP6, and evidence was presented that HTRP1 and HTRP3 are involved in mediating store-operated Ca2+ entry (32.Wu X. Babnigg G. Villereal M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C526-C536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we attempt to determine whether multiple Ca2+ entry pathways are mediated by endogenous HTRPs in HEK-293 cells. We have used the inhibitor, 2-aminoethyoxydiphenyl borane (2-APB), to analyze and compare Ca2+ entry induced by thapsigargin, carbachol, and OAG in HEK-293 cells. We also have generated antisense constructs for HTRP1, HTRP3, and HTRP4 and stably expressed them in HEK-293 cells. We provide evidence that in HEK-293 cells endogenous HTRP4 proteins do not participate in the formation of cation channels regulated by store depletion with thapsigargin but do participate in channel activity activated by CCh or OAG. More importantly, we provide evidence that HTRP4 proteins are involved in the formation of channels responsible for both the arachidonic acid-induced Ca2+ entry and the Ca2+ entry needed to sustain long term Ca2+oscillations in HEK-293 cells in response to low doses of CCh. Fura-2-free acid, fura-2/AM, and pluronic F-127 were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR); thapsigargin was from LC Laboratory; G418 was from Mediatech; Nusieve GTG-agarose was from FMC BioProducts; Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), Ca2+-free, Mg2+-free, HCO3−-free HBSS and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin/streptomycin,l-glutamine, and trypsin-EDTA were from Invitrogen; Chelex-100 was from Bio-Rad; arachidonic acid was from Biomol; and carbachol, OAG, and 2-APB, along with other chemicals, were purchased from Sigma. The poly(A)-RNA was isolated from HEK-293 cells using guanidinium thiocyanate extraction followed by an oligo(dT) binding method (QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit; Amersham Biosciences). The extracted mRNA was then treated with DNase (Invitrogen). The first strand cDNA was reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer, and it was then amplified directly using PCR (SuperScript Preamplification System; Invitrogen). Sequences of primers to amplify specific regions of HTRP1, HTRP3, and HTRP4 as well as human β actin are described in Table I. Sequence similarity analysis was performed using Seglab software by Genetics Computer Group. We used the inner primers to amplify fragments of endogenous HTRP cDNA in normal HEK-293 cells for the productions of the sense and antisense constructs and the outer primers to amplify HTRP cDNA fragments in HEK-293 cells in which sense or antisense constructs were stably expressed. The hot start PCR was performed with Taqpolymerase; the initial denaturation was at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s. A final extension was performed at 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR conditions were optimized to 30 cycles of annealing at 55 °C for endogenous HTRP1 and HTRP3 and to 35 cycles of annealing at 53 °C for endogenous HTRP4, using the inner primers. For the outer primers, the PCR was cycled 30 times, and the annealing was at 60 °C for all HTRP isoforms. For the experiments to test for mRNA expression for the α and β isoforms of HTRP4, the PCR was cycled 30 times, and the annealing was performed at 52.5 °C. The PCR mixture (48 μl) consisted of ∼22% of first stand cDNA as a template, 1 μl of 100 pm solution of each primer, 5 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 1 μl of 10 mmdNTP mix, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). For a positive control and to determine whether equal amounts of mRNA were used for each condition, we used a human β-actin primer, and a negative control without RT was performed alongside all experimental samples.Table ISequences of inner primers and outer primers for detection of HTRPsGenesAccession numberOrientationPrimer sequenceLocationHTRP1U31110Forward5′-GAT TTT GGA AAA TTT CTT GGG ATG T-3′2341–2365Reverse (inner)5′-TTT GTC TTC ATG ATT TGC TAT CA-3′2687–2709Reverse (outer)5′-ATA GCA TAT TTA GAA GTC CGA AAG C-3′3074–3098HTRP3U47050Forward5′-GAC ATA TTC AAG TTC ATG GTC CTC-3′1888–1911Reverse (inner)5′-ACA TCA CTG TCA TCC TCA ATT TC-3′2188–2210Reverse (outer)5′-CAA CAT TTA TTG AGC ACC TAC TAT-3′3088–3111HTRP4NM016179Forward5′-CTG CAA ATA TCT CTG GGA AGA-3′1744–1764Reverse (inner)5′-GCT TTG TTC GTG CAA ATT TCC-3′2135–2155Reverse (outer)5′-CTT CAC CAG GTT CCT CAT AAC-3′2356–2376HTRP4 α vs.βAF063822Forward5′-CAT CAC CAA TAC CAA GAA GTT A-3′2342–2363Reverse5′-CGT ATT CCT TTC TCT ATG GTC T-3′2962–2983Humanβ-actinJ00068Forward5′-GCT ACC CGC CCA GAA ACT AGA CAC-3′79–102Reverse5′-CCA GTT GGT GAT GAT GCC GTG CT-3′324–346The sense and antisense constructs for human Trps spanned ∼100–130-amino acid-long segments of Trps, starting from the transmembrane domain 5 and ending 12–20 amino acids downstream of transmembrane domain 6. Open table in a new tab The sense and antisense constructs for human Trps spanned ∼100–130-amino acid-long segments of Trps, starting from the transmembrane domain 5 and ending 12–20 amino acids downstream of transmembrane domain 6. The cDNA fragments of HTRP1 (369 base pairs), HTRP3 (323 base pairs), and HTRP4 (412 base pairs) from RT-PCRs were separated by electrophoresis in a 3% GTG-agarose gel. The corresponding bands were cut out of gels, extracted (QIAEX II Gel Extraction 150), and subcloned into an eukaryotic TA cloning vector pCR3.1 that accepts products in both the forward and reverse directions (eukaryotic TA cloning kit, bidirectional; Invitrogen). The clones were selected randomly, and the cDNAs were purified (Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit 25) and sequenced. The antisense constructs encoding HTRP1, HTRP3, and HTRP4 were expressed in HEK-293 cells, whereas the corresponding short sense constructs were expressed for the controls. HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mmglutamine. Cells were grown in an incubator at 37 °C with humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air. HEK-293 cells were transfected with sense or antisense constructs using the Ca2+ phosphate method. G418-resistant transformants were selected using 400 μg/ml G418. In total, three antisense cell lines (HTRP1AS, HTRP3AS, and HTRP4AS) and three sense cell lines (HTRP1S, HTRP3S, and HTRP4S) were established. For each cell line expressing sense or antisense constructs, all of the surviving clones (∼200) were pooled together to generate a cell line stably expressing one of the Trp construct(s). This was done in order to avoid the problems inherent with using small numbers of selected clones to compare the effects of gene transfection. In a previous publication, we reported significant clone-to-clone variation of SOC activity within the parent HEK-293 cell population, and, utilizing Monte Carlo analysis, we estimated the probability that this clone-to-clone variation would lead to misinterpretations of the effect of Trp channel expression (36.Babnigg G. Heller B. Villereal M.L. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells up to passage 30 were used for Ca2+imaging. Western blots of endogenous HTRPs were successful only after extensive characterization of HTRP antibodies (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel). We tested various cell lysis buffers, sample heating temperatures, support membranes, wash buffers, and antibody incubation times on samples of total cell protein, cell membrane protein, and immunoprecipitated tagged Trp protein prepared from HEK-293 cells overexpressing Trp proteins. Initial Western blot experiments were performed with anti-tag antibodies, whereas subsequent experiments compared results with anti-Trp antibodies with those obtained with anti-tag antibodies. Conditions were considered optimum when we could see clear distinct bands of the appropriate molecular weight on Western blots of Trp-expressing cells and the intensity of these bands was in great excess of corresponding bands in the lane for control HEK-293 cells. Since control samples of HEK-293 total cell protein run on minigels often did not show endogenous Trp proteins, we scaled up the procedure in order to routinely observe endogenous Trp proteins. We went to a large gel format (16 × 16 cm) so that we could load more protein, and we included a protein precipitation and wash step in order to reduce the amount of contaminants associated with loading a larger protein sample onto the gels. The precipitation and wash step was found to greatly reduce the background of the Western blots. Optimum blocking and wash conditions for Westerns with HTRP4 antibodies were slightly different from those for HTRP1 and HTRP3 antibodies (see below). Cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA). Protease Arrest (Geno Technology, Inc.) was added to prevent proteolysis. A quantitative precipitation of all of the proteins in the total cell extract was done with PAGE-Perfect (Geno Technology), and the protein precipitate was then washed to remove agents that would interfere with running high quality gels. Precipitated protein pellets were mixed with 2× Laemmli buffer (plus 100 mmdithiothreitol) and heated for 30 min at 70 °C, and sample pairs (antisense cells versus control cells) containing equal amounts of protein (200 μg for HTRP1 and HTRP3 and 400 μg for HTRP4) were loaded on a regular size gel (16 × 16 cm, 7.5% SDS-PAGE). Electrophoresis was performed overnight, and then proteins were electrotransferred onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp.). For blots with anti-HTRP1 and anti-HTRP3, the membranes were blocked with 5% milk solution in TBS-T (0.1% Tween 20) (for HTRP4 Western blots, the Tween 20 was omitted from the TBS solution) for 1 h and were then incubated with primary antibodies raised against the individual HTRPs (Alamone Laboratories) overnight at room temperature. The antibodies were diluted 1:200 in the blocking solution. Membranes were washed four times for 15 min each with TBS-T (for Trp4 Western blots, three times for 15 min each with TBS and one time for 15 min with TBS-T), incubated for 30 min at room temperature with secondary anti-rabbit antibody (1:10000 in 5% milk/TBS-T (TBS for HTRP4 Western blots)), washed under the same conditions, and developed with SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). [Ca2+]iconcentration was measured in cells loaded with the fluorescent indicator fura-2. Transfected cells were plated onto 25-mm coverslips 1 day before the experiment. On the next morning, cells were washed twice with a HEPES-buffered HBSS (HHBSS); loaded for 30 min with 5 μm fura-2/AM that was dissolved in HHBSS supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.025% pluronic F127; and then unloaded in HHBSS for another 30 min. The coverslips were mounted as the bottom of a chamber that was placed on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Zeiss Fluor ×10 (or ×20 for single cell analysis) objectives. Cells in the chamber were perfused via an eight-channel syringe system (Anspec). A suction pipette maintained a constant volume of solution (∼0.5 ml) in the chamber. An InCyt IM2TM fluorescence imaging system (dual wavelength fluorescence imaging system; Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH) was used to measure [Ca2+]i during the experiment. Excitation light from a xenon light source was alternately passed through 340 and 380 nm narrow pass filters mounted in a Sutter filter wheel (Lambda 10-C). The 510 nm emissions were captured by a cooled CCD camera (Cohu 4915). The images were transmitted to a computer (Intel Pentium Pro 500-MHz based PC) and processed with the imaging software InCyt IM2TM 4.6. [Ca2+]i was calculated by measuring the ratio of the two emission intensities for excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Calcium standard solutions, which were prepared with fura-2 potassium salt, were used to create a graph of fluorescence ratio (F340/F380) as a function of Ca2+ concentration (in nm). This graph was then used to convert fluorescence ratios in an experiment to calcium concentrations. In experiments in which Ba2+ and Sr2+ influx were measured, the data are reported as the 340/380 ratio (R340/380), since the Ba2+ and Sr2+ calibration curves for fura-2 differ from the calibration curve for Ca2+. During most experiments, an average response of ∼800 cells from a single field on each coverslip was represented as one trace. The level of store-operated Ca2+ entry in the cells expressing Trp sense or antisense constructs was obtained by subtracting the slope of the Ba2+ leak (before stimulation) from the slope of Ba2+ influx (after stimulatio"

In cardiac myocytes, endothelin-1 induces GATA-4 binding to the B-type natriuretic peptide gene, but the signaling pathways involved in endothelin-1-induced GATA-4 activation are unknown. Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways are stimulated in response to various extracellular stimuli, and they modulate the function of several transcription activators. Here we show that inhibition of p38 kinase with SB203580 inhibited endothelin-1-induced GATA-4 binding to B-type natriuretic peptide gene and serine phosphorylation of GATA-4. Inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase with MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 reduced basal and p38-induced GATA-4 binding activity, but it had no significant effect on endothelin-1-induced GATA-4 binding activity. Overexpression of p38 kinase pathway, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase or c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase, activated GATA-4 binding to B-type natriuretic peptide gene and induced rat B-type natriuretic peptide promoter activity via proximal GATA binding sites. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that activation of p38 kinase is necessary for hypertrophic agonist-induced GATA-4 binding to B-type natriuretic peptide gene and sufficient for GATA-dependent B-type natriuretic peptide gene expression.

Cardiac hypertrophy is a physiological process adapting heart to increased hemodynamic workload. In early stages, hypertrophy is a compensatory mechanism, but if prolonged, it leads to pathologic myocyte hypertrophy characterized by increase in cell size, enhanced sarcomeric organization, and induction of the fetal gene program (1.Lorell B.H. Carabello B.A. Circulation. 2000; 102: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar).

Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 215-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). At the genetic level, activation of a program of immediate early genes, such as c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc, is the first detectable response to hypertrophic stimuli. This is followed by alterations in contractile protein compositions, including reactivation of β-myosin heavy chain, skeletal α-actin, and myosin light chain-2 genes (3.Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1693-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 4.Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Hypertrophy also results in induction of noncontractile protein genes such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), which are known members of the mammalian cardiac natriuretic peptide system (5.Ruskoaho H. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 479-602PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Nakao K. Ogawa Y. Suga S. Imura H. J. Hypertens. 1992; 10: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 7.Lang C.C. Choy A.M. Struthers A.D. Clin. Sci. (Colch.). 1992; 83: 519-527Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). ANP and BNP defend against increased hemodynamic load by decreasing blood pressure, regulating fluid homeostasis by increasing salt and water excretion, and regulating several hormones, such as angiotensin II, ET-1, and vasopressin (5.Ruskoaho H. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 479-602PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Levin E.R. Gardner D.G. Samson W.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar). In the normal adult heart, ANP is mainly synthesized in the atria, whereas BNP is abundant in cardiac atria and ventricles where its gene expression is rapidly up-regulated in response to cardiac wall stretch. Indeed, the induction ofBNP gene expression is one of the earliest myocyte-specific markers of hemodynamic stress-induced hypertrophic response (5.Ruskoaho H. Pharmacol.

There is also considerable evidence that activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades can lead to a hypertrophic response in myocytes. MAPK pathways can be divided into three subclasses; the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway, the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) pathway, and the p38 kinase pathway (15.Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 633-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Each MAPK pathway consists of three or more levels and multiple isoforms, giving the signaling system potential to distinguish different extracellular stimuli. The MAPKs, ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, have been shown to be inducible by a variety of hypertrophic stimuli, including mechanical stretch, ET-1, and other GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor) agonists (15.Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 633-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16.Liang F. Lu S. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 188-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiac-restricted MEK1 (an upstream kinase of ERK pathway) overexpression in vivo has been shown to lead to concentric hypertrophy in transgenic mice (17.Bueno O.F. De Windt L.J. Tymitz K.M.

The p38 MAPK family consists of six isoforms, of whichp38α and p38β are the predominant isoforms present in the heart (20.Jiang Y. Gram H. Zhao M. New L. Gu J. Feng L. Di Padova F. Ulevitch R.J.

Activation of p38 has also been shown to lead to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro (21.Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J.

Activated MAPKs phosphorylate a number of substrates, including nuclear transcription factors such as myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2), activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2), ATF6, and downstream kinases such as p38-regulated/activated kinase (23.Han J.

However, the precise roles of different MAPKs and their downstream targets in hypertrophic signaling are not known.The GATA family of transcriptional factors contains six mammalian members (reviewed in refs. 27.Molkentin J.D.

Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). GATA proteins, which contain a DNA binding domain composed of two evolutionary conserved zinc fingers (N- and C-terminal), bind to consensus sequence 5′-(A/T)GATA(A/G)-3′ and its variants (29.Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Cardiac transcription factor GATA-4 has been shown to play a nonredundant role for the cardiac muscle development during embryogenesis (30.Molkentin J.D. Lin Q. Duncan S.A. Olson E.N.

In postnatal cardiac myocytes, it has been reported that the expression of several cardiac genes, including α-myosin heavy chain (αMHC) and cardiac troponin C (cTnC), is directed into cardiac myocytes via GATA-4 binding elements on the promoter region (32.Molkentin J.D.

Recently, we have reported that pressure overload of rat heart activates GATA-4 and that the activation is mediated by ET-1 (41.Hautala N. Tokola H. Luodonpää M. Puhakka J. Romppanen H. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. Circulation. 2001; 103: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the present study, to identify molecular mechanisms mediating ET-1-induced BNPgene expression and activation of GATA-4, we focused on the role of MAPK signaling in cultured rat neonatal cardiac myocytes.DISCUSSIONMAPKs, ERK, JNK, and p38, regulate a broad range of biological functions in response to extracellular stimuli. Each MAPK pathway is a complex formation, which provides multiple alternatives to distinguish between different signals. On the other hand, cross-talk between MAPK pathways is known to exist at several levels, i.e. MEKK1 (an upstream kinase of JNK pathway) activating both ERK and p38 MAPK pathways (21.Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 51.Thorburn J. Xu S. Thorburn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1888-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), therefore influencing the interpretation of the results when studying the specific cellular roles of MAPKs. In the present study, we investigated the role of MAPK signaling in hypertrophic gene expression induced by ET-1 in cardiac myocytes. ET-1 rapidly activated p38 MAPK, in agreement with several previous papers suggesting involvement of p38 MAPK in ET-1-induced hypertrophic response (16.Liang F. Lu S. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 188-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We also found that ET-1-induced de novoprotein synthesis of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes was inhibited by pharmacological blockade of p38 MAPK (SB203580), but not with blockade of ERK signaling (PD98059). This finding disagrees with the previous results showing that SB203580, which blocks the activity of p38 by binding to the ATP binding site of p38 MAPK (52.Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Kassis S. Doyle M.L. McNulty D. Gallagher T.F. Fisher S. McDonnell P.C. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Seibel G. Porter T.G. Livi G.P. Adams J.L. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), had no effect on ET-1-induced protein synthesis or sarcomere organization (19.Choukroun G. Hajjar R. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J.V. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The reason for these discrepant findings remains to be established but may be related to differences under “Experimental Procedures,” such as the duration of experiments and inhibitor concentration.As reported previously (12.Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 16.Liang F. Lu S. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 188-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), p42/44 MAPK was also rapidly activated by ET-1. Inhibition of ERK pathway with PD98059 has been proposed to inhibit also p38 to some extent (18.Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), but we found no inhibition of ET-1-induced p38 activity by PD98059 at the concentration of 20 μm (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, ERK inhibition induced basal p38 activation about 2-fold, but it had no additional effect on ET-1-induced p38 activity. Previously, a higher dose of PD98059 (50 μm) has been shown to increase basal levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK (18.Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a recent study constitutive active MEK1 (an upstream kinase of ERK pathway) was shown to inhibit p38 MAPK activity and p38-induced phosphorylation of TATA-binding protein (53.Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27858-27864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This inhibitory response was suggested to be mediated by MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), which has been shown to block ET-1-induced activation of the MAPKs (53.Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27858-27864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 54.Bueno O.F. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Tymitz K.M. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Studies using MEK1/2 inhibitor or overexpression of dominant negative form of MEK1 have shown that ERK is necessary for the stimulation of MKP-1mRNA expression (55.Haneda M. Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 365: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, blockade of ERK for 24 h in the present experiments is likely to inhibit MKP-1 expression and thus result in increased p38 activity. On the other hand, hypertrophic agonists have been shown to activate MKP-1 through mechanisms involving Ca2+, protein kinase C, and diacylglycerol (56.Scimeca J.C. Servant M.J. Dyer J.O. Meloche S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 57.Duff J.L. Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Bernstein K.E. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26037-26040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, lack of additive effect with PD on ET-1-induced p38 activity is likely to result of ET-1-induced activation of MKP-1. Another mechanism involved may be the substrate specificity of MKP-1, because it has been shown to preferentially block the activation of p38 MAPK (58.Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar).A large number of transcription factors, including GATA-1–4 (39.Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 5597-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have been shown to exist within cells as phosphoproteins. The GATA-4 protein has at least seven potential sites for serine phosphorylation by MAPKs, and the phosphorylation was increased after α1-agonist stimulation via ERK pathway (39.Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S. Kakita T. Wada H. Yanazume T. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13721-13726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A novel finding in our studies is the differential regulation of GATA-4 binding activity by MAPKs. The present results indicate that p38 MAPK and ERK are involved in the regulation of GATA-4 binding activity. Blockade of ERK pathway, although increasing p38 MAPK activity, lead to decreased phosphorylation of serine residues in GATA-4 and decreased basal binding activity, but it had no effect on ET-1-induced increase in GATA-4 DNA binding. ERK overexpression lead to phosphorylation of the serine residues of GATA-4 protein, but it was not sufficient to increase GATA-4 binding to BNP gene. Blockade of p38 pathway similarly decreased phosphorylation of serine residues in GATA-4 and, in contrast to ERK inhibition, totally abolished ET-1-induced GATA-4 binding to BNP gene. It is remarkable that p38 overexpression not only phosphorylated serine residues in GATA-4 protein, but also increased GATA-4 binding to BNP promoter. Interestingly, p38-induced increase, but not ET-1-induced increase, in GATA-4 DNA binding activity was partially inhibited by MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. This is likely to result from other mechanisms induced by ET-1, such as other kinases or transcription factors, which can compensate for the inhibited ERK pathway. Studies on MAPKs in COS-1 cells transiently expressing GATA-4 further supported the essential role of p38 MAPK in the regulation of GATA-4 DNA binding activity. Our findings together indicate the preferential but distinct roles of ERK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways in regulation of GATA-4 transcription factor binding activity. The present results show that blockade of p38 MAPK pathway abolishes hypertrophic agonist-induced GATA-4 binding to BNP gene, whereas inhibition of ERK pathway only disrupts GATA-4 binding activity in nonstimulated myocytes.In addition to the increase in the DNA binding activity, the functional consequences of GATA-4 phosphorylation may include changes in cellular localization and transcriptional activation. To define the role of GATA-4 binding on BNP gene expression, we introduced site-directed mutations to two adjacent GATA-sites at −91 and −80 bp of the proximal BNP promoter (Δ-534bp/+4bp). Previously, these GATA binding sites have been shown to direct cardiac myocyte-specific expression of rat BNP promoter and regulate basal promoter activity (34.Grepin C. Dagnino L. Robitaille L. Haberstroh L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3115-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 50.Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17772-17775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that p38α overexpression was potent in activating the proximal BNP promoter, but the mutation of GATA sites abolished p38-induced promoter activity. In contrast, overexpression of either MEK1 or MEKK1 activated both the proximal BNP promoter and the mutated promoter. These results demonstrate that, in the context of proximal rat BNP promoter, p38- but not ERK-induced transcription is dependent upon a GATA binding site in the promoter.The precise role of the third member of MAPK family, JNK, in hypertrophic response is even more controversial due to the lack of specific inhibitor for JNK. In cardiac myocytes, a dominant-negative JNK construct has been shown to inhibit PE-induced ANPexpression, and some studies also find functional JNK pathway essential for hypertrophic response to ET-1 (19.Choukroun G. Hajjar R. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J.V. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 51.Thorburn J. Xu S. Thorburn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1888-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In our studies we found that inhibition of the JNK pathway with dominant negative mutant of JNK1 had no effect on basal or hypertrophic agonist-induced GATA-4 DNA binding ability. On the other hand, overexpression of MEKK1, an upstream kinase of JNK, induced proximal BNP promoter activity, but the induction was independent of GATA-4 binding in the promoter.The mechanisms involved in GATA-4-induced tissue-specific gene expression are not well understood but may involve interactions between GATA-4 and other cell-restricted transcription factors (27.Molkentin J.D.

The ANP promoter is a known downstream target for the cardiac-specific transcription factor GATA-4, and for Nkx-2.5, which bind to adjacent sites in ANP promoter and synergistically activate ANP gene (35.Durocher D.

Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) that MEF2 proteins are recruited by GATA-4 to synergistically activateANP and αMHC genes. Interaction of friend of GATA-2 (FOG-2) with GATA-4 has also been confirmed (65.Tevosian S.G. Deconinck A.E. Cantor A.B. Rieff H.I. Fujiwara Y. Corfas G. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nkx-2.5 and NF-AT3 (nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes), in turn, bind to C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-4 resulting in synergistic transcriptional activation (35.Durocher D. Charron F.

The mechanisms by which GATA-4 increases or represses the transcriptional activity with its cofactors remain unclear, but site-specific phosphorylation of GATA-4 protein by MAPKs may have an effect on the interactions of GATA-4 with its cofactors in cardiac myocytes. GATA-4 protein harbors a strong MAPK recognition sequence (Pro-Val-Ser-Pro) at 102–105 residues and multiple Ser-Pro sequences (68.Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that p38-mediated Ser phosphorylation of GATA-4 is followed by increased DNA binding activity, mapping of these Ser phosphorylation sites of GATA-4 will be necessary to fully understand the regulation of GATA-4-mediated gene expression.The heart adapts to increased demands for cardiac work by increasing muscle mass through the initiation of a hypertrophic response. Hypertrophic stimuli reach the nucleus via multiple signaling pathways within cardiac myocytes and elicit changes in gene expression. p38 MAPK has been implicated in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, but exact mechanisms are not well understood (18.Clerk A.

Activating mutations in FGFR3 are associated with multiple myeloma, cervical carcinoma, and bladder cancer. To identify proteins that interact with FGFR3 and which may mediate FGFR3-dependent signaling, a yeast two-hybrid screen was employed using the cytoplasmic kinase domain of FGFR3 as bait. We identified the adapter protein SH2-B as an FGFR3-interacting protein. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate binding of the SH2-Bβ isoform to FGFR3 in 293T cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ was observed when coexpressed with activated FGFR3 mutants such as the weakly activated mutant N540K or the strongly activated mutant K650E, both associated with human developmental syndromes. The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ correlates with receptor activation, suggesting that FGFR3 activation mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ. Furthermore, two tyrosine phosphorylation sites of FGFR3, Tyr-724 and Tyr-760, are required for optimal binding of the Src homology-2 (SH2) domain of SH2-Bβ. We also demonstrate the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Stat5 by activated FGFR3, which increases in response to overexpression of SH2-Bβ.

Disruption of murine FGFR3 produces severe and progressive bone dysplasia with enhanced endochondral bone growth, suggesting that FGFR3 mediates the negative regulation of bone growth (16Deng C.

Mutations in FGFR3 are directly responsible for human dwarfism syndromes, including hypochondroplasia, achondroplasia, and thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) (6Webster M.K. Donoghue D.J. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 178-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Several of the mutations that cause these syndromes reside within the FGFR3 kinase domain and result in varying degrees of constitutive receptor activation. The N540K substitution, located proximal to the split tyrosine kinase domain, underlies the mild skeletal dwarfism hypochondroplasia and confers weak constitutive activation (15Bellus G.A. McIntosh I. Smith E.A. Aylsworth A.S. Kaitila I. Horton W.A. Greenhaw G.A. Hecht J.T. Francomano C.A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 18Bellus G.A.

At the other end of the spectrum, the K650E substitution located within the activation loop of the kinase domain relieves the normal requirement for regulatory phosphorylation at Tyr-647 and Tyr-648 and leads to profound constitutive kinase activation in comparison to wild-type FGFR3 (19Webster M.K. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This mutation causes thanatophoric dysplasia type II (TDII), a neonatal lethal dwarfism syndrome (6Webster M.K.

Recently, a different activating substitution at this same position, K650M, has been associated with the syndrome SADDAN (or severe achondroplasia with delayed development and acanthosis nigricans) (12Tavormina P.L.

Abnormal activation of FGFR3 as a result of somatic mutation has been reported in conjunction with several human cancers, including multiple myeloma, cervical carcinoma, and bladder carcinoma (7Chesi M.

The specific FGFR3 mutations involved include K650E and K650M in the kinase domain or R248C, S249C, G370C, and Y373C in the extracellular domain.

In the presence of heparin sulfate proteoglycan, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) bind to FGFRs, causing receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues (23Mohammadi M. Dikic I.

These phosphotyrosine residues provide specific binding sites for signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains or phosphotyrosine binding domains (26Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Martin G.A.

The adapter protein fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) has also been shown to associate with FGFR1 (29Ong S.H. Guy G.R. Hadari Y.R. Laks S. Gotoh N. Schelessinger J. Lax I. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17987-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Activation of FGFR1 leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 at several sites, leading to recruitment of growth factor receptor-bound 2 (Grb2) (32Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schelssinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Besides PLC-γ and FRS2, little is known about substrates of FGFRs that lead to mitogenesis and differentiation. Given the importance of understanding FGFR3-mediated signaling, both for human developmental syndromes and also for those human cancers where FGFR3 activation has been observed, we wished to identify novel FGFR3-interacting proteins that may represent important substrates for downstream signaling. Toward this end, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen in which the bait was the kinase domain from either wild-type FGFR3 or from an activated mutant. Using the weakly activated N540K mutant as bait, we were able to identify four candidate binding proteins that interact with FGFR3, one of which is the adapter protein SH2-B. SH2-B contains several protein-protein interaction motifs, including a pleckstrin homology domain, an SH2 domain, and multiple proline-rich regions (33Riedel H. Wang J. Hansen H. Yousaf N. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Rui L. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21239-21245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). At least three splice variants of SH2-B (α, β, and γ) have been identified that have identical N-terminal and SH2 domains but differ in their C-terminal domains (33Riedel H. Wang J. Hansen H.

Because SH2-Bβ has been the most studied isoform of SH2-B, we used SH2-Bβ to further characterize the interaction with FGFR3 described here. In PC12 cells, tyrosine-phosphorylated SH2-Bβ binds to growth factor receptor-bound 2 (Grb2) and is sufficient to mediate nerve growth factor induction of Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase (38Qian X. Riccio A. Zhang Y. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 45Rui L. Herrington J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol.

SH2-Bβ has also been demonstrated to bind to JAK2, to stimulate the kinase activity of JAK2, and to increase tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat5B when coexpressed with JAK2 (35Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,37Rui L. Carter-Su C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We also demonstrate that activated FGFR3 can directly phosphorylate SH2-Bβ. In addition, we show that expression of SH2-Bβ together with activated FGFR3 increases Stat5B phosphorylation in 293T cells. Stat5B was also observed to relocalize exclusively to the nucleus upon FGFR3-mediated signaling through SH2-Bβ. Our data thus suggest that the adapter protein SH2-Bβ may represent an important signaling molecule that mediates downstream biological effects of FGFR3 activation.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3309-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The FGFR3-N540K (R3-N540K) mutant was constructed from R3-WT by using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). LexA-R3-WT, LexA-R3-N540K, and LexA-R3-K650E were constructed through the insertion of the cytoplasmic domain of R3-WT, R3-N540K, and R3-K650E, respectively, into the LexA fusion vector pBTM116, which was constructed by P. Bartel and S. Fields. To construct the Myc epitope-tagged SH2 domain of SH2-B (Myc-SH2), pVP16-SH2-B isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen was digested at flanking BamHI and EcoRI sites, and the resulting restriction fragment was subcloned into BglII/EcoRI-digested pCS3+MT vector. GST-SH2 was generated by subcloning Myc-SH2 into the vector pGEX-KG (Amersham Biosciences). The Tyr to Phe mutants were constructed as described previously (49Hart K.C. Robertson S.C. Donoghue D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pBTM116. The Myc-SH2-Bβ(R555E) was made as described previously (37Rui L. Carter-Su C. Proc. Natl.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The two-hybrid plasmids pBTM116, pVP16, and LexA-lamin were kindly provided by S. Hollenberg and J. A. Cooper (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center). LexA-R3-WT, LexA-R3-N540K, or LexA-R3-K650E constructs were cotransformed with a 9.5-day-post-coitum mouse embryonic cDNA library fused to pVP16 into the L40 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transformants were selected on His− medium for 3–4 days at 30 °C. The resulting colonies were subjected to the filter-lift color assay and tested for β-galactosidase activity (50Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Potential positive clones were selected, and prey plasmids containing library cDNA inserts were isolated and shuttled into Escherichia coli HB101 cells. Positives were further confirmed by testing pVP16-cDNA against LexA-lamin and sequenced by the Center for AIDS Research Molecular Biology Core, University of California San Diego. The NCBI BLAST program was used to determine the identity of positive clones. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Sub-confluent cells were transfected with 10 μg of DNA by calcium phosphate precipitation (52Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4826) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection cells were harvested and lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer {20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were pre-cleared with 40 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose beads and then incubated with 2 μg of polyclonal FGFR3 (C-15) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody or monoclonal Myc (9E10) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then added over a 2-h period, and the immunoprecipitated samples were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, boiled 3 min in sample buffer, and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. For experiments not requiring immunoprecipitation, lysates were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were immunoblotted with FGFR3 (C-15) antibody, Myc (9E10) antibody, and phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). To reprobe with other antibodies, membranes were stripped of bound antibodies in stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)) and incubated for 30 min at 60 °C with rotation. For endogenous SH2-Bβ association with FGFR3, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 15 μg of pcDNA3 or R3-K650E. Two days post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysed with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and 1.5 mg of pre-cleared protein were immunoprecipitated with SH2-Bβ antibody generously provided by Dr. Carter-Su (35Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 4 °C overnight. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then added for at least 2 h, and the immunoprecipitated samples were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, boiled 3 min in sample buffer, and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and probed with FGFR3 (C-15) antibody. The membrane was then stripped and probed with SH2-Bβ antibody followed by ECL. For Stat5 phosphorylation experiments, 5 μg of the indicated constructs were transfected into 293T cells. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and 40 μg of lysate was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membrane was then probed with phospho-Stat5 antibody (Cell Signaling) and proteins were detected by ECL. The membrane was then stripped and reprobed with Stat5 (C-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FGFR3 (C-15), and Myc (9E10) antisera to ensure equal levels of protein expression. Bacteria transformed with GST-SH2 or GST plasmid were grown overnight and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside the next day. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of NETN (100 mmNaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% v/vNonidet P-40 with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cell suspensions were then sonicated followed by centrifugation at 20 krpm for 30 min. Supernatants were added to GST beads and rotated at 4 °C overnight. Beads then were washed five times with NETN and boiled in sample buffer. The kinase domain isolated from full-length R3-K650E (amino acids 457–827) was subcloned into pFASTBAC Htc (Invitrogen), which contains a histidine tag and elements necessary for cloning and subsequent transfer to the baculovirus genome. Purification was as previously described (53Polayes D. Ciccarone V. Anderson D. Harris R. Donahue R. Gerard G. Luckow V. Jessee J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1124-1134Google Scholar). 15 μl of GST fusion proteins were washed once in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2) and subsequently incubated with or without 15 μl of baculovirus-expressed R3-K650E in 30 μl of kinase buffer plus 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 20 min. Samples were then washed with NETN five times, boiled in sample buffer, resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to membrane, and visualized by autoradiography. The membrane was then immunoblotted with GST (Z-5) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and detected by ECL. Yeast were cotransformed with the indicated plasmids and grown on His− plates for 3–4 days at 30 °C. Liquid culture β-galactosidase assays were then performed according to the protocol provided by CLONTECH using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma). Each reaction was carried out at 30 °C until the sample became yellow. Samples that did not develop a yellow color were stopped at the end of the fourth hour. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 420 nm, and β-galactosidase activity was calculated using the formula, β-galactosidase units = 1000 × A420/(t ×V × A600), wheret is elapsed time (min) of incubation, V is 0.1 ml × concentration factor, and A600 is the absorbance of 1 ml if culture at 600 nm. The data obtained were the results of five independent experiments. 2C4 cells were cultured in 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum containing 80 μg/ml G418 in 5% CO2. Cells were plated onto 60-mm plates containing glass coverslips at a density of 5 × 105. The next day, the cells were transfected with a total of 2.1 μg of DNA of the indicated constructs using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s directions. DNA ratios for the triple transfection were 0.1 μg of GFP-Stat5B, 0.5 μg of FGFR3, and 1.5 μg of Myc-SH2-Bβ. pcDNA3 was added to make up the difference in the single and double transfections. Twenty-four h post-transfection, the coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. To visualize protein localization, the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The cells were incubated with FGFR3 antibody (1:500) for 1 h, washed, then incubated with 1:500 rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 45 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with 90% glycerol in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) plus phenylenediamine to prevent fading. Cells were photographed using a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope with a Hamamatsu C5810 camera. A yeast two-hybrid screen was employed to identify potential substrates of FGFR3. To construct the bait for the two-hybrid screen, the entire intracellular domain of FGFR3 was fused to the LexA DNA binding domain. Three different bait constructs were utilized that differed in the extent of constitutive FGFR3 kinase activation (Fig.1A): (i) LexA-R3-WT, (ii) LexA-R3-N540K, incorporating the weakly activated N540K mutation that causes hypochondroplasia (15Bellus G.A.

These constructs were used as two-hybrid baits and screened against a 9.5-day-post-coitum mouse embryonic cDNA library. Cotransformed yeast were plated on His− plates, and the activation of the HIS3 reporter gene was used to select for protein-protein interactions. The LexA-R3-WT bait resulted in ∼50 positives, but none yielded identifiable clones. The LexA-R3-K650E bait appeared toxic to the yeast in the large scale transformation, and no positives resulted from the screen. Only one of the bait proteins, LexA-R3-N540K, yielded significant positive clones in the screen. Approximately 150 potential positive clones were isolated, and of these, 50 clones scored positive on the filter-lift β-galactosidase assay. False positives were further eliminated by testing against LexA-lamin,"

The aims of this study were to determine whether MTP functions in the secretory pathway as well as in the endoplasmic reticulum and whether its large 97-kDa subunit interacts with the small 58-kDa protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) subunit and apoB, particularly in the Golgi apparatus. Using a high resolution immunogold approach combined with specific polyclonal antibodies, the large and small subunits of MTP were observed over the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi. Double immunocytochemical detection unraveled the colocalization of MTP and PDI as well as MTP and apoB in these same subcellular compartments. To confirm the spatial contact of these proteins, Golgi fractions were isolated, homogenized, and incubated with an anti-MTP large subunit antibody. Immunoprecipitates were applied on SDS-PAGE and then transferred on to nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting the membrane with PDI and apoB antibodies confirmed the colocalization of these proteins with MTP. Furthermore, MTP activity assay disclosed a substantial triglyceride transfer in the Golgi fractions.

Despite significant progress, our understanding of the complex biosynthetic process involved in the formation and secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles remains rather fragmentary. In particular, we know little about the sequential multistep assembly of apolipoproteins and lipids or the topology of the proteins in intracellular organelles implicated in lipoprotein production.

The addition of core lipid to the nascent lipoprotein particle is thought to occur in conjunction with the translation and translocation of apoB in the ER (12.Boren J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J.

The initial complement of lipid is then added to form a nascent, small, dense lipoprotein particle. In the second step, maturation of the particle occurs by the addition of the neutral lipid core (16.Swift L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Boren J.

Based upon the known lipid transfer activity of MTP, its localization in the lumen of the ER, and the observation that apoB is degraded intracellularly and not secreted in the absence of MTP, it has been proposed that MTP shuttles lipids from the ER membrane to the growing apoB chain in the ER, allowing the protein to translocate completely into the lumen (18.Gordon D.A.

If partial assembly takes place in the Golgi and additional core lipids and phospholipids are added in the pre-Golgi and Golgi as has been suggested (25.Bamberger M.J. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 529-543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one would anticipate the obligatory presence of MTP in these compartments. Structurally, MTP is a heterodimer composed of a unique large subunit (97 kDa) and a smaller subunit (58 kDa) (30.Wetterau J.R. Zilversmit D.B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1985; 38: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31.Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. Spinner S.N. Joiner B.J. J. Biol.

The role of PDI in the function of MTP is not entirely clear. The two subunits form a tight complex, and their dissociation eliminates MTP activity. The intracellular location of MTP in the intestine has not been thoroughly elucidated. Subfractionation of crude liver homogenates suggested that MTP is located in hepatocellular microsomes (32.Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Laplaud P.M. McLean L.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 33.Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. McLean L.R. Spinner S.N. Aggerbeck L.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9728-9735Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this finding was not confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. In the present paper, the following issues are addressed. 1) Can MTP be found in secretory pathway sites other than the ER? 2) Does it occur alone or in close proximity to PDI in these compartments? 3) Does it colocalize with apoB? 4) If MTP can be detected in the Golgi apparatus, is it functional? 5) Can it facilitate apoB translocation from Golgi membranes? The answers to these questions provided by the experiments described herein help elucidate the mechanisms involved in the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Sprague-Dawley rats were used for all experiments. Jejunal specimens were taken at the ligament of Treitz, washed, and prepared for microscopy visualization. For the isolation of Golgi, the mucosa was scraped, homogenized, and ultracentrifuged. Intestinal specimens were fixed by immersion in 1% glutaraldehyde, 0.1m phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 2 h at 4 °C and embedded in Lowicryl K4M at −20 °C according to our previously described procedures (34.Bendayan M. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1984; 1: 243-270Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Tissue blocks were examined by light microscopy to select well oriented villus tips. Thin sections (60–80 nm) of the different tissue blocks were mounted on nickel grids with a carbon-coated Parlodion film and processed for immunocytochemistry. Protein A-gold immunocytochemical techniques were employed to detect the presence of MTP, PDI, and apoB in rat intestinal tissue as we have described previously (34.Bendayan M. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1984; 1: 243-270Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 35.Levy E. Rochette C. Londono I. Roy C.C. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Bendayan M. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1937-1946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissue sections were washed initially in distilled water, incubated for 5 min on a drop of PBS containing 1% ovalbumin, and transferred subsequently to a drop of the PBS-diluted antibody (see below). After incubation (90 min) at room temperature, the grids were rinsed with PBS to remove unbound antibodies. They were transferred to the PBS-ovalbumin (3 min) and incubated on a drop of protein A-gold (pH 7.2) for 30 min at room temperature. The tissue sections were then thoroughly washed with PBS, rinsed with distilled water, and dried. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before examination with a Philips 410 electron microscope. Polyclonal antibodies were used at various dilutions (MTP 1/100, MTP large subunit 1/50, PDI 1/10, apoB 1/100) in combination with protein A-gold complexes, which were prepared using 10- or 5-nm gold particles according to our established techniques (35.Levy E.

Cytochem. 1995; 29: 1-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Control experiments were performed to assess the specificity of the results. Excess purified MTP (10-fold) was added to the antibody solution. Incubation with this solution was followed by the protein A-gold complex. Pre-immune rabbit serum (diluted 1:10) was used on tissue sections before incubation with protein A-gold complex. Incubations were also performed with the protein A-gold complex alone, omitting the antibody step to test for nonspecific adsorption of the protein A-gold complex to tissue sections (36.Bendayan M. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 29: 1-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To reveal the existence of MTP-PDI as well as MTP-ApoB complexes within the cellular compartments, the double-labeling technique was applied. The tissue sections were labeled simultaneously for either MTP and PDI or MTP and ApoB. The two-phase labeling technique (36.Bendayan M. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 29: 1-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 37.Bendayan M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1982; 30: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) was applied to avoid any cross-reaction between reagents. The small protein A-gold complex (5 nm) was used for the first labeling protocol, and the larger 10 nm protein A-gold complex was used for the second. This protocol allows for the simultaneous visualization of two antigens (MTP and PDI or MTP and ApoB) in the same tissue section. The antibodies for the MTP, PDI, and MTP large subunits were kindly provided by John Wetterau, Harris Jamil, and one of the authors (C. Shoulders). These antibodies have been characterized and utilized successfully in previous studies (7.Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Gay G. Rader D.J.

Marcel Y.L. Bendayan M. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1937-1946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confirmation of the specificity of the antibodies was obtained when: 1) MTP large and small subunits as well as apoB from total homogenate were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with each polyclonal antibody; and 2) cellular lysates were first reacted with the antibodies (directed against large MTP subunit, small MTP subunit, and apoB antibodies) before the immunoprecipitates were subjected to gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and reacted with the underlying antibodies. Microsomal and Golgi fractions were prepared from enterocytes of fasted rats using modifications of reported techniques (40.Levy E. Garofalo C. Rouleau T. Gavino V. Bendayan M.

Epithelial cells were homogenized (25%, w/v) in 0.25 m sucrose in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 25 mm KCl) containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 25 mm4-aminophenyl-methanesulfonyl fluoride) using a polytron (Brinkmann Instruments) at a setting of 1 (30 s). The homogenate from a group of animals was used to prepare microsomes representative of the endoplasmic reticulum (40.Levy E. Garofalo C. Rouleau T. Gavino V. Bendayan M. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 848-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the preparation of Golgi fractions, the homogenate from another group of animals was filtered through cheesecloth and then adjusted (150 parts homogenate and 95 parts 2m sucrose in the aforementioned buffer) to a final concentration of 1.07 m sucrose. The adjusted homogenate (19 ml/tube) was loaded into Beckman SW 28 tubes; 9 ml each of 0.9 and 0.2 m sucrose in the aforementioned buffer were then sequentially overlaid above the homogenate. The tubes were subsequently centrifuged in an SW 28 rotor for 2 h at 83,000 ×g. Golgi fractions were collected at the 0.2/0.9m sucrose interface. To prepare Golgi membranes, Golgi fractions were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with the buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, and the protease inhibitors as indicated above) with 20% glycerol and centrifuged for 90 min at 200,000 × g. Golgi membrane pellets were resuspended at 5% of their original volume in 0.25m sucrose in the same buffer. Golgi membranes were solubilized with either 1% Igepal CA 630 (a Nonidet P-40 equivalent from Sigma) or 1% CHAPS and 0.2% Triton X-100-containing buffer. The extract was then centrifuged at 200,000 × g, and the pellet was discarded. The purity of the Golgi subcellular fraction was verified by assay of galactosyltransferase, a specific marker for Golgi organelles, and glucose-6-phosphatase, a marker for the ER. The intestinal ER and Golgi specimens were sonicated in 1 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing saponin (100 μg/ml) and protease inhibitors (leupeptin, 10 μg/ml; Trasylol, 10 μg/ml; pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml). The MTP/PDI heterodimer was separated by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g) and concentrated using a Centricon 30 cartridge (5000 rpm × 30 min). The triglyceride transfer assay was adapted from previous reports (30.Wetterau J.R. Zilversmit D.B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1985; 38: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 39.Leiper J.M.

The donor and receiver vesicles were prepared by adding the appropriate amount of lipids to 500 μl of chloroform followed by drying under a stream of nitrogen, rehydration, and probe sonication in 1.25 ml of 15:35 buffer (15 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 35 mm NaCl, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 3 mm sodium azide, 1 mm EDTA). Donor vesicles contained, per assay, 4 nmol of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, 0.33 nmol of cardiolipin, and 0.024 nmol of [3H]trioleylglycerol (Amersham Biosciences). Receptor vesicles contained 24 nmol of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, 0.048 nmol of trioleylglycerol, and ∼4000 cpm of [14C]dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine ([14C]DPPC; Amersham Biosciences). Both categories of vesicles comprised 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene. Various amounts of semi-purified MTP were incubated with 5 μl of donor and receptor vesicles in a final volume of 100 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by adding 400 μl of ice-cold 15:35 buffer (without bovine serum albumin). The negatively charged (due to the presence of cardiolipin) donor vesicles were removed from the reaction mixture by adsorption onto DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE-52). The supernatant (containing the receptor vesicles) was collected after a low speed centrifugation (13000 × g) and recentrifuged (13000 × g) to assure a total removal of the DEAE-cellulose before scintillation counting. A blank assay containing donor and acceptor membranes without transferred protein was used to correct for the spontaneous transfer of labeling between vesicles. The ratio of [3H]glycerol trioleate on [14C]dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine was determined, and the percentage lipid transfer was calculated from the increase in this ratio. Lipid transfer activity was determined from the initial linear portions of the activity curves. ApoB synthesis was assessed in everted rat intestine, as described previously (44.Levy E. Garofalo C. Thibault L. Dionne S. Daoust L. Lepage G. Roy C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G319-G326PubMed Google Scholar). Then, 300 μCi of [35S]methionine was added to the RPMI 1640 medium for 1 h. The medium was removed, and the intestine was washed and again incubated for 2 h with medium containing 10 mm unlabeled methionine in the presence or absence of 15 μm BMS-200150, an inhibitor of MTP. Labeled apoB from membranes and the luminal contents of isolated microsomal and Golgi fractions were immunoprecipitated, subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, excised from the gel, and counted (45.Levy E. Sinnett D. Thibault L. Nguyen T.D. Delvin E. Ménard D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The first step in our studies was to test the specificity of the polyclonal antibodies that were generously provided by investigators (see “Acknowledgments”) who remarkably advanced the knowledge of MTP. By immunoprecipitating epithelial cell lysates, separating the immunoprecipitates on SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting them separately with large 97-kDa and small 58-kDa antibodies, we identified the expected 97- and 58-kDa subunits corresponding to the MTP and PDI components, respectively (Fig. 1 A). The use of polyclonal antibodies directed against the whole MTP complex resulted in the recovery of both MTP and PDI subunits (Fig. 1 A). Similar experimental procedures displayed and confirmed the specificity of anti-apoB antibodies (Fig. 1 A). In a second step, the specificity of antibodies was verified by fractionating the total homogenate by SDS-PAGE, transferring it to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotting. Once again, we found only the signal corresponding to the targeted protein (Fig. 1 B). We subsequently used immunocytochemical techniques and isolated microsomal and Golgi fractions to reveal the presence of MTP in these subcellular compartments. The purity of microsomal and Golgi fractions was determined by the assay of galactosyltransferase, as a specific marker for Golgi membranes, and glucose-6-phosphatase as a marker for the ER. The results of marker protein assays from a typical fractionation are shown in Table I. The Golgi fraction was enriched 96-fold with UDP-galactose galactosyltransferase specific activity over cell homogenate, whereas glucose-6-phosphatase activity was very low (1.26-fold) in this cell organelle. Furthermore, the rough ER-derived fraction was enriched 3.8-fold in the specific activity of glucose-6-phosphotase and 2.46-fold in that of galactosyltransferase.Table ISpecific activities of marker enzymes of subcellular fractionsOrganelleGalactosyltransferaseGlucose-6-phosphatasenmol/mg protein/minWhole homogenate0.041 (×1.00)0.720 (×1.00)Microsomal fraction0.101 (×2.46)2.735 (×3.80)Golgi fraction3.926 (×95.75)0.907 (×1.26)Microsomal and Golgi subcellular fractions were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” The purity of the organelle fractions was assessed by determining the specific activities of UDP-galactose galactosyltransferase and glucose-6-phosphatase.

The enrichment of the marker enzymes in each cellular fraction was calculated by dividing the specific activity of the subcellular fraction by that of the homogenate (data are given in parentheses). The data represent the average of n = 2. An anti-MTP heterodimer antibody was initially applied to define the immunocytochemical pattern of labeling in enterocytes (Fig. 2). The ultrastructural analysis of rat enterocytes revealed significant labeling over the rough ER, the Golgi area, and basolateral membranes (Fig. 2). The trans-Golgi cisternae were more intensely labeled. Finally, the gold particles in the basal region of the enterocyte were associated with the basolateral membrane and its interdigitations (Fig. 2). Only very few particles were located over the mitochondria and nuclei. Control experiments confirmed the specificity of these results. The preadsorbtion of the antibody with its antigen prior to performing immunocytochemical detection resulted in very low labeling in all cellular regions (Fig. 3). Similar data were obtained with the other control experiments, confirming the validity of the morphological findings. Furthermore, the addition of albumin to the antibody solution did not alter the pattern of labeling. The antibody used in this first series of experiments recognizes the whole 97-kDa-58-kDa MTP protein complex. We therefore attempted to distinguish between the two subunits by employing antibodies specific to the 97-kDa and the 58-kDa polypeptides separately. With the antibody directed against the MTP large subunit, the distribution of the labeling (Fig. 4) over the rough ER and the Golgi"

Proposed functions for this protein in vivo include a chaperone-like role in Kv1 α subunit biogenesis and catalytic activity as an AKR oxidoreductase. To investigate the in vivo function of Kvβ2, Kvβ2-null and point mutant (Y90F) mice were generated through gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. In Kvβ2-null mice, Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 localize normally in cerebellar basket cell terminals and the juxtaparanodal region of myelinated nerves. Moreover, normal glycosylation patterns are observed for Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 in whole brain lysates. Thus, loss of the chaperone-like activity does not appear to account for the phenotype of Kvβ2-null mice, which include reduced life spans, occasional seizures, and cold swim-induced tremors similar to that observed in Kv1.1-null mice. Mice expressing Kvβ2, mutated at a site (Y90F) that abolishes AKR-like catalytic activity in other family members, have no overt phenotype. We conclude that Kvβ2 contributes to regulation of excitability in vivo, although not directly through either chaperone-like or typical AKR catalytic activity. Rather, Kvβ2 relies upon as yet unidentified mechanisms in the regulation of K+ channel and/or oxidoreductive functions.

Subsequent cloning of the Kvβ2 homologs, Kvβ1and Kvβ3, revealed a conserved core region and variable N-terminal domains that may contain a ball-and-chain motif conferring rapid inactivation to even noninactivating Kv1 α subunits (5.Rettig J.

The observed alterations in K+ channel α subunit inactivation are likely to be a primary function of the Kvβ1 and Kvβ3 gene products. Mice rendered deficient in Kvβ1 by gene targeting display reduced K+ current inactivation, frequency-dependent spike broadening, and slow after-hyperpolarization in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (8.Giese K.P.

In heterologous expression systems it does, however, increase the rate of rapid inactivation of endogenously inactivating Kv1.4 currents (10.McCormack K. McCormack T. Tanouye M. Rudy B. Stühmer W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Kvβ2 also induces small shifts in the activation threshold of Kv1.5 currents (11.Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Graack H.R. Pongs O. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and alters inactivation rates when coassembled in combination with Kvβ1 subunits (10.McCormack K. McCormack T. Tanouye M.

In addition to the relatively restricted effects observed on K+ channel gating, Kvβ2 has also been reported to increase the amplitudes of Kv1.4 and Kv1.3 currents in Xenopus oocytes (4.McCormack T.

In cultured mammalian cells the absence of Kvβ2 results in unglycosylated forms of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 that are not efficiently transported to the membrane surface, leading Shi et al. (2.Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) to propose that Kvβ2 facilitates the glycosylation of Kv1 α subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby promoting the trafficking of Kvα/β complexes from the endoplasmic reticulum to the surface cell membrane. Whether Kvβ2 is required for trafficking of these Kvα species in vivo is unknown.Given their homology to other AKR1 superfamily members, including the conservation of nucleotide-cofactor binding and catalytic residues, additional physiological functions for Kvβ2 have been proposed relating to potential oxidoreductive and/or catalytic roles (14.McCormack T. McCormack K. Cell. 1994; 79: 1133-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 15.Chouinard S.W. Wilson G.F. Schlimgen A.K. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6763-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Interestingly, coexpression of Kvβ2 in cultured mammalian cells confers oxygen sensitivity to Kv4.2 but not Kv1 channels (16.Pérez-Garcia M.T. López-López J.R. González C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the structural and potential functional similarities between Kvβ2 and other AKR superfamily members, including cofactor binding, was confirmed through x-ray crystallographic resolution (17.Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Kvβ2 binds NADPH with an affinity comparable with that found for other AKR enzymes but with only 10-fold lower affinity for NADH; NADPH and NADH bind more tightly than NADP+ and NAD+, respectively, indicating that Kvβ2 would be more likely to function as a reductase than an oxidase (18.Liu S.Q. Jin H.J. Zacarias A. Srivastava S. Bhatnagar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11812-11820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); cofactor binding is not a prerequisite for multimer formation. It therefore remains possible that Kvβ2 is an oxidoreductive enzyme or acts as a metabolic sensor with regard to cofactor binding and interaction with at least some Kvα subunits. Despite much research into the expression of Kvβ2 in heterologous systems, little is known regarding the function of Kvβ2in vivo. The human Kvβ2 locus (KCNAB2) maps to chromosome 1p36, where it has been implicated in complex syndromes that include seizures (19.Schultz D. Litt M. Smith L. Thayer M. McCormack K. Genomics. 1996; 31: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20.Heilstedt H.A. Burgess D.L. Anderson A.E. Chedrawi A. Tharp B. Lee O. Kashork C.D. Starkey D.E. Wu Y.Q. Noebels J.L.

Epilepsia. 2001; 42: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).To investigate the possible functions of Kvβ2 in the intact mammalian nervous system, we used gene targeting in embryonic stem cells to generate Kvβ2-null or Y90F point mutant (which should specifically inhibit typical AKR catalytic activity) mice. We conclude that Kvβ2 plays an important role in modulating excitability in vivobut that this role does not rely upon Kvβ2 enhancement of Kv1 α subunit trafficking and/or targeting. We also find that the primary physiological role of Kvβ2 does not appear to take place through typical AKR-like oxidoreductive catalysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of the Kvβ2-null Targeting VectorThe Kvβ2-null targeting vector was constructed from a genomic clone isolated from a 129/SvEv genomic library (Stratagene number 946305) as diagrammed in Fig. 1A. Exon/intron boundaries of mouse Kvβ2 as determined by our sequencing do not correspond with those previously reported for 129/SvJ mice (21.Autieri M.V. Kozak C.A. Cohen J.A. Prystowsky M.B. Genomics. 1995; 25: 282-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), but do correspond with those reported for exons 5–9 of the human Kvβ2 gene locus (GenBankTM accession number NT_019265.6). The targeting vector contained a 2.5-kb 5′ arm of homology (XhoI-NsiI fragment) and a 3-kb 3′ arm of homology (SalI-BglII fragment). The internal NsiI-SalI fragment containing genomic DNA corresponding to exons 7–9 of human Kvβ2 was deleted such that any potential transcript would have a minimal deletion of 176 nucleotides of coding sequence; PGKneobpA (22.Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar) was inserted in place of the deleted fragment. MC1-thymidine kinase was attached at the 3′ end for negative selection against nonhomologous recombinants.Construction of the Y90F Point Mutant Knock-in VectorGenomic DNA encoding exon 5 (… agATG GCA GAG CAC CTA ATG ACC TTG GCC TAC GAT AAT GGC ATC AAC CTG TTC GAT ACG GCG GAG GTC TAC GCT GCT GGA Aagtacgtagt. . . . .) and residue Tyr90 was isolated from the same genomic library. Using the AccI site (GTC TAC) overlapping Tyr90(TAC) and a SnaB1 site in the 3′ intervening sequence (tactgta), double-stranded oligonucleotides containing three substitutions (underlined) were introduced into exon 5 (GTC TTC GCCGCG GGA Aagtacgta) mutating Tyr90 to Phe90 while removing the AccI site and introducing a SacII site. A 1.9-kb SalI/XhoI PGKneo fragment flanked by loxP sequences (gift of A. Nagy) was then cloned into the XhoI site ∼100 nucleotides downstream of the 3′ end of exon 5. The final targeting vector consisted of a contiguous 5.7-kb BamHI/BglII genomic fragment interrupted at the XhoI site with the floxed PGK-neo, with a 1.3-kb 5′ arm of homology containing the point mutation and the 4.4-kb 3′ arm of homology (see Fig. 1B).Creation of Targeted Embryonic Stem Cells and Kvβ2-null and Y90F MiceAB-1 ES cells (obtained from Allan Bradley) were electroporated with 10 μg of linearized targeting vector and treated with G418 (350 μg/ml) and FIAU (200 nm) for selection of doubly resistant colonies. Southern blot analyses were performed as described (23.Ramı́rez-Solis R. Davis A.C. Bradley A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 855-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). For the ES cells transfected with the Kvβ2-null targeting vector, DNA was digested with BglII (for 5′ probe) or HindIII (for neo probe). For the ES cells transfected with the Kvβ2-Y90F targeting vector, DNA was digested with BamHI (for the 3′ probe) or AccI and AccI/SacII (for the neo probe). Excision of the PGKneo insert was induced through transient transfection of CMV-Cre recombinase (pBS185; Invitrogen), and recombinant clones were identified through Southern blot analysis utilizing the same 0.8-kb AvrII/SalI 3′ probe by comparison of BamHI versus BamHI/SacII digestion as well as by PCR using primers corresponding to genomic DNA sequences 5′ of exon 5 and 3′ of the XhoI site in intron 5.Targeted ES cell clones were injected into C57BL/6J (B6) blastocysts (University of Wisconsin Transgenic Core Facility) to generate chimeric founder mice. Founder mice were bred to inbred B6 mice to generate F1 heterozygotes, which were then bred together to generate mutant mice on a mixed B6×129 genetic background. The Kvβ2-null and Y90F point mutant mice described in this report have been given the strain designations Kcnab2tm1Mes and Kcnab2tm2Mes, respectively.Survival AnalysisAll Kvβ2-null, Y90F, and heterozygous mice that were generated through the F2 and F3 generations (in mixed B6×129 backgrounds) were included in the survival analysis. Mice that were alive as of an arbitrary end date (January 29, 2001) or were removed for various reasons (for example, use in experiments) were treated as censored data. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for both groups and compared using the logrank test.Myoclonus Score Following Cold Water SwimMice were placed in a tank of 17 °C water for 2 min. The mice were then placed in a dry cage for observation by a scorer blinded to the genotype. The myoclonus score is the number of whole body jerks observed during the first 2 min post-swim. Kvβ2-null mice and wild type littermates were 42–58 days old, Kvβ2-Y90F and wild type littermates were 50–53 days old, and Kv1.1-null mice (24.Smart S.L. Lopantsev V. Zhang C.L. Robbins C.A. Wang H.

For anti-Kv1.2, the polyclonal antibody was generated in rabbit against residues 417–499 of rat brain Kv1.2 (Alomone Labs; catalog number APC-010), and the monoclonal antibody was generated in mouse against residues 428–499 of rat heart Kv1.2 (88 kDa) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; 1:100, catalog number 05-408) (2.Shi G.

For anti-Kvβ1, the monoclonal antibody to Kvβ1 (K9/40.1) was a gift from James Trimmer (SUNY Stony Brook) (25.Bekele-Arcuri Z. Matos M.F. Manganas L. Strassle B.W. Monaghan M.M. Rhodes K.J.

For anti-Kvβ2, the monoclonal antibody to Kvβ2 (K17/70) was a gift from James Trimmer (SUNY Stony Brook) (25.Bekele-Arcuri Z. Matos M.F. Manganas L. Strassle B.W. Monaghan M.M. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S.

For ECL, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (Pierce; 1:2000) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse (Pierce; catalog number 31450) were used.ImmunofluorescenceSciatic NerveBriefly, the sciatic nerves were immersion fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and then teased into single fibers on glass slides and processed for Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kvβ2 immunofluoresence as previously described (27.Zhou L. Zhang C.L. Messing A. Chiu S.Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7200-7215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal images of immunofluorescence were captured using a Bio-Rad confocal microscope (MRC 1024). The published images were obtained by plane projection from 4–10 consecutive z-section images with 0.2-μm z-increments. During image capturing, the settings on the microscope (background, gain, and axis) were adjusted so that the peak readings at the juxtaparanode were always lower than 256 (the maximum value) to minimize saturation. Spatial distribution of the Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 immunofluorescence intensity along single fibers at the nodal region was quantitatively measured along a fixed length (60 μm) using MetaMorph software. The line scan function was used with a setting of 6 × 60 pixels (thickness × length).CerebellumAll mice were anesthetized deeply with avertin and transcardially perfused with 60 ml of chilled fixative containing 15% picric acid, 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate-buffered saline buffer. The brain was removed and immersed in the same fixative for another 3–4 h at 4 °C. After several washes, the fixed brain was cyroprotected in 30% sucrose solution in 0.1m phosphate-buffered saline overnight. Frozen sagittal sections of the cerebellum were cut at 50 μm and permeabilized in blocking solution for 2 h with 5–10% goat serum, 0.4% Triton X-100, and 0.02% sodium azide in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline. The subsequent staining and imaging were similar to that described above for sciatic nerves.Western Blot Analysis of Kvα SubunitsAge-matched littermate or C57BL/6J mice were used as wild type controls. For Western blot analysis of Kvα subunits, whole brains were removed, washed several times with ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA) and then homogenized with 10–15 strokes in a glass homogenizer in buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml antipain, and 10 μg of benzamide as protease inhibitors. The extracts were sonicated for 1 min and then spun in a microcentrifuge for 4 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was quickly mixed with 5× sample buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 500 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) SDS, 0.5%, bromphenol blue, 50%, glycerol) in a 4:1 ratio and boiled for 2 min. The protein concentration in each sample was quantified by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and the volume of each sample was adjusted so that all were at 20 mg/ml.The proteins were separated on a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad; 0.45 μm). The membranes were blocked in TBS-Tween (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and then incubated in primary antibodies (monoclonal anti-Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.4, used at 1:1000, 1:500, and 1:1000, respectively). The membranes were then washed four times for 5 min before incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce; 1:3000 dilution). After washing, the membranes were developed with enhanced chemoluminescence (Pierce) for 1 min and then exposed to film. To verify equal loading of lanes, the membranes were stained following ECL with Ponceau S for 5 min, followed by fixation with 5% glacial acetic acid.For analysis of glycosylation status of Kvα subunits, the brain extracts were incubated overnight at 37 °C with either N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; 20 units/ml) or endoglycosidase H (EndoH; 0.5 unit/ml), both purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. For PNGase treatment, the brain extract was first diluted 1:10 with lysis buffer without SDS.For semi-quantitative analysis of Kvα subunit expression, binding of primary antibodies were detected using 125I-labeled protein A. After transfer of proteins, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in TBS-Tween with 5% dried milk, washed, incubated with primary antibodies as described above, and then washed again. The membrane was next incubated with goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibodies, depending on the species of the primary antibody. After another wash, 0.5 μCi of 125I-conjugated protein A was diluted in 10 ml of block solution and incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. Finally the membrane was washed five times for 5 min, air-dried, and then wrapped in plastic and mounted in a PhosphorImager cassette. The upper and lower bands, which correspond to the mature and core glycosylated forms (see below), were analyzed together with background subtraction. The ratio of upper band to lower band in each sample was calculated directly.Western Blot Analysis of Kvβ SubunitsFor Western blot analysis of Kvβ subunits, whole brains were homogenized in 0.3 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mm sodium fluoride homogenization buffer, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and cellular debris, and the supernatant was used for Western blot analysis. Protein content was assayed by the Bradford assay. The samples of supernatant (10 μl, containing 50 μg of protein) were boiled in SDS sample buffer containing 63 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue for 10 min. The proteins were then separated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride-plus membrane. The membranes were blocked in 3% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) overnight at 4 °C and probed with monoclonal anti-Kvβ1 (K9/40.1) or anti-Kvβ2 (K17/70) antibodies (25.Bekele-Arcuri Z.

Three days later oocyte membranes were depolarized to +50 mV from a holding potential of −90 mV using standard two-microelectrode recording techniques as described elsewhere (10.McCormack K. McCormack T. Tanouye M. Rudy B. Stühmer W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we describe the generation of Kvβ2-null and Kvβ2-Y90F mutant mice to examine the in vivo function of Kvβ2, a major auxiliary subunit of Kv1α channels in the mammalian nervous system. Kvβ2-null mice display cold swim-induced tremors, occasional seizures, and reduced life spans similar to that observed in Kv1.1-null mice. We therefore examined whether the absence of Kvβ2 might result in a failure of Kv1α subunit surface expression in vivo. We turned our attention to the cerebellar basket cell terminals and the paranodal regions of myelinated fibers, both of which are normally characterized by a striking colocalization of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kvβ2 gene products but relatively free of Kvβ1 (33.Rhodes K.J.

Scherer S.S. J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 333-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, disruption of a putative chaperone-like role of Kvβ2 might be expected to produce an obvious impact at these two regions.Kv1 Channel Surface ExpressionThe ability of Kvβ1 subunits to confer enhanced surface expression of Kv1α K+channels in cultured cell lines was first demonstrated by Shi et al. (2.Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In that study, Western blot analysis indicated that expression of Kv1.2 in COS cells resulted in production of 63-kDa (unglycosylated) and 66-kDa (glycosylated) bands of roughly equal intensity, with a significant amount of Kv1.2 immunoreactivity retained in an intracellular compartment (likely to be endoplasmic reticulum). When coexpressed with Kvβ2, most of the Kv1.2 was in the glycosylated 66-kDa band, and stronger Kv1.2 immunoreactivity was observed at the cell surface. Shi et al. (2.Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) therefore proposed that the primary physiological role of Kvβ2 is to facilitate the folding, glycosylation, and trafficking of Kv1 proteins to the cell membrane. More recently, Campomanes et al. (35.Campomanes C.R. Carroll K.I. Manganas L.N. Hershberger M.E. Gong B. Antonucci D.E. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. December 17, 2001; 277: 8298-8305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) found that Kvβ subunits promoted axonal targeting of transfected Kv1.2 in primary neuronal cultures.In contrast to the studies carried out in cultured cells, the absence of Kvβ2 in vivo does not lead to a detectable retention of Kv1.1/Kv1.2 immunoreactivity in the cell bodies of the cerebellar basket cells. Furthermore, our immunofluorescence studies show that both the clusters of Kv1.1/Kv1.2 proteins at the basket cell terminal and the juxtaparanodal regions of myelinated axons are not affected in the Kvβ2-null mutants. In addition, our Western blot analysis failed to reveal accumulation of unglycosylated species for Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 in Kvβ2-null mutants, suggesting that the Kv1α subunits are glycosylated efficiently in vivo without Kvβ2. Our results are most consistent with the data of Nagaya and Papazian (36.Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3022-3027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), who found that the β2 subunit did not increase the rate or extent of Shaker protein maturation in transfected mammalian cells.We considered two ways in which a chaperone-like role of Kvβ2 might have eluded our detection. First, other Kvβ subunits such as Kvβ1 may compensate for the loss of Kvβ2. However, this appears unlikely because Kvβ1 is normally absent in the basket cell terminals and the juxtaparanodal regions of myelinated fibers, and we detected no significant up-regulation of Kvβ1 in Western blot analysis of whole brain lysates from Kvβ2-null mice. Although a third Kvβ subunit has been identified in rat brain, little is known regarding its cell specificity, level of expression, and ability to associate with or assist in trafficking of Kv1α subunits in vivo (6.Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Wunder F. Pongs O. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Second, our biogenesis analysis was performed on mice between the ages of P30–P40, and given the reduced life span of mutant mice older than 5 months, we cannot exclude the possibility that a significant biogenesis defect emerges in older mice.K+ Channel Subunit CompositionMost individual neurons expressing Kv1 channels appear to express multiple family members, and some Kv1 α subunits may facilitate efficient surface expression of heteromultimeric Kv1 channels in the absence of Kvβ2 (37.Manganas L.N. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29685-29693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For example, homotetramers of Kv1.2 and Kv1.4, but not Kv1.1, are expressed efficiently on the surface of mammalian cell lines; Kv1.1/Kv1.2 or Kv1.1/Kv1.4 heterotetramers are expressed more efficiently than Kv1.1 is by itself. Intrinsic differences in the trafficking of specific Kv1 α subunits may be regulated to some degree by Kvβ2,"

The allose-binding protein from Escherichia coli is, like other receptors in its family, composed of two α/β domains joined by a three-stranded hinge.

Together, these allow a description of the conformational changes associated with ligand binding. A few large, coupled torsional changes in the hinge strands are sufficient to generate the overall bending motion, with only minor disruption of the individual domains. Integral water molecules appear to act as structural “ball bearings” in this process. The conformational changes of the related ribose-binding protein follow a distinct pattern.

The observed differences between the two proteins can be interpreted in the context of changes in sequence and in crystal packing and provide new insights into the nature of hinge bending motion in this class of periplasmic binding proteins. Conformational changes play a vital role in the biological function of many proteins. The wide spectrum of conformational changes observed in crystal structures can be broadly classified as small amplitude shear motion, large amplitude hinge bending motion, or some combination of the two (1.Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 2.Gerstein M. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6739-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Shear motion generally represents the sliding movement of secondary structural elements on other parts of the tertiary structure, whereas hinge-bending motion is characterized by a few localized torsional rotations that combine to produce dramatic changes in the protein as a whole. A classic example of the involvement of hinge-bending motion in protein function is found in the periplasmic receptors of the bacterial ABC transporter systems. Such systems use the energy of ATP to carry small ligands and ions across the cytoplasmic membranes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (3.Ames G.F.-L. Mimura C.S. Shyamala V. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 75: 429-446Crossref Google Scholar, 4.Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar, 5.Boos W. Lucht J.M. Niedhart F. Ingraham R.C. Lin E.

C.1996: 1175-1209Google Scholar). A typical ABC system consists of an membrane-bound permease, an ATP-binding component, and, in most bacterial systems, a periplasmic receptor. Binding of a small molecule ligand to the periplasmic proteins favors their closure via large scale hinge-bending motions (6.Newcomer M.E. Lewis B.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13218-13222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These movements are required for productive interactions with the cognate membrane permeases and, in some cases, with membrane-bound chemotaxis receptors as well. The periplasmic sugar-binding proteins belong to a subfamily (pentose/hexose sugar receptors) of the larger family of periplasmic receptors (7.Tam R. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crystal structures of several members of this subfamily have been reported in the closed, ligand-bound form, including allose-binding protein (ALBP 1The abbreviations used are: ALBPallose-binding proteinABParabinose-binding proteinGBPglucose-galactose-binding proteinRBPribose-binding proteinr.m.s.root mean square(8.Chaudhuri B.N.

Each consists of two similar Rossmann fold domains linked by a three-stranded hinge region. The binding site is located at the domain interface; extensive hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions of the ligand with both domains of the protein stabilize the closed form. Although the periplasmic receptors can assume similar closed forms in the ligand-free state (e.g. Ref. 13.Flocco M.M. Mowbray S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8931-8936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), experimental data suggest that more open forms will predominate in the absence of ligand (6.Newcomer M.E.

Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 651-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The two domains of each open RBP were shown to move as nearly rigid bodies at the hinge that joins them; the observed structures were opened by 43, 53, and 64° with respect to the closed receptor. Most structural changes involved only a few torsional changes in the hinge segments, although some minor repacking was observed where domain-domain interactions were lost in the opened receptors. Further, the three structures represented discrete points along a conformational trajectory, thus describing the motion that should apply to ligand capture as well as ligand release into the permease. In each open form, the two domains had a similar set of packing interactions that were not present in the closed form, and that would be expected to stabilize them in preference to other possible open conformations. Here, we describe three ligand-free, open forms of a second member of the subfamily, ALBP, solved at 1.7- and 3.1-Å resolution. These structures, together with that of the closed, ligand-bound form, supply specific information on the conformational changes of ALBP. As RBP and ALBP are the most closely related members of this family (amino acid sequence identity 35%), similarities and differences could readily be analyzed and extended to give a better understanding of the motions of the family as a whole. Purified ALBP (18.Kim C. Song S. Park C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7631-7637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), concentrated to 5 mg/ml, was shipped frozen from Korea to Sweden and stored at −20 °C. Crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method (19.McPherson A.J. Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1982Google Scholar). Showers of small cubic crystals grew within 2–3 days in drops containing 2 μl of protein solution (5 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8) and 2 μl of reservoir solution, equilibrated against 20–30% monomethyl polyethylene glycol 2000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0), and 0.01 m NiCl2 at room temperature. These crystals grew slightly afterward, to a final size of ∼50 μm3. Orthorhombic crystals (100 × 100 × 50 μm3) grew after several days using 30% monomethyl polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, and 5 mm ZnSO4. The presence of divalent cations substantially improved both types of crystals. Crystals were soaked in mother liquor containing 15% glycerol for 2 min prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected from a single cubic crystal to 3.1-Å resolution using the synchrotron radiation source BW7B (λ = 0.89 Å), at the EMBL outstation (DESY, Hamburg). Data to 1.7-Å resolution were collected from an orthorhombic crystal at ID14-EH4 at ESRF, Grenoble (λ = 0.94 Å). Data were processed using DENZO (20.Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

When the ligand-bound, closed structure of ALBP had been solved and refined at 1.8-Å resolution (8.Chaudhuri B.N. Ko J. Park C. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1519-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), its domains were used as input models in AMoRe (22.Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Observed structure factors were sharpened by a B-factor of −10 Å2. An all atom model of domain 1 (residues 1–113 and 247–282) and a truncated, polyserine model of domain 2 (residues 114–246) provided solutions in rotation searches using data between 6- and 3.5-Å resolution. The fifth highest peak in the rotation search for domain 1 yielded a clear solution in the translation search, with a correlation coefficient of 0.38 and an R-factor of 45%. Phased translation function searches were then employed for domain 2, using data between 10 and 3.5 Å. The top solution, with a correlation coefficient of 0.56 and an R-factor of 39%, was the 38th peak of the original rotation search. After rigid body refinement of both domains, the correlation coefficient and R-factor were 0.63 and 36%, respectively. Clear electron density was observed at this stage (Fig. 1a), even for atoms missing from the initial model (e.g. residues 283–288 and most side chain atoms). This, together with the correct reassembly of the two domains into a contiguous protein, provided evidence that the replacement solutions were correct. The initial 3.1-Å cubic model was subjected to several cycles of positional and B-factor refinement in CNS (23.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13868) Google Scholar), alternated with manual rebuilding in the program O (25.Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M.O. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Where side chain conformation needed to be adjusted, the best fitting rotamer from the data base in O (26.Jones T.A. Thirup S. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 27.Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) was used in the electron density. 10% of the data were used to monitor R-free (28.Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar). Harmonic restraints were applied to all atoms throughout the course of refinement, and small-molecule-derived parameters were applied in all geometrical restraints (29.Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Positional refinement with subsequent grouped B-factor refinement (one B-factor for each domain) was performed initially. The average B-factor for domain 2 was high. During the later stages of CNS refinement,B-factors were refined using three groups. Residues 139–147 and 168–193, which are the least ordered (although clearly present) part of the model, constituted one group. The rest of domain 2 and the complete domain 1 comprised the other two groups. Residues 174–176 were eliminated from the refinement; these residues were visible but ill defined. The final B-factor of domain 1 in the CNS refinement was 35.7 Å2, that of the disordered region of domain 2 was 91.6 Å2, and that for the rest of domain 2 was 63.5 Å2. Superior results were obtained utilizing TLS refinement in REFMAC5 (30.Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar) prior to isotropicB-factor refinement. After this treatment, the averageB-factors were reduced to 11.6 Å2 for domain 1 and 12.2 Å2 for domain 2, and the electron density for domain 2 was greatly improved. Final electron density in the hinge is shown in Fig. 1b. Electron density for residues 168–194 and 210–218 is still poorer than that for the rest of the molecule, although the main features are still quite clear. Residues 210–218 also show somewhat weaker electron density than the average, but again, their position is clear. Thirteen water molecules were modeled in the electron density, four of them in the hinge region. While we would not normally place water molecules at this resolution, both electron density and local protein structure argued strongly for their presence here. Six of these were also present in the high resolution structure of the closed ligand-bound form. At the N terminus, there was strong positive electron density, suggesting the presence of two or more metal ions, although their position on or near the 3-fold axis made their exact placement difficult. Two Ni2+ ions were eventually modeled, with occupancies of 0.33 each, and obtained B-factors of 51.7 and 52.9 Å2 in the refinement. At the same time, theR-factor dropped from 24.3 to 21.8, and R-free dropped from 28.8 to 27.2. We cannot show that this is the correct chemical model, but it appears to be more a accurate description than simply omitting the ions from the model and calculations. Statistics relating to the final model are summarized in Table II. The Ramachandran plot had nine outliers. Two of these, residues Asp91 and Asp227, are outliers in the entire subfamily of periplasmic sugar-binding proteins. The rest were close to the allowed regions of a stringent boundary Ramachandran plot (31.Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A.

Only nine side chains have rotamer side chain fit values of >1.5 Å, consistent with a well behaved structure (32.Zou J.-Y. Mowbray S.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Initial attempts to solve the structure using the open form described above failed. An all atom model of domain 2 from the closed form of ALBP was then used for the rotation search. The highest peak gave a correlation coefficient of 0.19 and anR-factor of 53% when entered in the translation search. This solution, combined with the second best solution for domain 1 in the rotation search, yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.32 and anR-factor of 48% after rigid body fitting. These two solutions, which represented a contiguous protein, were then joined together to search for the second molecule. The original solution appeared as the top peak in rotation/translation searches. This molecule was fixed, and the second peak of the rotation search gave a good translation solution. A correlation coefficient of 0.44 and anR-factor of 44% were obtained after rigid body fitting, which allowed the two domains of each molecule to move independently. Five cycles of simulated annealing and individual B-factor refinement of the initial 1.7-Å model, alternated with manual rebuilding, were carried out in CNS. A random set of 4% of the data was used in the R-free calculation. The final refinement of the structure was carried out in REFMAC5. Water molecules were added using wARP (37.Perrakis A. Sixma T.K.

These do not seem to have any functional role and probably serve to stabilize the crystal packing. Statistics relating to the final model are summarized in Table II. Final electron density in the hinge is shown in Fig. 1c. As for the 3.1-Å structure, Asp91 and Asp227 were outliers in the Ramachandran plot; the others were different in the various structures.

Rotations, translations, and axes describing domain movements were calculated using the program FIT. 2Program available on the World Wide Web at bioinfo1.mbfys.lu.se/∼guoguang/fit.html. Buried surface area was calculated with the algorithm of Lee and Richards (41.Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5346) Google Scholar), using a 1.4-Å probe. Figures were prepared with the programs O, Molray (42.Harris M. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1201-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and Molscript (43.Kraulis P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). The structures of three open, ligand-free forms of ALBP were obtained using molecular replacement, one refined at 3.1-Å resolution in a cubic space group, and two others found in the same asymmetric unit of an orthorhombic space group and refined to 1.7-Å resolution. Statistics describing the final structures are presented in Table II, and samples of electron density are shown in Fig. 1. Like the previously solved structure of closed, ligand-bound ALBP (8.Chaudhuri B.N. Ko J. Park C. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1519-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), those of the ligand-free protein feature two α/β (Rossmann fold) domains, each of which is composed of two distinct segments of polypeptide chain (Fig. 2, a and b). Strands B1–B5 and B11, together with α-helices H1–H4 and H10, are found in domain 1 (residues 1–112 and 247–282). Domain 2 includes α-helices H5–H9 and β-strands B6–B10 and B12 (residues 113–246 and 283–288). Three connections result between the two domains (Fig. 3), which are designated here as connection I (residues 111–113), connection II (246–247), and connection III (281–284). The first two are β-α crossovers, which are more buried in the structure, while the third is a β-β crossover that lies diagonally across them.Figure 3Schematic diagram of the connectivity in the three-stranded hinge of ALBP. Two key water molecules (W1 and W2) are shown as circles, and their hydrogen-bonding interactions are shown as broken lines. The position of a third water (W3) that is only observed in ligand-bound ALBP is also indicatedView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The structures of domain I and domain II are similar in all ligand-bound and ligand-free forms of ALBP. The ligand-free proteins are more open, as a result of largely rigid body rotations of the domains, using their three connections as a hinge. The 3.1-Å structure is opened by 37° compared with the closed form, while the two 1.7-Å forms are opened by 43 and 33° in the A and B molecules of the Protein Data Bank file (1GUD), respectively. For convenience in the following discussion, we will refer to the four conformational forms of ALBP as closed, O1 (33°), O2 (37°), and O3 (43°). The three very similar rotation axes that apply to the open forms of ALBP are shown in Figs. 4 and5. The motions of O2 and O3 are essentially pure rotations about similar axes that pass close to two hinge residues: 113 (from connection I) and 246 (from connection II). The axis associated with O1 is parallel to the others but shifted by ∼2.5 Å toward residue 246; this motion also includes an ∼1-Å screw component along the rotation axis.Figure 5Crystal packing for the O2 structure.One molecule is shown in dark gray, and the four symmetry-related molecules in the crystal packing that are closest to domain 2 are colored pale gray. The three observed axes of ALBP opening are indicated (marked O1, O2, and O3). The axes of libration for the two domains (indicated by L1 andL2, respectively), as suggested from TLS refinement, are also shown, with lengths proportional to the magnitude of the apparent motion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Opening of ALBP is the result of coupled rotations around main chain dihedrals in the three interdomain connections. Movements in the three hinge segments are largest at residues 111−112, 245−247, 283−284 (Table III). The movements in connections I and II determine the direction of rotation, while those in connection III seem to be simply those required to accommodate changes in the other two segments. This is perhaps not surprising when the relatively exposed location of connection III is considered; it will not have the same constraints within the tertiary structure as the other two connections. Although it is clear that that the changes in φ or ψ increase with the degree of opening, the relationship is not a linear one (the bonds that most closely follow a linear pattern are φ112, ψ245, and φ246). This serves as a reminder that the different parts of the protein must work together; conformational changes depend on a number of bonds rotating in a cooperative fashion.Table IIIChanges in backbone torsion angles in the hinge connections of ALBP and RBPConnection Iφ111ψi111φ112ψ112φ113ψ113ALBP O1 (33 °)−3.20.7−3.26.69.4−4.9 O2 (37 °)−9.0−16.015.619.60.1−13.3 O3 (43 °)−7.6−17.327.96.48.6−6.0φ102ψ102φ103ψ103φ104ψ104RBP rO1 (43 °)−17.4−10.1−9.17.90.311.7 rO2 (50 °)−6.83.9−21.927.0−6.9−7.5 rO3 (64 °)−11.02.2−18.131.8−3.1−7.7Connection IIφ244ψ244φ245ψ245φ246ψ246φ247ψ247ALBP O1 (33 °)−0.8−6.22.41.9310.88.2−37.54.1 O2 (37 °)−2.6−9.35.8−12.932.2−20.3−16.9−6.4 O3 (43 °)1.50.05.9−31.650.8−15.9−43.0−15.5φ232ψ232φ233ψ233φ234ψ234φ235ψ235RBP rO1 (43 °)0.3−15.218.0−0.713.9−2.0−23.77.9 rO2 (50 °)−12.3−21.628.2−12.927.6−12.1−25.2−1.1 rO3 (64 °)−12.0−16.125.0−11.533.5−18.6−29.918.7Connection IIIφ281ψ281φ282ψ282φ283ψ283φ284ψ284ALBP O1 (33 °)−5.9−3.23.97.4−25.71.6−25.611.8 O2 (37 °)3.4−7.48.40.0−31.05.8−29.6−4.2 O3 (43 °)−28.3−9.81.513.5−35.2−3.7−21.5−8.4φ263ψ263φ264ψ264φ265ψ265φ266ψ266RBP rO1 (43 °)−45.2−5.3−5.7−10.235.2−10.4−20.5−17.5 rO2 (50 °)−13.4−7.8−8.1−2.811.5−6.9−23.8−2.8 rO3 (64 °)−12.24.0−12.2−6.916.7−3.5−28.1−19.6Each open form is identified by a label (e.g. O1), as well as the relative degree of opening in parentheses.

https://openalex.org/W2002352626,"Resonance Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies have been used to study theaa3-type cytochrome c oxidase and the Y280H mutant from Paracoccus denitrificans. The stability of the binuclear center in the absence of the Tyr280-His276 cross-link is not compromised since heme a3 retains the same proximal environment, spin, and coordination state as in the wild type enzyme in both the oxidized and reduced states. We observe two C-O modes in the Y280H mutant at 1966 and 1975 cm−1. The 1975 cm−1 mode is assigned to a γ-form and represents a structure of the active site in which CuB exerts a steric effect on the heme a3-bound CO. Therefore, the role of the cross-link is to fix CuB in a certain configuration and distance from heme a3, and not to allow histidine ligands to coordinate to CuB rather than to heme a3, rendering the enzyme inactive, as proposed recently (Das, T. K., Pecoraro, C., Tomson, F. L., Gennis, R. B., and Rousseau, D. L. (1998)Biochemistry 37, 14471–14476). The results provide solid evidence that in the Y280H mutant the catalytic site retains its active configuration that allows O2 binding to hemea3. Oxygenated intermediates are formed by mixing oxygen with the CO-bound mixed-valence wild type and Y280H enzymes with similar Soret maxima at 438 nm.

The enzyme contains four redox-centers; two hemes a and three associated copper atoms. Electron injection from cytochromec to the homo-dinuclear copper center, CuA, is followed by intramolecular electron transfer, via the low-spin hemea, to the binuclear center which contains a high spin hemea3 and a CuB atom. The latter two species serve as the catalytic site where O2 is reduced to H2O. The free energy released in the electron-transfer reactions is conserved as an electrochemical proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane and is used ultimately for ATP synthesis. cytochromec oxidase mixed valence resonance Raman Fourier transform infrared The crystal structures of mammalian CcO (7.Tsukihara T.

The properties of the binuclear center are of particular importance, since the heme a3/CuBcenter is the site where dioxygen reduction takes place and is the most probable site of the proton-electron coupling (2.Babcock G.T. Wikström M. Nature. 1992; 356: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). One of the unique properties of the binuclear center that were determined by the crystal structure is the covalent link of Tyr280 with one of the three histidine ligands of CuB, namely His276. (If not stated otherwise, we adopt the residue numbering of P. denitrificans.) This specific tyrosine which is located at the end of the proton K-channel is highly conserved among the heme-copper oxidases and since its discovery it has been proposed to posses an important structural as well as functional role. On the basis of the properties of the Y → F mutant ofRhodobacter sphaeroides, analyzed by resonance Raman spectroscopy (RR), Rousseau and co-workers (12.Das T.K. Pecoraro C. Tomson F.L. Gennis R.B. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14471-14476Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) proposed that the tyrosine-histidine cross-linking stabilizes the binuclear center. They suggested that in the absence of the His-Tyr cross-link one of the histidines normally bound to CuB coordinates to the hemea3, leaving the binuclear center severely disrupted, and rendering the enzyme inactive. Based on the crystal structure of bovine CcO, Yoshikawa and co-workers (9.Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P. Mizushima T.

Moreover, other groups have suggested that the tyrosine can serve as a hydrogen atom donor during the cytochrome oxidase/O2 reaction (3.Michel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 2000; 290: 1588-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) proposed that Tyr280 is the source for both the proton and the electron required in the O-O bond cleavage, and Michel and co-workers (15.MacMillan F. Kannt A. Behr J. Prisner T. Michel H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9179-91884Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) proposed that the EPR signal (giso ∼ 2.0055) they observed in the cytochrome aa3/H2O2 (P. denitrificans) reaction originated from the cross-linked tyrosine. Structural information of the heme-CuB center have been determined from studies of the CO-bound adducts (16–28).

The two major conformers found are termed as α- and β-forms and although their functional significance and the origin for the splitting have not been established, it has been demonstrated that in the α-form the frequencies of the ν(Fe-CO) and ν(C-O) deviate from the inverse linear curve that exists between the frequencies of these two modes in histidine-coordinated heme proteins, while in the β-form those frequencies are placed on the curve (17.Wang J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13195-13200Google Scholar). Recently, from the observed pH-dependent conformational changes in the binuclear site it was postulated that the different structures result from a change in the position of the CuB atom with respect to the CO due to the presence of one or more ionizable groups (23.Das T.K. Tomson F.K. Gennis R.B. Gordon M. Rousseau D.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2039-2045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was suggested that the possible candidates are the cross-linked, conserved tyrosine that is adjacent to the oxygen-binding pocket or one of the histidines that coordinate CuB. In an effort to gain additional information on the role of Tyr280 in the catalytic function of CcO we have characterized the wild type and histidine mutant (Y280H) of CcO fromP. denitrificans in the oxidized, reduced, and CO-bound forms by optical absorption, RR, and FTIR spectroscopies. Our studies show that the CuB modification by the Y280H mutant results in only slight perturbation of the formyl group of hemea3. Therefore, the role of the cross-link is not to allow His276 (His240 in bovine, His284 in Rb. sphaeroides) to coordinate to CuB instead of the heme iron atom, as previously suggested (12.Das T.K. Pecoraro C. Tomson F.L. Gennis R.B. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14471-14476Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but to hold CuB in a certain configuration and distance from heme a3. Without the cross-linking of Tyr280 and His276, the heme pocket retains its active configuration that allows O2 binding to hemea3. Upon direct mixing of O2 to the CO-bound mixed-valence wild-type and Y280H enzymes, oxygenated species with similar Soret maxima at 438 nm are formed, which decay to the resting form of the enzymes. Wild-type and mutant CcO was purified from P. denitrificans according to published procedures (42.Hendler R.W. Pardhasaradhi K. Reynafarje B. Ludwig B. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 43.Pfitzner U. Odenwald A. Ostermann T. Weingard L. Ludwig B. Richter O.-M. H. J. Bioenerg.

Richter O.-M. H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mammalian CcO was isolated from beef hearts (44.Varotsis C. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The samples were concentrated to 100–150 μm in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% dodecyl β-d-maltoside and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. The fully reduced CO derivative was prepared by flushing CO gas anaerobically to dithionite-reduced enzyme. The mixed-valence CO-bound enzyme was prepared by exposing an anaerobic solution of the resting enzyme to CO for 10 h. RR spectra were obtained from 30 to 40 μm samples in an anaerobic cylindrical quartz spinning cell. The RR spectra were acquired by using a SPEX 1877 triplemate with an EG&G (model 1530-CUV-1024S) CCD detector. A Coherent Innova K-90 Krypton ion laser was used to provide the excitation wavelength of 413.1 nm. A Coherent 590 dye laser connected with a Coherent Innova 200 argon laser was used to provide the excitation wavelength of 431 nm. The power incident on the CcO sample was typically 4–6 mW. FTIR spectra were obtained from 200 to 300 μm samples with a Bruker Equinox 55 FTIR spectrometer equipped with liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector. The samples were loaded anaerobically into a cell with CaF2 windows and a 0.025-mm spacer. The spectra were obtained as difference, using the buffer as background, and each spectrum is the average of 1000 scans. The spectral resolution used for the FTIR measurements was 2 cm−1 for the wild-type CO spectrum and 4 cm−1 for the Y280H mutant, respectively. Optical absorbance spectra were recorded before and after FTIR and Raman measurements to assess sample stability with a PerkinElmer Life Science Lamda 20 UV-visible spectrometer. The optical absorption spectra of resting (as isolated) and fully reduced aa3 from P. denitrificansdisplay maxima at 423 and 598 nm in resting form (Fig. 1A, trace a), and at 444 and 605 nm in the reduced form (Fig. 1A, trace b). The difference CO-bound-reduced spectrum displays a positive band at 430 nm and a shoulder at 416 nm with a trough at 449 nm (Fig. 1A, trace c). The optical spectrum of the resting Y280H mutant shown in Fig. 1B (trace a) shows in addition to the 423-nm band a shoulder at 441 nm in the Soret region and an increased absorption of the 604-nm band. This indicates that a sizeable percentage of heme a(∼30%) is reduced in the mutant. Addition of dithionite to Y280H (Fig. 1B, trace b) shifts the maxima at 441 and 604 nm, consistent with the maxima of the fully reduced wild-type enzyme. The difference spectrum of the reduced CO-bound minus reduced form is characteristic of CO binding to heme a3, as denoted by the peaks at 432 and 592 nm (Fig. 1B,trace c). The high frequency region of the RR spectrum of the resting and reduced wild-type, which are shown in Fig. 2A (traces a andb), are in agreement with those previously reported for heme-copper oxidases (35.Babcock G.T.

In the spectrum of the resting enzyme, the oxidation state marker v4 is at 1371, establishing that both hemes are in the ferric (Fe3+) state. The modes at 1477 and 1498 cm−1 originating from ν3 of high-spin heme a3 and low spin heme a, respectively, indicate that both hemes are six-coordinate. This is also consistent with structural data which indicate that in this form of the enzyme heme a is coordinated by two histidine ligands and that there is a bridging ligand between heme a3 and CuB (10.Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar,11.Ostermeier C. Harrenga A. Ermler U. Michel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 1612 and 1635 cm−1 modes arise from ν10 of hemea33+and hemea3+, respectively. The 1646 and 1671 cm−1 modes have been assigned as the C=O stretching vibrations of the formyl groups (−CHO) of hemea3+ and hemea33+, respectively (39.Vamvouka M. Müller W. Ludwig B. Varotsis C. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 3030-3034Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar,40.Heibel G.E. Hildebrand P. Ludwig B. Steinrücke P. Soulimane T. Buse G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10866-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The spectrum from the fully reduced enzyme (Fig. 1A,trace b) has the oxidation state marker, ν4, at 1359 cm−1 indicating that both hemes are in the ferrous state. The modes at 1464 and 1490 cm−1 originate from the ferrous, five-coordinate high spin hemea32+and the ferrous six-coordinate low-spin heme a, respectively. The mode at 1519 originates from ν19 of hemea2+. The modes at 1569 and 1584 cm−1 originate from ν2 of hemea32+and heme a, respectively. The 1612 and 1662 have been assigned as the C=O stretching vibrations of the formyl group (−CHO) of hemea2+ and hemea32+, respectively (35.Babcock G.T. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. 3. Wiley, New York1988: 293-346Google Scholar,40.Heibel G.E. Hildebrand P. Ludwig B. Steinrücke P. Soulimane T. Buse G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10866-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The 1623 cm−1 mode arises from the C=C stretching vibration of heme a2+ and hemea32+. The spectral perturbations caused by the Y280H mutation are very limited except for the decrease in intensities of the heme a3+modes and the concomitant appearance of modes originating from a fraction of heme a2+ (Fig. 2B,trace a). The reduction of heme a is apparent from the increase in intensities of ν4 at 1356, ν11 at 1519, ν2 at 1584, ν10at 1612 cm−1, as well the decrease in intensity of the formyl stretching vibration at 1646 cm−1. All the modes associated with the high spin hemea33+are very similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. The only exception is the reduced intensity of the formyl stretching vibration at 1671 cm−1. The RR spectrum of the fully reduced Y280H enzyme (Fig. 2B,trace b) is very similar to that of the fully reduced wild-type, with the exception of the formyl vibration at 1662 cm−1 which is weaker in the mutant. No unusual stereochemical influences on heme a3are apparent in the Y280H mutant that would modify the hemea3 ligand-binding site. In addition, no evidence for any histidine coordination from CuB to hemea3 is apparent. Thus, our data do not support the conclusions of Das et al. (12.Das T.K. Pecoraro C. Tomson F.L. Gennis R.B. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14471-14476Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that, without the cross-linking of Tyr288 and His284 (R. sphaeroides residue numbering), the heme pocket becomes severely disrupted and one of the histidines bound to CuBcoordinates to heme a3, lowering its redox potential. Fig. 3 shows the low-frequency RR spectra of the fully reduced wild-type and Y280H mutant, and that of the wild-type CO-bound form. The RR spectrum of the fully reduced enzyme (trace a) is characterized by the Fe-His stretching mode at 220 cm−1 and porphyrin modes of both hemes a and a3. Very similar spectra were obtained for the Y280H mutant as shown in trace b. The Fe-His stretching mode is 6 cm−1 higher in P. denitrificans than it is in CcO (36.Kitagawa T. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. 3. Wiley, New York1988: 97Google Scholar). The binding of CO to hemea32+is accompanied by the disappearance of the Fe-His stretching vibration at 220 cm−1 and of the porphyrin mode at 369 cm−1(trace c). In the 400–600 cm−1region of the RR spectrum of the CO complex, one frequency for ν(Fe-CO) is detected at 517 cm−1. Assignment of this frequency is confirmed by isotope (13CO) replacement experiment (trace d), where the corresponding line appears at 513 cm−1, close to the value expected for a two-harmonic oscillator between iron and CO. The difference spectrum (trace e) confirms the above assignment. In the13CO-bound adduct we also detect a line at 559 cm−1. Although the presence of a porphyrin mode at ∼580 cm−1 partially obscures band assignment with12CO in this region, the difference spectrum shows that the 559 cm−1 band shifts to 573 cm−1 when the experiment is repeated with 12CO. We assign the 573 cm−1 mode to the Fe-C-O bending mode δ(Fe-C-O). The frequencies of the 517 and 573 cm−1 modes are similar to those that have been reported for the aa3-type oxidases from beef heart (16.Argade P.V. Ching Y.C. Rousseau D. Science. 1984; 225: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), R. sphaeroides (17.Wang J. Takahashi S. Hosler P.H. Mitchell D.M. Ferguson-Miller S. Gennis R.B. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9819-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), andaa3-600 from Bacillus subtilis (21.Varotsis C. Vamvouka M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 7670-7673Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The increased frequency of the Fe-His mode we observe in theaa3 from P. denitrificans can be attributed to the strength of the H-bond of the proximal His411 ligand to Gly387 (41.Lauraeus M. Wikström M. Varotsis C. Tecklenburg M.J. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10054-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). From the model compound work, the complex with a weaker (or absent) hydrogen bond to the proximal His is expected to have the weaker Fe-His bond and the lower frequency vibration (36.Kitagawa T. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. 3. Wiley, New York1988: 97Google Scholar). The observation of the Fe-His at 220 cm−1 in conjunction with the high frequency data further supports our conclusion that hemea32+in the Y280H mutant is five-coordinated, high-spin, and the proximal environment of hemea32+in the mutant behaves in a manner analogous to the wild type. Since The Fe-His411forms the only covalent linkage between the five-coordinate hemea3 and the protein, protein structural changes should be manifested through this bond. From the absence of such changes in the proximal environment of hemea32+, any protein structural change due to the mutation is not widespread but is more localized in the CuB environment. Structural information such as the geometry of the bound CO to the heme and its interactions with CuB has been determined from the vibrational modes involving the CO. Although the ν(Fe-CO) and δ(Fe-C-O) we have observed is similar to otheraa3-type oxidases, theIδ/Iν ∼ 0.25 we observe is low compared with those of CcO and R. sphaeroides aa3-type oxidase (Iδ/Iν = 0.43) and significantly higher than that of cytochromebo3 (20.Wang J. Ching Y-C. Takahashi S. Rousseau D.L. Hill J.J. Rumbley J. Gennis R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 3390-3391Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Iδ/Iν = 0.1). It has been argued that a highIδ/Iν is an indication of a strong interaction between the CO and CuB. Consequently, our data suggest that the Fe … CuBdistance is longer in our case. However, despite the increased Fe-CuB distance we have not been able to detect a low-energy Fe-C bond (∼490 cm−1) corresponding to the high energy C-O bond (∼1950 cm−1) of the β-conformer. Recently, it was postulated that the two distinctly different Fe-CO modes observed in the RR of the Rb. sphaeroides spectra result from a change in the position of CuB with respect to the CO due to the presence of one or more ionizable groups in the vicinity of the binuclear center (23.Das T.K. Tomson F.K. Gennis R.B. Gordon M. Rousseau D.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2039-2045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Additional experiments are in progress in our laboratory to address this possibility in theaa3 oxidase from P. denitrificans. Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectra of the CO-bound wild-type and Y280H mutant of aa3 fromP. denitrificans at room temperature. For comparison, the fully reduced aa3-CO complex of the mammalian enzyme is included (trace c). Trace a, shows that the C-O stretching modes from the P. denitrificans aa3 enzyme split into three components just as was found in the low-temperature experiments (27.Rost B. Behr J. Hellwig P. Richter O.-M. H. Ludwig B. Michel H. Mäntele W. Biochemistry. 1998; 38: 7565-7571Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The major component is centered at 1966 cm−1 (α-form) and two minors are located at 1956 cm−1 (β-form) and 1975 cm−1. The frequency of the major CO stretching mode at 1966 cm−1, which we detect in P. denitrificansis 3 cm−1 higher than the corresponding frequency of the CO-bound heme a3 of CcO (trace c).Trace b shows that the Y280H mutant has two conformers that have ν(CO) at 1966 and 1975 cm−1. Similar results have been obtained in the low-temperature experiments. 2P. Hellwig, submitted for publication. The structural basis for the splitting of the enzyme into the α- and β-forms has not been determined and no information regarding the origin of the 1975 cm−1 has been reported. The FWHM is ∼5 cm−1 in the C-O modes of the major conformer in both the mammalian and P. denitrificans enzymes indicating the absence of a wide distribution of allowed CO confo"

Loss of the synergism between Pax3 and Sox10, a high mobility group domain costimulatory factor, seems to be critical in the rapid decrease in Mitf gene expression. The Pax3 down-regulation in IL6RIL6-induced F10.9 cell is linked to growth arrest and transdifferentiation to a glial cell phenotype. IL6RIL6 stimulates the interleukin-6 family cytokine receptor gp130, leading to the rapid phosphorylation of Stat3 on tyrosine 705.

In the differentiated melanocytes, the synthesis of melanin and growth of short dendritic arborizations releasing melanosomes is increased by UV light (13.Friedmann P.S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The effect of UV light is mediated by up-regulation of α-MSH, activation the G protein-linked MC1 receptor, and stimulation of cAMP formation (for review, see Ref. 14.Abdel-Malek Z. Suzuki I. Tada A.

Another type of differentiation is seen in senescent melanocytic nevus cells in the dermis, where melanogenesis is lost, and the cells adopt the spindloid morphology and gene markers of early Schwann cells (18.Reed J.A. Finnerty B. Albino A.P. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 549-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). How the transdifferentiation process operates has not been clarified. This transdifferentiation is not seen in invasive melanoma, although cases of melanomas displaying Schwann cell-like features have been reported (19.Bosman C. Boldrini R. Corsi A. Tumori. 1995; 81: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Loss of melanogenesis and of tyrosinase can, however, be induced in melanocytes and in melanoma cells by cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (20.Swope V.B.

Garcia Borron J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). IL6-family cytokines use gp130 as a common signaling molecule, and the transcription factor Stat3 plays a major role in growth regulation, survival, and differentiation effects of these cytokines (for review, see Refs. 22.Hirano T. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 23.Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem.

This leads to activation of intracellular signaling cascades, including the Janus kinase/STAT pathway, extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (22.Hirano T. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 by Janus kinases stimulates recruitment and phosphorylation of Stat3 at tyrosine 705 (27.Zhong Z. Wen Z.L. Darnell J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar) and transfer of activated Stat3 to the nucleus. Stat3-transactivating and -signaling functions are regulated by homo- and heterodimerization with STAT family or other factors (28.Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Activated Stat3 binds to palindromic Stat response element (STAT-RE) on target genes. Optimal activation of transcription by Stat3 requires phosphorylation of Ser-727 in the Stat3a C-terminal activation domain (29.Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2062-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We previously described a model of metastatic murine melanoma cells, B16/F10.9, which respond to treatment with IL6 and soluble IL6Rα, or with the chimeric molecule IL6RIL6, by arrest of proliferation and transition to an elongated spindloid morphology (26.Chebath J.

Eisenbach L. Revel M. Chebath J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis are strongly inhibited in F10.9 melanoma cells treated with IL6RIL6 and describe the molecular mechanisms mediating the silencing of the tyrosinase gene. The major mechanism is a loss of Mitf expression and MITF promoter activity in these cells, itself caused by down-regulation of Pax3. The phosphorylation of Stat3 on Tyr-705 appears essential for the down-regulation of Pax3 and Mitf. Murine B16 melanoma cells, clone F10.9 (31.Porgador A. Feldman M. Eisenbach L. J. Immunogenet. 1989; 16: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), were obtained from Dr. L. Eisenbach (Weizmann Institute, Israel). Cells were cultured as a monolayer at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 8% fetal calf serum (Biolabs, Bet Ha Emek, Israel) supplemented with glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin and subcultured every 3 days at 10–30% confluency. The chimeric molecule interleukin-6 receptor/interleukin-6 (IL6RIL6 (26.Chebath J. Fischer D. Kumar A. Oh J.W. Kolett O. Lapidot T. Fischer M. Rose John S. Nagler A. Slavin S. Revel M. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1997; 8: 359-365PubMed Google Scholar)) was produced by recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-clone L12). The cells were grown on microcarrier beads, and the soluble IL6RIL6 protein was purified as a single 85-kDa species by immunoaffinity on an Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad) column coupled with anti-IL6R (Mc antibody 34.14) (Interpharm, Israel). To follow up the effect of IL6RIL6 at different times, cells were plated at less than 50% confluency, equal numbers of cells were plated in non-treated and treated wells, and treatment was applied about 2 h after seeding (in general 150 ng/ml IL6RIL6). Stock solutions of 20 mmforskolin (Sigma) were prepared in Me2SO.l-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-Dopa) (Sigma) stock solution was dissolved in water (80 mg/ml). For tyrosinase activity, measured as the rate of l-Dopa oxidation (32.Takahashi H. Parsons P.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 481-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33.Englaro W. Bertolotto C. Busca R. Brunet A. Pages G. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9966-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), F10.9 cells were seeded in 6-well Costar plates (5 × 105 cells/well) and cultured for the indicated times. Cells were lysed with 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1% Triton X-100. Duplicate 40-μl aliquots of 1300 × g supernatants (or lysis buffer only) were distributed on microtiter plates and supplemented with 100 μl of l-Dopa solution (2 mg/ml in phosphate buffer). The A at 570 nm was read at different times with automatic blank subtraction. Absorbance values were corrected for protein concentration. F10.9 cells were seeded at less than 50% confluency and either treated with 150 ng/ml IL6RIL6 or left untreated. Total RNA was extracted with Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cambridge) as recommended by the manufacturer. For Northern blots, RNA samples (15 μg/lane) denatured in 50% formamide and 6% formaldehyde were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels in 0.1 m MOPS/acetate buffer with 6% formaldehyde and transferred to nylon Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). DNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming with the Rediprime II kit (Amersham Biosciences) were hybridized to RNA blots in standard solutions (34.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 50% formamide and 10% dextran sulfate. For RT-PCR, RNA samples (about 2 μg/assay) were reverse-transcribed with SuperscriptII (Invitrogen) in the presence of oligo-dT in 20 μl, and 2 μl of the RT reaction was used for amplification withTaq polymerase. The primers used to amplify specific mouse cDNAs are listed below. Mitf (GenBank™ accession number NM 008601): forward (F) nucleotides 82–101, reverse (R) 1382–1401.

For amplification of mutated Stat3 cDNAs in F10.9 cells transformed with pEF-IRES-P-Stat3DN, the forward primer contained the mutated Stat3 sequence, whereas the reverse primer, AGGTACCACGCGTGAATtcacatg, overlapped the cDNA 3′ end and the plasmid sequence. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3′PDH) primers (CLONTECH) were used to verify RNA loading. Amplification conditions were 94 °C (1 min), 52–58 °C (30 s), 72 °C (1 min) for 29 cycles or, in specific cases, 20 cycles (G3′PDH) or 24 cycles (Mitf, tyrosinase). Sequencing of PCR fragments was done on DNA analyzer 3700 (PE Applied Biosystems, Hitachi). F10.9 cells or transformed clones seeded at less than 50% confluency were either treated with IL6RIL6 or left untreated. At the end of the incubation period, cells washed with phosphate-buffered saline were lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (34.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing protease inhibitors (Calbiochem), or nuclear proteins were extracted (30.Oh J.W. Katz A. Harroch S. Eisenbach L. Revel M. Chebath J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes Protran Ba85 (Schleicher and Schüell). For immunodetection, the blots were first blocked with a solution of 5% (w/v) lowfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween 20 (1 h, room temperature), then incubated with specific rabbit antibody diluted in phosphate-buffered saline/T, 2% milk (2 h, room temperature), washed, and incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated immunopurified IgGs (Jackson Immunoresearch). Antibody binding was revealed with Pierce ECL reagents. Rabbit anti-Sox10 antibody (CeMines) and anti-Pax3 antibody (Geneka Biotechnology Inc.) were used at 1/2000 dilution, and rabbit IgG against CREBP/ATF1 (Biolabs) was used at 1/1000 dilution. RT-PCR with F10.9 total RNA was used to amplify coding sequences corresponding to Pax3c cDNA (35.Barber T.D. Barber M.C. Cloutier T.E. Friedman T.B. Gene. 1999; 237: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)(NM 008781: nucleotides 255–1759) and Sox10 cDNA (AF04743: nucleotides 39–1339). PCR products were cloned in the PGEMT plasmid (Promega) and sequenced. In the Pax3 Δ-Cterm construct, the Pax3 open reading frame ends at codon 277, after the DNA binding site. A TGA termination codon was introduced by PCR at codon 188 of Sox10 (Sox10 Δ-Cterm), after the high mobility group domain. For expression the cDNAs were cloned in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). pcDNA3-MITF contains the human MITF coding sequence (a gift from Dr. E. Razin, Hadassah Medical School). The CREBP-binding protein in pCEP4 expression vector was a gift from Dr. Roni Seger (Weizmann Institute, Israel). The mouse Stat3a/APRF cDNA cloned in the EcoRI site of pBlueScript was obtained from Dr. Shizuo Akira (Osaka, Japan). Stat3 mutant sequences acting as dominant negative proteins (Stat3DN), similar to those described (36.Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), were created with mutated oligonucleotides in PCR reactions. The mutated Stat3-coding sequences were recloned in a bicistronic vector, pEF-IRES-puromycin (37.Hobbs S. Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), for F10.9 cell transfection and selection of transformed clones with puromycin. For transient transfection with Stat3DN, cDNA inserts cut with EcoRI were cloned in theEcoRI site of pC-EGFP. pC-EGFP was prepared by replacing the NeoR sequence (between SmaI-ScaI sites) of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by the coding sequence of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (fragment SmaI-AflII) from pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). PCR amplification was used to isolate a fragment of the mouse tyrosinase gene upstream sequence, including TATA box and promoter region (D00439: F 2019–2031, R 2552–2570). The fragment was cloned into the XhoI site of the pGl3-basic vector (Promega) to produce the plasmid tyrosinase-Luc. Three repeats of the sequence 5′-gatcAAGTTAGTCATGTGCTT corresponding to MITF-responsive sequence (M-box) in the tyrosinase gene were cloned in the BglII site of the pGl3 promoter plasmid (Promega). A plasmid containing the human MITF gene promoter region (38.Fuse N. Yasumoto K. Suzuki H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (AF034755: nucleotides 117–2377) in the pGL2-basic vector (Promega) was a gift from Dr. Ballotti (Nice, France) (11.Bertolotto C. Abbe P. Hemesath T.J. Bille K. Fisher D.E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). MITF sequences 1161–2356 (or −1097/+99, relative to the start site) were amplified by PCR and cloned at the BglII site in pGl3-basic. From this construct, deletions between XhoI (in polylinker) and either PstI or NsiI sites (in MITF) created the −381 and −46 constructs. Other 5′ deletions were obtained by exonuclease III digestion on the −381/+99 construct cut withSacI and MluI followed by mung bean nuclease digestion (Exo mung bean deletion kit, Stratagene). The fragments resulting from HindIII digestion were recloned in pGl3-basic cut with XhoI (blunt end) and HindIII to create constructs −318, −277, −246, and −192. Three contiguous internal fragments between AatII and EcoRV,EcoRV and NsiI, or NsiI andDdeI were excised from the sequence −381/+99, respectively, in constructs −146/−122 (CREdel), −119/−46, or −46/−31(Pax3del2). In the LEF-1del construct, the fragment −234 to −192 was replaced by 40 base pairs of linker sequence. To produce the −381/−46 thymidine kinase construct, the fragment −381/−46 was amplified by PCR and cloned in front of minimal herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter sequence (AF057310, nucleotides −148/−1) cloned in theBglII site of pGl3-basic. A plasmid containing eight repeats of the Pax3 site in front of the MITF promoter (−31/+99) was prepared as described (8.Watanabe A. Takeda K. Ploplis B. Tachibana M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Mutations were performed by two-step PCR to change the sequence ATTAATACTACTGGAAC (−260/−244), containing Pax3 paired and homeodomain binding sites, into AgcgATACTACTcGAgC (Pax3 mut1). The sequence TGACGTCA (−147/−141), containing the CRE site, was mutated to TGAgcTCA in CRE mut. The sequence TTGCTGAAAG (286/−277), containing a potential C/EBP-β/NF-IL6 binding site, was mutated into TTGCTcgAgG in the C/EBP mut construct. Mutations were all in the context of the −381/+99 sequence. For transfections, F10.9 cells in the log phase of growth were seeded in 6-well Costar plates (2 × 105 cells/well). After 24 h, each well received 1.2 ml of mixture containing 2 μg of plasmid DNA, including 0.5 μg of plasmid pSV2-β-galactosidase (Promega) or pCMV-β-galactosidase and 10–12 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in F-12 medium without antibiotics. After 10 h at 37 °C in the CO2incubator, the mixture was replaced by normal growth medium, and treatment with IL6RIL6 (140 ng/ml) was started. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured with Promega kits or reagents. Tyrosinase is a rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of melanin pigments in melanocytes and melanoma cells (39.Hearing V.J. Jimenez M. Int. J. Biochem. 1987; 19: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Whereas in untreated cultures of B16/F10.9 cells the tyrosinase specific activity increased with time, treatment of the cells by IL6RIL6 caused a gradual loss in the melanogenic enzyme (Fig. 1 A). Melanocytic differentiation can be enhanced in melanomas by agents that increase intracellular cAMP, such as forskolin (17.Preston S.F. Volpi M. Pearson C.M. Berlin R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5247-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40.Busca R. Bertolotto C. Abbe P. Englaro W. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Boquet P. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1367-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The F10.9 cells responded to forskolin by a marked increase in tyrosinase, but this increase was also completely prevented by IL6RIL6 (Fig. 1 B). Spectrometric measures of melanin released by the cells showed changes similar to tyrosinase, the black coloration of the medium being increased by forskolin and inhibited over 95% by IL6RIL6 addition (not shown). Forskolin produced the typical melanocytic differentiation characterized by formation of a dense crown of short dendritic expansions (Fig. 1 C), which are sites of melanosome release. In contrast, the cells treated by IL6RIL6 became elongated and developed long processes often bipolar and branched with thinner ramifications (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that the loss of melanogenesis is part of a differentiation toward another phenotype. Analysis of tyrosinase mRNA in Northern blots showed that both large (4–5 kilobases) and small (2 kilobases) alternatively spliced transcripts (41.Kelsall S.R. Le Fur N. Mintz B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were decreased in the melanoma cells treated by IL6RIL6 (Fig. 2). The same blots revealed that the mRNA for MITF, a factor of critical importance for tyrosinase gene transcription (6.Bentley N.J. Eisen T. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7996-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and a marker of the melanocytic lineage (for review, see Ref. 3.Goding C.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1712-1728PubMed Google Scholar), was suppressed by IL6RIL6 already 6 h after treatment (Fig. 2). To examine the transcriptional activity of the tyrosinase gene, a 550-base pair promoter segment linked to a luciferase reporter gene was transfected into the F10.9 cells (Table I). IL6RIL6 produced an 80% decrease in the activity of the tyrosinase promoter measured 72 h after treatment. Forskolin increased the tyrosinase promoter activity, but IL6RIL6 inhibited it even in the presence of forskolin (Table I). Because the target of MITF in the tyrosinase promoter is an M-box element (6.Bentley N.J. Eisen T. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7996-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 11.Bertolotto C. Abbe P. Hemesath T.J. Bille K. Fisher D.E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), we tested a luciferase gene driven by repeats of the M-box and found that its expression is reduced in IL6RIL6-treated cells (Table I). Evidence that these effects may be attributed to a decrease of MITF was obtained by co-transfection with a plasmid expressing the human MITF cDNA; under these conditions, no inhibition by IL6RIL6 was observed with either the M-box or the tyrosinase promoter either with or without forskolin (Table I). In contrast, transfection with the coactivator CREBP-binding protein/p300 did not suppress the inhibitory effect of IL6RIL6 (Table I), although CREBP-binding protein binds MITF and modulates its transcriptional activity (42.Sato S. Roberts K. Gambino G. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Goding C.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 3083-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, CREBP-binding protein/p300 also enhances the activity of factors binding to cAMP response elements (for review, see Ref. 43.De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 343-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and enhanced the tyrosinase promoter activity in the presence of forskolin (Table I).Table IEctopic expression of MITF reverses inhibition by IL6RIL6 of tyrosinase gene promoter activity or M-box reporter activityLuciferase constructsExpression vectorNon-treatedIL6RIL6IL6RIL6 effectForskolinForskolin + IL6RIL6IL6RIL6 effect%%Tyrosinase-Luc.pcDNA35711−8013037−71MITF180203+13288346+20CBP5312−7824141−83M-box-Luc.pcDNA3740446−40MITF982012730+29Tyr-Luc contains the mouse tyrosinase gene 5′ sequences (−446/+107) in pG13 basic, and M-box-Luc contains three repeats of the tyrosinase sequences −113/−97 in front of the minimal SV40 promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2085131924,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a critical component of the signaling pathways that control the activation of platelets. Here we have examined the regulation of protein kinase B (PKB), a downstream effector of PI3K, by the platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein (GP) VI and thrombin receptors. Stimulation of platelets with collagen or convulxin (a selective GPVI agonist) resulted in PI3K-dependent, and aggregation independent, Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation of PKBα, which results in PKB activation. This was accompanied by translocation of PKB to cell membranes. The phosphoinositide-dependent kinase PDK1 is known to phosphorylate PKBα on Thr308, although the identity of the kinase responsible for Ser473phosphorylation is less clear. One candidate that has been implicated as being responsible for Ser473 phosphorylation, either directly or indirectly, is the integrin-linked kinase (ILK). In this study we have examined the interactions of PKB, PDK1, and ILK in resting and stimulated platelets. We demonstrate that in platelets PKB is physically associated with PDK1 and ILK. Furthermore, the association of PDK1 and ILK increases upon platelet stimulation. It would therefore appear that formation of a tertiary complex between PDK1, ILK, and PKB may be necessary for phosphorylation of PKB. These observations indicate that PKB participates in cell signaling downstream of the platelet collagen receptor GPVI. The role of PKB in collagen- and thrombin-stimulated platelets remains to be determined. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a critical component of the signaling pathways that control the activation of platelets. Here we have examined the regulation of protein kinase B (PKB), a downstream effector of PI3K, by the platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein (GP) VI and thrombin receptors. Stimulation of platelets with collagen or convulxin (a selective GPVI agonist) resulted in PI3K-dependent, and aggregation independent, Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation of PKBα, which results in PKB activation. This was accompanied by translocation of PKB to cell membranes. The phosphoinositide-dependent kinase PDK1 is known to phosphorylate PKBα on Thr308, although the identity of the kinase responsible for Ser473phosphorylation is less clear. One candidate that has been implicated as being responsible for Ser473 phosphorylation, either directly or indirectly, is the integrin-linked kinase (ILK).

However, upon vascular damage platelets are exposed to extracellular matrix proteins, such as sub-endothelial collagens, factors released or generated by activated platelets, and thrombin, which activate platelets. This leads to the formation of a platelet thrombus, preventing further blood loss. Although this mechanism is vital when tissue is damaged, inappropriate activation of platelets can lead to thrombosis. Alternatively, failure to become activated can lead to excessive bleeding. An understanding of the intracellular mechanisms that regulate the function of platelets is vital for the development of therapies to combat these disorders. Platelets express a number of receptors on their cell surface that are important for activation and aggregation at sites of tissue injury. These include the collagen activatory receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI)1 (1.Moroi M. Jung S.M. Okuma M. Shinmyozu K. J. Clin.

Damage to the blood vessel wall exposes platelets to sub-endothelial collagens. Following initial interactions of platelets with collagen via von Willebrand factor, the collagen receptors GPVI and integrin α2β1 support firm adhesion. GPVI is non-covalently associated with the Fc-receptor γ-chain, and activation of this complex by collagen leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein (2.Gibbins J.M. Okuma M. Farndale R.

This leads to the recruitment and activation of various signaling molecules, which, in turn, and via a range of signaling pathways, result in platelet aggregation (7.Poole A. Gibbins J.M.

Thrombin receptors, on the other hand, are coupled to G proteins and elicit their effects through G protein-linked signaling pathways. Although collagen and thrombin activate divergent signaling pathways, common to both is phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K has been shown to be central to the intracellular signaling pathways activated by agonist-induced stimulation of either of these receptors. Inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin blocks collagen-induced aggregation (11.Lagrue A.H. Francischetti I.M.B. Guimaraes J.A. Jandrot Perrus M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas the thrombin receptor requires phosphoinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), a product of PI3K activity, to elicit its effect (12.Zhang J.

However, little has been shown in platelets with regard to the signaling that lies downstream of PI3K. In recent years attention has been focused on the enzyme protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) as one of the central downstream effectors of PI3K in many cell systems. Indeed, PKB has been shown to become activated in platelets following stimulation with thrombin and thrombopoietin (TPO), but it is not activated upon stimulation with other platelet agonists such as ADP and platelet-activating factor (13.Banfic H.

PKB is a 57-kDa phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinase that has been implicated in regulating cell survival (15.Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S.

It is a multidomain protein that contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain adjacent to a centrally located catalytic domain. The kinase domain is highly homologous to the catalytic domains of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC). The regulation of PKB activity has been shown to be critically dependent on phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues (21.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). Indeed the catalytic domain contains one such residue. The catalytic domain is connected to a short C-terminal tail, which displays considerable similarity to the regulatory subunit of PKC and contains a second regulatory serine phosphorylation site (22.Bellacosa A. Franke T.F. Gonzalezportal M.E. Datta K. Taguchi T. Gardner J. Cheng J.Q. Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 745-754PubMed Google Scholar). Three isoforms of PKB have been identified in humans, PKBα, -β, and -γ. The isoforms are differentially distributed, but each tissue contains at least one isoform (22.Bellacosa A. Franke T.F. Gonzalezportal M.E. Datta K. Taguchi T. Gardner J. Cheng J.Q. Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 745-754PubMed Google Scholar). The subtypes possess more than 80% sequence homology but differ with respect to their regulatory phosphorylation sites (PKBα: Thr308/Ser473; PKBβ: Thr309/Ser474; PKBγ: Thr305) (23.Jones P.F.

Ono Y. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In resting cells PKB is predominantly cytoplasmic and exists as an inactive multimer (25.Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Activation requires both translocation to cell membranes and phosphorylation of the enzyme. Upon cellular stimulation, PKB is initially recruited to the plasma membrane via interaction of its PH domain with phosphoinositide products of PI3K, particularly PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (26.Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J.N. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Once at the plasma membrane, PKB is believed to undergo conformational changes and is subsequently phosphorylated at its regulatory threonine and serine phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of the threonine site alone facilitates partial activation and occurs via another phospholipid-dependent kinase, namely PDK1 (27.Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 28.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, with the exception of PKBγ (which has only a threonine phosphorylation site due to C-terminal truncation), for maximal activation and protection against dephosphorylation by cytosolic phosphatases, PKB also requires phosphorylation at the regulatory serine residue (21.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this serine residue is phosphorylated remains contentious. Some researchers propose autophosphorylation (29.Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) as the given mechanism, whereas others suggest that PDK1 is responsible for phosphorylating this residue as well as the threonine residue (30.Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C.F. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Several reports indicate that Ser473 of PBKα is phosphorylated by a second PDK, and recent studies have indicated that this may be integrin-linked kinase (ILK) (31.Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 32.Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J.

In this study we have investigated the regulation of PKB in human platelets. PKBα and PKBβ have been shown to be expressed in platelets (14.Kroner C. Eybrechts K. Akkerman J.W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Of these two isoforms PKBα appears to be the most abundant and is activated in response to the platelet agonist thrombin (13.Banfic H. Downes C.P. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11630-11637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14.Kroner C. Eybrechts K. Akkerman J.W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this report we present data to show that PKBα is also phosphorylated in platelets following activation of the collagen receptor GPVI. This is demonstrated by stimulating platelets with collagen and convulxin (Cvx), a selective agonist for the platelet collagen receptor GPVI (33.Polgar J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M.

GPVI-stimulated phosphorylation of PKBα occurs independently of aggregation but is dependent on the activation of PI3Ks. We have also examined the interaction of PKBα with ILK and PDK1 in resting and stimulated platelets, kinases that are implicated in the phosphorylation and regulation of PKB. Anti-PKB and anti-phospho-PKB (Ser473and Thr308) antibodies were purchased from New England BioLabs (Hertfordshire, UK). Anti-PDK1 (06-637) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (TCS Biologicals, Buckingham, UK) and anti-ILK (C-19) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Autogenbioclear, Wiltshire, UK). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, enhanced chemiluminescence reagents, and x-ray film were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. (Buckinghamshire). The PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, were from Calbiochem (CN Biosciences, Nottingham, UK). The Lowry protein assay reagent was purchased from Pierce (Perbio, Cheshire, UK). All other reagents were of analytical grade and from previously described sources (34.Cicmil M. Thomas J.M. Sage T. Barry F.A. Leduc M. Bon C. Gibbins J.M. J. Biol.

Blood. 2002; 99: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Human platelets were obtained on the day of experiments from drug-free volunteers and prepared by differential centrifugation as described previously (36.Asselin J. Gibbins J.M. Achison M. Lee Y.-H. Morton L.F. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Watson S.P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were then resuspended in Tyrode's-Hepes buffer (134 mm NaCl, 0.34 mmNa2HPO4, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm Hepes, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3) to a density of 8 × 108 cells/ml. Platelets were stimulated for the appropriate duration with collagen, convulxin (Cvx), or thrombin at 37 °C in an aggregometer with continuous stirring (1200 rpm). For inhibitor studies platelets were incubated with the appropriate inhibitor (dissolved in Me2SO, final concentration <0.2% (v/v)) for 15 min prior to stimulation. Control samples were incubated with the appropriate concentration of Me2SO alone. Where stimulations were performed under non-aggregating conditions, platelets were preincubated for 30 min with 1 mm EGTA and 10 μm indomethacin. Platelets were stimulated for the appropriate time, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of reducing Laemmli sample treatment buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semi-dry Western blotting. After blocking by incubation in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (TBS-T; 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6) containing 5% (w/v) milk protein, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody, at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in TBS-T containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin or 5% (w/v) milk protein where appropriate. Subsequent to washing membranes in TBS-T, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, at a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml in 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin dissolved in TBS-T, and then washed with TBS-T. Membranes were then incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate for horseradish peroxidase and exposed to x-ray film. Following stimulation, platelets were pulse-centrifuged (14,000 × g), and the supernatant was removed. PBS containing 0.05% (w/v) digitonin was added to the platelet pellet and incubated for 10 min on ice with intermittent agitation. Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant cytosolic fraction was removed. PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added to the cell pellet and incubated on ice for a further 10 min with intermittent agitation. Samples were centrifuged as before, and the supernatant membrane fraction was harvested. The protein concentration for both membrane and cytosol fractions were determined using the Lowry protein assay and following the manufacturer's protocol. After stimulation, cells were lysed using an equal volume of radioimmune precipitation buffer (4m NaCl, 1.25 mm sodium deoxycholate, 1m Tris, 10% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4 containing 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm okadaic acid, and 2 mmNa3VO4) and incubated on ice for more than 15 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C; the supernatants were then precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose (PAS; 20 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension in TBS-T) for 30 min. Following removal of the PAS by centrifugation, 1 μg of the appropriate antibody was added to each sample and the samples were incubated for 1 h before addition of PAS (40 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension in TBS-T). After a further 1-h incubation, the samples were centrifuged and the PAS beads were washed three times in TBS-T. Each sample was resuspended in reducing Laemmli sample treatment buffer and boiled prior to loading on a polyacrylamide gel. It has been shown previously that PKBα is phosphorylated in platelets in response to the agonist thrombin (13.Banfic H. Downes C.P. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11630-11637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14.Kroner C. Eybrechts K. Akkerman J.W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because PI3K activity is required for platelet responses to both collagen and thrombin, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 generation is required for activation of PKB, we investigated whether signaling generated by the platelet collagen receptor GPVI also leads to PKBα phosphorylation. Immunoblot analysis of platelet lysates using PKBα phosphospecific antibodies revealed that PKBα is phosphorylated on Ser473 (Fig. 1) and Thr308 (not shown) in response to stimulation with collagen, Cvx, and thrombin. This response was found to be both concentration- and time-dependent (not shown and Fig. 1, respectively). An increase in Ser473phosphorylation in response to collagen (100 μg/ml) was detectable within 90 s stimulation, and the level of phosphorylation peaked at around 5 min. Phosphorylation was more rapid in response to Cvx and thrombin at the concentrations presented (125 ng/ml and 1 unit/ml, respectively) with phosphorylation levels reaching above basal levels within 20 s. Maximal phosphorylation in response to Cvx was achieved within 5 min, and for thrombin, 90 s. Similar profiles of Thr308 phosphorylation were also detected (not shown). Differences in kinetics reflect the relative potencies of these agonists and the concentrations at which they were used. Each of these experiments was performed in the presence of 1 mm EGTA. Under these conditions aggregation is prevented (as confirmed using optical aggregometry (not shown)) due to inhibition of fibrinogen binding. The levels of PKBα phosphorylation observed were very similar in platelets that were allowed to aggregate through the omission of EGTA. This indicates that the phosphorylation of PKBα on Ser473 and Thr308 is not dependent on platelet aggregation. It has been reported that thrombin stimulates dual signaling pathways leading to the phosphorylation and activation of PKBα; one pathway being PI3K-dependent and the other independent of PI3K (14.Kroner C. Eybrechts K. Akkerman J.W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The latter pathway was shown to involve calcium-dependent PKC isoforms (PKCα/β). In contrast, TPO-stimulated PKBα phosphorylation is solely dependent on PI3K signaling (14.Kroner C. Eybrechts K. Akkerman J.W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We therefore examined GPVI-stimulated PKB phosphorylation in the presence of PI3K inhibitors. Both LY294002 (Fig. 2) and wortmannin (not shown) completely inhibited collagen and Cvx-stimulated PKBα Ser473 (Fig. 2) and Thr308 (not shown) phosphorylation, indicating that GPVI-stimulated PKBα phosphorylation is dependent on PI3K. In agreement with Kroner et al. (14.Kroner C. Eybrechts K. Akkerman J.W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) these inhibitors did not prevent PKBα phosphorylation at high concentrations of thrombin, although complete inhibition of PKBα phosphorylation was observed at all concentrations of collagen and Cvx tested (not shown). To examine the subcellular localization of PKB under resting and stimulated conditions, platelets were activated with collagen, Cvx, or thrombin, then separated into cytosolic and membrane fractions. Fractions were examined for the presence of PKB by immunoblot analysis using an anti-PKB antibody. Fig. 3 shows that under basal conditions PKB is present predominantly in the cytosolic fraction. However, when the platelets are stimulated with collagen (100 μg/ml), Cvx (125 ng/ml), or thrombin (1 unit/ml), PKB translocates to the membrane fraction. Translocation is rapid, occurring within 20 s of stimulation and coincides (or precedes, in the case of collagen) with the onset of phosphorylation of PKB, as seen in Fig. 1. This indicates that the phosphorylation and, therefore, the activation, of PKB in platelets coincide with its association with cell membranes. This is consistent with observations in other cell systems and the dependence of PKB on PI3K activity and the generation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (25.Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A.

Ravichandran K.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We next looked at the interaction between PKB and reported upstream regulators PDK1 and ILK, which we have previously demonstrated to be expressed in platelets (38.Thomas J.M. Barry F.A. Cicmil M. Sage T. Gibbins J.M. Blood. 2000; 96: 1053Google Scholar) 2F. A. Barry and J. M. Gibbins, unpublished data. and are implicated in PKB phosphorylation. PDK1 and ILK were immunoprecipitated from resting platelets and platelets stimulated with either Cvx or thrombin. Isolated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-phospho-Ser473 PKBα antibodies. Fig. 4a shows that phosphorylated PKBα is present in PDK1 immunoprecipitates, and that the level of phosphorylation of associated PKBα is increased on stimulation with Cvx (125 ng/ml) and thrombin (1 unit/ml). It is well established that PDK1 is responsible for Thr308 phosphorylation (28.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although controversy surrounds the identity of the kinase that phosphorylates Ser473. ILK is implicated in this role (31.Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar,32.Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol.

Of particular interest, therefore, is the observation that phosphorylated PKBα is also present in ILK immunoprecipitates, and similarly the level of phosphorylation of associated PKBα is increased on stimulation with Cvx and thrombin (Fig. 4b). In addition we observed interaction between PDK1 and ILK in platelets (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, the level of this interaction was increased following stimulation of platelets with Cvx (125 ng/ml) or thrombin (1 unit/ml). Because all three enzymes contain PH domains, it was of concern that these may not be true associations but result from the incorporation into lipid microvesicles formed during immunoprecipitation. To verify this was not the case, all blots (Fig. 4, a–c) were reprobed with an antibody to an abundant PH-domain containing protein pleckstrin. No pleckstrin was detected in ILK and PDK1 immunoprecipitates. These results illustrate the potential importance of both ILK and PDK1 in the regulation of PKB activity in collagen- and thrombin-stimulated platelets. Human platelets express on their surface a plethora of receptors that are activated by a number of physiological factors leading, via multiple signaling pathways, to platelet activation. Central to the function of several of these receptors is the activation of PI3K. PI3K has previously been shown to be necessary for collagen- and thrombin receptor-mediated platelet aggregation, as well as Cvx-induced granule secretion, inositol phosphate production, and increase in [Ca2+]i (11.Lagrue A.H. Francischetti I.M.B. Guimaraes J.A. Jandrot Perrus M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12.Zhang J. Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6265-6272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, little is known of the downstream effectors of PI3K in platelets. Because PKB has been shown to be a key effector of PI3K in other cell systems, we investigated this enzyme in collagen receptor (GPVI)-mediated platelet signaling. We have observed that stimulation of platelets with a variety of agonists, including collagen, Cvx, and thrombin results in the phosphorylation of PKBα on Ser473 and Thr308, and this phosphorylation is not dependent on aggregation. Kinetic analysis reveals that PKBα is rapidly phosphorylated in platelets stimulated with any of these agonists. Phosphorylation continues to increase for up to 5 min in response to collagen and Cvx, and is sustained above basal levels for up to 1 h in response to all of the agonists used. PKBα has been shown previously to become phosphorylated and activated in platelets following stimulation with thrombin and TPO. Other platelet agonists such as ADP and platelet-activating factor have been shown not to stimulate PKB phosphorylation (34.Cicmil M. Thomas J.M. Sage T. Barry F.A. Leduc M. Bon C. Gibbins J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27339-27347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study extends the involvement of PKB in platelets to the signaling downstream of the GPVI-Fc receptor γ-chain collagen receptor complex. PKB activity in platelets stimulated with thrombin has been shown to be biphasic. This mirrors the biphasic activation of PI3K and generation of 3′-phosphorylated inositol phospholipids, where PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is generated upon initial stimulation and PtdIns(3,4)P2 is generated later on platelet aggregation (13.Banfic H. Downes C.P. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11630-11637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Biphasic activation of PKB was not observed in response to collagen, Cvx, or thrombin in these studies, because platelets were prevented from aggregating during kinetic studies of PKB phosphorylation. PKB activity is regulated by the 3′-phosphorylated inositol phospholipids PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2(39.Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These lipids show an affinity for the PH domain of signaling proteins; therefore, as the concentration of these phospholipids rise, PH domain-containing proteins are recruited to membranes. We have observed that stimulation of platelets with collagen, Cvx, or thrombin leads to the translocation of PKB to membranes, which is consistent with the rise in intracellular PtdIns(3,4,5)P3stimulated in platelets by these agonists (11.Lagrue A.H. Francischetti I.M.B. Guimaraes J.A. Jandrot Perrus M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12.Zhang J. Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6265-6272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that by 20 s PKB translocates from the cytosolic fraction of stimulated platelets to the membrane fraction, a time point that correlates with or precedes its phosphorylation. Indeed, phosphorylated PKBα can be visualized by indirect immunofluorescence at the plasma membrane of platelets adhered to collagen (not shown). It is widely accepted that the regulation of PKB is dependent on the phospholipid products of PI3K activity. Recently, however, Kroner and colleagues (14.Kroner C. Eybrechts K. Akkerman J.W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) reported that activation of PKB in thrombin-stimulated platelets is a consequence of PI3K signaling and a second partially PI3K independent mechanism. This second mechanism involves the activation of phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ1), leading to the activation of calcium-dependent isoforms of PKC (PKCα/β) and ultimately the phosphorylation of Ser473. Indeed, the activation of PKC directly using phorbol 12-myristate causes the selective phosphorylation of Ser473. It has been suggested that in this case PI3Kγ activity may be involved in the phosphorylation of Thr308 via activation of PDK1. This dual regulation of PKB in platelets is possible, because the thrombin receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are able to activate PLCβ1/2 (through the action of Gαq and Gβγ protein subunits), p85/110 PI3K, and PI3Kγ. Activation of the TPO receptor c-Mpl, on the other hand, leads to the activation of PKB by p85/110 PI3K-dependent signaling alone. This is responsible for regulating the phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473, because phosphorylation is abolished completely in the presence of PI3K inhibitors. It was therefore important to establish whether a single or dual regulation system is in place in platelets to regulate PKBα phosphorylation and activation downstream of the collagen receptor GPVI. We have shown in this study that PKB phosphorylation in response to relatively high concentrations of collagen (100 μg/ml) and Cvx (125 ng/ml) is completely abrogated by the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin. This indicates that GPVI-stimulated PKB phosphorylation is solely dependent on PI3K activity and suggests that a single regulation system is operational downstream of this receptor. Consistent with the work of Kroner et al., at high concentrations of thrombin, Ser473 phosphorylation was partially resistant to PI3K inhibitors. The molecular links between PI3K activation and PKB phosphorylation are phosphoinositide-dependent kinases such as PDK1. PDK1 is a 63-kDa monomeric protein that is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues (28.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of 3′ phospholipids PDK1 phosphorylates PKB at its Thr308 residue, which results in partial activation of the enzyme. The mechanism of phosphorylation of the Ser473 site, however, is still hotly debated. The question remains whether this site is phosphorylated by an independent protein or by PKB itself (that is, PKB autophosphorylation of Ser473). Evidence is mounting for the involvement of an independent protein in the phosphorylation of Ser473, and several candidates have been proposed for the role. Integrin-linked kinase is one such candidate, but the role of this 59-kDa protein in phosphorylating PKB, however, is contentious. Several studies report that ILK phosphorylates Ser473 directly (31.Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 32.Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), whereas others propose that ILK acts as an adapter (40.Lynch D.K. Ellis C.A. Edwards P.A.W. Hiles I.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8024-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) thereby facilitating phosphorylation by an alternative kinase. We show here that PDK1 and ILK both co-associate with PKB in platelets (Fig. 4, a and b). The association of PKB with ILK is consistent with recent observations in DU145 cells (32.Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and implies that ILK may play a role in regulating PKB activity. Furthermore, Fig. 4c shows that PDK1 and ILK also co-associate with each other. We postulate that the formation of this tertiary complex (PKB·PDK1·ILK) may facilitate the phosphorylation of PKB on its Ser473 site by changing the conformation of the enzyme such that its serine site becomes available for phosphorylation. Whether the Ser473phosphorylation occurs in platelets via PDK1, ILK, or an alternative mechanism, however, remains to be determined. An additional layer of complexity to the regulation of PKB has been recently introduced with the observation that PKB can become tyrosine-phosphorylated. Two tyrosine residues have been identified near the activation loop of PKBα, Tyr315 and Tyr326, and phosphorylation of these residues in vitro effects PKB activity (41.Chen R.Y. Kim O. Yang J.B. Sato K. Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J. Chen H.G. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31858-31862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The significance of PKB tyrosine phosphorylation has yet to be determined, but it is interesting to note that PKB becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation of platelets with Cvx.2 The importance of PI3K activity and the stimulation of platelet activation is well established. However the functional significance of PKB in platelet function is presently unknown. With the present lack of a specific PKB inhibitor, this is a difficult question to address. We have established that a kinase inhibitor, ML-9, which has been shown to inhibit PKB activity (42.Smith U. Carvalho E. Mosialou E. Beguinot F. Formisano P. Rondinone C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), is able to partially inhibit Cvx-stimulated platelets2; however, the promiscuous nature of this inhibitor prevents solid conclusions to be drawn from such experiments. An alternative approach is to examine the role of effectors of PKB in platelets. PKB has numerous substrates that have been identified, including forkhead transcription factors (43.Rena G. Guo S.D. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), CREB (44.Du K.Y. Montminy M. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), 6-phosphofructose 2-kinase (46.Deprez J. Vertommen D. Alessi D.R. Hue L. Rider M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17269-17275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (19.Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4364) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins are not present in platelets, although, we have found that glycogen synthase kinase-3 is present (47.Barry F.A. Gibbins J.M. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: P2645Google Scholar). Therefore, investigations are currently underway in our laboratory to determine if this is a functionally relevant substrate of PKB in these cells. We are very grateful to Drs. M. Leduc and C. Bon (Institute Pasteur, Paris, France) for the gift of purified convulxin for use in these studies. We also acknowledge Dr. Joanne Thomas for assistance with methodology and helpful discussion during the course of this project."

Photosystem II (PSII) 1The abbreviations used are: PSIIphotosystem IIPSIphotosystem ITricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineis a large cofactor-protein complex consisting of at least 17 protein subunits (Ref. 1.Zouni A.

Hankamer B. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 817-827Crossref Google Scholar). The PSII reaction center is formed by a heterodimer of two pigment-binding proteins, D1 and D2, which, in photosynthetic eukaryotes, are encoded by the chloroplast psbA and psbD genes, respectively. The photochemical reaction carried out by the reaction center converts the energy of a photon into a separation of charge and, in this way, initiates electron flow. Around the reaction center, the outer parts of PSII are assembled, the inner and outer antennae funneling absorbed light energy to the catalytic core and the oxygen-evolving complex splitting water into protons, electrons, and dioxygen (reviewed in Refs. 3.Wollman F.-A.

J. Plant Res. 1998; 111: 101-111Crossref Google Scholar). Most of these small subunits do not bind redox cofactors and, hence, are unlikely to participate directly in electron transfer reactions. It is generally assumed that they rather function as photosystem-assembling or stabilizing factors. However, in many cases, molecular evidence supporting such a structural role is largely lacking. The successful development of transformation technologies forChlamydomonas (6.Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Harris E.H. Hosler J.P. Johnson A.M. Jones A.R. Randolph-Anderson B.L. Robertson D. Klein T.M. Shark K.B. Sanford J.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1534-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) and tobacco chloroplasts (7.Svab Z. Hajdukiewicz P. Maliga P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8526-8530Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) has paved the way to functional characterizations of plastid genome-encoded genes by reverse genetics. Linked to a selectable marker gene, mutant alleles can be introduced into plastids by chloroplast transformation, where they replace the endogenous wild-type allele by homologous recombination. During the past decade, reverse genetics has become a powerful tool in plastid functional genomics (reviewed in Ref. 8.Rochaix J.-D. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 419-425Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Here, we have taken a reverse genetics approach to define the function of one of the smallest polypeptides in PSII, PsbJ. Using chloroplast transformation, we have generated tobacco plants lacking the PsbJ polypeptide. Physiological and biochemical analyses revealed that the PsbJ-deficient mutant plants accumulate incompletely assembled oxygen-evolving complexes, have reduced levels of PSI and are extremely sensitive to light. Sterile tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havana) were grown on agar-solidified MS medium containing 30 g/liter sucrose (9.Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 493-497Crossref Scopus (53928) Google Scholar). Homoplasmic transplastomic lines were rooted and propagated on the same medium. Photoautotrophic growth was tested on MS medium without sucrose. For protein isolation and physiological measurements, wild type and transformed plants were grown on sucrose-containing medium under low (2 μmol quanta m−2 s−1) and standard light (100 μmol quanta m−2 s−1), respectively. Leaves referred to as “young leaves” were harvested at the age of only a few days in order to avoid interference with photooxidative damage in the mutant chloroplasts. Leaves referred to as “mature leaves” were several weeks old and, in the case of the ΔpsbJ mutant, not yet photobleached. The region of the tobacco plastid genome containing the psbEoperon was isolated as a 2383-bp SalI/SpeI fragment corresponding to nucleotide positions 65,313–67,695 (according to Ref. 10.Wakasugi T. Sugita M. Tsudzuki T. Sugiura M. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1998; 16: 231-241Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The fragment was cloned into a pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) cut with SalI andSpeI. To remove the HincII site from the remaining polylinker, the plasmid was linearized with SalI and the recessed ends were filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I followed by religation. The psbE operon was subsequently excised by digestion with HincII andClaI (restriction sites correspond to nucleotide positions 66,341 and 67,167) and replaced by a similarly cut PCR product carrying the psbJ deletion. The deletion of the psbJcoding region was introduced into a PCR product by amplification with primers PT5′ (5′-GACGATCTCACAAAGATGAA-3′) and PΔJ1 (5′-TTTTGTTGACGACTCAATTCATTACCCCACTTCCCTCCA-3′). The 3′ portion of oligonucleotide PΔJ1 binds to the sequence immediately upstream of the psbJ initiator codon and contains in its 5′ portion the nucleotide sequence downstream of the psbJ termination codon up to the HincII site at 66,341. Oligonucleotide PT5′ binds upstream of the ClaI site at 67,167. A chimericaadA gene conferring resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics (11.Svab Z. Maliga P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) was cloned into the unique EcoRV site (position 66,054) to facilitate selection of chloroplast transformants. A plasmid clone carrying the aadA gene in the same orientation as the psbE operon yielded the final transformation vector pΔpsbJ (see Fig. 2). Young leaves from sterile tobacco plants were bombarded with plasmid pΔpsbJ-coated 1.1-μm tungsten particles using a biolistic gun (PDS1000He; Bio-Rad). Primary spectinomycin-resistant lines were selected on RMOP regeneration medium containing 500 mg/liter spectinomycin (7.Svab Z. Hajdukiewicz P. Maliga P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8526-8530Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 11.Svab Z. Maliga P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Plastid transformants were identified by PCR amplification according to standard protocols and using the primer pair P10 (5′-AACCTCCTATAGACTAGGC-3′; complementary to the psbA3′-untranslated region of the chimeric aadA gene) and P11 (5′-AGCGAAATGTAGTGCTTACG-3′; derived from the 3′ portion of theaadA coding region). Four independent transplastomic lines were subjected to four additional rounds of regeneration on RMOP/spectinomycin to obtain homoplasmic tissue. Total plant DNA was isolated by a rapid miniprep procedure (12.Doyle J.J. Doyle J.L. Focus. 1990; 12: 13-15Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). DNA samples were digested withEcl136II/DraI, separated on 1.2% agarose gels, and blotted onto Hybond N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Total cellular RNA was electrophoresed on formaldehyde-containing 1.3% agarose gels and transferred onto Hybond N+ membranes. For hybridization, [α-32P]dATP-labeled probes were generated by random priming (Multiprime DNA labeling system; Amersham Biosciences). A radiolabeled PCR product covering part of thepsbE operon (obtained by amplification with primer pair P7652 (5′-CCGAATGAGCTAAGAGAATCTT-3′)/P7355 (5′-GACTATAGATCGAACCTATCC-3′)) was used as probe for the restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and for detection ofpsbE operon-specific transcripts. Hybridizations were carried out at 65–68 °C in rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences). An NdeI restriction fragment corresponding to nucleotide positions 41,487–42,385 in the tobacco chloroplast genome (10.Wakasugi T. Sugita M. Tsudzuki T. Sugiura M. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1998; 16: 231-241Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was used as a specific probe for detection of transcripts from the plastid psaA/B operon. To control for equal loading, blots were stripped and rehybridized to a cytoplasmic 18S rRNA probe (amplified with primer pair P5′18SNT (5′-GTATATTTAAGTTGTTGCAGT-3′)/P3′18SNT (5′-AAACTTTGATTTCTCATAAGG-3′)). Transcript quantitation was performed with a PhosphorImager using the Quantity One® software (Bio-Rad). Thylakoid proteins from wild-type and mutant plants were isolated from total leaf material following published procedures (14.Machold O. Simpson D.J. Moller B.L. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1979; 44: 235-254Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). PSII-enriched membranes (BBY) were prepared according to a protocol originally developed for spinach (15.Johnson G.N. Boussac A. Rutherford A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 85-92Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Following protein quantitation, equal amounts of thylakoid proteins were separated on Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels (16.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10478) Google Scholar) and stained with silver according to standard protocols (17.Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). For Western blot analyses, electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred to Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using the Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad) and a standard transfer buffer (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3). Immunoblot detection was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Determination of PSII activity was performed on dark-adapted leaves from wild-type and mutant plants grown under low light (2 μmol quanta m−2s−1) and standard light (100 μmol quanta m−2 s−1) conditions, respectively. PSII-dependent chlorophyll fluorescence was recorded at 650-nm wavelength with a pulsed amplitude modulation fluorimeter (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany; Ref. 18.Schreiber U. Schliwa U. Bilger W. Photosynth. Res. 1986; 10: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar) under illumination of intact leaf tissue with white actinic light (flux density 50 μmol quanta m−2 s−1 and 100 μmol quanta m−2 s−1; pulse frequency of measuring light, 1.6 kHz). For complete reduction of QA, leaves were exposed to pulses of saturating light (1 s; flux density 6000 μmol quanta m−2 s−1). The redox state of the PSI reaction center chlorophyll P700 was monitored by following the changes in absorbance of dark-adapted leaves from wild-type and mutant plants at a 830-nm wavelength (19.Harbinson J. Hedley C.L. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 649-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20.Schreiber U. Klughammer C. Neubauer C. Z. Naturforsch. 1988; 43: 686-698Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Absorbance measurements were performed using the pulsed amplitude modulation fluorimeter with a modified emitter/detector unit. Far red light with a peak wavelength of 730 nm was used to selectively excite PSI. To obtain complete rereduction of PSI, leaves were exposed to a strong white light pulse (5, 50, or 200 ms; 6000 μmol quanta m−2 s−1). Oxygen evolution of young leaves from plants grown at 2 μmol quanta m−2 s−1 was measured with a Clark O2 electrode (Hansatech) at room temperature under saturating CO2 levels to minimize competing O2-consuming reactions. Oxygen evolution was monitored at flux densities of 30 μmol quanta m−2 s−1. Five independent measurements were performed to calculate average O2 evolution values. Thermoluminescence was measured on leaf segments with a home-built apparatus. Thermoluminescence was excited with single turnover flashes at 0 °C. The flashes were spaced with a 1-s dark interval. Samples were then heated with a heating rate of 20 °C/min to 60 °C, and the light emission was recorded. Graphical and numerical data analyses were performed according to Ducruet and Miranda (21.Ducruet J.M. Miranda T. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 33: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). ThepsbJ gene is part of the plastid psbE operon, which comprises the four PSII genes psbE, psbF,psbL, and psbJ. This operon structure is conserved in all photosynthetically active multicellular plant species investigated to date but is not found in the unicellular green algaChlamydomonas reinhardtii (22.Mor T.S. Ohad I. Hirschberg J. Pakrasi H.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The psbE operon is unique in that its tetracistronic primary transcript does not undergo processing into monocistronic or oligocistronic units (23.Haley J. Bogorad L. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 323-333PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, translation must initiate efficiently on all four cistrons of the polycistronic mRNA. The resulting translation products are relatively small subunits of the PSII complex. ThepsbE and psbF genes specify the cytochromeb559 α and β subunits, which are essential for PSII assembly (24.Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys.

The function of the other two polypeptides encoded by the psbE operon, PsbL and PsbJ, is much less clear. PsbL has recently been implicated in the stabilization of the PSII core complex and the dimeric form of PSII (27.Kitamura K. Ozawa S. Shiina T. Toyoshima Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28.Zheleva D. Sharma J. Panico M. Morris H.R. Barber J. J. Biol.

The PsbJ protein has been detected immunologically in thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria (29.Lind L.K. Shukla V.K. Nyhus K.J. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol.

Krauß N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses in cyanobacteria also support an association of PsbJ with PSII and, in addition, have established that, in Synechocystis, PsbJ is not essential for photoautotrophic growth (29.Lind L.K. Shukla V.K. Nyhus K.J. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1575-1579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The psbJ gene of photosynthetic eukaryotes specifies a hydrophobic polypeptide of only 40 amino acids (theoretical molecular mass: 4.1 kDa) which is evolutionarily highly conserved (Fig. 1). In order to define the function of the PsbJ polypeptide in PSII of higher plants, we have constructed a chloroplast transformation vector carrying a psbJ null allele (Fig. 2). The psbJcoding region was deleted from a cloned fragment of the tobacco plastid DNA using PCR-based mutagenesis techniques. A chimeric selectable marker gene aadA was inserted into the intergenic spacer in between the psbE operon and the petA gene (Fig. 2). Earlier work had established that this spacer is a suitable site for the insertion of plastid transgenes (31.Bock R. Kössel H. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 32.Bock R. Hermann M. Kössel H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5052-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Biolistic bombardment of sterile tobacco leaves with plasmid pΔpsbJ-coated tungsten particles was followed by selection of spectinomycin-resistant cell lines. Successful chloroplast transformation was verified by tests for double resistance on medium containing two aminoglycoside antibiotics, spectinomycin and streptomycin (11.Svab Z. Maliga P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), and further confirmed by PCR assays usingaadA gene-specific primers (32.Bock R. Hermann M. Kössel H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5052-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Chloroplast transformants were purified to homoplasmy by passing them through additional regeneration cycles under antibiotic selection. Homoplasmy of the transplastomic lines (i.e. absence of any residual copies of the wild-type chloroplast genome) was confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (Fig. 3). Since there is no absolute linkage between the introducedpsbJ deletion and the selectable marker gene aadAin our transformation vector (Fig. 2), two different types of chloroplast transformants are obtained: (i) transformants carrying only the aadA but not the psbJ deletion and (ii) transformants having incorporated both the aadA gene and thepsbJ null allele by homologous recombination upstream ofpsbJ (Fig. 2). Southern blot analyses confirmed the isolation of transplastomic lines from each of the two types (Fig. 3). As expected, lines belonging to the first type were phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild type (as shown earlier; Ref. 31.Bock R. Kössel H. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), whereas lines of the second type all exhibited the same mutant phenotype (subsequently referred to as ΔpsbJ plants; see below). Since the psbJ gene is part of an operon that is transcribed as a tetracistronic mRNA, it was important to verify that the deletion introduced into psbJ did not affect transcription of the psbE operon or stability of its mRNAs. We therefore comparatively analyzed accumulation of psbE operon transcripts in wild-type and transplastomic tobacco lines (Fig. 4). No significant difference was found in transcript pattern and mRNA accumulation levels between the transplastomic lines only having the aadA marker and those additionally carrying the psbJ deletion indicating that the deletion in the psbJ coding region does not negatively affect synthesis or stability of psbE operon transcripts. Faithful expression of the engineered psbE operon in ΔpsbJ plants was subsequently also confirmed at the protein level by assaying accumulation of the cytochromeb559 α-subunit, the psbE gene product (see below). As established earlier foraadA transgenes inserted into the same genomic location (31.Bock R. Kössel H. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar,32.Bock R. Hermann M. Kössel H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5052-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), transplastomic plants carrying the aadA selectable marker gene but not the psbJ deletion were phenotypically normal and indistinguishable from wild-type tobacco plants in all subsequent biochemical and physiological tests (see below). By contrast, homoplasmic psbJ knockout plants grown on synthetic medium under standard light conditions (100 μmol quanta m−2 s−1) displayed a clear mutant phenotype. While young leaves were almost normally green (Fig. 5), older leaves were completely white and showed strong symptoms of photobleaching. However, this phenotype was much less severe than that observed previously for tobacco photosynthesis null mutants (33.Ruf S. Kössel H. Bock R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 34.Hager M. Biehler K. Illerhaus J. Ruf S. Bock R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5834-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting that the lack of the PsbJ protein may reduce but does not completely abolish photosynthetic activity. The mutant phenotype was identical in all independently generated transplastomic lines and has remained stable during vegetative propagation, providing additional proof for the homoplasmy of the lines. When grown under extreme low light conditions (2 μmol quanta m−2 s−1), no bleaching of mature leaves occurred in ΔpsbJ plants (Fig. 5), confirming that the severe phenotype under standard light conditions is caused by the mutant's high sensitivity to light, which appears to result in the accumulation of photooxidative damage over time. The highly light-sensitive phenotype of the ΔpsbJ lines was indicative of inefficient electron transfer reactions, potentially leading to the production of free radicals that in turn cause photooxidative damage to chloroplast membranes and proteins. In order to determine the efficiency of photosynthetic electron transport, we comparatively analyzed PSII and PSI functions in wild-type andΔpsbJ plants. In view of the light-sensitive phenotype of the psbJ knockout plants and the strong dependence of photobleaching on leaf age, we included young and mature leaves from plants grown at 2 μmol quanta m−2 s−1 as well as similar leaf material from plants raised at 100 μmol quanta m−2 s−1 (Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). We define here “young” as the first (or at most the second, depending on the size of the youngest visible leaf) leaf from the tip of the plant and “mature” as a relatively expanded leaf (second, third, or fourth from the tip), which, in the case of the ΔpsbJ plants grown at 100 μmol quanta m−2 s−1 must not yet be photobleached.Figure 7Test for PSI function by far red spectroscopy. Selective excitation of the PSI reaction center chlorophyll P700 results in a transition from its reduced to its oxidized state and hence reveals intact PSI photochemistry in both the wild type and the mutant. However, rereduction of P700 by white light pulses and, hence, by electrons released in PSII reveals remarkable differences. The 200-ms light pulse on mature mutant leaves grown at 2 μmol quanta m−2 s−1 as well as all pulses on mature mutant leaves grown at 100 μmol quanta m−2s−1 cannot rereduce the PSI reaction center chlorophylls and instead result in an apparent overoxidation of the P700 pool. Note that plants grown at 100 μmol quanta m−2s−1 generally possess more PSI than plants grown at 2 μmol quanta m−2 s−1, which is likely to reflect light-induced up-regulation of photosynthesis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We first measured PSII activity by chlorophyll fluorescence at room temperature. The minimum fluorescence F0 was determined by exposure of dark-adapted leaves to measuring light of low intensity (Fig. 6). Subsequently, maximum fluorescence Fm was obtained by illumination with two saturating light pulses each resulting in complete reduction of the primary quinone-type acceptor of PSII, QA. High variable fluorescence (Fvar =Fm − F0) was detected for both young wild-type and young ΔpsbJ leaves (Fig. 6), strongly suggesting that ΔpsbJ plants synthesize functional PSII units capable of reducing the primary PSII acceptor QA. In contrast, mature leaves from ΔpsbJplants grown at 100 μmol quanta m−2 s−1showed almost no variable fluorescence. Fvar was also drastically reduced in mature leaves from ΔpsbJplants grown under extreme low light conditions (Fig. 6) mainly caused by a strong increase in minimum fluorescence,F0. This may indicate a disproportion between the photon-capturing capacity of the PSII antenna and the transfer of absorbed light energy to the PSII reaction center resulting in dramatically enhanced chlorophyll fluorescence emission. The ratio (Fm −F0)/Fm can serve as a measure of the maximum quantum yield of PSII-driven photochemistry. In young leaves from ΔpsbJ plants, this ratio (and hence the maximum photochemical capacity of PSII) was found to be only slightly reduced as compared with wild-type leaves, suggesting that the absence of the PsbJ protein does not dramatically impair the electron transfer reactions in PSII. By contrast, mature leaves from ΔpsbJplants were severely affected (Fig. 6), indicating that the PsbJ protein is directly or indirectly involved in the protection of PSII from light-induced damage or destabilization. When wild-type leaves were exposed to continuous actinic light of low intensity, flashes of saturating white light superimposed on the actinic light resulted in a fluorescence rise, which approximately reached the initial value of Fm, and strong photochemical fluorescence quenching occurred (Fig. 6). By contrast, in young leaves from ΔpsbJ plants, the fluorescence rise induced by the saturating flashes clearly did not reach the initialFm value, and mature leaves from plants grown at 100 μmol quanta m−2 s−1 even lacked almost any PSII photochemistry. These results lend further support to the idea that, in the absence of the PsbJ protein, the photosynthetic apparatus is highly light-sensitive. In order to measure the efficiency of electron transfer to downstream components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, we next set out to determine the activity of PSI. PSI function in wild-type and mutant plants was deduced from absorption measurements at 830 nm. Absorption changes at 830 nm correlate with the redox state of the PSI reaction center chlorophyll, P700. In the dark, P700 is present in its reduced form (19.Harbinson J. Hedley C.L. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 649-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Illumination of dark-adapted leaves with far red light selectively excites PSI, thereby converting P700 in its oxidized form (Fig. 7). This PSI-induced absorption shift is observed for the wild type as well as for all leaves from ΔpsbJ plants, including the mature leaves grown under normal light (100 μmol quanta m−2s−1), which had almost no measurable PSII activity, confirming that the knockout of psbJ primarily affects PSII. However, in all leaf samples from the mutant, the intensity of the absorption change was significantly lower than in the equivalent wild-type sample, suggesting that ΔpsbJ plants may have fewer active PSI units than the wild type (Fig. 7). When short pulses of white light are superimposed onto the continuous far red light, electrons are released from PSII and transferred to PSI, where they lead to a rereduction of P700, which again can be monitored as an absorption change at 830 nm (Fig. 7). This PSII-dependent rereduction of P700 was observed for young mutant leaves but was significantly impaired in mature leaves fromΔpsbJ plants (Fig. 7). Altogether, these physiological data suggest that, whileΔpsbJ plants are capable of synthesizing principally functional photosystems, (i) PSII function appears to be highly light-sensitive in a leaf age-dependent manner and (ii) PSI levels or activity may be reduced in the absence of the PsbJ polypeptide. Having established that the light reactions of photosynthesis still function to some extent in ΔpsbJ plants, we were interested to know whether or not the electron transfer capacity in the mutant was sufficient to sustain photoautotrophic growth. We therefore transferred cuttings from ΔpsbJ plants to sucrose-free synthetic medium. In this way, continued growth was made dependent on net photosynthetic carbon fixation.

Factors related to the virus itself, to the host and/or to environmental exposures probably account for these observations. The HIV protein Tat, a viral regulator required for efficient transcription of the viral genome in host cells is secreted from infected cells and taken up by uninfected by-stander cells. Tat can also act as a general transcriptional activator of key inflammatory molecules. We have examined whether Tat contributes to this endothelial cell activation by activating NF-κB. Human endothelial cells exposed to Tat in the culture medium activated E-selectin expression with delayed kinetics compared with tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Tat-mediated E-selectin up-regulation required the basic domain of Tat and was inhibited by a Tat antibody. Transfection of human E-selectin promoter-luciferase reporter constructs into Tat-bearing cells or into endothelial cells co-transfected with a Tat expression vector resulted in induction of luciferase expression. Either Tat or TNF activated p65 translocation and binding to an oligonucleotide containing the E-selectin κB site 3 sequence. Tat-mediated p65 translocation was also delayed compared with TNF. Neither agent induced new synthesis of p65.

Inflammation-mediated tissue destruction results from recruitment and extravasation of inflammatory cells at some tissue site, usually because of injury or infection. Host-pathogen interactions trigger the inflammatory response, and the balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory forces will determine the outcome of the infection. The vascular endothelium is an essential component of this balance and contributes to the separation between vascular and interstitial spaces. At areas of inflammation, neutrophils are recruited by a combination of adhesion molecule up-regulation and chemokine secretion. The leukocytes in turn activate their own inflammatory programs of increased reactive oxygen species generation and cytokine secretion. Endothelial cells respond in kind by becoming further activated. Accordingly, diseases that affect the endothelium result in marked vasculopathies and failure of the endothelial barrier.

On the other hand, transgenic mice carrying a replication-defective provirus develop smooth muscle hypertrophy as well as adventitial infiltration by T-lymphocytes. This vascular remodeling leads to narrowing of the blood vessels of different sizes with the resultant ischemia in organs such as brain, heart, kidney, pancreas, and spleen (5.Tinkle B.T. Ngo L.

Loewenstein P.M. Green M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9357-9361Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Expression of Tat is critical for productive HIV infection. Thetat gene consists of 2 coding exons. The first one, which encodes 72 amino acids, is sufficient to activate HIV LTR-mediated gene expression in co-transfection promoter-reporter assays (7.Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). However, in the context of viral infection, where the integrated provirus is subject to chromatin influences, the second exon is required for trans activation of the LTR (8.Jeang K.T. Berkhout B. Dropulic B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24940-24949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exon 1 contains the cysteine-richtrans-activation domain, the core, and an arginine-rich motif that is responsible for Tat-TAR RNA interactions (9.Barillari G. Gendelman R. Gallo R.C. Ensoli B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7941-7945Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 10.Brake D.A. Debouck C. Biesecker G. J.

Virol. 1999; 73: 7080-7086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second exon codes for the remaining amino acids. Tat acts by binding to a region located at the 5′-end of the viral transcript. This region, called TAR, forms a stable stem-loop structure having a high affinity for Tat (7.Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 11.Taube R. Fujinaga K. Wimmer J. Barboric M. Peterlin B.M. Virology. 1999; 264: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminaltrans-activation domain, when tethered to TAR, strongly interacts with cyclin T1, which is a component of transcription elongation factor β (7.Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol.

The cyclin-dependent kinase 9 that is part of this complex then phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. This phosphorylation facilitates the elongation step by preventing premature termination and ensures production of the full-length viral transcript (16.Okamoto H. Sheline C.T. Corden J.L. Jones K.A.

The end result is a significant increase in the production of viral proteins, essential for productive infection. Tat can be secreted from infected cells and circulates in the bloodstream of infected individuals. From the circulation, Tat enters uninfected cells and once internalized, it alters cellular physiology by positively or negatively affecting gene expression. For example, Tat activates transforming growth factor-β expression in human chondrocytes (19.Lotz M. Clarklewis I. Ganu V. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), TNF expression in mononuclear cells (20.Buonaguro L. Buonaguro F.M. Giraldo G. Ensoli B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2677-2682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IL-8 secretion in endothelial cells (21.Hofman F.M. Chen P. Incardona F. Zidovetzki R. Hinton D.R. J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 94: 28-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and T cell lines following CD3- and CD28-mediated co-stimulation (22.Ott M. Lovett J.L. Mueller L. Verdin E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2872-2880PubMed Google Scholar). Tat increases IL-1β production in monocytic cells, and IL-6 protein and mRNA in astrocytes, both effects independent of TNF-α production (23.Nath A. Conant K. Chen P. Scott C. Major E.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17098-17102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Tat also increases FAS and FAS-ligand transcription, presumably via NF-κB (24.Li-Weber M. Laur O. Dern K. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and induces IL-10 in peripheral blood monocytes (25.Badou A. Bennasser Y. Moreau M. Leclerc C. Benkirane M. Bahraoui E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10551-10562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Microglia exposed to Tat induce nitric-oxide synthase and NO production, and this induction is also dependent upon NF-κB (26.Polazzi E. Levi G. Minghetti L. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). On the other hand, negative effects include repression of major histocompatibility class-I gene promoter activity (27.Howcroft T.K. Strebel K. Martin M.A. Singer D.S. Science. 1993; 260: 1320-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and of the important antioxidant enzyme maganese-superoxide dismutase (28.Flores S.C. Marecki J.C. Harper K.P. Bose S.K.

Interestingly, a deregulation of cytokine expression and/or secretion is a hallmark of HIV infection (29.Buonaguro L. Barillari G. Chang H.K. Bohan C.A. Kao V. Morgan R. Gallo R.C. Ensoli B. J.

Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that Tat may be having some of its positive transcriptional effects through NF-κB activation. Indeed, Tat activates the transcription factor NF-κB in HeLa cells. This activation is mediated by PKR, the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, which phosphorylates IκB leading to its degradation (14.Demarchi F. Gutierrez M.I. Giacca M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7080-7086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent NF-κB translocation into the nucleus increases expression of a cascade of inflammatory genes. Tat introduced via liposomes results in nuclear translocation of NF-κB (34.Demarchi F. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Falaschi A. Giacca M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4427-4437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and induction of CD69 gene transcription in an erythroleukemia cell line (35.Blazquez M.V. Macho A. Ortiz C. Lucena C. Lopez-Cabrera M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Munoz E. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1999; 15: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and interleukin-8 secretion in a T-cell line (22.Ott M. Lovett J.L. Mueller L. Verdin E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2872-2880PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular Tat is associated with an increase in both NF-κB binding and protein kinase C activity in primary fetal human astrocytes (36.Conant K. Ma M. Nath A. Major E.O. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Tat does not activate the NF-κB responsive reporter construct, (PRDII)4-CAT, but can synergize with NF-κB in the activation of both HIV-derived and non-HIV-derived promoters (37.Kelly G.D. Morris C.B. Offermann M.K. Virology. 1999; 263: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Tat induces matrix metalloproteinase-9 in monocytes through protein-tyrosine phosphatase-mediated activation of NF-κB (38.Kumar A. Dhawan S. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In Jurkat T cells, Tat-mediated activation of NF-κB is dependent upon activation of the T cell-specific tyrosine kinase p56lck (33.Manna S.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5156-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, Tat-mediated NF-κB activation may be via multiple signal transduction pathways. The adhesion molecule E-selectin is induced at inflammatory sites where it exhibits restricted and tightly regulated expression in endothelial cells. E-selectin up-regulation is accomplished via increased cytokines such as TNF, and mediated in part by two closely apposed NF-κB sites (39.Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies demonstrated that as part of the immune activation seen in AIDS patients, soluble E-selectin levels were elevated (40.Seigneur M. Constans J. Blann A. Renard M. Pellegrin J.L. Amiral J. Boisseau M. Conri C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,41.Sfikakis P.P. Tzavara V. Sipsas N. Kosmopoulou O. Sfikakis P. Kordossis T. Infection. 1995; 23: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tat increases E-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (42.Dhawan S. Puri R.K. Kumar A. Duplan H. Masson J.M. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 1997; 90: 1535-1544PubMed Google Scholar). Because endothelial cell adhesiveness for neutrophils consists of an interplay between adhesion molecules and circulating neutrophils, and since Tat has been demonstrated to increase E-selectin expression in normal endothelial cells and activate NF-κB in some cells, we examined whether the Tat-mediated increases in E-selectin expression require NF-κB. Here we demonstrate for the first time that this Tat-mediated up-regulation of E-selectin requires NF-κB and the synthesis of new macromolecules. Furthermore, consistent with previous reports of Tat-mediated NF-κB activation in HeLa cells, we demonstrate that the basic domain of Tat is necessary for this induction. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG), antibiotics, cycloheximide, actinomycin D, cell dissociation buffer, IGEPAL (Nonidet P-40), salts, bovine heart cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and buffers were purchased from Sigma. GSH-Sepharose and ECL chemiluminescence kit were from Amersham Bioscience; tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) used for all the present studies was obtained from Pepro Tech, Inc.; fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Cd62E (clone 1.2B6) was obtained from Research Diagnostics Inc.; antibodies against p65, p52, RelB, Sp3, and actin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; antibodies against cRel were obtained from Rockland, and p50 from Geneka Biotechnology Inc. Endothelial cell culture medium was EGM-2 (EGM-2 Bullet kit, BioWhittaker, San Diego, CA), supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. Serum-free Opti-MEM and neomycin were purchased from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD). Bradford reagent for protein determination was purchased from Bio-Rad. The Tat antibody was kindly provided by the AIDS Reference and Research Reagent Program and was originally contributed by Dr. Bryan Cullen (43.Hauber J. Perkins A. Heimer E.P. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Superfect reagent for transfection was purchased from Qiagen and used according to manufacturer's specifications. Plasmid GST-Tat (GST-Tat 1 86R TK) contains the 2-exon 86-amino acid wild-type tat gene cloned into pGEX2TK (Amersham Bioscience); pGST-Tat 1 48Δ TK is truncated after amino acid 48 and contains a functional activation domain; pGST-Tat 1 48Δ C22G contains a truncation after amino acid 48, and a non-functional activation domain because there is a point mutation at cysteine 22. All of these GST fusion vectors were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program and contributed by Dr. Andrew P. Rice. Parental vector pGEX-2TK was purchased from Amersham Bioscience. This vector is designed for inducible expression of genes as fusions with the Schistosoma japonicum glutathioneS-transferase (GST). Because the fusion constructs are under the control of the tac promoter, induction with IPTG leads to high levels of expression. Affinity chromatography with GSH-Sepharose followed by thrombin cleavage is used to purify the protein of interest. Plasmid pMT/V5-His C (Invitrogen) is aDrosophila expression vector that carries the fly metallothionein promoter, which allows for CuSO4 induction of cloned genes. The HIV-1 86-amino acid Tat was cloned into the multiple cloning site of this vector to generate the plasmid pMT-tat. 2A. E. Casullo, N. C. Flores, L. Uyetake, A. Cota-Gomez, and S. C. Flores, manuscript in preparation. Plasmid pELAM-Luc (pE-Luc), kindly provided by Dr. Tom McIntyre, contains sequences 840 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site of the human E-selectin gene driving firefly luciferase transcription. Control plasmid pGL3B containing the promoterless luciferase gene was obtained from Promega Biotechnology. Plasmid pCoHygro, obtained from Invitrogen, containing a hygromycin resistance gene under the control of the Drosophila copia promoter, was used for the generation of stable S2-tat cells. Plasmid pHOOK-3 (Invitrogen), an expression vector carrying the cytomegalovirus promoter, was used to create a pHOOK-tat expression vector for transient transfections of mammalian cells. HUVEC were obtained from BioWhittaker and maintained in EGM-2. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 6.5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Adhesion molecule induction via NF-κB declines as passage number increases and is sensitive to growth state, therefore, expanded cells were used at passages 2–3 and cells at 3 days postconfluence were used for all the experiments. HeLa and HeLa-tat cells were obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program and contributed by Drs. W. Haseltine and E. Terwilliger. These cells were cultured in Opti-MEM with 3.75% fetal calf serum in the absence of antibiotics. The HeLa-tat cells were grown in the presence of 800 μg/ml neomycin. Schneider 2 (S2) Drosophila cells were purchased from Invitrogen and cultured in complete DrosophilaExpression System medium according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transfection and selection of stable S2-tat cells, S2 cells were grown in 6-well culture dishes to a density of 1 × 106 cells, collected, washed, and co-transfected with pCoHygro/pmT-tat via Ca3PO4. Cells were plated and allowed to recover for 24 h in complete Drosophila Expression System medium. Stable clones were selected by growth in 300 μg/ml hygromycin for at least 2 months. Transgene expression was induced by 24 h incubation in the presence of 500 μmCuSO4. HeLa or HeLa-tat cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well on 6-well tissue culture dishes and grown until 60% confluence. Cells were washed with sterile PBS and incubated in the presence of 2 μg of pE-Luc or pGL3B in Superfect reagent for 18 h. Cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega luciferase transfection kit) according to the manufacturer, lysate collected, and total protein determined. Aliquots of 20 μl were assayed for light emission with a plate-reader luminometer. In a separate series of experiments, HUVEC were seeded in 6-well tissue culture dishes and grown to 60% confluence. Transfection and luciferase assays were performed as described above, except that the cells were co-transfected with equimolar amounts of either pHOOK-3/pE-Luc or pHOOK-tat/pE-Luc. For nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extraction, confluent HUVEC cultures grown on 10-cm tissue culture dishes were washed with sterile PBS and fed 5 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM containing 20 ng/ml recombinant human TNF, 500 ng/ml recombinant Tat, or the indicated control medium for 1 h. After addition of 5 ml of EGM-2 containing 2% fetal calf serum, cells were incubated for the indicated times. Therefore, no serum was present during the first hour of incubation, and only 1% during the remainder. Cells were harvested by rinsing twice with PBS (calcium and magnesium-free), followed by incubation in a non-enzymatic cell dissociation buffer for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were detached by scraping, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and pelleted at 5,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was removed, cells resuspended in 1 ml of cold hypotonic buffer (10 mmHEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm KCl adjusted to pH 7.9 with KOH) containing 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.3 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm DTT, and washed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 5 times the packed cell volume of cold hypotonic buffer with protease inhibitors as described above and allowed to swell on ice for 20 min. IGEPAL was then added to 0.1% and the swollen cells incubated an additional 5 min on ice followed by homogenization with 20 strokes of a microtube pestle homogenizer (Fisher Scientific). Cell lysis and nuclear integrity were verified by trypan blue exclusion analysis. Nuclei were pelleted at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction was transferred to another tube and stored at −80 °C until further use. The nuclei were resuspended in 3–4 times the packed nuclear volumes of cold hypotonic buffer with protease inhibitors as above, washed once by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C, and resuspended gently in one-half packed nuclear volume of cold low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, pH 7.9). One-quarter packed nuclear volume of cold hypertonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mmKCl, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2 at pH 7.9) was added in a dropwise manner to prevent lysis of the nuclei. Nuclear proteins were extracted at 4 °C for 30 min, with a gently rotating motion. The nuclear protein extract was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford reagent microassay protocol using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To assess the purity of the fractions and to test our cell fractionation technique, 15 μg of nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins extracted from HUVEC, HeLa, or HeLa-tatcells were immunoblotted with actin or Sp3 antibodies. Nuclear proteins were diluted in a 2:1 mixture of low salt:hypertonic buffer to a concentration of 0.75 μg/μl and 2.5 μg of this protein were used in the binding reaction. This procedure ensured that the salt as well as the protein concentration was the same in all the reactions. The oligonucleotide used contained the human E-selectin κB site 3 (39.Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) flanked by additional E-selectin-specific sequences: 5′- GCCATTGGGGATTTCCTCTTT-3′ (κB site underlined). Complementary oligos (Invitrogen) were annealed and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Labeled oligos were separated from unincorporated nucleotides using a Sephadex G-25 spin column (5 Prime → 3 Prime). The labeled probe was diluted to 8–12 fmol/μl (∼10,000 cpm) and 1 μl/binding reaction was used. The binding reaction also contained 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm, Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), and 2.5 μg of nuclear protein (3.3 μl of 0.75 μg/ml dilution) in a final volume of 9 μl. For competition studies, 50-fold molar excess of cold competitor κB or an irrelevant oligonucleotide was included. The reaction was mixed by gentle rocking and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After binding, 1 μl of 10 × EMSA buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 40% glycerol) was added to each reaction and loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel (40:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) containing 1 × TGE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 190 mmglycine, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) and 10% glycerol. The protein complexes were separated at 12 mA/gel for ∼2 h. Gels were driedin vacuo and exposed to Bio-Max X-Ray (Kodak) film. Multiple exposures of the film were obtained to ensure that the signal was within the linear range of the film. After 20 min incubation of the oligonucleotide and the nuclear protein extract, 1 μg of antibodies against p50, p65, RelB, cRel, or p52 was added and the mixture incubated for an additional 15 min before electrophoresis. The HIV-1 Tat protein was purified in our laboratory as described (44.Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using affinity chromatography. The truncated Tat mutants and the parental GST were purified using the same method. Expression from these vectors results in GST-fusion proteins, linked by a thrombin-sensitive peptide. Host Escherichia coli cells were grown toA 590 = 0.5–0.7 in 500 ml of culture volume. Induction of fusion proteins was achieved by growth in the presence of 0.1 mm IPTG for 2.5 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g, the pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of EBC-DTT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% IGEPAL, and 5 mm DTT) and sonicated for 1 min twice, with a 1-min incubation on ice between sonications. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation in microtubes at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and frozen at −80 °C. For GST-Tat purification, all of the buffers were degassed to minimize the exposure of Tat to oxygen. This treatment consistently gave biologically active Tat preparations.

https://openalex.org/W1987558980,"Several tissues of Mirabilis jalapaL. (Nyctaginaceae) were assayed for inhibition of translation by a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (as a signal of ribosome-inactivating activity) and for adenine DNA glycosylase activity, activities that are both due to the presence of a class of enzymes called ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), currently classified as rRNAN-glycosylases (EC 3.2.2.22). These activities were highest in seed; intermediate in flower bud, immature seed, sepal + gynoecium, leaf, and root; and very low in all other tissues. By cation-exchange chromatography, four protein peaks with inhibitory activity on cell-free translation were identified in extracts from seeds, and two proteins were isolated from peaks 1 and 4, all of which have the properties of single-chain type 1 RIP. One is Mirabilisantiviral protein (MAP), so far purified only from roots. The second is a new protein that we propose to call MAP-4. The distribution of MAP and MAP-4 in several tissues was determined with a novel experimental approach based on liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The direct enzymatic activity of MAP on several substrates is described here for the first time. MAP depurinated not only rRNA in intact ribosomes, thus inhibiting protein synthesis, but also other polynucleotides such as poly(A), DNA, and tobacco mosaic virus RNA. Autologous DNA was depurinated more extensively than other polynucleotides. Therefore, the enzymatic activity of this protein may be better described as adenine polynucleotide glycosylase activity rather than rRNAN-glycosylase activity. Finally, MAP does not cross-react immunologically with other commonly utilized RIPs. Several tissues of Mirabilis jalapaL.

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 785-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Besides the classical type 1 and 2 RIPs, a 60-kDa RIP (called JIP60) has been identified in barley (Hordeum vulgare) that consists of an amino-terminal domain closely related to the RIP enzymatic chain linked to an unrelated carboxyl-terminal domain with unknown function (5.Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Lehmann J. Becker W. Apel K. Parthier B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7012-7016Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); this protein may be classified as type 3 RIP (3.Peumans W.J. Hao Q. Van Damme E.J.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1493-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of this class of proteins became clearer when it was found that ricin and subsequently all RIPs tested release a single adenine residue from ribosomes in a precise position (A4324 in the case of rat liver ribosomes) of a universally conserved GAGA sequence in a peculiar stem-loop structure (review in Ref. 2.Endo Y. Frankel A.E. Immunotoxins. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1988: 75-89Google Scholar). They were thus classified as rRNAN-glycosidases (EC 3.2.2.22). Subsequently, it was observed that some RIPs release more than one adenine residue from ribosomes, that others act on RNA species apart from ribosomal RNA and on poly(A), and that all RIPs release adenine from DNA. Thus, the enzymatic activity of RIP was defined as polynucleotide:adenosine glycosidase (6.Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Bonora E. Gorini P. Bolognesi A. Stirpe F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), which we propose to change to adenine polynucleotide glycosylase (APG) in analogy with the EC nomenclature of nucleic acid glycosylases. ribosome-inactivating proteins adenine polynucleotide glycosylase pokeweed antiviral protein human immunodeficiency virus Mirabilis antiviral protein tobacco mosaic virus herring sperm DNA high pressure liquid chromatography liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry Two main biological properties of RIPs, viz. (i) inhibition of multiplication of plant viruses (reviewed in Ref. 4.Nielsen K. Boston R.S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Acta. 1993; 1154: 237-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), upon entry into eukaryotic cells, led to several applications. In agriculture, plants were transfected with RIP genes, viz. barley RIP, pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP), trichosanthin, and dianthin, to confer resistance to viruses and fungi (reviewed in Ref. 4.Nielsen K. Boston R.S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 785-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In traditional Chinese medicine, trichosanthin and momordin have been used as abortifacient agents (reviewed in Ref. 1.Barbieri L. Battelli M.G. Stirpe F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 237-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). RIPs are currently under study as therapeutic agents against cancer (review in Ref. 7.Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 1998; 31: 53-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and possibly HIV infection (8.Pincus S.H. Antiviral Res. 1996; 33: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) after linkage to antibodies (immunotoxins) or other specific carrier molecules to make them selectively toxic to a given type of target cells. One of the unsolved problems in the clinical use of immunotoxins is the immune response elicited against both the mouse monoclonal antibody and the toxic moiety that prevents repeated administrations. This problem can be partially circumvented by the use of immunotoxins prepared with human or humanized antibodies and different RIPs that do not cross-react with each other. Thus, the availability of a set of non-cross-reacting RIPs should be highly valuable in this kind of therapeutic strategy. A potent antiviral activity was found in extracts from a yellow flower cultivar of Mirabilis jalapa L. (Nyctaginaceae) in root, leaf, and stem tissues and in in vitro cultured cells (9.Kubo S. Ikeda T. Imaizumi S. Takanami Y. Mikami Y. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Jpn. 1990; 56: 481-487Crossref Google Scholar,10.Ikeda T. Takanami Y. Imaizumi S. Matsumoto T. Mikami Y. Kubo S. Plant Cell Rep. 1987; 6: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). From the roots of M. jalapa, a protein was then purified that was highly effective in preventing viral infection caused by contact-transmitted virus (11.Takanami Y. Kwata S. Ikeda T. Kubo S. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Jpn. 1990; 56: 488-494Crossref Google Scholar). This protein, namedMirabilis antiviral protein (MAP), was later identified as a RIP (12.Kataoka J. Habuka N. Furuno M. Miyano M.

Here, we describe the distribution of both translation inhibitory activity (RIP activity) and, for the first time in any plant, APG activity in the different organs of M. jalapa. From the seeds of this plant, which contain the highest levels of both activities, two RIP isoforms were purified, and the most abundant one was characterized. This protein is identical to the isoform purified from root tissue, MAP (12.Kataoka J. Habuka N. Furuno M. Miyano M. Takanami Y. Koiwai A. J. Biol.

In plants, RIPs may be present with many isoforms in several tissues (PAPs in Phytolacca americana (reviewed in Ref. 17.Irvin J.D. Chessin M. DeBorde D. Zipf A. Antiviral Proteins in Higher Plants. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 65-94Google Scholar), saporins in Saponaria officinalis (14.Ferreras J.M. Barbieri L. Girbés T. Battelli M.G. Rojo M.A. Arias F.J. Rocher M.A. Soriano F.

In this study, the distribution of the two major isoforms of MAP in six tissues was determined, and the hitherto unknown APG activity and immunological properties of MAP are described. M. jalapa (red flower cultivar) tissues were collected from plants grown in the garden of the Dipartimento di Patologia Sperimentale, Università di Bologna.l-[U-14C]leucine andl-[4,5-3H]leucine were from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Materials for low-pressure chromatography, including calibrating substances, were from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). Adenine, tRNA, and electrophoresis markers were from Sigma. Poly(A), genomic RNA from tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), and rRNA from Escherichia coli(16 S + 23 S, Mr = 1.75 × 106) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Cell culture medium and supplements and all other chemicals were as described in previous work (18.Bolognesi A. Polito L. Olivieri F. Valbonesi P. Barbieri L. Battelli M.G. Carusi M.V. Benvenuto E.

Strocchi (University of Bologna). Chloroacetaldehyde was prepared according to McCann et al. (19.McCann W.P. Hall L.M. Nonidez W.K. Anal.

Milli-Q water (Millipore Corp., Milford, MA) was used when applicable. DNA from herring sperm (hsDNA) (Sigma) was mechanically sheared and made RNA-free by treatment with DNase-free RNase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2.5 h at 37 °C. DNA was then repeatedly precipitated in ethanol to remove the enzyme. Genomic DNA from M. jalapa leaves, prepared following the general procedure described by Ausubel et al. (20.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1987: 4.5.1-4.5.3Google Scholar), was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, twice phenol-extracted, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in the same buffer. DNA was then subjected to mechanical shearing and RNase treatment as described for hsDNA. Poly(A)+ RNA fromBryonia dioica leaves was obtained by extraction on oligo(dT)-cellulose as described by Ausubel et al. (20.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1987: 4.5.1-4.5.3Google Scholar). Fresh plant materials were frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground in a mortar, and homogenized with an Ultraturrax apparatus (Ika, Staufen, Germany) in cold phosphate-buffered saline (0.14 mNaCl and 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5)). Mature seeds and sepals + gynoecia were homogenized in 8 ml and all other tissues in 5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline/g of starting material. The slurries were extracted overnight at 4 °C with magnetic stirring, filtered through cheesecloth, and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C (crude extracts). When appropriate, crude extracts were adjusted to pH 4.0 with glacial acetic acid and centrifuged again at 10,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to an SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (15 × 2.5 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5) at room temperature. The column was washed with 1 volume of the equilibration buffer and then extensively with 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and bound proteins were eluted with 1 m NaCl in the same buffer. Eluted protein was either dialyzed exhaustively against water at 4 °C (for further preparative processing) or concentrated at 4 °C in an Amicon concentrator equipped with a PM-10 membrane under nitrogen pressure (4 bars) and magnetic stirring and then desalted by chromatography on Sephadex G-25. These preparations are referred to as basic protein fractions and contained most, if not all, RIPs present in the starting material in all plant species and tissues assayed (21.Barbieri L. Bolognesi A. Stirpe F. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 166: 71-85PubMed Google Scholar). The basic protein fraction from 100 g of M. jalapa seeds was adjusted to 5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and applied to a CM-Sepharose Fast Flow column (42 × 1.6 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer at room temperature. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer until the absorbance at 280 nm was lowered to the base line and was eluted with 1 liter of a linear (0–300 mm) gradient of NaCl in the same buffer (see Fig. 1). Fractions appropriately diluted in phosphate-buffered saline were assayed for translation inhibitory activity by a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Active fractions from peaks indicated as MAP, MAP-2, MAP-3, and MAP-4 were pooled, dialyzed extensively against water at 4 °C, and stored frozen at −80 °C. Proteins obtained by cation-exchange chromatography were analyzed for purity and molecular mass by gel filtration, SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and reverse-phase HPLC as described (22.Bolognesi A. Olivieri F. Battelli M.G. Barbieri L. Falasca A.I. Parente A. Del Vecchio Blanco F. Stirpe F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 935-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Chromatographic conditions were as follows: protein C4 reverse-phase column (250 × 4.6 mm; Vydac) equipped with the appropriate pre-column and equilibrated and eluted at 20 °C at 1 ml/min; solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; and solvent B, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The column was equilibrated with 90:10 solvent A/solvent B and loaded with 100 μl of protein sample in water. Bound material was eluted with a linear gradient of solvent B up to 40% in 10 min and then to 60% in 50 min. The effluent was split; 5% was analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (single quadrupole ZMD, Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom); and molecular mass was calculated by the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt, Micromass). The remaining effluent was analyzed at 214 nm in a Kontron spectrophotometric monitor. The isoelectric point was determined with Phast system and PhastGel IEF 3–9 (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. N-terminal sequencing was performed as described (23.Parente A. de Luca P. Bolognesi A. Barbieri L. Battelli M.G. Abbondanza A. Sande M.J.W. Siniscalco Gigliano G. Tazzari P.L. Stirpe F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). TheE280 nm,1 cm1%of purified MAP was determined with water solutions of freeze-dried samples. The cross-reactivity of MAP with antibodies against other RIPs was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (22.Bolognesi A. Olivieri F. Battelli M.G. Barbieri L. Falasca A.I. Parente A. Del Vecchio Blanco F. Stirpe F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 935-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The identification of MAP isoforms in basic protein fractions was performed by LC/MS as described above. Protein was applied at ∼100 μg in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Murine 3T3 (fibroblasts) and human HeLa (carcinoma), NB100 (neuroblastoma), and BeWo (choriocarcinoma) cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Subcultures were obtained by trypsin treatment of confluent cultures. The JM cell line (human monocyte-derived) was grown in suspension and treated with phorbol myristate to induce adhesion as described by Bolognesi et al. (22.Bolognesi A. Olivieri F. Battelli M.G. Barbieri L. Falasca A.I. Parente A. Del Vecchio Blanco F. Stirpe F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 935-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis by cells was determined as described by Ferreras et al. (14.Ferreras J.M. Barbieri L. Girbés T. Battelli M.G. Rojo M.A. Arias F.J. Rocher M.A. Soriano F. Méndez E. Stirpe F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Other experimental details are described in the legend to Fig. 4. The effect of protein from M. jalapa on translation in a cell-free system (a rabbit reticulocyte lysate) was studied essentially as described by Parente et al. (23.Parente A. de Luca P. Bolognesi A. Barbieri L. Battelli M.G. Abbondanza A. Sande M.J.W. Siniscalco Gigliano G. Tazzari P.L. Stirpe F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained, in a final volume of 62.5 μl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm ammonium acetate, 2 mmmagnesium acetate, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, 15 mm phosphocreatine, 3 μg of creatine kinase, 0.05 mm amino acids (minus leucine), 89 nCi ofl-[U-14C]leucine, and 25 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Incubation was at 28 °C for 5 min. The enzymatic activity of the purified protein was determined by measuring adenine released from various substrates by HPLC (24.Zamboni M. Brigotti M. Rambelli F. Montanaro L. Sperti S. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) essentially following the procedure of McCann et al. (25.McCann W.P. Hall L.M. Siler W. Barton N. Whitley R.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 28: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as described by Barbieri et al. (26.Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Gorini P. Pession A. Stirpe F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Reactions were run for 40 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 50 μl containing 100 mm KCl, 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0), increasing concentrations of RIPs, and the indicated amounts of polynucleotide substrates. A standard curve of adenine was run with each experiment. The determination of bases other than adenine was performed as described (26.Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Gorini P. Pession A. Stirpe F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The determination of adenine released by crude extracts or basic protein fractions was done by LC/MS because of interference of compounds present in crude preparations with the derivatization step of the method described above. Briefly, the reaction was stopped in ice by the addition of 100 μl of ice-cold 10 mm ammonium acetate, and reagents were separated by solid-phase extraction on Bond Elute-NH2 minicolumns (Varian) equilibrated with 10 mm ammonium acetate as described (26.Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Gorini P. Pession A. Stirpe F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Adenine was measured by LC/MS on a Waters Alliance/zq apparatus. Chromatography to separate adenine was carried out on a Waters XTerra MS C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 2.5-μm beads) equilibrated and eluted with 10 mmammonium acetate (solvent A)/methanol (solvent B) at 0.3 ml/min at 15 °C. Equilibration was in 98:2 solvent A/solvent B; and after sample injection (120 μl), the column was eluted with equilibration solvents for 2 min and then with 90:10 solvent A/solvent B for 5 min. Tightly bound material was eluted with 20:80 acetonitrile/solvent A for 0.6 min, and equilibration was attained with 90:10 solvent A/solvent B for 1.2 min, followed by 98:2 solvent A/solvent B for 9 min. Mass spectrometric analysis was carried out in positive electrospray with a single-ion recording (m/z 135 + 1) on a split flow of ∼50 μl/min. Parameters were optimized manually for maximum sensitivity under the present column elution conditions. Duplicate chromatograms were combined to reduce noise using Micromass MaxLynx software. Samples containing standard adenine (from 1 to 300 pmol) were incubated and processed together with the experimental samples. A standard curve run with each experiment was fit by linear regression analysis, and adenine released from experimental samples was determined by plotting against the standard curve. The tissue distribution of RIP and APG activities was assayed both in crude extracts from most M. jalapa tissues and in basic protein fractions from root, mature shelled seed, immature unshelled seed, green leaf, flower bud, and sepal + gynoecium (Table I). The highest activity was found in mature seed.Table IDistribution of RIP and APG activities in M. jalapa tissuesTissueCrude extractBasic protein fractionRIP activityAPG activityRIP activityAPG activity% of root activitySeed (mature)97142616103300Flower bud3225760270Leaf (apical)1410.4Sepal + gynoecium1301.66040Seed (immature)1266114070Root(100) (100) (100) (100)Leaf (yellow)6457Leaf (intermediate color)6451Leaf (green)6236330830Petiole3210Petal + stamen270.3Stem2421Experimental details are given under “Experimental Procedures.” One unit of RIP activity is defined as the amount of protein necessary to reduce translation by 50% in 1 ml of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system under the present experimental conditions.

Samples were all run in duplicate, and controls with all reagents but no incubation were run in each experiment. The basic protein fraction from 100 g of seeds was loaded onto a CM-Sepharose column. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient, and the inhibitory activity was resolved into four protein peaks (Fig. 1). The first eluted protein, which is identical to MAP from roots (see below), and the fourth protein (MAP-4) appeared to be >98% homogeneous upon reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 2), and both gave a single band upon SDS-PAGE (data not shown). MAP was also pure when analyzed by gel filtration under nondenaturing conditions (data not shown). The inhibitory activity and protein yield at the various steps of purification are summarized in Table II. It should be noticed that the total activity recovered after the acidification and SP-Sepharose steps was higher than that present in the original crude extract. This has been observed previously with other RIPs (27.Barbieri L. Stoppa C. Bolognesi A. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 408: 235-243Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and possibly is due to removal of an inhibitor or to “activation” of the M. jalapa ribosome-inactivating proteins.Table IIPurification of RIP from M. jalapa seedsPurification stepTotal proteinIC50Specific activityTotal activityYieldmgng/mlunits × 10−3/mg proteinunits × 10−6%Crude extract10,98610960.99.99(100)Acidified extract36372244.516.22162Basic protein fraction11188312.113.47134CM-Sepharose eluate MAP22.65.4183.84.1642 MAP-22.541.424.20.061 MAP-33.513.375.20.263 MAP-45.515.365.40.364Results refer to 100 g of seeds.

To define its pharmacological specificity, we have used patch-clamp methods in cell lines expressing recombinant Ca(v)2.1, Ca(v)2.2, and Ca(v)2.3 channels (P/Q-, N-, and R-type currents, respectively). Calcium currents generated by Ca(v)2.1 and Ca(v)2.2 were blocked almost irreversibly by 3 nm omegaPtxIIA, whereas Ca(v)2.3 showed partial and readily reversible inhibition. Binding assays with mono[(125)I]iodo-omegaPtxIIA indicated that membranes expressing recombinant Ca(v)2.1 or Ca(v)2.2 channels showed a single class of sites with similar affinity (K(D) approximately 50 pm), whereas low affinity interactions were detectable with Ca(v)2.3. Kinetic, saturation, and displacement assays demonstrated that rat brain synaptosomes displayed multiple classes of binding sites for (125)I-omegaPtxIIA. High affinity binding of (125)I-omegaPtxIIA was totally displaced by omegaPtxIIA (K(i) = 100 pm), but only partially by omega-conotoxin GVIA (25% inhibition) and omega-conotoxin MVIIC (50% inhibition at 0.3 microm). (125)I-omegaPtxIIA thus defines a unique high affinity binding site that is predominantly associated with Ca(v)2.1 or Ca(v)2.2 channels."

We suggest that a similar relationship exists between other orthodox type II, type IIE, and type IIF restriction endonucleases. This may explain why similarities may be more pronounced between members of different subtypes of restriction enzymes than among the members of a given subtype. More than 3000 different type II restriction endonucleases are known and characterized with respect to their cleavage specificities (1.Roberts R.J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 268-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This group of enzymes probably constitutes one of the largest families of enzymes with the same basic function. This makes type II restriction endonucleases (like DNA methyltransferases) ideal objects to study evolutionary relationships. Moreover, in principle, the family relationships should eventually allow predicting structural and functional features of an individual restriction endonuclease, solely on the basis of sequence comparisons. This was not obvious for a long time since only 10 years ago restriction endonucleases, because of their little sequence conservation, were not considered to be related in evolution (2.Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 585-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 3.Heitman J. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering (NY). 15. Plenum Press, New York1993: 57-108Google Scholar).

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3705-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), which made it obvious that these enzymes have very similar structural cores. Nevertheless, it has been shown recently that some genuine restriction enzymes belong to distinct nuclease superfamilies (Nuc, HNH, and GIY-YIG), which are unrelated and structurally dissimilar to each other and to the “archetypal” (P)D … (D/E)XK superfamily (9.Sapranauskas R.

Our interest in studying this enzyme is due to its sequence similarity toEcoRII, a type IIE enzyme (reviewed in Ref. 19.Krüger D.H. Kupper D. Meisel A. Reuter M. Schroeder C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which being somewhat larger than SsoII is a dimer of identical subunits each consisting of 404 amino acid residues (20.Kossykh V.

New Biol. 1973; 244: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which means that SsoII and EcoRII can be considered to be quasi isoschizomers. Thus, these two enzymes have a similar “genotype” (amino acid sequence) and “phenotype” (recognition sequence) which suggest a relatively close evolutionary relationship (4.Jeltsch A. Kröger M. Pingoud A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sequence similarities between SsoII and EcoRII were first noticed by Morgan et al. (31.Morgan R.D. Xiao J.P. Xu S.Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3669-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They had determined the sequence of PspGI, an isoschizomer ofEcoRII, which is more similar in size (each subunit comprising 272 amino acid residues) and sequence to SsoII than to EcoRII. Morgan et al. (31.Morgan R.D. Xiao J.P. Xu S.Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3669-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified a conserved segment of 87 amino acid residues in these three enzymes and proposed that this segment is part of a common DNA recognition domain for CCXGG sequences. The significance of sequence similarities between SsoII and EcoRII was emphasized by Reuter et al. (32.Reuter M. Schneider-Mergener J. Kupper D. Meisel A. Mackeldanz P. Krüger D.H. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5213-5221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), who had identified by a peptide scanning technique two DNA-binding sites in EcoRII, one of which showed a highly significant similarity to SsoII (consisting of the sequence R(R/K)SRAGKXXE (DNA-binding site II)). The importance of the underlined lysine residues of the R(R/K)SRAGKXXE motif for the function of EcoRII was demonstrated by a mutational analysis as follows: the K263A/K268A and K263E/K268E variants were active in specific DNA binding but inactive in DNA cleavage (32.Reuter M.

In this study another DNA-binding site (DNA-binding site I) was identified, located in the N-terminal domain of EcoRII, not present inSsoII and PspGI, and it was proposed that this DNA-binding site is associated with a potential catalytic center. The importance of this binding site for the function of EcoRII was again demonstrated by a mutational analysis as follows: the K92A/K97A and K92E/K97E variants were severely impaired in DNA binding but were more or less active; the E96A variant, in contrast, was inactive in DNA cleavage. It was speculated by Reuter et al.(32.Reuter M. Schneider-Mergener J. Kupper D. Meisel A. Mackeldanz P. Krüger D.H. Schroeder C. J. Biol.

(31.Morgan R.D. Xiao J.P. Xu S.Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3669-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for PspGI, SsoII, andEcoRII extends into a region that contains a potential (P)D … (S)XK … (D/E) motif, identified as the catalytic motif in the type IIF restriction endonucleasesCfr10I (36.Bozic D.

Biol. 2000; 7: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The significance of this homology, however, was not realized by Morgan et al.(31.Morgan R.D. Xiao J.P. Xu S.Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3669-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The (P)D … (S)XK … (D/E) sequence could represent the catalytic center not only of SsoII andPspGI but also of EcoRII. This would imply that DNA-binding site I identified by Reuter et al. (32.Reuter M. Schneider-Mergener J. Kupper D. Meisel A. Mackeldanz P. Krüger D.H. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5213-5221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) is the effector site and not the catalytic center. The goal of this study was to identify amino acid residues involved in DNA recognition and cleavage by SsoII. Based on sequence alignments and structural comparisons and verified by a mutational analysis, we have identified two regions that are essential for the function of SsoII, one of which is very likely to harbor the catalytic center. The sequences characterizing these regions are present in several other orthodox type II as well as type IIE enzymes (which require binding of a substrate at the active site and the effector site) and IIF enzymes (which require binding of a substrate at two active sites formed by four identical subunits) that recognize CCGG, CCNGG, or CCWGG in different sequence contexts, an observation that has implications for the evolution of these subtypes of type II restriction endonucleases. Site-directed mutagenesis of the SsoII gene was performed by a PCR-based technique (40.Kirsch R.D. Joly E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The mutant genes were sequenced and found to contain only the mutation desired. The SsoII overproducing strain was kindly provided by Dr. A. Karyagina (Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology, Moscow, Russia). SsoII and its variants were expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 and purified to homogeneity as described by Sheflyan et al.(14.Sheflyan G.Y. Kubareva E.A. Kuznetsova S.A. Karyagina A.S. Nikolskaya I.I. Gromova E.S. Shabarova Z.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation was done in a Beckman XL-A Analytical Ultracentrifuge equipped with a photoelectric scanner. All experiments were done at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl. Sedimentation velocity experiments were done in an 8-place An50 Ti rotor with double sector centerpieces made of charcoal filled Epon at 45,000 rpm. To evaluate binding of double-stranded d(GCTGCCAACCTGGGTCTAAC) (US/LS-20a) toSsoII the concentrations of free and bound oligo 1The abbreviations used are: oligooligonucleotideUS/LS-20a were extracted from the measured profilesA(x,t) by fitting Equation 1,A(x,t)=∑i=12 Ai(xm,0)·(esiω2t) 2ςki2π ∫−∞x e−12y−xm·esiω2tςki2dyEquation 1 where xm is position of the meniscus;Ai(xm,0) is absorption of theith sedimenting boundary at the beginning of the experiment;si is sedimentation coefficient of theith sedimenting boundary; ςk is a parameter describing the width of each measured sedimentation profile; ω is angular velocity of the rotor. This fit corresponds to a description of the sedimenting boundaries by a Gaussian error function and yields the absorption for free oligo US/LS-20a and the sum of the absorptions for total SsoII and bound oligo US/LS-20a at the beginning of the sedimentation run. oligonucleotide For sedimentation equilibrium analysis samples of 120 μl were run in 6-channel centerpieces (column height ∼3 mm) at the specified speed until no change in concentration distribution could be observed for at least 12 h. Scans from these 12 h were averaged to reduce random noise. A simple aggregation model will describe the association ofn dimers of SsoII to form a single aggregate. For such a reaction the law of mass action can be written as Equation 2,Kaggn−1=[R.SsoIIn][R.SsoII] nEquation 2 with SsoIIn being the n-mer aggregate and Kagg the bimolecular equilibrium constant for aggregation. For evaluation of the sedimentation equilibrium the distribution of each species is calculated by numerically solvingci(x)=exp∫xmx Mi(1−ν̄iρ)RT ω2x′ dx′Equation 3 x(xm), radial position (of the meniscus), and ν̄i, partial specific volume of the ith species, where allci(x) must obey the above law of mass action. The partial specific volume for SsoII was calculated from the amino acid composition to be 7.25 × 10−4m3/kg. Gel filtration experiments were performed at room temperature on a Merck-Hitachi system using a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2. Free SsoII or SsoII in complex with oligo US/LS-20a were diluted in the same buffer and loaded onto the column. Chromatography was carried out at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 20 °C. Elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The molar masses were determined by interpolation, using a calibration curve of proteins of known molar mass (molecular weight marker kit, Sigma). Circular dichroism spectra were recorded in 10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl in a Jasco J-710 dichrograph at 20 °C in a cylindrical cuvette of 0.05-cm path length. The DNA cleavage activities of wild typeSsoII and the mutants were determined by performing cleavage experiments in cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C with32P-labeled PCR products as substrate. Cleavage experiments designed to compare the rates of cleavage of one- and two-site substrates by wild type SsoII were performed with two different PCR products containing one recognition sequence each with a different flanking base pair (GCCTGGG (325 bp) and CCCTGGG (221 bp)) and one PCR product containing both recognition sites (442 bp). Cleavage experiments that were carried out to determine the activity of the SsoII variants were carried out with the 325-bp substrate. After incubation for a specified time, reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were subsequently subjected to autoradiography using an instant imager (Packard Instrument Co.). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays SsoII and the respective variants were mixed with binding buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% (v/v) glycerol) in a total volume of 10 μl in addition containing 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) and 32P-labeled double-stranded d(GCTGCCACCCTGGGTCTAAC), oligo US/LS-20b. After incubation for 30 min at 20 °C, the samples were applied to a 12% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis for 5 h at 80 V (10 V/cm) in 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.5, 5 mmCaCl2, gels were subjected to autoradiography using an instant imager (Packard Instrument Co.). The multiple alignment was obtained based on PSI-BLAST searches of the non-redundant sequence data base at the NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and edited manually based on consensus secondary structure prediction and threading results reported by the Meta Server (41.Bujnicki J.M. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 750-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 42.Lundstrom J. Rychlewski L. Bujnicki J.M. Elofsson A. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2354-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) with the links to the individual methods provided therein and at the website bioinfo.pl/meta/. The alignment of NgoMIV andCfr10I was based on the structural superposition of the atomic coordinates. The neighbor-joining tree (43.Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) was estimated from 100 bootstrap resamplings of the conserved alignment. Homology modeling of the core region (residues 115–257) ofSsoII was performed using Swiss-PdbViewer and Swiss model (44.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9389) Google Scholar) based on the coordinates of the NgoMIV-product complex (39.Deibert M. Grazulis S. Sasnauskas G. Siksnys V. Huber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A series of alternative models of the SsoII monomer were submitted to the Verify3D server (45.Eisenberg D. Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar) to evaluate compatibility of the residues with the environment. The best structure was used to model the interactions of SsoII with the cleaved target DNA. At the outset, the coordinates of the double-stranded d(GCGCCGGCGC) containing the NgoMIV target sequence were copied to the model from the template structure. Subsequently, theSsoII-DNA complex was duplicated and positioned in such a way that one of the subunits remained superimposed onto the corresponding NgoMIV monomer, whereas the other was shifted and rotated to reflect insertion of 1 bp in the middle of the DNA sequence. It was immediately recognized that preservation of theNgoMIV-like structure of the DNA and orientation of the active sites in respect to the “CC” element in bothSsoII monomers lead to unresolvable steric clashes and loss of contact of Arg-186 and Arg-188 side chains with the “GG” element. Thus, the 185–189 loop of SsoII was separately superimposed onto the 190–195 loop of NgoMIV to mimic its interaction with the “GG” element. Subsequently, the two subunits were mutually rotated together with the DNA to reduce the overlap at the dimer interface and to bring the ends of the displaced 185–189 loop close enough to the original attachment points to allow reconnection of the polypeptide backbone without distortion of the neighboring regions. As an outcome, the model of theSsoII-DNA complex contains two regions of interaction with the CC and the GG elements that closely resemble those of theNgoMIV template structure but which could not be simultaneously superimposed onto it. The final model of the monomer was refined using GROMOS (46.Scott W.R.P. Hunenberger P.H. Tironi I.G. Mark A.E. Billeter S.R. Fennen J. Torda A.E. Huber T. Kruger P. van Gunsteren W.F. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 3596-3607Crossref Scopus (1249) Google Scholar), duplicated, and docked onto the DNA created from two NgoMIV half-sites “GCGCC” with an additional AT base pair manually inserted in the middle. We show here that SsoII shares sequence similarities with EcoRII, Cfr10I, and NgoMIV (among others). The most interesting aspect of this is that EcoRII,Cfr10I, and NgoMIV require simultaneous binding of two substrates (or one substrate with two recognition sites) for efficient cleavage. Whereas EcoRII is a type IIE enzyme, which are homodimeric proteins with two distinct binding sites for their respective recognition sequences, one being the active site and the other the effector site, Cfr10I and NgoMIV are type IIF enzymes, which are composed of four identical subunits that form two active sites which in a coordinate manner cleave the two recognition sites (47.Halford S.E. Bilcock D.T. Stanford N.P. Williams S.A. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A. Watson M.A. Bath A.J. Embleton M.L. Gowers D.M. Daniels L.E. Parry S.H. Szczelkun M.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 696-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In order to characterize the relationship between SsoII and the type IIE (EcoRII) and type IIF (Cfr10I and NgoMIV) enzymes, it had to be investigated to what subtype of type II restriction endonucleasesSsoII belongs and to find out whether the sequence similarities between SsoII on one hand and type IIE and IIF enzymes on the other hand concern functionally important residues. Orthodox type II restriction enzymes are homodimeric enzymes. The quaternary structure of SsoII is not known. In order to determine the native molar mass of SsoII, analytical ultracentrifugation and gel filtration experiments were carried out. Sedimentation velocity runs with free SsoII showed that most of the protein (>80%) sedimented with 5 S. Because the largest sedimentation coefficient for a protein with a mass of 35.9 kDa is 3.77 S, the value of 5 S shows that the predominant form ofSsoII is a dimer. A minor component (<20%) sedimented with ∼20 S indicating the presence of larger aggregates (data not shown). Fig. 1A shows the result of a sedimentation equilibrium experiment with SsoII. Assuming an aggregation equilibrium, the concentration profile can best be described by a reaction of dimers, the predominant species at micromolar concentrations, interacting in a concentration-dependent manner with each other to form an aggregate consisting of ∼14 dimers, with a bimolecular equilibrium constant, Kagg, of 1 × 105m−1 which would yield half of the dimer being engaged in aggregates at a total concentration of 3 × 10−4m. The presence of significant amounts of monomers is incompatible with the measured protein concentration profile as is an association of dimers forming only tetramers. Fig. 1B shows the sedimentation profiles of a mixture ofSsoII and excess oligo US/LS-20a, a double-stranded eicosadeoxynucleotide containing one recognition site in a central position. From the evaluation of the absorption of the two sedimenting boundaries a stoichiometry of one oligo US/LS-20a binding to oneSsoII dimer can be deduced. Gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column showed that SsoII coelutes with bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) indicating that the quaternary structure of SsoII is that of a dimer (72 kDa). In the presence of Ca2+ and an excess of oligo US/LS-20a, the SsoII-DNA complex eluted with an apparent mass of 80 kDa, which is in good agreement with the calculated mass of 84 kDa for the 1:1 complex (data not shown). The results of the analytical ultracentrifugation and the gel filtration experiments demonstrate that SsoII-like orthodox type II restriction endonucleases is a homodimer, both in the absence and presence of DNA. Our finding that SsoII is a homodimer is somewhat at variance with a result obtained for a very close relative ofSsoII, namely Ecl18kI which differs only in one position (position 232 where SsoII has an isoleucine andEcl18kI a valine residue) (48.Den'mukhametov M.M. Zakharova M.V. Kravets A.N. Pertsev A.V. Sineva E.V. Repik A.V. Beletskaia I.V. Gromova E.S. Solonin A.S. Mol. Biol. (Moscow). 1997; 31: 831-838PubMed Google Scholar), based on a gel filtration analysis Ecl18kI was identified to be a homotetramer (49.Den'mukhametov M.M. Brevnov M.G. Zakharova M.V. Repyk A.V. Solonin A.S. Petrauskene O.V. Gromova E.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Of course, it cannot be excluded that a valine for isoleucine substitution could change a dimer to tetramer equilibrium. SsoII shows sequence similarity to EcoRII, a typical type IIE restriction endonuclease, which requires binding to two recognition sites for efficient cleavage (22.Krüger D.H. Barcak G.J. Reuter M. Smith H.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3997-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To find out whether SsoII behaves like a type IIE enzyme, DNA cleavage experiments were carried out with substrates containing one or two sites. PCR products containing one (221- and 325-mer) or two sites (442-mer) are cleaved with rates dependent on the sequence context, CCCTGGG (kapp = 0.26 ± 0.03 min−1) is cleaved faster than GCCTGGC (kapp = 0.15 ± 0.02 min−1), but independent of whether one or two sites are present (Fig. 2). Cleavage of the 325-mer (which contains only one site) could not be stimulated in trans, as observed for EcoRII (50.Reuter M. Kupper D. Pein C.D. Petrusyte M. Siksnys V. Frey B. Krüger D.H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), by addition of oligo US/LS-20a in concentrations varied from 0.5- to 5-fold excess; in contrast, with increasing concentration of the oligodeoxynucleotide an inhibition of the cleavage of the 325-mer was observed (data not shown). The cleavage of the 1-site and 2-site substrates was investigated at different ionic strengths. With increasing ionic strength (from 50 to 150 mm NaCl)SsoII cleaves the substrates with one (221 bp, CCCTGGG) or two recognition sites (442 bp, CCCTGGG and GCCTGGG) with reduced but equal rates (data not shown). These results confirm thatSsoII, despite its sequence similarity to EcoRII, is an orthodox type II enzyme. Sequence similarities betweenSsoII (recognition sequence: ↓CCNGG, PspGI (↓CCWGG)), and EcoRII (↓CCWGG) had been identified over a stretch of ∼90 amino acid residues (amino acid residues 108–196 inSsoII) by Morgan et al. (31.Morgan R.D. Xiao J.P. Xu S.Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3669-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) leading to speculations that this segment is part of a common DNA recognition domain for CCXGG and should also be found in the amino acid sequence of BstNI (CC↓WGG), MvaI (CC↓WGG), and ScrFI (CC↓NGG). Our inspection of the sequences ofScrFI (51.Twomey D.P. Gabillet N. Daly C. Fitzgerald G.F. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and ofMvaI 2A. Karyagina, personal communication. showed that there is no significant similarity between these sequences and the sequences of SsoII, PspGI, and EcoRII; the sequence of BstNI is not yet available. On the other hand, it was recently observed that eight different type II restriction enzymes (including SsoII, PspGI,EcoRII and among others NgoMIV, whose cocrystal structure is known), which all have"

We have reported that α1:Ser2091–Arg2108, a peptide derived from the α1-chain of laminin-1, triggers protein kinase C-dependent activation of MAPKerk1/2, leading to the up-regulation of macrophage urokinase type plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression. Since intact laminin-1 failed to trigger these events, we hypothesized that α1:Ser2091–Arg2108 is cryptic or assumes a conformation not recognized by macrophages. Here we demonstrate that elastase cleavage of laminin-1 generates fragments, which stimulate proteinase expression by RAW264.7 macrophages and peritoneal macrophages. In contrast, fragments generated by MMP-2, MMP-7, or plasmin had no effect on macrophage proteinase expression. Elastase-generated laminin-1 fragments were fractionated by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Heparin-binding fragments stimulated macrophages' proteinase expression severalfold greater than nonbinding fragments. The heparin binding fragments reacted with antibodies directed against regions of the α1-chain including α1:Ser2091–Arg2108 and the globular domain. A peptide from the first loop of the globular domain (α1:Ser2179–Ser2198) triggered the phosphorylation of MAPKerk1/2 and stimulated the expression of macrophage urokinase type plasminogen activator and MMP-9. Moreover, a heparin-binding fraction isolated from an aortic aneurysm contained fragments of α1-chain and stimulated macrophages' proteinase expression. Based on these data, we conclude that cryptic domains in the COOH-terminal portion of the α1-chain of laminin are exposed by proteolysis and stimulate macrophages' proteinase expression.

In earlier studies, we tested the hypothesis that the ECM regulates macrophage proteinase expression by culturing macrophages on ECM purified from Engelbreth Holm Swarm (EHS) sarcoma (MatrigelTM) (8.Khan K.M.F.

Results demonstrated that the expression of urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) and MMP-9 by murine RAW264.7 macrophages, human THP-1 monocytes, and human bone marrow-derived macrophages were strongly up-regulated. This was the first demonstration that the engagement of ECM by macrophages stimulates their expression of both uPA and MMP-9. Since the uPA/plasmin system is a physiologic activator of MMPs (10.Carmeliet P. Moons L. Lijnen H.R. Baes M. Lemaitre V. Tipping P. Drew A. Eeckhout Y. Shapiro S. Lupu F. Collen D. Nat.

Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8270-8275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Laminins are large heterotrimeric molecules (∼500–1000 kDa) with multiple domains that mediate their attachment to cells and other ECM components (12.Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Twelve laminin heterotrimers (assembled from five α, three β, and three γ chains) have been identified in mammals. Laminin-1 was the first of this family to be identified (13.Kleinman H.K. McGarvey M.L. Liotta L.A. Robey P.G. Tryggvason K. Martin G.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6188-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) and remains the best understood of the laminin isoforms (12.Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 14.Beck K. Hunter I. Engel J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). It consists of α1 (∼400 kDa), β1 (∼200 kDa), and γ1 (∼200 kDa) chains. The NH2-terminal portions of the α1-, β1-, and γ1-chains are free, whereas much of the rest of the chains are twisted in a coiled-coil. The COOH-terminal portion of the α1-chain extends past the coiled-coil region and forms a large oblong globule (G-domain) consisting of five homologous repeats. The G-domain is the principle heparin-binding region of laminin-1 (15.Ott U. Odermatt E. Engel J. Furthmayr H. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 16.Yurchenco P.D. Sung U. Ward M.D. Yamada Y. O'Rear J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8356-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to identify the domains of laminin-1 responsible for stimulating macrophage proteinase expression, we examined synthetic peptides, which were reported to support cell adhesion and stimulate a variety of biological responses. Incubation of RAW264.7 macrophages and THP-1 monocytes with α1:2099SIKVAV2104stimulated their expression of both uPA and MMP-9 (8.Khan K.M.F. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8270-8275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Neither a scrambled α1-chain peptide nor β1-chain peptides had any effect on macrophage proteinase expression. Thus, a peptide derived from the α1-chain of laminin-1 stimulates both uPA and MMP-9 expression by macrophages. ECM components contain cryptic domains, which are exposed by proteolysis and elicit biological responses distinct from intact molecules. For example, it was recently reported that a cryptic domain in laminin-5 that stimulates cell motility is exposed following cleavage with MMP-2 or MT1-MMP (17.Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 18.Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The synthetic laminin-1 peptide α1:2099SIKVAV2004 that stimulates macrophages uPA and MMP-9 (8.Khan K.M.F. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8270-8275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) is derived from the region of the α1-chain associated with the coiled-coil and is probably not exposed in the intact molecule (16.Yurchenco P.D. Sung U. Ward M.D. Yamada Y. O'Rear J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8356-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the ability of intact laminin-1 and α1-chain peptide to regulate macrophage proteinase expression. Results of those experiments demonstrated that intact laminin-1 had no effect on macrophages' proteinase expression, whereas uPA and MMP-9 expression were stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by α1:2091SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR2108 (9.Khan K.M.F. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4492-4498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, incubation of macrophages with the α1-chain peptide, but not intact laminin-1, triggers a phosphorylation cascade resulting in the activation of protein kinase C, which in turn leads to the activation of MAPKerk1/2. The observed signaling events were causal to the induction of proteinase expression, since inhibition of tyrosine kinases, protein kinase C, or MEK-1 (MAPK kinase) blocked the ability of α1:2091SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR2108 to induce uPA or MMP-9 expression (9.Khan K.M.F. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4492-4498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that a cryptic domain of laminin-1 induces a signaling pathway distinct from intact laminin-1 and up-regulates macrophage proteinase expression. The unmasking of this cryptic domain may play a role in regulation of macrophage degradative phenotype and tissue remodeling. In studies reported here, we have sought to identify the proteinases responsible for exposing the domain(s) in laminin-1 that regulate the macrophage-degradative phenotype. Results demonstrate that laminin-1 is susceptible to cleavage by a variety of proteinases including elastase, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, and plasmin. However, only cleavage by elastase generated fragments that stimulated proteinase expression by RAW264.7 macrophages and thioglycollate-elicited macrophages. Laminin fragments were fractionated by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose. Heparin binding fragments stimulated macrophage proteinase expression severalfold greater than fragments that did not bind, suggesting that the stimulatory domains were in or associated with the G-domain. A peptide from the first globular repeat in the G-domain (α1:Ser2179–Ser2198; SN peptide), which plays a role in the adhesion of cells to laminin-1 (19.Chen L.L. Shick V. Matter M.L. Laurie S.M. Ogle R.C. Laurie G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L494-L503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), triggered the phosphorylation of MAPKerk1/2 and stimulated the expression of macrophage uPA and MMP-9. Moreover, a heparin-binding fraction isolated from an aortic aneurysm contained fragments of α1-chain and stimulated macrophage proteinase expression. When immunodepleted with anti-α1-chain IgG, the heparin-binding fraction no longer stimulated proteinase expression. Taken together, we conclude that the COOH-terminal portion of the α1-chain of laminin contains cryptic domains that are exposed by selective proteolysis and stimulate macrophages' proteinase expression. Murine RAW264.7 macrophages (20.Raschke W.C. Baird S. Ralph P. Nakoinz I. Cell. 1978; 15: 261-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained as adherent cultures in Roswell Park Memorial Medium (RPMI; without HEPES) supplemented with 10% Cellect Gold fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 4 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). Experiments to determine the effect of laminin fragments and peptides on macrophage proteinase expression were carried out in macrophage serum-free medium (MSFM; Invitrogen). Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were obtained from Swiss Webster mice by the method of Edelson and Cohn (21.Edelson P.J. Cohn Z.A. Purification and Cultivation of Monocytes and Macrophages.in: Bloom B.R. David J.R. In Vitro Methods in Cell-mediated Tumor Immunity. Academic Press, Inc., New York1976: 333-340Google Scholar) as described previously (2.Falcone D.J. Ferenc M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 135: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mice were injected intraperitoneally (3 ml/mouse) with 3% brewer thioglycollate medium containing 0.3 mm thioglycollate (Difco). 4 days later, cells were harvested by lavage with cold DPBS. Peritoneal cells were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in RPMI-10% FBS and plated into appropriate wells. Cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h and then washed free of nonadherent cells. Murine laminin-1 (BD Biosciences) was incubated with bovine pancreatic elastase (Sigma), active recombinant human MMP-2 (Calbiochem), active recombinant human MMP-7 (Calbiochem), or human plasmin (American Diagnostica). Incubation conditions were as follows. 27 nm laminin-1 was incubated with 0.48 nm elastase for 2.5–120 min in 0.05m ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.9; 5.8 nmlaminin-1 was incubated with 50 nm MMP-2 for 2–24 h in DPBS; 5.8 nm laminin-1 was incubated with 50 nmMMP-7 for 2–24 h in DPBS; and 22 nm laminin-1 was incubated with 235 nm plasmin in DPBS for 2–24 h. Following incubation, 6× SDS-sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol was added to the samples and boiled for 3 min. In experiments to monitor the degradation of murine laminin-1 by selected proteinases, intact laminin-1 and degraded laminin-1 were electrophoresed in 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, following which the membrane was blocked in TTBS containing 5% dry defatted milk for 1 h. Following one wash (15 min) in TTBS, the membrane was incubated 1 h with 1.0 μg/ml rabbit anti-murine laminin-1 (Collaborative Biomedical Products) in TTBS containing 3% dry defatted milk. The membrane was washed (twice in TTBS) and reblocked in TTBS containing 5% dry defatted milk for 15 min. The membrane was then incubated 1 h with biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000; Pierce), washed (twice in TTBS) and incubated for 1 h with preformed avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complexes (Pierce) in DPBS plus 0.1% Tween 20. Bound HRP was visualized utilizing enhanced chemiluminescence. Laminin-1 (5 mg) was digested with elastase (2.5 μg) at 4 °C for 1 h and room temperature for 20 h in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.9. Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of excess phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The sample was loaded on a heparin-Sepharose column (5 ml), which was previously equilibrated with ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and monitored for the presence of protein by UV spectrophotometry. Unbound laminin fragments were washed from the column with buffer. Bound fragments were eluted with 0.5 mNaCl in ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Peak fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration and dialyzed against DPBS at 4 °C. Following elastase digestion and fractionation by heparin-Sepharose chromatography, laminin fragments were electrophoresed in 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, following which the membrane was blocked in TTBS containing 5% dry defatted milk for 1 h. Following one wash (15 min) in TTBS, the membrane was incubated with either a rabbit antibody directed against a recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 1856–2099 of the α1-chain of laminin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a rabbit antibody directed against the COOH-terminal 50-kDa portion of the G-domain (16.Yurchenco P.D. Sung U. Ward M.D. Yamada Y. O'Rear J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8356-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (RG50; kindly provided by Peter Yurchenco, UMDNJ) in TTBS containing 3% dry defatted milk. The membrane was washed (twice in TTBS) and reblocked in TTBS containing 5% dry defatted milk for 15 min. The membrane was then incubated 1 h with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000; Pierce), washed (twice in TTBS), and incubated for 1 h with preformed avidin-biotin-HRP complexes (Pierce) in DPBS plus 0.1% Tween 20. Bound HRP was visualized utilizing enhanced chemiluminescence. RAW264.7 macrophages were lysed in Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotonin. Lysates were centrifuged (14,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were recovered, normalized for protein, and mixed with SDS sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Equal amounts of cell lysates were applied to gels based on protein content. Cell lysates were electrophoresed in 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, following which the membrane was placed in blocking buffer for 1 h. Following one wash in PBS, the membrane was incubated 1 h in blocking buffer containing 0.1 μg/ml rabbit anti-phosphospecific p44/p42 MAP kinase IgG (New England Biolabs). The membrane was washed (twice in TPBS) and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 0.3 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to HRP (Transduction Laboratories). The membrane was washed in TPBS (three times) followed by PBS (once). Bound HRP was visualized utilizing enhanced chemiluminescence. Plasminogen activator activity was quantitated utilizing a sensitive functional assay for plasmin (22.Falcone D.J. McCaffrey T.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Garcia M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Aliquots of conditioned media were added to microtiter wells containing 82 μl of DPBS plus 0.05% Tween 20, 13 μg of the plasmin substrate d-Val-Leu-Lys-amino methyl coumarin (Enzyme Systems Products), and 0.5 μg of bovine plasminogen (American Diagnostica). Samples were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h. Cleavage of the substrate was monitored by measuring the increase in fluorescence in a Fluoroscan microplate reader (excitation: 330–380 nm; emission: 430–530 nm). Concentrations of uPA in the test samples were extrapolated from a standard curve utilizing high molecular weight uPA (American Diagnostica). Plasminogen activator activity in macrophage-conditioned media was completely inhibited when preincubated with a polyclonal anti-human uPA IgG (American Diagnostica). The presence of metalloproteinase activity in cellular conditioned media was determined utilizing enzyme zymography as previously described (8.Khan K.M.F. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8270-8275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Conditioned media were mixed with SDS sample buffer (without mercaptoethanol) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples and molecular weight markers were electrophoresed in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% gelatin. The gel was then washed (twice) in 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS. The gel was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h in 200 mm NaCl containing 40 mm Tris-HCl and 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The presence of gelatinolytic activity was identified as clear bands on a uniform blue background following destaining. Total RNA was isolated from RAW264.7 macrophage as previously described (23.Falcone D.J. McCaffrey T.A. Vergilio J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22726-22732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The poly(A) mRNA fraction was isolated utilizing the Poly(A)Ttract® mRNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were electrophoresed in agarose, transferred to nylon membrane (Schleicher and Schuell), and hybridized with a 32P-labeled murine cDNA for MMP-9 (24.Masure S. Nys G. Fiten P. Van Damme J. Ghislain G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. G. Opdenakker, Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, Belgium). A specimen of surgically removed abdominal aneurysm (∼4 g, wet weight) was dissected free of fat and thrombus, minced, and extracted with 4 ml of 5 m urea in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.12, containing 10 mm EDTA for 6 h at room temperature and overnight at 4 °C. Tissue pieces were removed from the extract by centrifugation and clarified by filtration (0.45 μm). The extract was applied to a heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated with the extraction buffer without EDTA. Unbound proteins (peak 1) were washed from the column with extraction buffer, and bound proteins (peak 2) were eluted with 0.5 m NaCl in extraction buffer. Peaks 1 and 2 were dialyzed against DPBS and stored at −20 °C. The unfractionated tissue extract, peak 1, and peak 2 were electrophoresed in 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and probed with rabbit antibody directed against a recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 1856–2099 of the α1-chain of laminin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described above. Peak 1 and 2 proteins were incubated with rabbit polyclonal directed against α1:1856–2099 of laminin-1 at room temperature for ∼4 h with mixing. Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences; 100 μl of 10% suspension) was added to extracts, which contained rabbit polyclonal antibodies, and was incubated for 1 h with end over end mixing. Protein A-Sepharose was removed from the suspension by brief centrifugation. The supernatants were collected and diluted 1:3 with RPMI medium. Laminin family members are susceptible to cleavage by a variety of proteinases including elastase (15.Ott U. Odermatt E. Engel J. Furthmayr H. Timpl R. Eur. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18917-18923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To directly test whether cleavage of laminin-1 exposes cryptic domains, which subsequently stimulate macrophage proteinase expression, we incubated intact murine laminin-1 with elastase. Degradation of laminin-1 was monitored by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and/or Western blot with polyclonal anti-murine laminin-1. Under reducing conditions, intact laminin-1 (Fig. 1A) appears as two bands: the α1-chain (∼400 kDa), and β1/γ1-chains, which co-migrate (∼200 kDa). As reported by others (15.Ott U. Odermatt E. Engel J. Furthmayr H. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 25.Schittny J.C. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), several fragments of laminin-1, ranging from 200 to 20 kDa, are generated by elastase cleavage. The degradation of laminin-1 by elastase was further monitored utilizing Western blot (Fig. 1B). Following a 10-min incubation, immunoreactive α1-chain disappeared, and a lower molecular weight band appeared below the β1/γ1 chains. At 20 min, immunoreactive β1/γ1 chains were reduced in intensity and disappeared by 30 min. Following 120 min, immunoreactivity with the polyclonal anti-laminin-1 antibody was lost despite the presence of a range of laminin fragments (Fig. 1A). We next determined whether elastase-generated fragments of laminin-1 would stimulate macrophage proteinase expression. uPA and MMP levels in macrophage conditioned media were quantitated utilizing a fluorescent bioassay and zymography, respectively. As seen in Fig. 2, an overnight incubation of RAW264.7 macrophages with elastase-generated fragments of laminin-1 stimulated their expression of both uPA and MMP-9 to levels achieved utilizing the previously reported stimulatory peptide α1:Ser2091–Arg2108. In contrast to either elastase-degraded laminin-1 or the α1-chain peptide, intact laminin-1 has no effect on macrophages' proteinase expression. These data are proof of the principle that proteolysis of laminin-1 generates fragments that regulate macrophage proteinase expression. We next determined whether the exposure of stimulatory domains in laminin-1 by elastase was specific. For this purpose, the effect of fragments of laminin-1 generated by MMP-2, MMP-7, or plasmin on macrophage proteinase expression was determined. As seen in Fig. 3, the α1-chain of laminin-1 was degraded by active recombinant MMP-2, MMP-7, and plasmin. However, fragments generated by these proteinases failed to stimulate macrophages uPA or MMP-9 expression (data not shown). These data demonstrate that selective digestion of laminin-1 produces fragments that stimulate macrophage proteinase expression. However, in the inflammatory setting, laminin-1 would be subjected to a variety of proteinase, which may modify the elastase-generated fragments to produce biologically inactive fragments. To determine whether the stimulatory activity of elastase-generated laminin-1 fragments is sensitive to other proteinases, we incubated elastase-generated fragments with either 50 nm recombinant MMP-2 or MMP-7 for 4 h and tested their ability to up-regulate uPA expression. Conditioned media recovered from control RAW264.7 macrophages contained 77 ± 3 milliunits of uPA/105 cells (n= 3; means ± S.E.). uPA expression by macrophages incubated (18 h) with elastase-generated fragments increased to 285 ± 25 milliunits/105 cells. Elastase-generated fragments incubated with either MMP-2 or MMP-7 stimulated macrophage uPA expression to 221 ± 21 and 263 ± 24 milliunits/105 cells, respectively. Thus, incubation of elastase-generated fragments with either MMP-2 or MMP-7 had little effect on their ability to stimulate macrophage uPA expression. The principal heparin-binding region of laminin-1 has been mapped to the COOH terminus of the α1-chain that forms five homologous loops (G-domain) (30.Sung U. O'Rear J.J. Yurchenco P.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31.Skubitz A.P.N. McCarthy J.B. Charonis A.S. Furcht L.T. J. Biol.

These results suggest that cellubrevin plays a role in phagosomal maturation and that it is a target for modification by mycobacteria or by infection-induced processes in the host cell. The mechanisms of phagosomal biogenesis and maturation into the phagolysosome represent a fundamental biological process reflecting regulatory aspects of membrane trafficking and organelle biogenesis in eukaryotic cells (1.Alvarez-Dominguez C.

In this work, we extended our analyses of the phagosomal organelles to the v-SNARE cellubrevin. Cellubrevin (also known as VAMP3) is a SNARE molecule involved in the recycling of plasma membrane markers from the endosome (44.Galli T. Chilcote T. Mundigl O. Binz T. Niemann H. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in trafficking from the TGN to the endocytic pathway through interactions with the TGN SNARE Syntaxin 6 (45.Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Here we report the degradation of cellubrevin on the M. tuberculosis phagosome, as a mechanism contributing to altered trafficking from and to the mycobacterial phagosome. The murine macrophage-like cell line, J774, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 4 mml-glutamine and 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG Pasteur (BCG) harboring phsp60-gfp was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (46.Dhandayuthapani S. Via L.E. Thomas C.A. Horowitz P.M. Deretic D. Deretic V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Single cell suspensions were generated using a Tenbroek tissue grinder, followed by a 5-min pulse in a water bath sonicator. Remaining bacterial aggregates were removed by low speed centrifugation. For experiments examining brief infection periods (<1 h), infections were synchronized as described previously (8.Fratti R.A. Backer J.M. Gruenberg J. Corvera S. Deretic V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Synchronization of latex beads and BCG phagocytosis was achieved by allowing latex beads or BCG to attach to macrophages cooled to 4 °C without allowing uptake. Samples were shifted to 37 °C for various periods of time and phagosomes isolated as described previously. For longer phagosome chase experiments, BCG or latex beads were taken up by macrophages for 1 h, followed by removal of unphagocytosed particles and fresh media added for 1 to 24 h (19.Via L.E.

Phagosomes were isolated and characterized for purity as described previously (19.Via L.E. Deretic D. Ulmer R.J. Hibler N.S. Huber L.A. Deretic V. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were mechanically lysed in 8.5% sucrose (w/w in homogenization buffer: 1 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine gelatin) supplemented with protease inhibitors. After cellular debris and nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation to generate post-nuclear supernatants (PNS), PNS from different samples were sedimented by centrifugation through a sucrose step gradient of 8.5, 15, and 50% sucrose (w/w in homogenization buffer). The sediment collected from the 15/50% interface was loaded on a linear 32–53% sucrose gradient (w/w in homogenization buffer). After isopycnic separation of organelles, fractions were collected from the top of the gradients, and membranes were pelleted. The fraction containing purified MPC were characterized for purity as described previously (19.Via L.E. Deretic D. Ulmer R.J. Hibler N.S. Huber L.A. Deretic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13326-13331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). For latex bead phagosome purification, J774 cells were infected with latex beads and incubated as indicated above. Latex bead phagosomal compartments (LBC) were isolated from PNS by flotation and characterized for purity as described previously (47.Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G.F. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Prior to infection, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml brefeldin A (Epicentre Technologies) (48.Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.

J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) for 1 or 2 h at 37 °C or 20 min at 4 °C, respectively. All treatments remained throughout the experiment. Equivalent amounts of MPC and LBC (5 μg of protein per well) were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes by electroblotting. For immunoblots, membranes were incubated with antibodies against globular actin (Sigma), AP3 (ς3 subunit; from J. Bonifacino and E. Dell'Angelica, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), cellubrevin (from P. DeCamilli, Yale University, New Haven, CT), LAMP 2 (Developmental Hybridoma Bank), NSF (from S. Whiteheart, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY), Rab 5 (from L. Huber, Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria), SNAP 23 (from P. Roche, NIH, Bethesda, MD), α-SNAP (StressGen), Syntaxin 13 (from R. Scheller and R. Prekeris, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA), Coronin/TACO (from J. Pieters, Basel Institute, Basel, Switzerland), transferrin receptor (BIOSOURCE International), and VAMP1–3 (VAMP c10.1; Synaptic Systems GmbH). Bound antibodies were visualized using the ECL Western blotting system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). When comparing MPC and LBC on discontinuous membranes, antibody incubations and ECL reactions were performed simultaneously. Membranes were exposed to film simultaneously, and identical exposure times were used. All statistical analyses were calculated using Fisher's Protected LSD post hoc test (ANOVA) (SuperANOVA 1.11, Abacus Concepts, Inc.). p values of ≤0.05 were considered significant. Purified phagosomes containing M. bovis BCG (BCG) or latex beads were prepared and characterized as described previously (8.Fratti R.A. Backer J.M. Gruenberg J. Corvera S. Deretic V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 19.Via L.E. Deretic D. Ulmer R.J. Hibler N.S. Huber L.A. Deretic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13326-13331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) and examined for the presence and dynamics of endosomal SNAREs. The most striking observation was made with the v-SNARE cellubrevin (VAMP3). Purified LBC were found to contain and accumulate cellubrevin over time (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, purified MPC, while containing cellubrevin (14 kDa), also displayed a lower molecular mass band (12.2 kDa) (Fig. 1 A) that reacted with the cellubrevin antibody directed against the cytoplasmic N terminus of cellubrevin (44.Galli T. Chilcote T. Mundigl O. Binz T. Niemann H. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The identity of the lower band as a VAMP was confirmed (Fig. 1 B) by using the antibody anti-VAMP c10.1, which recognizes the cytoplasmic α-helix of VAMP3 (cellubrevin), as well as VAMP1 and VAMP 2 (51.McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). We conclude that the lower molecular mass polypeptide corresponds to a removal of a 1.8-kDa fragment from the C terminus of cellubrevin. The truncated polypeptide, referred to as Δcellubrevin, was not present on LBC. A decrease in the amount of full-length cellubrevin was seen in PNS from BCG-infected cells with the effect depending on the multiplicity of infection (Fig. 1, C and D). Cellubrevin levels were significantly reduced in macrophages infected at a multiplicity of infections (m.o.i.) of 50 or 100 bacilli per cell (Fig. 1, C and D) (p < 0.005 for m.o.i.50; p = 0.0001 for m.o.i.100, relative to maximum cellubrevin levels; ANOVA). Actin levels were unaffected at all m.o.i. values (Fig. 1 D). ΔCellubrevin in PNS observed from BCG-infected cells could only be detected when membranes were pelleted from PNS and overloaded on SDS-PAGE gels (data not shown). To test whether BCG infections can affect cellubrevin in trans, e.g. on latex bead phagosomes in the same macrophages, cells were infected with BCG for 24 h prior to superinfecting with latex beads for an additional 24 h after which LBC were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that conditioning cells with BCG at levels that did not reduce overall cellular cellubrevin levels in infected cells (Fig. 2, PNS), did not significantly alter cellubrevin levels on LBC (Fig. 2, LBC). Furthermore, Δcellubrevin was absent from LBC isolated from BGC-conditioned macrophages (Fig. 2). This suggests that the effects of BCG on cellubrevin are not exerted globally within BCG-infected macrophages, but represent a phenomenon specific for the mycobacterial phagosome. We next examined whether the generation of Δcellubrevin on MPC is only a secondary phenomenon caused by phagosome maturation arrest or could actively contribute to the arrest. This was addressed by inducing a phagosome maturation block using pharmacological inhibitors of membrane trafficking. We found that treatment with bafilomycin A and nocodozole, two known inhibitors of cellular functions essential in endosome maturation (acidification and microtubule based vectorial transport, respectively) (52.van Deurs B. Holm P.K. Kayser L. Sandvig K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 309-323PubMed Google Scholar, 53.van Weert A.W. Dunn K.W. Gueze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), did not cause reduction in cellubrevin levels on LBCs (Fig. 3 A). Thus, induction of a maturation block alone, by causing stagnation of latex bead phagosomes, did not suffice to cause the appearance of ΔCellubrevin on LBC (Fig. 3 A) or reduction of cellubrevin levels in PNS. In contrast to bafilomycin A and nocodozole, treatment with brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of ARF GTPase-based vesicular trafficking within the secretory pathway, including the trafficking from the TGN, decreased levels of cellubrevin on LBC (Fig. 3, A and B). The effect was specific, as levels of SNAP 23 on LBC were not affected in BFA-treated cells (Fig. 3 A). Cellubrevin levels were reduced on LBC by 75% in cells treated with BFA (p = 0.0001; ANOVA) (Fig. 3 B). However, a cellubrevin degradation product was not detected on latex bead phagosomes in BFA-treated cells (Fig. 3 A; Δcellubrevin on MPC is shown for reference). Although cellubrevin levels were significantly reduced on LBCs in BFA-treated macrophages, overall cellular cellubrevin levels were not affected (Fig. 3 A; PNS). It is possible that BFA effects on phagosome-associated cellubrevin were due to either its decreased delivery or increased removal from phagosomes. We favor the former possibility based on the following considerations: (i) cellubrevin has been implicated in TGN-to-endosome trafficking (45.Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar); (ii) it has been shown that the TGN t-SNARE syntaxin 6 can interact with cellubrevin (45.Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar); (iii) we have also found that syntaxin 6 is excluded from MPC, a phenomenon linked to the block in delivery of lysosomal effectors (e.g. H+ATPase and immature cathepsins) to phagosomes. 2R. A. Fratti and V. Deretic, unpublished results. As BFA has been shown to cause the tubulation and fusion of endosomes and TGN (48.Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), this opens the theoretical possibility that BFA-mediated alterations in the protein profiles of LBC may be linked to mixing of compartments. However, since we observed a reduction rather than increase in phagosomal acquisition of cellubrevin, we can exclude the possibility that BFA in our experiments caused indiscriminant fusion of phagosomes with endosomes or TGN. Instead, the observed reduction of cellubrevin acquisition by LBC in BFA-treated cells is most likely associated with the disruption of phagosomal interactions with the endosomal and biosynthetic compartments. We next tested whether alterations in cellubrevin levels affected recycling of markers from the phagosome. The effect of BFA (which lowers cellubrevin on phagosomes; Fig. 3) on recycling of transferrin receptor (TfR) from model phagosomes was examined. LBC were isolated from BFA-treated macrophages at 30 min post-phagocytosis. LBC from BFA-treated cells retained significantly more TfR relative to LBC from untreated control macrophages (p < 0.05; ANOVA) (Fig. 4, A and B). BFA treatment also caused increased levels of AP3 (p < 0.05; ANOVA), an adapter protein involved in TGN and endosomal trafficking (54.Faundez V. Horng J.T. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 423-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, levels of coronin, an actin-binding, general phagocytosis protein (also termed TACO, proposed to accumulate on mycobacterial phagosomes (28.Ferrari G. Langen H. Naito M. Pieters J. Cell. 1999; 97: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar)), was moderately increased on LBC upon BFA treatment (p< 0.01; ANOVA) (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, levels of the early endosomal SNARE syntaxin 13 were not affected by BFA, suggesting that the effects seen with TfR, AP3, and coronin (Fig. 4, A and B) were not a result of indiscriminate membrane mixing. After a round of membrane fusion is completed, SNARE proteins remain tightly associated in a cis-SNARE complex. SNARE molecules stored in cis complexes are made available for subsequent fusion events only upon a priming cycle, which involves an ATP-dependent disruption of the cis-SNARE aggregate. The priming process is dependent on the ATPase NSF association with SNARE complexes, via interactions that include another factor, α-SNAP (55.Banerjee A. Barry V.A. DasGupta B.R. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20223-20226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Upon ATP hydrolysis, the cis-SNARE complex is dissociated, and the primed free SNARE proteins become available for new docking and fusion events. Isolated phagosomes were probed for the presence of NSF and α-SNAP. Both MPC and LBC displayed membrane bound NSF and α-SNAP throughout the experiment with some evidence of reduced amounts as the maturation progressed (Fig. 5 A). When NSF was examined at 24 and 72 h post-infection, we found that MPC retained significant levels of NSF, while most of it was lost from LBC (Fig. 5 B). LBC isolated from BFA-treated cells showed an increase in NSF levels (200%) relative to those isolated from untreated cells (p < 0.05; ANOVA) (Fig. 6, A and B). Inhibiting H+ATPase activity with bafilomycin A had a similar effect (p < 0.05; ANOVA) (Fig. 6, Aand B). Nocodozole did not have an effect on NSF increase, and, if anything, it caused a slight reduction in NSF levels. Accumulation of NSF on LBC isolated from BFA-treated macrophages (Fig. 6) correlates with a marked reduction in cellubrevin levels (Fig. 3), while retention of NSF on MPC (Fig. 5) correlates with cellubrevin degradation. We interpret these observations as an impeded release of NSF from MPC due to disfunctional SNARE priming associated with either reduced levels of cellub"

The presence of pleckstrin homology and phosphotyrosine binding domains as well as multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites suggests that Dok-1 is involved in protein-protein and/or protein-lipid interactions. Here we show that stimulation of Mo7 hematopoietic cells with c-Kit ligand (KL) induces phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and membrane recruitment of Dok-1. Addition of the K-Ras membrane-targeting motif to Dok-1 generated a constitutively membrane-bound Dok-1 protein whose tyrosine phosphorylation was independent of PI 3-kinase. Membrane localization of Dok-1 was required for its ability to function as a negative regulator of cell proliferation. Additional experiments revealed that Dok-1 associated with the juxtamembrane region and C-terminal tail of c-Kit. Lyn promoted phosphorylation of c-Kit and association of c-Kit and Dok-1. Both Lyn and Tec were capable of phosphorylating Dok-1. However, the use of primary bone marrow mast cells from normal and Lyn-deficient mice demonstrated that Lyn is required for KL-dependent Dok-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of PI 3-kinase by KL promotes binding of the Dok pleckstrin homology domain and Dok-1 recruitment to the plasma membrane where Dok-1 is phosphorylated by Src and/or Tec family kinases.

Kit ligand phosphatidylinositol pleckstrin homology glutathioneS-transferase Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium interleukin GTPase-activating protein mitogen-activated protein bone marrow mast cells We have been studying the role of Dok-1 in normal and malignant cell signaling. Dok-1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to a variety of growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulated factor, interleukin-3 (IL-3), and KL. Cloning of the Dok-1 cDNA revealed that the overall structure of Dok-1 is similar to insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), which harbors an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a central phosphotyrosine binding domain, and a C-terminal tail containing multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites (8.Carpino N.

Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The PH domain of Dok-1 is thought to mediate protein interaction with the plasma membrane possibly by binding to phospholipids. The phosphotyrosine binding domain of Dok-1 is thought to mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs with the sequence of NPXpY (10.Zhou M.M.

The multiple tyrosine residues at the C-terminal region are phosphorylated in response to various growth factors. When phosphorylated they act as docking sites for SH2-containing proteins such as p120RasGAP and NCK (12.Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K.

Cells derived from Dok −/− mice hyperproliferate in response to a number of cytokines and growth factors including KL (17.Yamanashi Y. Tamura T. Kanamori T. Yamane H. Nariuchi H. Yamamoto T.

Med. 2001; 194: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism responsible for the hyperproliferative effect has not yet been elucidated. Moreover, the kinase(s) that phosphorylates Dok-1 in c-Kit-mediated signaling has not been identified. Lyn (a Src family kinase) and Tec (a Tec family kinase) have been reported to be activated upon c-Kit activation (5.Tang B. Mano H. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8432-8437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 6.Price D.J. Rivnay B. Avraham H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27450-27455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Tec forms a trimolecular complex with Dok-1 and Lyn in KL-stimulated cells, and activation of Tec and phosphorylation of Dok-1 have been shown to require PI 3-kinase activity (13.van Dijk T.B. van Den Akker E. Amelsvoort M.P. Mano H. Lowenberg B. von Lindern M. Blood. 2000; 96: 3406-3413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have documented a role for Src family kinases in Dok-1 phosphorylation. For example, Lck is required for CD2-mediated phosphorylation of Dok-1 in JcaM1.6 cells, and Src, Fyn, and Lck can phosphorylate Dok-1 in COS-7 cells (14.Nemorin J.G. Duplay P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14590-14597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we examine the mechanisms involved in tyrosine phosphorylation, membrane recruitment, and signal transduction by Dok-1 during KL stimulation. Here we report that Dok-1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and recruited to the membrane in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner when Mo7 hematopoietic cells are stimulated with KL. Removal of the PH domain of Dok-1 results in loss of membrane localization and phosphorylation. However, Dok-1 phosphorylation can be restored by replacing the PH domain with the membrane-targeting motif of K-Ras, implying that membrane localization is required for Dok-1 phosphorylation. We demonstrate that Dok-1 associates with the juxtamembrane region and C-terminal tail of c-Kit. Moreover, we show that Lyn is necessary for KL-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 during c-Kit signal transduction. Constitutively membrane-targeted Dok proteins were generated by attaching the K-Ras tail (farnesyl/polybasic) to the C terminus of wild type Dok-1 or the ΔPHDok-1 mutant.

Western blots were detected with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The Mo7 megakaryoblastic cell line was maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10 ng/ml human rIL-3 (BD PharMingen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. BMMC were maintained in IMDM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and murine 30 ng/ml rIL-3. Mo7 cells were transfected by electroporation with 15–30 μg of plasmid DNA. Mo7 cells (20 × 106/300 μl) were pulsed at 126 V and 1700 μF using an ECM 600 (BTX) electroporator and were collected 18 h after transfection. For stimulation with c-Kit ligand Mo7 cells or BMMC were washed free of growth factor and starved overnight at 37 °C in IMDM containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in IMDM + 1% serum at a concentration of 10 × 106/ml, and stimulated with human or mouse c-Kit ligand (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at a concentration of 100 ng/ml for 5 min at 37 °C. For treatments with wortmannin (Sigma) or Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), Mo7 cells were first starved overnight and then incubated with various concentrations of drugs for 1 h before the cells were stimulated with human c-Kit ligand. Cells were then pelleted, lysed, and processed for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. For stimulation with c-Kit ligand, COS-1 cells first were starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum and then were stimulated with 200 ng/ml c-Kit ligand for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer, lysed by homogenization with 30 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain a cytosolic fraction (S100) and a membrane fraction (P100) as described (16.Alland L. Peseckis S.M. Atherton R.E. Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16701-16705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mo7 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either polyclonal anti-Lyn, anti-c-Kit, or anti-Tec antibodies. Immune complexes were washed with lysis buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Recombinant Dok-1 (2 μg) was used as substrate for Lyn and Tec kinase assays. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, and reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. GST fusion proteins of juxtamembrane, kinase 1, kinase insert, and C-terminal tail domains of c-Kit were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The protein concentration of the various GST fusion proteins was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Phosphorylated GST fusion proteins were generated by incubating 5 μg of GST fusion proteins in kinase assay buffer with Lyn immunoprecipitates from Mo7 cell lysates. Lyn immunoprecipitates were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant containing phosphorylated GST fusion proteins was then added to KL-treated Mo7 cell lysates in the presence of 12 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Unphosphorylated GST fusion proteins were used as control. The mixture was gently agitated at 4 °C for 2 h, and the beads were washed three times with Mo7 lysis buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. COS-1 cells were transfected with either wild type Dok-1, membrane-targeted wild type Dok-1 (Dok-1-KRas), ΔPHDok-1, or membrane-targeted ΔPHDok-1 (ΔPHDok-1-KRas) for 24 h and then trypsinized and seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates with a cell concentration of 5 × 104 cells/0.2 ml/well. 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were harvested, and 3H radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Previous studies have established that Dok-1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in KL-stimulated Mo7 cells (8.Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Clarkson B. Cell. 1997; 88: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Because Dok-1 contains a PH domain, and many PH domains bind to the products of PI 3-kinase, we tested whether PI 3-kinase was involved in a KL-mediated signaling pathway leading to Dok-1 phosphorylation. Mo7 cells were starved overnight and then incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nm wortmannin for 1 h prior to stimulation with KL. As indicated in Fig. 1, Dok-1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to KL. Addition of wortmannin inhibited KL-stimulated phosphorylation of Dok-1 by >90%. Wortmannin had no effect on the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the c-Kit. Western blotting with anti-Dok-1 or anti-c-Kit antibodies revealed the presence of the same amount of Dok-1 and c-Kit in each sample. These data suggest that KL-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 is PI 3-kinase-dependent. The products of PI 3-kinase enzymatic activity (PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3) form a binding site in the plasma membrane for proteins with PH domains. We tested whether activation of Mo7 cells with KL promoted recruitment of Dok-1 to the membrane via a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism. Mo7 cells were starved overnight and treated with or without wortmannin for 1 h prior to stimulation with KL. Cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer and separated into cytosolic (S100) and membrane (P100) fractions by differential ultracentrifugation. As indicated in Fig. 2A, in the absence of KL stimulation little or no [Tyr(P)]Dok-1 was observed. However, when Mo7 cells were stimulated with KL most (70%) of the [Tyr(P)]Dok-1 was localized to the membrane fraction (P100). Western blotting with anti-Dok-1 antibody revealed that there was no significant change in the distribution of total Dok-1 before and after KL stimulation, suggesting that only a small amount of Dok-1 was phosphorylated upon KL stimulation. To test whether the PH domain of Dok-1 was required for membrane association, a precise deletion of the PH domain was generated within Dok-1. The wild type and ΔPH mutant Dok-1 were transfected into Mo7 cells by electroporation. As depicted in Fig. 2B, the ΔPHDok-1 mutant was localized nearly exclusively in the S100 fraction, whereas wild type Dok-1 was evenly distributed in the S100 and P100 fractions. These data support a model in which activation of PI 3-kinase by KL generates a binding site for the Dok-1 PH domain that serves to recruit Dok-1 to the plasma membrane. The next set of experiments was designed to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 precedes or follows membrane binding. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we generated a chimeric Dok-1 protein that was constitutively targeted to the plasma membrane. This was accomplished by fusing the membrane-targeting motif of K-Ras (farnesyl + polybasic) to the C terminus of wild type and ΔPH mutant Dok-1, respectively. Because the efficiency of transfection in Mo7 cells was very low the proteins were expressed in transfected COS-1 cells. As depicted in Fig. 3, wild type Dok-1 was evenly distributed in the S100 and P100 fractions and was tyrosine-phosphorylated (most likely by endogenous tyrosine kinases). The ΔPHDok-1 mutant was localized to the cytosolic fraction (S100) and was not phosphorylated. In contrast the ΔPHDok-1 mutant with the K-Ras tail was primarily associated with the membrane fraction (P100) and was constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated. These results indicate that the PH domain of Dok-1 is required for membrane localization and phosphorylation and that membrane binding is required for Dok-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. We next tested whether the addition of a K-Ras tail to full-length Dok-1 could bypass the requirement for PI 3-kinase for Dok-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. COS-1 cells were transfected with wild type Dok-1 or Dok-1-KRas and empty vector or Δp85, a dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Dok-1 antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-Tyr(P) and anti-Dok-1 antibodies. Compared with wild type Dok-1, Dok-1-KRas was hyperphosphorylated, with an approximately 2-fold enhancement of Tyr(P) levels per unit of protein (Fig. 4A). Phosphorylation of the wild type Dok-1 was inhibited by expression of a dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase. In contrast, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1-KRas was insensitive to Δp85 expression. The Dok-1-KRas construct was nearly exclusively localized to the membrane fraction (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that constitutive targeting of Dok-1 to the membrane via a K-Ras tail results in PI 3-kinase-independent hyperphosphorylation of Dok-1. Dok-1 has been reported to be a negative regulator of cell growth (17.Yamanashi Y. Tamura T. Kanamori T. Yamane H. Nariuchi H. Yamamoto T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 11-16PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the significance of membrane localization for Dok-1 function, COS-1 cells were transfected with wild type Dok-1, Dok-1-KRas, ΔPHDok-1, or ΔPHDok-1-KRas, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured. As depicted in Fig. 5A, expression of wild type Dok-1 inhibited cell growth by ∼22%. The constitutively membrane-bound Dok-1-KRas or ΔPHDok-1-KRas exhibited a greater negative effect on cell proliferation with ∼45% reduction in [3H]thymidine incorporation. Western blotting with anti-Dok-1 antibody revealed that the expression level for each construct was the same (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that membrane localization of Dok-1 is required for negative regulation of cell proliferation. The mechanism by which membrane translocation contributes to the ability of Dok-1 to inhibit cell proliferation is not yet known. In B cells, binding of Dok-1 to the membrane-bound FcγRIIB receptor promotes Dok-1 phosphorylation and association with RasGAP (22.Tamir I. Stolpa J.C. Helgason C.D. Nakamura K. Bruhns P. Daeron M. Cambier J.C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This results in formation of RasGDP and attenuation of the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase signaling pathway. However, recent studies using fibroblasts from Dok-1 −/− mice revealed that RasGAP binding is not required for negative regulation of cell proliferation by Dok-1 (23.Zhao M. Schmitz A.A.P. Yi Q. Di Cristofano A. Pandolfi P-P. Van Aelst L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is likely that association of Dok-1 with other downstream effector proteins mediates cell growth inhibition. The next set of experiments was designed to identify the kinase(s) responsible for KL-stimulated phosphorylation of Dok-1. The likely candidates were c-Kit itself as well as Lyn and Tec kinases, which have been shown to interact with c-Kit. Mo7 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of KL, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to Dok-1, Lyn, or Tec. Western blotting of anti-Dok-1 immunoprecipitates with anti-Tyr(P) antibody revealed the presence of a 145-kDa phosphoprotein that coprecipitated with Dok-1 with higher levels present in KL-stimulated cells. Reprobing of the Western blot with anti-c-Kit antibody revealed that the 145-kDa protein was c-Kit (Fig. 6A). c-Kit also associated with Lyn in a KL-independent manner as has previously been reported (7.Linnekin D. DeBerry C.S. Mou S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27450-27455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Probing of anti-Tec immunoprecipitates with anti-Tyr(P) antibody revealed the presence of c-Kit in the KL-treated samples. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Tec was very low, and little tyrosine-phosphorylated Dok-1 was observed in these complexes. Two proteins with molecular masses of 62 and 70 kDa were detected when the blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-Tec antibody. These likely represent isoforms of Tec kinases, which have been reported to result from alternative splicing (18.Mano H. Yamashita Y. Sato K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1995; 85: 343-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon KL stimulation, tyrosine-phosphorylated SHC was detected in the anti-Tec immunoprecipitates (data not shown). These data indicate that c-Kit forms complexes with Dok-1, Lyn, and Tec. GST fusion pulldown experiments were performed to identify the region(s) of c-Kit that interacts with Dok-1. GST fusion proteins containing the juxtamembrane, kinase insert, and C-terminal tail regions as well as the first half of the kinase domain of c-Kit were purified from Escherichia coli. Because the interaction between Dok-1 and c-Kit was likely to be Tyr(P)-dependent, the fusion proteins were first phosphorylated by incubation with Lyn immunoprecipitates from Mo7 cells. As depicted in Fig. 6Bthe juxtamembrane region and C-terminal tail of c-Kit were phosphorylated. The fusion proteins were then incubated with lysates from KL-stimulated Mo7 cells, and the amount of Dok-1 that was bound was determined. As indicated in Fig. 6C only the phosphorylated juxtamembrane region and C-terminal tail of c-Kit associated with phosphorylated Dok-1. Phosphorylation of the GST fusion proteins was necessary for association with Dok-1 because no interaction occurred when the fusion proteins were not prephosphorylated by Lyn (data not shown). The Src family member Lyn has been shown to be required for KL-mediated responses of mast cells and progenitor cells (25.O'Laughlin-Bunner B. Radosevic N. Taylor M.L. Shivakrupa DeBerry C. Metcalfe D.D. Zhou M. Lowell C. Linnekin D. Blood. 2001; 98: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because Lyn constitutively associates with c-Kit in Mo7 cells, we tested whether Lyn is necessary for c-Kit to achieve maximum tyrosine phosphorylation and activation. c-Kit was expressed alone or was coexpressed with Lyn in COS-1 cells, and c-Kit tyrosine phosphorylation was examined upon stimulation with c-Kit ligand. As depicted in Fig. 7A, upon KL stimulation tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Kit was detected. However, in the presence of Lyn, KL stimulation of c-Kit phosphorylation increased ∼10-fold, indicating that Src family kinases promote maximal phosphorylation of c-Kit. Because Src family kinases (especially Lyn) are activated in response to KL, we tested whether Dok-1 is phosphorylated by Src family kinases. Dok-1 was expressed alone or coexpressed with the Src family kinase Fyn, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 was examined. As depicted in Fig. 7B, tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 increased ∼20-fold when wild type Fyn was coexpressed, whereas expression of a kinase-inactive mutant of Fyn mutant (K299M) had no effect on Dok-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. To study the role of Src family kinases in the c-Kit pathway, we attempted to reconstitute the KL signaling system in COS-1 cells. As depicted in Fig. 7C, when COS-1 cells were transfected with Dok-1 alone Dok-1 was phosphorylated to low levels by endogenous kinases, and addition of KL had no effect. KL stimulation of COS-1 cells expressing Dok-1 and c-Kit resulted in a 2-fold increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 compared with cells without KL stimulation. However, when COS-1 cells were cotransfected with Dok-1, c-Kit, and Fyn the tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 increased 10-fold, and stimulation with KL resulted in an additional 2-fold increase. Moreover, the Dok-1·c-Kit receptor complex was only detected when Fyn was present (data not shown). When the kinase-inactive mutant of Fyn was expressed in place of wild type Fyn, tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 dramatically decreased. These data strongly suggest that Src family kinases mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1. Both Lyn and Tec are expressed in KL-responsive Mo7 cells (6.Price D.J. Rivnay B. Avraham H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 7.Linnekin D. DeBerry C.S. Mou S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27450-27455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The abilities of Lyn and Tec kinases to phosphorylate Dok-1 were compared directly as follows. Mo7 cells were starved overnight and then stimulated with KL. Lyn and Tec kinases were immunoprecipitated from the same amount of cell lysate. In vitro kinase assays were performed using recombinant Dok-1 as substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 8A, Lyn was constitutively active in Mo7 cells, and incubation with recombinant Dok-1 resulted in robust phosphorylation of Dok-1. The ∼140-kDa phosphoprotein detected in Lyn immune complex kinase assays was identified as c-Kit because it comigrated with the c-Kit band in anti-c-Kit immunoprecipitates (data not shown). No detectable phosphorylation of recombinant Dok-1 by Tec was observed. Tec protein was clearly present in the anti-Tec immunoprecipitate (Fig. 8, A and B), but the autophosphorylation activity of Tec kinase was only detectable when the intensity on the phosphorimaging device was greatly increased (20-fold) (Fig. 8B). Others have also observed that Tec autophosphorylation activity is relatively weak (20.Yang W.-C. Ghiotto M. Barbarat B. Olive D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is possible that the inability to detect phosphorylated Dok-1 in anti-Tec immunoprecipitates was due to low levels of Tec kinase in Mo7 cells. Experiments designed to increase the level of Tec were not feasible in Mo7 cells because of low transfection efficiencies combined with a loss of KL responsiveness following electroporation. We therefore expressed Tec in COS-1 cells and directly compared the ability of Tec and Lyn kinases to phosphorylate Dok-1 in vivo. As depicted in Fig. 8C both Tec and Lyn were capable of phosphorylating Dok-1 to equivalent extents. Cotransfection of both Tec and Lyn resulted in a 2-fold increase in Dok-1 phosphorylation compared with Tec alone. A similar effect was recently noted by van Dijk et al. (13.van Dijk T.B. van Den Akker E. Amelsvoort M.P. Mano H. Lowenberg B. von Lindern M. Blood. 2000; 96: 3406-3413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the ability of Src family kinases to phosphorylate and thereby activate Tec family kinases (18.Mano H. Yamashita Y. Sato K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1995; 85: 343-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Wahl M.I. Fluckiger A.C. Kato R.M. Park H. Witte O.N. Rawlings D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11526-11533Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We conclude that both Lyn and Tec are capable of phosphorylating Dok-1. To further determine the role of Src family kinases in mediating Dok-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, Mo7 cells were starved overnight and incubated with various concentrations of Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 for 1 h prior to stimulation with KL. As depicted in Fig. 9A, inhibition of KL-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 was dose-dependent. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 was completely inhibited by 5 μm PP2. As a control the inactive analog PP3 had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 (data not shown). Lyn has been shown to be an important contributor to KL-induced proliferation of primary hematopoietic cells (25.O'Laughlin-Bunner B. Radosevic N. Taylor M.L. Shivakrupa DeBerry C. Metcalfe D.D. Zhou M. Lowell C. Linnekin D. Blood. 2001; 98: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the requirement for Lyn in Dok-1 tyrosine phosphorylation during c-Kit signaling. Primary BMMC isolated from normal and Lyn-deficient mice were starved overnight and then stimulated with KL. Phosphorylated Dok-1 was immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated anti-Tyr(P) antibodies and blotted with anti-Dok-1 antibody. As depicted in Fig. 9B, upon c-Kit stimulation tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 was increased ∼2-fold in primary normal BMMC but not in Lyn-deficient BMMC, indicating that Lyn is required for KL-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1. Western blotting with anti-Dok-1 antibody revealed the presence of the same amount of Dok-1 in each sample. In conclusion, the data presented in this manuscript support the following model. Binding of KL to c-Kit results in activation of PI 3-kinase and generation of inositol phospholipids at the plasma membrane that serve as binding sites for PH domains. Dok-1 and Tec are recruited to the plasma membrane via their respective PH domains. In addition, Dok-1 binds to the juxtamembrane region and C-terminal tail of c-Kit, placing it in close proximity to membrane-bound c-Kit-associated Lyn. Several lines of evidence indicate that Lyn plays a critical role in c-Kit signaling. A recent study reported that Lyn is required for an optimal response to KL-mediated cell proliferation and chemotaxis in primary hematopoietic progenitor cells and mast cells (25.O'Laughlin-Bunner B. Radosevic N. Taylor M.L. Shivakrupa DeBerry C. Metcalfe D.D. Zhou M. Lowell C. Linnekin D. Blood. 2001; 98: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here we show that Lyn is required for association of Dok-1 and c-Kit most likely because Lyn phosphorylates sites on c-Kit that promote Dok-1 binding. Moreover, Lyn is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 in KL-stimulated Mo7 cells and BMMC. This may occur by direct phosphorylation of Dok-1 by Lyn. Alternatively, or in parallel, Lyn phosphorylation of Tec would result in Tec activation and phosphorylation of Dok-1 by Tec. Other studies in B and T cells have revealed that Tec can phosphorylate Dok-1 (19.Yoshida K. Yamashita Y. Miyazato A. Ohya K. Kitanaka A. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Yamanaka T. Ozawa K. Mano H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24945-24952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20.Yang W.-C. Ghiotto M. Barbarat B. Olive D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and Lyn, Tec, and Dok have been shown to form a complex in hematopoietic cells stimulated with KL (13.van Dijk T.B. van Den Akker E. Amelsvoort M.P. Mano H. Lowenberg B. von Lindern M. Blood. 2000; 96: 3406-3413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless of which kinase(s) phosphorylates Dok-1, it is clear that membrane localization of Dok-1 is essential for its tyrosine phosphorylation during c-Kit signaling. Identification of Dok-1 tyrosine phosphorylation sites will ultimately be important for understanding the function of Dok-1 as an adaptor protein in c-Kit-mediated signal transduction.

Available data suggest that papain-family proteases require prodomains for correct folding into functional conformations. However, in prior studies of falcipain-2, anEscherichia coli-expressed construct containing only a small portion of the prodomain refolded efficiently, suggesting that this enzyme differs in this regard from other papain-family enzymes. To better characterize the determinants of folding for falcipain-2, we expressed multiple pro- and mature constructs of the enzyme in E. coli and assessed their abilities to refold. Mature falcipain-2 refolded into active protease with very similar properties to those of proteins resulting from the refolding of proenzyme constructs. Deletion of a 17-amino acid amino-terminal segment of the mature protease yielded a construct incapable of correct folding, but inclusion of this segment in trans allowed folding to active falcipain-2. The prodomain was a potent, competitive, and reversible inhibitor of mature falcipain-2 (K i 10−10m). Our results identify a chaperone-like function of an amino-terminal segment of mature falcipain-2 and suggest that protease inhibition, but not the mediation of folding, is a principal function of the falcipain-2 prodomain.

Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world. Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent human malaria parasite, is responsible for hundreds of millions of illnesses and more than one million deaths each year (1.Breman J.G. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 64: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Because available antimalarial agents are limited by drug resistance, toxicity, and cost, new drugs, ideally directed against new targets, are urgently needed (2.Rosenthal P.J. Miller L.H. Rosenthal P.J. Antimalarial Chemotherapy: Mechanisms of Action, Resistance, and New Directions in Drug Discovery. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 3-13Google Scholar). Among promising drug targets are proteases that hydrolyze hemoglobin during the erythrocytic stage of infection and thereby provide amino acids for parasite protein synthesis (3.Olliaro P.L. Yuthavong Y. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 81: 91-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cysteine protease inhibitors blocked parasite hemoglobin hydrolysis and development in vitro (4.Rosenthal P.J. McKerrow J.H. Aikawa M. Nagasawa H. Leech J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and curedPlasmodium-infected mice (5.Rosenthal P.J. Lee G.K. Smith R.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting that plasmodial cysteine proteases are appropriate drug targets. The best characterized cysteine proteases of P. falciparum are the papain-family enzymes falcipain-2 (6.Shenai B.R. Sijwali P.S. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29000-29010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and falcipain-3 (7.Sijwali P.S. Shenai B.S. Gut J. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Each of these proteases cleaves hemoglobin under the acidic conditions of the plasmodial food vacuole, the site of hemoglobin hydrolysis, and they are likely the principal targets of antimalarial cysteine protease inhibitors. In initial studies of the in vitro refolding ofEscherichia coli-expressed falcipain-2 and falcipain-3, constructs including the mature proteases and only short (35 and 33 amino acid, respectively) carboxyl-terminal portions of the prodomains folded into active enzymes (6.Shenai B.R.

Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These results were surprising, because the prodomains of papain-family proteases have previously been deemed essential for correct folding (9.Smith S.M. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20487-20495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Yamamoto Y. Watabe S. Kageyama T. Takahashi S.Y. Arch. Insect Biochem.

Mature falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 contain an unusual amino-terminal segment that is not seen in any other described papain-family enzymes. We hypothesized that the amino-terminal extension of falcipain-2 plays a role in protein folding. To determine the roles of the falcipain-2 prodomain and amino-terminal extension of the mature domain in folding, we evaluated the abilities of multiple falcipain-2 constructs to refold into active protease. We found that the falcipain-2 prodomain is not required for folding, that folding is mediated by the amino-terminal extension, and that, as is the case with other proteases, the prodomain is a potent inhibitor of mature falcipain-2.

The sequence of each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing at the Biomolecular Resource Center, University of California, San Francisco. Four constructs coding for the falcipain-2 mature domain (FP2) and various lengths of the prodomain (−188FP2, −89FP2, and −35FP2) were PCR-amplified using the following primers (bold italics indicate restriction endonuclease cleavage sites): −188FP2, 1F (5′-TTATTGGATCC TACTCCAAATTCTAGAAAAAGTG-3′) and 1R (5′-TGACAAGCTT ATTCAATTAATGGAATGAATGCATCAGTACC-3′); −89FP2, 2F (5′-GATAAGGATCC CTTAATGAATAATGCAGAAC-3′) and 1R; −35FP2, 3F (5′-ATAGTTGGATCC GGGAAAGAATTAAACAGATTTGCC-3′) and 1R; and FP2, 4F (5′-TATTTAGGATCC CAAATGAATTATGAAGAAG-3′) and 1R. The DNA fragments were digested with BamHI andHindIII, ligated intoBamHI-HindIII-digested pQE-30 (FP2 and −35FP2; Qiagen) or pRSET-B (−89FP2 and −188FP2; Invitrogen) plasmids and used to transform M15(pREP4) (for pQE) or AD(DE3)pLys (for pRSET) E. coli. Both pRSET-B and pQE-30 expression vectors add His-tag fusions at the amino terminus of the foreign proteins that allow one-step purification of recombinant proteins by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) chromatography. Expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and expressed proteins were purified by Ni-NTA chromatography under denaturing conditions as previously described (8.Sijwali P.S. Brinen L.S. Rosenthal P.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). −188FP2 and −89FP2 were further purified by binding to a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and elution with a step gradient of NaCl in 8m urea, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. To determine the best refolding buffer for each of the constructs, 176 combinations of 11 different buffers were tested by a microtiter plate refolding assay (8.Sijwali P.S. Brinen L.S. Rosenthal P.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Refolding buffers contained 100 mmTris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 9.0 (A) plus 500 mml-arginine (B), 250 mml-arginine + 5% glycerol (C), 30% glycerol (D), 250 mml-arginine plus 30% glycerol (E), 20% sucrose (F), 250 mml-arginine plus 20% sucrose (G), 1m KCl (H), 1 m KCl plus 20% glycerol (I), 1m KCl plus 20% sucrose (J), and 16 different combinations of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione as described previously (8.Sijwali P.S. Brinen L.S. Rosenthal P.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For the refolding assay, 3 μl of denatured-reduced protein (150 pmol in 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris-Cl, 200 mm imidazole, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 8.0) was added to 297 μl of each ice-cold refolding buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 20 h. Refolding was measured as the hydrolysis of Z-Leu-Arg-AMC by 25 μl of each refolding reaction (in 350 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate, 50 μmZ-Leu-Arg-AMC, 10 mm DTT, pH 5.5) assayed fluorometrically, as previously described at room temperature for 30 min (8.Sijwali P.S. Brinen L.S. Rosenthal P.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For large scale refolding, equal amounts (100 nmol) of each denatured-reduced protein were diluted 100-fold in 200 ml of the optimal refolding buffer for each protein, containing 1 mmeach GSH and GSSG (buffers B for −188FP2, C for −89FP2, and E for −35FP2 and FP2) and incubated at 4 °C for 20 h. Insoluble protein was removed using a 0.22-μm membrane. Each refolding reaction was concentrated to 20 ml, brought to pH 5.8 and 5 mm DTT at room temperature for 1.5 h (1 h for −35FP2 and FP2), the pH was raised to 6.25, the protein was applied to a Q-Sepharose column, and active protease was eluted using a gradient of 1 m NaCl in 20 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.25. Elution fractions containing protease activity (indicated by Z-Leu-Arg-AMC hydrolysis) were combined, concentrated to 1–2 ml, and diluted with an equal volume of glycerol for storage. Quantities of unfolded expressed proteases were estimated by the Bradford assay (12.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). To estimate recovery of active protease, enzyme concentrations were determined by active site titration with Z-Phe-Arg-FMK (13.Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar) before (−35FP2 and FP2) or after (−188FP2 and −89FP2) purification. For amino-terminal sequencing, purified active products of −188FP2, −89FP2, −35FP2, and FP2 were electrophoresed in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to an Immobilon-PSQmembrane (Millipore), stained with Coomassie Blue, excised, and sequenced at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility, Stanford University Medical Center. For substrate SDS-PAGE, protease samples were mixed with non-reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and electrophoresed in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel copolymerized with 0.1% gelatin. The gel was washed twice with 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min each at room temperature, incubated overnight at 37 °C in 100 mmsodium acetate, 10 mm DTT, pH 5.5, and then stained with Coomassie Blue. To generate −188dFP2 and −89dFP2, proregions of −188dFP2 (1F and 2R (5′-ATGATCATCTAATAAATATTTAGAATTCTTTAATGG3-′)) and −89dFP2 (2F and 2R) were amplified and then recombined with an extension deleted mature fragment (5F (5′-TCTAAATATTTATTAGATGATCATGCAGCTTACGACTGG-3′) and 1R) by the overlap extension PCR method (overlapping primer regions are underlined) (14.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The coding sequence for extension-deleted mature falcipain-2 (dFP2) was amplified using primers 6F (5′-GAGGAGAAGAGGATCC CGATCATGCAGCTTACGACTGG-3′) and 1R. The DNA fragments were digested with BamHI andHindIII, ligated in pRSET-B, and expressed in AD(DE3)pLysE. coli. Proteins were purified from isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced E. colicells by Ni-NTA chromatography as described above. −188dFP2 and −89dFP2 were further purified under denaturing conditions with Q-Sepharose as described above. Refolding of −188dFP2, −89dFP2, and dFP2 was assessed in the 176 buffers described above. Samples (150 pmol) of denatured-reduced recombinant proteins (in 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris-Cl, 200 mm imidazole, 10 mmDTT, pH 8.0) were diluted 100-fold in 297 μl of ice-cold refolding buffer containing 1 mm each of reduced and oxidized glutathione (buffers B for −188FP2 and −188dFP2; C for −89FP2 and −89dFP2; E for −35FP2, FP2 and dFP2) and incubated at 4 °C. At multiple time points, 15 μl of each refolding reaction was incubated in 325 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate, 10 mmDTT, pH 5.5, at room temperature for 25 min to allow processing, 10 μl of Z-Leu-Arg-AMC was added (final concentration 50 μm), and fluorescence, representing protease activity, was monitored continuously for 10 min at room temperature (8.Sijwali P.S. Brinen L.S. Rosenthal P.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). DNA fragments coding for propeptides with (−188P17 and −89P17) or without (−188P and −89P) the 17-amino acid extension were PCR-amplified using primers (1F and 3R (5′-GTAAGCTGAAGCTT AGAAATTTTCTTCTCCTCTATA-3′)) for −188P17, 2F and 3R for −89P17, 1F and 4R (5′-CATAATTCAAAGCTT ATAATAAATATTTAGAATTCTTTAATGGT-3′) for −188P, and 2F and 4R for −89P). Each of the DNA fragments was digested with BamHI and HindIII, ligated into pRSET-B, and expressed in AD(DE3)pLys cells. Propeptides were purified from isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced AD(DE3)pLys cells by Ni-NTA chromatography under denaturing conditions as described above. To purify further, Ni-NTA-purified propeptides were bound to a SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted by a step gradient of NaCl in 8m urea, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. Refolding of extension-deleted mature falcipain-2 (dFP2) alone or with different concentrations of prodomain constructs (−188P17, −89P17, −188P, or −89P; molar ratio of dFP2:prodomain constructs 1:1–1:3) or a synthetic peptide (molar ratio of dFP2:peptide 1:1–1:50) identical to the falcipain-2 amino-terminal extension was studied in 11 refolding buffers (described above; each containing 1 mm each GSH and GSSG). An equal amount of mature falcipain-2 (FP2) was also refolded in buffer E. For each refolding reaction, 3-μl aliquots containing 150 pmol of denatured reduced recombinant protein(s) were added to 297 μl of ice-cold refolding buffer, samples were incubated at 4 °C for 20 h to allow refolding, 25 μl of each refolding reaction was added to 315 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm DTT, pH 5.5, at room temperature for 25 min to allow processing, and refolding to active enzyme was assessed as relative hydrolysis of Z-Leu-Arg-AMC over 30 min. Protease concentrations were determined by active-site titration with Z-Phe-Arg-FMK. Constant amounts (1.0 nm with Z-Leu-Arg-AMC and 2.0 nm with Z-Phe-Arg-AMC) of enzyme were incubated with different concentrations of substrate, hydrolysis over time was assessed fluorometrically (excitation 355 nm, emission 460 nm) for 15 min (Z-Leu-Arg-AMC) or 30 min (Z-Phe-Arg-AMC) in 100 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm DTT, pH 5.5, at room temperature, and the kinetic constants K m and V MAX were determined by non-linear regression using Prism (GraphPad Software). To refold prodomain −188P for inhibition studies, the denatured protein was 100-fold diluted (final protein concentration 15–20 μg/ml) in 100 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mml-arginine-HCl, pH 7.5, incubated at 4 °C for 20 h, and concentrated (using a 10-kDa cut-off membrane, Millipore) to 10 ml. Insoluble protein was removed using a 0.22-μm syringe filter. Different concentrations of −188P were preincubated with 0.96 nm falcipain-2 derived from 4 different constructs in 100 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm DTT, pH 5.5, for 10 min at room temperature. The substrate Z-Leu-Arg-AMC (4 μm; ∼2-fold below K m) was added, and fluorescence was continuously measured for 10 min. Pseudo-first order conditions were assumed (substrate hydrolysis was shown to be ≪10%) (15.Salvesen G. Nagase H. Benyon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1989: 87-88Google Scholar). The results were plotted as (V o/V i) − 1versus I, where V o is the uninhibited rate, V i the rate in the presence of the inhibitor, and I is the concentration of inhibitor. From this plot, the K i,app was determined (slope = 1/K i,app) and used to calculate the true K i using the relationshipK i = K i,app/(1+ [S]/K m), where [S] is the substrate concentration. Falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are fairly typical papain-family proteases, but they share some unusual features, including large prodomains, a putative type II membrane-spanning region near the amino terminus, and some unique inserts in the mature protease sequence (6.Shenai B.R.

Rosenthal P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Most relevant for this study, the two plasmodial proteases lack the typical papain-family mature protease cleavage site, where cleavage occurs immediately upstream of the sequence XP, where Xrepresents a nonpolar amino acid about 25 amino acids upstream of the catalytic cysteine (16.Berti P.J. Storer A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The conserved proline is seen in nearly all known papain-family proteases other than falcipain-2 and falcipain-3. Determination of the amino-terminal sequences of native mature falcipain-2 and processed recombinant falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 showed that these two enzymes contain an amino-terminal extension, with an additional 17 amino acids in falcipain-2 and 26 amino acids in falcipain-3 relative to other papain-family proteases (Fig. 1). The sequences of the two plasmodial amino-terminal extensions are 47% identical and do not show significant identity with any other protein sequences in available data bases. To investigate the role of the falcipain-2 prodomain, we expressed four constructs including mature falcipain-2 with different portions of the prodomain (−188FP2, −89FP2, and −35FP2) and mature falcipain-2 alone (FP2) in E. coli (Fig. 2, A and B). Each of the proteins was refolded at alkaline pH and underwent autohydrolysis at acid pH to a product of identical size (Fig. 2 C). Amino-terminal sequencing of the active products revealed the native mature falcipain-2 terminus for the FP2 construct (QMNYEE) and microheterogeneity (DQMNYEE and MNYEE) for the three prodomain constructs. All four refolded proteins were enzymatically active, as demonstrated by hydrolysis of the substrates Z-Leu-Arg-AMC and gelatin (Fig. 2 D). The refolding of each construct to active protein varied with the composition of refolding buffer and redox couple, as seen previously (8.Sijwali P.S. Brinen L.S. Rosenthal P.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but optimized recovery for each product was similar (Fig. 2 A). The progress of refolding to active enzyme for each protein was very similar, with maximum activity achieved after ∼18 h (Fig. 3). Thus, in contrast to all other described papain-family proteases, the prodomain of falcipain-2 is not required for folding of the active enzyme. Furthermore, including the prodomain in expression constructs does not improve the speed or efficiency of folding over that of the mature protease.Figure 3Progress of refolding.Denatured-reduced recombinant proteins were diluted 100-fold in refolding buffer containing 1 mm each of reduced and oxidized glutathione (buffers B for −188FP2 and −188dFP2, C for −89FP2 and −89dFP2, and E for −35FP2, FP2, and dFP2; see “Experimental Procedures” for description of buffers) and incubated at 4 °C. Aliquots from each reaction were tested for Z-Leu-Arg-AMC hydrolysis as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and results are expressed as the percentage of maximum activity (fluorescence units/min) obtained with any protease.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has recently been shown that alterations in prodomains can result in differential properties of mature proteases that are identical in sequence but have been processed from different proenzyme constructs (17.Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To determine whether this “memory” phenomenon was evident in falcipain-2, we compared catalytic properties of the four active proteases generated from different falcipain-2 constructs. The four proteases cleaved peptide substrates with very similar kinetics (Table I). Thus, the falcipain-2 prodomain does not appear to impart folding characteristics on the mature protease that impact on catalytic activity.Table IEffect of the prodomain on the catalytic properties of falcipain-2ParameterSubstrateActive product of different constructs−188FP2−89FP2−35FP2FP2K m(μm)Z-Leu-Arg-AMC7.67.58.98.8Z-Phe-Arg-AMC9.59.420.912.1k cat(s−1)Z-Leu-Arg-AMC1.61.21.51.9Z-Phe-Arg-AMC0.40.40.70.5k cat/K m(m−1s−1)Z-Leu-Arg-AMC202,600155,400162,400214,300Z-Phe-Arg-AMC44,97037,37031,30042,780 Open table in a new tab Considering the lack of a requirement for the prodomain for folding of mature falcipain-2, we considered the role of the unusual amino-terminal extension of this mature protease. Three constructs from which the 17-amino acid extension was deleted were expressed in E. coli (Fig. 4,A and C), purified, and refolded. Proenzyme constructs from which the 17-amino acid extension was deleted (−188dFP2, −89dFP2) and mature falcipain-2 lacking the 17-amino acid extension (dFP2) were all incapable of folding to active enzyme in any of the 176 tested buffers (Fig. 3). Thus, the short amino-terminal extension of falcipain-2 is required for correct folding of the mature protease. To determine whether the amino-terminal extension must be covalently linked to the remainder of the mature protease for folding, prodomain constructs with (−188P17, −89P17) or without ( −188P, −89P) the amino-terminal extension were expressed (Fig. 4, B and D) and incubated with the mature protease lacking the extension (dFP2) in standard folding buffers (Fig. 5). The extension-deleted mature protease (dFP2) was successfully folded to active enzyme in combinations that included extended prodomain constructs ( −188P17 or −89P17) but not in those including prodomains without the extension ( −188P, −89P; Fig. 5). Thus, presentation of the amino-terminal extension of mature falcipain-2 in trans was adequate to mediate correct folding of truncated mature falcipain-2. When a synthetic peptide identical to the 17-amino acid extension was incubated with the extension-deleted mature protease (dFP2), folding to active enzyme was not seen (Fig. 5). Our results indicate that the short amino-terminal falcipain-2 extension does not need to be covalently bound to the mature protease to mediate folding. However, the free peptide could not mediate folding, suggesting that, when it is not bound to the remainder of the mature protease, the extension must be presented by the prodomain, presumably after this domain binds to the mature protease via structural features maintained by well conserved “ERFNIN” and other residues in many papain-family enzymes (Fig. 1; Refs. 18.Karrer K.M.

In addition to their roles as mediators of folding, the prodomains of many papain-family (20.Guay J. Falgueyret J.P. Ducret A. Percival M.D. Mancini J.A. Eur. J.

It was of interest to determine whether the falcipain-2 prodomain retained an inhibitory function independent of folding activity. The inhibition of falcipain-2 by the prodomain was compared for the active products of four different constructs (−188FP2, −89FP2, −35FP2, and FP2; Fig. 2). The prodomain was a potent inhibitor of the mature protease, with similar inhibition constants for each active product (Table II). Inhibition of the protease was competitive and reversible, as indicated by very similarV MAX values but increasing K mvalues with increasing prodomain concentrations. For example, theK m for Z-Leu-Arg-AMC was 8.2 μm(V MAX, 2.7×10−7 μmol s−1) in the absence of the prodomain and 73.3 μm (V MAX, 2.7×10−7μmol s−1) in the presence of 18 nmprodomain.Table IIInhibition of falcipain-2 by the prodomainActive product−188FP2−89FP2−35FP2FP2K i(nm)0.330.310.540.30The hydrolysis of Z-Leu-Arg-AMC by falcipain-2 derived from four different constructs was carried out in the presence of different concentrations of the prodomain (−188P), and inhibition constants (K i) were calculated as discussed under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab The hydrolysis of Z-Leu-Arg-AMC by falcipain-2 derived from four different constructs was carried out in the presence of different concentrations of the prodomain (−188P), and inhibition constants (K i) were calculated as discussed under “Experimental Procedures.” We have characterized folding determinants of the P. falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-2 and shown that, unlike other studied papain-family proteases, falcipain-2 does not require its prodomain for folding. Rather, falcipain-2 utilizes an unusual amino-terminal peptide to mediate folding. Although the falcipain-2 prodomain differs from other papain-family enzymes in this regard, it shares another function in that it is a potent inhibitor of the mature protease. Molecular chaperones mediate folding of many proteins (24.Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar).

Physiol. 1999; 42: 167-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proteases, act intramolecularly by mediating folding of the cognate mature protein before processing and removal of the chaperone domain. Our results identify a novel intramolecular chaperone-like function for the amino-terminal extension of falcipain-2. It is described as chaperone-like, because unlike true chaperones, it remains bound to the mature protease. A role in folding for small amino-terminal peptides has previously been hypothesized but not, to our knowledge, identified (28.Ma B. Tsai C.J. Nussinov R. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is likely that many other proteins utilize small intramolecular peptides to mediate folding, in particular proteins that lack prodomains and those, such as falcipain-2 and some other proteases (e.g. trypsin, chymotrypsin, and cathepsin D), that do not require their prodomains for folding to the active enzymes (29.Higaki J.N. Evnin L.B. Craik C.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9256-9263Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30.Venekei I. Graf L. Rutter W.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9778-9782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Of note, the prodomain of falcipain-2 acts as a potent inhibitor of the mature protease, but it does not affect the rate or efficiency of protease folding or impact on the catalytic properties of the mature protease. The unusual folding properties of falcipain-2 are probably shared by other plasmodial cysteine proteases. Falcipain-3 (but not falcipain-1) shares the presence of an unusual sequence at the amino terminus of the mature protease domain (7.Sijwali P.S. Shenai B.S. Gut J. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In addition, a chimeric protein in which the amino-terminal extension of falcipain-2 was replaced by the corresponding region of falcipain-3 refolded with very similar efficiency to that of falcipain-2. 2P. S. Sijwali, unpublished data. Similar sequences are also seen in homologous proteases of murine malaria parasites 3A. Singh, unpublished data. but not in any other reported cysteine proteases. Thus, the unusual folding properties of a subset of the falcipains appear to be required due to a specific feature of the biology of malaria parasites. Why has a plasmodial cysteine protease developed an unusual intramolecular control of protein folding? We hypothesize that this architecture may have been generated to allow the protease to perform two quite different cellular functions. First, falcipain-2 cleaves hemoglobin in the acidic P. falciparum food vacuole (4.Rosenthal P.J. McKerrow J.H. Aikawa M. Nagasawa H. Leech J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 6.Shenai B.R. Sijwali P.S. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29000-29010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Second, the protease appears to be responsible for the hydrolysis of erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins that is probably required to allow the egress of mature parasites from the erythrocyte. A role for falcipain-2 in the hydrolysis of cytoskeletal proteins is supported by the observation that cysteine protease inhibitors block the rupture of erythrocytes by mature malaria parasites (32.Hadley T. Aikawa M. Miller L.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1983; 55: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 33.Salmon B.L. Oksman A. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the identification of P. falciparum cysteine protease activity that cleaves the erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins ankyrin and protein 4.1 (34.Raphael P. Takakuwa Y. Manno S. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Hanspal M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the demonstration that this activity is identical to that of recombinant falcipain-2 (35.Dua M. Raphael P. Sijwali P.S. Rosenthal P.J. Hanspal M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 116: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To access hemoglobin, falcipain-2 is likely transported to the parasite food vacuole by vesicular trafficking from the cytostome organelle after insertion into the parasite plasma membrane, as has also been proposed for aspartic plasmodial proteases (36.Francis S.E. Sullivan D.J. Goldberg D.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). To access the erythrocyte cytoskeleton, we propose that falcipain-2 is cleaved from the plasma membrane by limited autohydrolysis or the action of exogenous proteases. This process likely occurs at the cytostome, the plasmodial organelle through which erythrocyte cytosol transits into the parasite, and where the parasite plasma membrane appears to be in direct apposition with erythrocyte cytosol (37.Slomianny C. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 369-378PubMed Google Scholar). If this cleavage into erythrocyte cytosol liberates truncated, incompletely folded falcipain-2, the parasite may have evolved an intramolecular system for protease folding that is independent of the prodomain to allow the elaboration of hydrolytic activity against cytoskeletal targets. This model must take into account the need for control of falcipain-2 activity in the erythrocyte, presumably via inhibition by the free falcipain-2 prodomain or exogenous cysteine protease inhibitors such as cystatins. In any event, it explains the unique need in malaria parasites for a cysteine protease that can mediate its folding after cleavage of the prodomain. More generally, our data show that inhibitory and folding functions can be independent in papain-family enzymes. This independent control of enzyme inhibition and folding may well be a common feature of proteases, including those that may utilize different portions of the prodomain for the two functions. Furthermore, our results identify the use of a small internal peptide to direct folding of a mature protease and suggest that many other proteins may incorporate similar systems in which internal sequences provide mediation of protein folding.

SecA ATPase is thus activated only under appropriate conditions (i.e. by substrates at SecYEG) and not in vain (i.e. in the cytoplasm). An important unresolved question is the molecular mechanism of SecA/preprotein interaction and how this regulates the DEAD motor. Several assays have demonstrated that signal peptides and whole preproteins bind to soluble SecA and alter its conformation (23.Shinkai A. Mei L.H. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol.

On the other hand, nucleotides alter the efficiency of SecA/preprotein cross-linking (26.Wang L. Miller A. Kendall D.A. J. Biol.

Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 206: 6600-6606Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). However, whether this region represents a binding site for either the signal peptide or the mature region or whether cross-linking resulted from spatial proximity at a site distinct from the binding site proper was not determined. To determine the molecular features of SecA/preprotein interaction, we localized and quantitated signal peptide binding onto SecA. We found that the signal peptide binds on the amino-terminal ATPase subdomain of the DEAD motor, at a site distinct from the catalytic determinants. Binding requires SSD, a novel substrate specificity domain that is essential for protein translocation. Signal peptide binding affects conformation of the ATPase subdomain and leads to DEAD motor ATPase repression. Signal peptide binding to soluble SecA is, like ATP hydrolysis (17.Karamanou S.

Tryptic peptides (200 μg of total protein/run) were injected onto a reverse phase column (UP5WRP-25; Interchrom) in a Shimadzu LC-10AVP HPLC instrument equipped with a diode array detector and CLASS-VP 5.0 software. Peptides were eluted (50-min run at 0.75 ml/min) with a gradient of 25–56% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was monitored at 220 nm. Fractions (0.75 ml) were dried (SpeedVac; Savant) and resolubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on high Tris (hT) (34.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Biochemistry. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar) gels and either visualized by silver staining or electrotransferred (4 °C, 200 mA; 90 min) to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore Corp.). Following Coomassie Blue staining, peptides were subjected to Edman degradation (Alba Biosciences, Birmingham, UK). 3K7L (MKQKKLALLLALLLASSSASAC) and 1K2L (MKQQQAALAAAAALASSSASAC) prepared by standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase synthesis were purified by HPLC on a semipreparative resin (C18-SynChropak RP-P.250 × 7.8; Synchrom) and were handled and stored as described (24.Miller A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9904-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Purified peptides dissolved in Me2SO (∼5 mg/ml) were stored at −80 °C. Peptides were labeled by 3H acetylation of the N-terminal group (36.Seligman S.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 324-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C. The functional state of [3H]3K7L was tested by comparing its N68 ATPase inhibition activity with that of unlabeled 3K7L. 3K7L was immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). 3K7L (2 mg/ml resin in 0.1m NaHCO3, pH 8.3, 0.5 m NaCl) was coupled onto the matrix at 4 °C. Excess ligand was washed away, and the remaining active groups were blocked with 0.1 mTris·Cl, pH 8 (2 h). [3H]3K7L (1500 pmol; 55,000 cpm) was incubated (40-μl reactions; 5 min at 4 °C) with SecA or derivatives (150 pmol in buffer H (50 mm Hepes, pH 8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, dithiothreitol prior to incubation with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (10-fold molar excess; 20 min; 0 °C). After a 15-min incubation on ice, the reactions were quenched with 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. Cross-linking was visualized developed by fluorography (Amplify) and quantitated by phosphorimaging (TR screens/ImageQuant software; Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Proteolytic digests (50-μl final volume in buffer B) contained 20 pmol of proteins and a 15-fold (N1–349) or 20-fold (SecA and N68) molar excess of signal peptide. After a 5-min incubation on ice, trypsin (25 μg/ml) was added for an additional 45 min, and the reaction was stopped with pefabloc (10 mm). Samples were then analyzed by HPLC and SDS-PAGE (10% hT gels) and visualized by silver staining. Optical biosensor measurements were on an IBIS II instrument (Echochemie). 3K7L (3 μg in 50 μl from a 60 μg/ml stock in 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.5) was added onto carboxymethylated dextran-coated gold sensor disks (CMD6 or CMD20; Xantec) and was cross-linked via NH2-specificN-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide)/N-hydroxysuccinimide. The surface was equilibrated with buffer H and regenerated with 100 mm HCl. Data were collected for 750 s and were analyzed using IBIS Kinetic Analysis software. The association constant (Ka) was determined from data points of a range of protein concentrations at equilibrium (steady state of the association phase) by linear regression using the integrated rate method (37.O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). α-244–385 antibodies were purified from α-N244–478 serum. N385–610 was immobilized on CNBr-Sepharose (5 mg/ml gel, 12 h, 4 °C). Remaining active groups were blocked with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8. The α-244–478 serum was then adsorbed on the resin (1 h, 22 °C) to remove 385–478 interacting antibodies. Flow-through material was collected and tested for specificity by Western blot and immunoblotting. Protein concentration determination, in vitro translocation assays, enzyme kinetics, CD spectroscopy, and protein electrophoresis were as described (7.Economou A. Pogliano J.P. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 17.Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A. Economou A. Mol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To identify the signal peptide binding region of SecA, we used 3K7L, a chemically synthesized signal peptide that binds soluble SecA and promotes efficient protein secretion in vivo (24.Miller A. Wang L. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,26.Wang L. Miller A. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10154-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The peptide we synthesized has all of the functional features described previously; it activates SecA lipid ATPase (Fig. 1A) and inhibits translocation ATPase activity while leaving basal and membrane ATPase activities largely unaffected. In support of previous data (24.Miller A. Wang L. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), none of these effects are observed with 1K2L, a nonfunctional signal peptide (not shown). Furthermore, 3K7L competitively inhibits translocation of a full-length preprotein such as proOmpA into inverted inner membrane vesicles when added prior (B, lane 4) but not after (lane 5) initiation of the reaction. To determine which SecA primary domain is responsible for 3K7L binding, we employed chemical cross-linking (Fig. 1C). Mixtures of tritiated 3K7L (lane 1; see “Experimental Procedures”) with SecA or N68 or C34 (17.Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18.Sianidis G. Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Boulias K. Repanas K. Kyrpides N. Politou A.S. Economou A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) were cross-linked with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). Under nonreducing conditions, [3H]3K7L co-migrates with SecA (lane 3) or N68 (lane 6) but not with C34 (lane 9). Cross-linking of [3H]3K7L was more intense with N68 than with SecA (see also below), was extensively reduced by dithiothreitol (DTT; lanes 4 and 7), and could be competed by the addition of an excess of nonlabeled 3K7L (lanes 5 and8). No cross-linking of [3H]3K7L was observed to a BSA control (lane 2). These results indicated that signal peptides bind on the SecA DEAD motor. To further test this possibility, SecA and N68 were passed over agarose-immobilized 3K7L (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both proteins were retained on the affinity matrix (Fig. 1, D andE; lanes 1–3) and were competitively eluted by an excess of free 3K7L (lane 4). BSA did not bind to the matrix and was recovered in the flow-through (F, lane 2). We conclude that signal peptides bind on the SecA DEAD motor (N68 domain). To identify the DEAD motor subdomain responsible for signal peptide binding, N68 was trypsinized to large peptides that were amino-terminally sequenced (Fig. 1G; lane 2; p36, p35, p25, p24, p16, and p12). Binding of these peptides to the 3K7L affinity matrix was tested. The amino-terminal p36 and p35 fragments were quantitatively retained on the matrix, since they were not present in the flow-through (lane 3). p16 (contains IRA2) (18.Sianidis G. Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Boulias K. Repanas K. Kyrpides N. Politou A.S. Economou A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and p12 were recovered in the flow-through (lane 3), suggesting that these regions do not contain a fully functional signal peptide binding site. p25 and p24 (containing IRA2 and upstream sequences) were largely retained on the matrix (lane 5), suggesting that they either bind signal peptide directly or that they coelute with amino-terminal fragments (such as p35 and p36) due to the tight association of the ATPase subdomain with IRA2 (18.Sianidis G. Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Boulias K. Repanas K. Kyrpides N. Politou A.S. Economou A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To unambiguously delimit the signal peptide binding determinants, we generated truncated recombinant N68 derivatives synthesized with oligohistidinyl extensions (Fig. 2A and Ref. 18.Sianidis G. Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Boulias K. Repanas K. Kyrpides N. Politou A.S. Economou A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant fragments (Fig. 2B) were shown by far UV sprectropolarimetry to be folded (data not shown and Ref. 18.Sianidis G. Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Boulias K. Repanas K. Kyrpides N. Politou A.S. Economou A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Binding of [3H]3K7L to N68 fragments was examined by cross-linking (Fig. 2C). Cross-linking to N1–263, N1–349, and N1–479 (Fig. 2C, lanes 5–7) and N1–420 (data not shown) was at least as strong as that of SecA and N68 (lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, reduced but measurable cross-linking was also obtained with N1–234 (lane 4), while cross-linking to the slightly smaller N1–227 fragment was weak (lane 3). To exclude artifacts due to truncated constructs, in the same assay we tested a full-length SecA with an internal deletion of residues 219–240 (33.Jarosik G.P. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 860-868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SecAΔ219–240 is dominant negative in vivo(33.Jarosik G.P. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 860-868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has no detectable structural defects since it is proteolytically stable (Fig. 2B, lane 14) (33.Jarosik G.P. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 860-868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and displays wild type basal ATPase (Kcat = ∼4 min−1). No detectable cross-linking was obtained with either SecAΔ219–240 (Fig. 2C, lane 14) or N68Δ219–240 (lane 15). Similarly, little or no cross-linking was obtained with fragments that did not contain the 1–270 sequence (lanes 8–12) or with a control protein (lane 13). To further test and quantitate 3K7L association to SecA and derivatives with a direct method that eliminates potential aggregation artifacts, we developed a 3K7L optical biosensor (Fig. 2E; see “Experimental Procedures”). N68 binding (lane 2) to 3K7L is higher than that of SecA (lane 1). In agreement with the cross-linking results, N1–234, N1–263, N1–349, and N1–479 (lanes 4–7) bind to 3K7L as well as or even more strongly than SecA, whereas N1–227 (lane 3) binds poorly. Fragments devoid of amino-terminal sequences (lanes 8–12), control proteins (lane 13), SecAΔ219–240 (lane 14), and N68Δ219–240 (lane 15) show little or no detectable binding. These data can be rationalized by kinetic analysis (Table I). The binding affinity (KD) of SecA for 3K7L is almost 3 times reduced when compared with that of N68, indicating that N68 is somehow activated for binding (see below). N1–263 has similar affinity to N68, whereas that of N1–234 is high but ∼3-fold reduced compared with that of N68. In contrast, the affinity of N1–227 is drastically reduced (∼15-fold), suggesting that it is missing either residues important for efficient 3K7L binding or local structural features.Table IKinetic parameters of signal peptide binding to SecA and derivative domainsProteinKD,3K7LnμmSecA3.165N681.364N1–227214N1–2344.92N1–2631.83SecAΔIRA1-(783–795)1.233SecAW775A1.43A range of protein concentrations ensuring binding saturation (0.05–10 μm) were added to 3K7L immobilized on a biosensor (see “Experimental Procedures”). n, number of repeats of the measurement.

We conclude that N1–263 contains a fully functional signal peptide binding site. Since the mutated proteins show no structural defect, our data suggest that residues 219–244 are essential for signal peptide binding to an unknown region of 1–263, whereas residues 234–263 may optimize the binding reaction. To characterize folding and subdomain structure of the DEAD motor amino-terminal region that contains the ATPase and signal peptide binding determinants (Fig. 2), we combined two approaches: (a) limited trypsinolysis of amino-terminal N68 fragments (Fig. 3A) and (b) comparison of SecA amino-terminal sequences with those of DEAD helicases of known three-dimensional structure (Fig. 3B). The N1–420 construct is colinear with the most prominent proteolytic fragment of 46 kDa derived from SecA and N68 (17.Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.

N1–420 contains DEAD superfamily 2 motifs I–III (21.Bird L.E. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 22.Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and its predicted secondary structure aligns well with that of other DEAD proteins such as UvrB (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these observations suggest that, as in all corresponding DEAD helicase domains,"

We report that CsA treatment results in increased level of the p53 tumor suppressor, its nuclear accumulation, and transcriptional activation of p53-dependent genes. The increase of p53 correlates with the elevation of p21Waf1 and Bax protein expression. The increased level of Bax protein was accompanied with changes in its subcellular localization and association with mitochondria. Importantly, we demonstrate that glioma cells stably transfected with a mutant p53 (p53Val135) fail to increase p21 and Bax protein levels and are less sensitive to CsA-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, primary fibroblasts from p53−/− knockout mice are significantly more resistant to CsA-induced apoptosis compared with their corresponding counterparts containing functional p53. Together, our results suggest that the apoptotic program activated by CsA can be mediated by activation of p53 tumor suppressor and potentiation of its ability to initiate apoptosis.

Together, our results suggest that the apoptotic program activated by CsA can be mediated by activation of p53 tumor suppressor and potentiation of its ability to initiate apoptosis. The p53 tumor suppressor is implicated in cell cycle control, DNA repair, replicative senescence, and programmed cell death (1.Haffner R. Oren M. Curr. Opin.

In normal cells p53 is expressed at a low constitutive level and is localized predominantly in cytoplasm. The latent form of p53 is stabilized and activated by post-translational modifications (3.Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). A number of cellular kinases have been proposed to directly phosphorylate p53, including casein kinase I, casein kinase II, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein, CDK7, DNA-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAP 1The abbreviations used are: MAPmitogen-activated proteinCsAcyclosporin AMdm2murine double minute clone 2 oncoproteinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanatePBSphosphate-buffered salinekinase (4.Knippschild U.

Activation of p53 may also result in apoptosis, and indeed, p53 transcriptionally activates a number of pro-apoptotic proteins including Bax, Fas, p85, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3, PIG3, and apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (18.Yu J.

The signaling cascade induced by p53 is complex and likely differs depending on the type of tissue examined. Despite the fact that many distinct damaging agents and cell types share similar features in regulating p53 function, no single cell type or damaging agent can generalize all known components of the p53 pathway (23.Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Ball K.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).

Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar). The p53 dysfunction is the frequent event occurring in gliomas, the most common adult brain tumors of glial origin that are highly resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (32.Bogler O. Huang H.J. Kleihues P. Cavenee W.K. Glia. 1995; 15: 308-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Many studies concentrate on the discovery of agents that allow rescue of wild-type p53 conformation and function (23.Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Ball K.L. Biochem.

Cyclosporin A is a widely used immunosuppressive drug that acts by binding to immunophilins and inhibiting a protein phosphatase, calcineurin (37.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). The effects of CsA have been mostly characterized in lymphocytes, but recent data point out that CsA not only affects signaling pathways in lymphocytes but also in other cellular types such as adipocytes (38.Ho I.C. Kim J.H. Rooney J.W. Spiegelman B.M. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15537-15541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and myocytes (39.Musaro A. McCullagh K.J. Naya F.J. Olson E.N. Rosenthal N. Nature. 1999; 400: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 40.Semsarian C. Wu M.J. Ju Y.K. Marciniec T. Yeoh T. Allen D.G. Harvey R.P. Graham R.M. Nature. 1999; 400: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that cyclosporin A (CsA) induces apoptosis in rat C6 glioma cells that is characterized by morphological changes (such as shrinkage of the cell body and loss of extensions), chromatin condensation, caspase-3 activation, and “ladder-like” DNA fragmentation (41.Mosieniak G. Figiel I. Kaminska B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 42.Mosieniak G. Pyrzynska B. Kaminska B. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 43.Pyrzynska B. Mosieniak G. Kaminska B. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cell death induced by CsA is dependent on de novoprotein synthesis and occurs in association with the persistent activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAP kinases, members of stress-activated protein kinase family. Prolonged activation of stress-activated protein kinases results in the stabilization c-Jun and ATF-2 proteins, activation of AP-1 DNA binding activity, and transcriptional activation of Fas ligand expression (43.Pyrzynska B. Mosieniak G. Kaminska B. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This work was thus undertaken to further elucidate the mechanism of CsA-induced cell death of glioma cells. We have hypothesized that p53 tumor suppressor and a pro-apoptotic protein could be an important mediator of CsA-induced apoptosis. We provide evidence that treatment of glioma cells and primary fibroblasts with CsA results in the up-regulation of p53 level and activation of p53-dependent apoptotic cell death. In glioma cells the induction of apoptosis by CsA correlates with the p53-dependent expression of p21Waf1, a cell cycle inhibitor and a pro-apoptotic Bax protein. Rat C6 glioma cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (Sigma) and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin). Cells were grown in 24-well or 10-cm diameter culture plates (Corning Glass) in a humidified atmosphere of CO2/air (5%/95%) at 37 °C (or 38 °C where indicated). At 18 h after plating, glioma cells were treated with 60 μm CsA (Sandimmun, Sandoz) as described (41.Mosieniak G. Figiel I. Kaminska B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 42.Mosieniak G. Pyrzynska B. Kaminska B. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from wild-type and p53−/− knockout mice were obtained as described previously (44.Jacks T. Remington L. Williams B.O. Schmitt E.M. Halachmi S. Bronson R.T. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar, 45.Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics. At 18 h after passage, fibroblasts were treated with 45 μm CsA. Rat C6 glioma cells (2 × 104 cells/cm2) were seeded in an 8-well glass slide and grown for 24 h. Control cells and cells treated with 60 μm CsA were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde, 10 min at room temperature), permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, 15 min at room temperature), and blocked (2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature). The cells were then stained overnight at 4 °C with either anti-p53 antibody (NovoCastra), anti-p21, or anti-Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 for 1 h at room temperature and TO-PRO-3 for nuclear staining (Molecular Probes). For mitochondria detection, an antibody recognizing the E2 polypeptide of the mammalian mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex followed by anti-human IgG conjugated with Cy3 was used (46.Claveria C. Albar J.P. Serrano A. Buesa J.M. Barbero J.L. Martinez-A C. Torres M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7199-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Stained cells were visualized with either TCS-NT Leica confocal imaging system or fluorescent microscopy (Olympus). Cells were collected in PBS with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cell lysis was achieved by addition of an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Equal protein loading was confirmed by staining the membranes with Ponceau Red (Sigma). Membranes were subsequently incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies as follows: a mouse monoclonal anti-p53 Ab-1 (Transduction Laboratories), and polyclonal anti-p21, anti-Bax, anti-Bcl-xL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-Actin (Sigma). Antibody recognition was detected with the respective secondary antibody, either anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunocomplexes were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Expression vectors used included the following: a temperature-sensitive mouse p53Val135 mutant in pWZL-hygro vector (45.Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar), and a control pWZL-hygro vector. Plasmid DNA for transfections was isolated using QIAfilter plasmid kit (Qiagen). Cells were transfected with p53Val135 vector or empty pWZL-hygro vector using TransFast Reagent (Promega). Transfected cells were selected in medium containing 700 μg/ml hygromycin for 4–6 weeks, and individual clones were isolated and expanded. The levels of p53 protein expression among p53Val135 stably transfected clones were verified by Western blot analysis. For nuclear DNA staining, cells were fixed overnight in cold 70% ethanol, washed in PBS, and stained with Hoechst 33258 at 0.005 mg/ml (in PBS, pH 7.4) for 10 min. Stained cells were washed again with PBS and examined under the fluorescence microscope with excitation at 330–380 nm. For flow cytometry (using EPICS XL flow cytometer, Coulter), cells were stained with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) for cell cycle analysis or propidium iodide (2.5 μg/ml) with the annexin V-FITC kit for phosphatidylserine detection (Immunotech). Total RNA was isolated from C6 cells at different times after the treatment using RNeasy Mini kit with QIAshredders (Qiagen). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was fractionated through a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by standard techniques. Serial probing of the Hybond membranes with probes coding for mouse p21waf1, mdm2,g3pdh, and human bax cDNAs was performed. Probes were generated by enzymatic digestion of inserts encoding the mentioned cDNAs and labeling with [32P]dCTP using a random primer-labeling kit, (Rediprime, Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were stripped between each probing. The hybridization was performed after preincubating the membranes with a solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 7% SDS, 0.5 mNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4 at 60 °C for 3 h. 32P-Labeled DNA was added at a concentration of 5 × 107 cpm/ml, and membranes were incubated overnight at 60 °C. Membranes were then washed at high stringency buffer and exposed on Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry of the autoradiograms was performed using the Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Data were expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical significance was assessed by the one-way analysis of variance test. p values less than 0.05 were considered as significant. We examined p53 protein expression during CsA-induced apoptosis in C6 glioma cells. This particular clone of glioma cells is known to express wild-type p53 (47.Anker L. Ohgaki H. Ludeke B.I. Herrmann H.D. Kleihues P. Westphal M. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 982-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 48.Asai A. Miyagi Y. Sugiyama A. Gamanuma M. Hong S.H. Takamoto S. Nomura K. Matsutani M. Takakura K. Kuchino Y. J. Neurooncol. 1994; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed a significant increase of p53 protein level in cells treated with 60 μm CsA for 15 h that remained elevated up to 50 h (Fig. 1A). The observed increase of p53 level preceded an induction of apoptosis. Fig. 1, B andC, shows representative results of flow cytometric analysis of C6 glioma cells untreated or exposed to CsA for various times. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis shows a significant increase in the number of annexin V-FITC-positive cells at 40–50 h after CsA addition. Annexin V binds phosphatidylserine. Apoptotic changes in cell membrane biochemistry lead to increased concentration of phosphatidylserine on the outer plasma membrane, where it becomes accessible to annexin V. The increasing number of cells co-stained with annexin-FITC and propidium iodide at 60 h indicates an occurrence of secondary necrosis (Fig. 1C). Proliferating glioma cells in the absence of CsA showed marginal p53 nuclear level, as determined by immunofluorescence staining with specific antibody. Upon CsA treatment, the level of nuclear p53 was significantly increased after 25 h and remained elevated up to 40 h (Fig. 2A). Staining with a fluorescent dye Hoechst 33258 that visualized apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology followed immunocytochemical detection of p53 proteins in glioma cells. This double staining revealed a considerable increase of nuclear p53 levels in apoptotic cells (Fig. 2A). Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein was more prominent in cells exhibiting morphological features of apoptosis, such as loss of cytoplasmic extensions, “bean”-shaped nuclei with highly condensed chromatin. These morphological features have been shown previously to precede an increase in the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling positive cells and ladder-like DNA fragmentation. To determine whether the above-described up-regulation of p53 is accompanied by an increase of its transcriptional activity, we studied the expression of some genes, p21waf1, bax, andmdm2, that are potential transcriptional targets of p53 (14.Fritsche M. Haessler C. Brandner G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 307-318PubMed Google Scholar,17.el-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The activated p53 is known to increase the mdm2 (murine double minute) gene transcription and interactions between the p53 and Mdm2 form negative autoregulatory feedback loop (49.Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3722) Google Scholar). Total RNA was harvested at 0, 15, 25, and 35 h after exposure to 60 μm CsA. Northern blots were then serially probed with labeled cDNA probes. The increase of mdm2 and p21waf1 mRNA levels was observed 15 h after CsA treatment, and mRNA levels remained higher than in untreated cells up to 35 h. In contrast, bax mRNA increased barely at 25 h after CsA treatment (Fig. 2B). Staining of the 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA levels on corresponding agarose gels with ethidium bromide ensured the equal loading of total RNA in each sample. Furthermore, we have examined changes in protein levels of p21Waf1 and Bax in CsA-treated cells. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies specifically recognizing p21 and Bax protein demonstrated that there was a significant increase in p21 and Bax protein levels 25 h after the addition of CsA (Fig. 2C). The same extracts applied for Bax immunoblot analysis were used to analyze changes of the levels of Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 family. The levels of Bcl-xLprotein slightly but reproducibly decreased at 35–50 h post-treatment (Fig. 2C). The subcellular localization of the Bax protein plays an important role in the induction of apoptosis as cytosolic Bax is unable to induce cell death, and in different cell systems the association of Bax translocation to mitochondria with release of pro-apoptotic molecules and activation of apoptosis has been demonstrated (28.Yin C. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Van Dyke T. Nature. 1997; 385: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 29.Fortin A. Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J.G. Kushwaha N. Hickman E.S. Thompson C.S. Hakim A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2345-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The use of Bax-specific antibodies and confocal microscopy revealed a significant change in the subcellular localization of Bax elicited by CsA treatment (Fig. 3). In particular, untreated cells showed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization of Bax, whereas in CsA-treated cultures many cells had Bax localized in association to mitochondria at 36 h after addition of 60 μm CsA (Fig. 3, overlay). Those changes were observed particularly in the cells exhibiting apoptotic nuclear alterations visualized by TO-PRO-3 staining (Fig. 3, right panel). Noteworthy, in CsA-treated cultures cells with a weak expression and diffuse cytoplasmic localization of Bax had normal nuclei without signs of chromatin condensation (Fig. 3). The above results suggest that CsA treatment evokes the accumulation of p53 and its activation, resulting in the transcriptional activation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. The increased level of Bax is accompanied by changes of its subcellular localization and association with mitochondria. To investigate the role of p53 in CsA-induced apoptosis, we have generated C6 glioma cells stably expressing p53Val135. This mutant p53, carrying a substitution from alanine to valine at position 135, exhibits a dominant negative activity against wild-type p53 at 38 °C (50.Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M. Cell. 1990; 62: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of protein extracts isolated from three cell lines of p53Val135 transfected cells, cultured at 38 °C, confirmed that these cells expressed high levels of p53 protein (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we demonstrated that CsA-induced up-regulation of p21 and Bax levels was inhibited in cells expressing mutant p53 (Fig. 4B). The highest inhibition was observed in the cell line expressing the highest level of p53Val135 mutant. Apoptotic changes were analyzed in several independently derived clones of glioma cells stably transfected with empty vector or mutant p53Val135 that were treated with CsA for 40 h. Fig. 5 shows the results of the representative experiment demonstrating differences in sensitivity to apoptosis between control and p53Val135 cell lines. Such differences were particularly evident after staining the nuclei of fixed cells with the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33258. The vast majority of cells transfected with empty vector and treated with CsA exhibited chromatin condensation and deformations in nuclear shape. In contrast, the appearance of apoptotic changes was significantly blocked in p53Val135-expressing cells, and the majority of these cells still remained attached to the dish (Fig. 5A). The same results were obtained with several others independently derived p53Val135-expressing clones (not shown).Figure 5Dominant negative p53 confers resistance to CsA-induced apoptosis in rat glioma cells. A, cells stably transfected with empty or mutant p53Val135 were treated with 60 μm CsA, and apoptotic changes in cell shape and nuclear morphology were analyzed after 40 h. A representative result of three independent experiments is shown. Staining with a fluorescent dye Hoechst 33258 was employed to visualize the nuclei of control and CsA-treated cultures (lower panel).B, quantitation of CsA-induced apoptosis in glioma cells expressing dominant negative p53 mutant. The percentage of apoptotic cells at different times after CsA (60 μm) was determined by staining cells with FITC-conjugated annexin V and flow cytometry (EPICS XL, Coulter). The data represent means ± S.D. from 3 independent clones at each time point. Asterisks indicate statistical significance measured by one-way analysis of variance test: *, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001 (cells expressing dominant negative p53 mutant versus control cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Furthermore, we have used annexin V binding and flow cytometry to obtain a quantitative estimate of the resistance of glioma cells expressing p53Val135 to CsA-induced cell death (Fig. 5B). Glioma cells expressing mutant p53 were significantly resistant to apoptosis as inferred by the diminished appearance of annexin V binding. Approximately 20% of the p53Val135-expressing cells were annexin V-positive after 50 h of CsA treatment, compared with 55% in the case of control cells (Fig. 5B). The experiment shown in Fig. 5B is the average of assays done with three independent p53Val135-expressing clones. All together, these results demonstrate that the expression of dominant negative p53 confers resistance to the induction of apoptosis by CsA. To critically test the importance of p53 activation during CsA-induced apoptosis, we have performed further studies on primary cells lacking functional p53 pro"

NADE (p75NTR-associated celldeath executor) is a p75NTR-associated protein that mediates apoptosis in response to NGF by interacting with the death domain of p75NTR in 293T, PC12, and nnr5 cells (Mukai, J., Hachiya, T., Shoji-Hoshino, S., Kimura, M.

We performed extensive mutational analysis on NADE, to better characterize its structural and functional features. Truncation of a minimal region, including amino acid residues 41–71 of NADE, was found to be sufficient to induce apoptosis. The designated regulatory region includes the C-terminal amino acid residues (72–112) and is essential for NGF-dependent regulation of NADE-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the mutants with amino acid substitutions in the leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) sequence (residues 90–100) abolished the export of NADE from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Mutation of the NES also abolished self-association of NADE, its interaction with p75NTR, and NGF-dependent apoptosis. Expression of a fragment of NADE (amino acid residues 81–124) blocked NGF-induced apoptosis in oligodendrocytes, suggesting that this region has a dominant negative effect on NGF/p75NTR-induced apoptosis. These studies identify distinct regions of NADE that are involved in regulating specific functions involved in p75NTR signal transduction.

Many mammalian cells undergo apoptosis in response to various stimuli, including DNA damage, growth factor deprivation, and abnormal expression of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (1.Raff M.C.

Apoptosis induced by these various signals appears to be mediated by a common set of downstream elements that act as regulators and effectors of programmed cell death. Apoptosis also occurs during the course of normal development. In neural cells, neurotrophins have been shown to promote apoptosis during development (4.Bibel M. Barde Y.A.

Binding of NGF to TrkA activates the kinase and subsequently induces phosphorylation of multiple substrates that lead to the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and other intracellular signaling cascades (10.Peng X.

In contrast, p75NTR, which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, mediates neurotrophin-induced apoptosis (14.Dechant G. Barde Y.A. Curr. Opin.

Several lines of evidence from various systems, including cultured cells as well as knockout and transgenic mice, suggest that p75NTR has a pro-apoptotic role (15.Bredesen D.E. Rabizadeh S.

Furthermore, NGF induces apoptosis in terminally differentiated primary oligodendrocytes expressing p75NTR (20.Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that p75NTR is involved in NGF-induced apoptosis. The only known consensus motif within the intracellular domain of p75NTR is a death domain, similar to that found in the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (p55TNFR) and in Fas. However, the molecular mechanisms by which p75NTR mediates pro-apoptotic signaling have not been well characterized. Recently, members of the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family, FAP-1, SC-1, NRIF, NRAGE, and RhoA, have been reported to interact with the intracellular domain (ICD) of p75NTR (21.Khursigera G.

The retinae ofnrif −/− mice show reduced cell death, and this reduction is quantitatively similar to that seen inp75−/− and ngf−/−mice (25.Casademunt E. Carter B.D. Benzel I. Frade J.M. Dechant G.

NRAGE overexpression facilitates cell cycle arrest and permits NGF-dependent apoptosis within sympathetic neuron precursor cells (26.Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L.

However, the mechanisms of p75NTR-mediated signal transduction are still not fully understood. Recently, we identified a novel protein that we termed p75NTR-associated cell death executor (NADE), which associated with the p75NTR(ICD) in a yeast two-hybrid screen (28.Mukai J. Hachiya T. Shoji-Hoshino S. Kimura M.T. Nadano D. Suvanto P. Hanaoka T. Li Y. Irie S. Greene L.A. Sato T.A. J. Biol.

A data base search using the putative NADE amino acid sequence identified a homologous, partially characterized human cDNA clone termed HGR74/Bex3 (29.Brown A.L. Kay G.F. Hum. Mol.

NGF induced a dose-dependent association of NADE with the death domain of p75NTR, and p75NTR·NADE-induced cell death required NGF but not BDNF, NT-3, or NT-4/5. Similar results were also obtained in PC12 and PC12 nnr5 cells (28.Mukai J. Hachiya T. Shoji-Hoshino S. Kimura M.T. Nadano D. Suvanto P. Hanaoka T. Li Y. Irie S. Greene L.A. Sato T.A. J. Biol.

After forebrain ischemia, p75NTR and NADE gene expression were induced in degenerating rat hippocampal CA1 neurons. NADE contributes to p75NTR-induced cortical neuronal death (30.Park J.A. Lee J.-Y. Sato T.A. Koh J.-Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9096-9103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, 14-3-3 proteins associate with NADE and play a role in p75NTR·NADE-mediated apoptosis in HEK293 cells, PC12 nnr5 cells, and oligodendrocytes (31.Kimura M.T. Irie S. Shoji-Hoshino S. Mukai J. Nadano D. Oshimura M. Sato T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17291-17300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). NADE has a nuclear export signal (NES) consensus motif, which is both necessary and sufficient to mediate nuclear export of large carrier proteins (32.Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Recent reports have demonstrated that the cellular localization of many proteins is tightly regulated by this motif, including that of HIV-Rev (33.Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Lhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), PKI (34.Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Thus, the NES-mediated intracellular transport system is a widely conserved mechanism that controls the subcellular localization of proteins in cells. In this study, we have analyzed three issues relating to the functional and structural properties of mouse NADE. First, by mutational analysis, we have defined the subregions of NADE that are required for NGF-induced cell death. Second, we have shown that NADE contains a functional NES domain and that this sequence is responsible for self-association, interaction with p75NTR and induction of cell death. Finally, we have identified a dominant negative form of NADE, comprised of amino acids 81–124, which inhibited NGF-induced apoptosis in oligodendrocytes. NADE (WT) (pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(−)A/mNADE WT) was constructed as described previously (28.Mukai J. Hachiya T. Shoji-Hoshino S. Kimura M.T. Nadano D. Suvanto P. Hanaoka T. Li Y. Irie S. Greene L.A.

Expression vectors for mouse NADE deletion mutants were constructed by PCR amplification of NADE coding sequences using oligonucleotide pairs as shown, digesting the resulting fragments with XhoI/BamHI, and ligating the resulting fragments into XhoI/BamHI-digested pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(−) A: for N-(1–120), FX29 (5′-ATCCTCGAGCGATCATGGCCAATGTCCAC-3′) and RB360 (5′-ATCGGATCCGAATTCATCATGGTGATC-3′); for N-(1–112), FX29 and RB336 (5′-ATCGGATCCGTTAGACAGCTCCCCCAT-3′); for N-(1–100), FX29 and RB300 (5′-ATCGGATCCTCTCAGCTGTAGCTCCCT-3′); for N-(1–71), FX29 and RB213 (5′-ATCGGATCCGTCATTCATCTGCCTGTT-3′); for N-(1–20), FX29 and RB60 (5′-ATCGGATCCTTCCTGTCCATTCTGCAG-3′); for N-(41–124), FX121 (5′-ATCCTCGAGACCATGCACAACCATAACCACAAC-3′) and RB27 (5′-ATCGGATCCAGGCATAAGGCAGAATTC-3′); for N-(81–124), FX241 (5′-ATCCTCGAGACCATGGAAATGTTCATGGAGGAG-3′) and RB27; for N-(101–124), FX301 (5′-ATCCTCGAGACCATGAATTGTCTACGCATCCTT-3′) and RB27; for N-(41–71), FX121 and RB213; for FLAG-tagged N(WT), FX29, and RBFLAG (5′-CGCGGATCCTCACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCAGGCATAAGGCAGAATTC-3′). Point mutants for NADE were constructed by PCR amplification ofNADE coding sequences using oligonucleotide pairs as described below, followed by digesting the resulting PCR product withDpnI: for N(L99A) and GFP-N(L99A), in which Leu-99 is replaced with Ala, F-L99A (5′-AGGGAGCTACAGGCGAGAAATTGTCTA-3′), and R-L99A (5′-TAGACAATTTCTCGCCTGTAGCTCCCT-3′); for N(L94A/L97A/L99A) and GFP-N(L94A/L97A/L99A), in which Leu-94, Leu-97, and Leu-99 are replaced with Ala, F-L97A (5′-AAAGCTTAGGGAGGCACAGCTGAGAAA-3′), R-L97A (5′-TTTCTCAGCTGTGCCTCCCTAAGCTTT-3′) and F-L97A/L99A (5′-AGGGAGGCACAGGCGAGAAATTGTCTA-3′), R-L97A/L99A (5′-TAGACAATTTCTCGCCTGTGCCTCCCT-3′) and F-L94A/L97A (5′-ATCCGGAGAAAGGCTAGGGAGGCACA-3′), R-L94A/L97A (5′-TGTGCCTCCCTAGCCTTTCTCCGGAT-3′). Expression plasmids encoding fusion proteins of green fluorescence protein (GFP) and NADE proteins were constructed as follows: GFP cDNA was PCR-amplified from pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by using the primer pair 5′-CTAGCTAGCATCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCAT-3′. The product was cloned into theNheI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(−)A/mNADE. Expression plasmids for glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-fused p75NTR proteins have been described previously (28.Mukai J. Hachiya T. Shoji-Hoshino S. Kimura M.T. Nadano D. Suvanto P. Hanaoka T. Li Y.

Adenoviral vectors were constructed using the Adeno-X Expression system (CLONTECH) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. pShuttle/Myc-GFP, pShuttle/Myc-N(WT), and pShuttle/Myc-N-(81–124) were constructed by digesting the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(−)A/GFP, pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(−)A/N(WT), and pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(−)A/N-(81–124) withNheI/AflII, and ligating the resulting fragments into the NheI/AflII sites of the pShuttle vector. pAdeno-X/Myc-GFP, pAdeno-X/Myc-N(WT), and pAdeno-X/Myc-N-(81–124) were constructed by digesting pShuttle constructs with PI-SceI/I-CeuI and ligating the resulting fragments into the PI-SceI/I-CeuI sites of the pAdeno-X adenoviral vector. Recombinant adenoviral plasmids were packaged into infectious adenoviral particles by transfecting human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. The adenoviral particles were propagated in HEK293 cells and purified on cesium chloride gradients. Recombinant adenoviruses were screened for expression of the introduced genes by fluorescent microscopy and/or Western blot analysis. Adenoviral infection was performed on oligodendrocytes that were cultured for 7 days in Basal Medium Eagle (BME), which is described under “Cell Culture and Transfection.” Cells were infected with 4–10 plaque-forming units/cell of adenovirus in BME. After incubation for 6 h at 37 °C, cultures were replaced with fresh BME for 18 h. For the apoptosis assay, infected oligodendrocytes were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF. N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN), NGF, leptomycin B (LMB), and the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 568, and anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 350 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The anti-α-NADE polyclonal antibody was prepared as described previously (28.Mukai J. Hachiya T. Shoji-Hoshino S. Kimura M.T. Nadano D. Suvanto P. Hanaoka T. Li Y. Irie S. Greene L.A. Sato T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17566-17570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The anti-O1 mouse monoclonal antibody was a kind gift from Dr. S. Pfeiffer. The anti-myc polyclonal antibody was obtained from MBL International Corp. (Watertown, MA). The anti-myc monoclonal antibody was obtained from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). 293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection; 293T cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection, 293T cells (1.5 × 106 per 100-mm dish) were transiently transfected with 25 μg of DNA using the calcium phosphate method in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured for 10 h. After withdrawing the serum, the cells were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 36 h. Oligodendrocytes were prepared as described previously (36.Gu C. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Srinivasan A. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3043-3049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mixed glial cultures were prepared from P2-rat cortex. After plating on poly-d-lysine-coated 75-cm2flasks, cultures were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 7 days. Oligodendrocytic cultures were typically preplated and grown for 24 h in NM15 media (minimal essential medium supplemented with 15% FCS, 6 mg/ml glucose, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 mg/ml streptomycin). Cultures were then switched to oligodendrocyte differentiation media, containing BME:Ham's F-12 (1:1 v/v) supplemented with 6 mg/mld-glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml transferrin, 25 μg/ml insulin, 20 nm progesterone, 60 μm putrescine, 30 nm selenium, 6.6 mm glutamine, and 0.5 μm thyroxine. 293T cells were plated onto glass coverslips and transfected with GFP-containing constructs. At 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stained with Hoechst 33342 to visualize the nucleus. The images of representative fields were captured on a fluorescence microscopy EFD-3 (Nikon) and recorded with a SPOT-RT digital charge-coupled device camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (37.Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Petehansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Transfected 293T cells were washed in PBS. Half of the cells were used for preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, respectively. For preparation of cytoplasmic extracts, the cells were resuspended in 300 μl of buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mmbenzamidine), and allowed to swell by incubation for 10 min on ice. The cells were gently homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. Small aliquots of the lysate were taken and stained with trypan blue to determine the progression of cell lysis. Homogenization was continued until more than 95% of the cells were broken. After centrifugation at 1500 ×g, the resultant supernatant was carefully removed and supplemented with 60 μl of 6-fold concentrated standard reducing sample buffer. For preparation of nuclei, cells were incubated on ice for 10 min in buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mmbenzamidine) and homogenized as described for the preparation of cytoplasmic extracts. When more than 95% of the cells were lysed, the salt concentration was adjusted to 150 mm, and the suspension was layered over 20% (w/v) sucrose in buffer B and centrifuged at 800 × g. The nuclei were washed, resuspended in 300 μl of buffer B, and supplemented with 60 μl of 6-fold concentrated standard reducing sample buffer. In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were generated with the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Binding assays were performed as described previously (28.Mukai J. Hachiya T. Shoji-Hoshino S. Kimura M.T. Nadano D. Suvanto P. Hanaoka T. Li Y. Irie S. Greene L.A. Sato T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17566-17570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The transfected 293T cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 7 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 25 μmALLN). The lysates were then centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C. Myc was then immunoprecipitated from the resulting supernatants with 0.8 μg of an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). The immune complexes were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The membrane was blocked for 5 h at room temperature in blocking buffer containing 10% skim milk and 0.1% NaN3 in PBS. FLAG-tagged constructs were detected by Western blotting with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and visualized with the ENHANCE chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The O1 mouse monoclonal antibody was used to identify oligodendrocytes. Cells were gently washed with PBS, and viable cells were incubated with the O1 antibody for 30 min at room temperature (1:100 dilution in Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 3% fetal calf serum). For double-staining, cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% sodium citrate containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min on ice, and processed for TUNEL as described below. Cells were incubated with the anti-Myc polyclonal antibody in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% normal goat serum (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. After several rinses with PBS, cells were incubated with the anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 568 and anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 350 at room temperature for 30 min. These antibodies were used at 1:100 dilutions in PBS supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl and 1% normal goat serum. In situ detection of apoptotic oligodendrocytes was performed by using a TUNEL method (38.McGahon A.J. Martin S.J. Bissonnette R.P. Mahboubi A. Shi Y. Mogil R.J. Nishioka W.K. Green D.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 153-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). After incubation with the O1 antibody, oligodendrocytes were fixed and permeabilized, as described above. After several rinses, samples were processed for TUNEL using the in situ cell death detection assay according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer (MBL International Corp.). In some experiments, Alexa 568-dUTP (Molecular Probes) was used instead of FITC·dUTP as a substrate for the TUNEL reaction. Double-stained cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy EFD-3 (Nikon) and recorded with a SPOT-RT digital charge-coupled device camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Apoptotic cells were determined by counting the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells among O1-positive cells in four fields across the"

In the mammalian brain, ThTP synthesis is rapid, but its steady-state concentration remains low, presumably because of rapid hydrolysis. In this report we purified a soluble thiamine triphosphatase (ThTPase; EC3.6.1.28) from calf brain. The bovine ThTPase is a 24-kDa monomer, hydrolyzing ThTP with virtually absolute specificity. Partial sequence data obtained from the purified bovine enzyme by tandem mass spectrometry were used to search the GenBankTM data base. A significant identity was found with only one human sequence, the hypothetical 230-amino acid protein MGC2652. The coding regions from human and bovine brain mRNA were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR, cloned in Escherichia coli, and sequenced. The human open reading frame was expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion protein. Transformed bacteria had a high isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible ThTPase activity. The recombinant ThTPase had properties similar to those of human brain ThTPase, and it was specific for ThTP. The mRNA was expressed in most human tissues but at relatively low levels.

This is the first report of a molecular characterization of a specific ThTPase. In most cells, the major form of thiamine (vitamin B1) is thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), 1The abbreviations used are: ThDPthiamine diphosphateGSTglutathione S-transferaseIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosideThMPthiamine monophosphateThTPthiamine triphosphateThTPasethiamine triphosphataseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMSmass spectroscopy1The abbreviations used are: ThDPthiamine diphosphateGSTglutathione S-transferaseIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosideThMPthiamine monophosphateThTPthiamine triphosphateThTPasethiamine triphosphataseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMSmass spectroscopya cofactor for pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases, as well as transketolase. However, most animal tissues also contain free thiamine, thiamine monophosphate (ThMP), and small amounts of thiamine triphosphate (ThTP) (1.Bettendorff L. Wins P. Recent Res. Dev. Neurochem. 1999; 2: 37-62Google Scholar). ThTP is found in most animal cells, as well as in yeast and bacteria, but its physiological importance remains unclear. For several decades, ThTP was thought to play a specific function in excitable tissues (2.Cooper J.R. Pincus J.H. Neurochem. Res. 1979; 4: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 3.Bettendorff L. Metab. Brain Dis. 1994; 9: 183-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) but until recently, no compelling evidence could be found to support this hypothesis. In inside-out patches of neuroblastoma cells, ThTP activates a high conductance chloride channel, possibly through phosphorylation (4.Bettendorff L. Kolb H.A. Schoffeniels E. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but the role of this so-called maxi-chloride channel remains unknown. In Torpedoelectric organ, [γ-32P]ThTP was found to phosphorylate rapsyn (5.Nghiêm H.O. Bettendorff L. Changeux J.P. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), a protein required for the clustering of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction (6.Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Mudd J. Nichol M. Chu G.C. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Nature. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation was highly specific for ThTP compared with ATP, and, surprisingly, ThTP phosphorylated a histidyl residue (5.Nghiêm H.O. Bettendorff L. Changeux J.P. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Two or three phosphorylated protein bands were also observed in membranes prepared from rodent brain, but they have not been identified so far. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a protein phosphorylation in mammalian tissues with a phosphate donor other than ATP, and this could be part of a novel signal transduction pathway. It is therefore of interest to study the metabolism of ThTP in animal cells. thiamine diphosphate glutathione S-transferase isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside thiamine monophosphate thiamine triphosphate thiamine triphosphatase high performance liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy thiamine diphosphate glutathione S-transferase isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside thiamine monophosphate thiamine triphosphate thiamine triphosphatase high performance liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy The enzymatic mechanisms of ThTP synthesis are still poorly understood. Skeletal muscles sometimes contain unusually high amounts of ThTP because its synthesis can be catalyzed by adenylate kinase according to the reaction ADP + ThDP ↔ AMP + ThTP (7.Miyoshi K. Egi Y. Shioda T. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because ThDP is a very poor substrate for adenylate kinase, this mechanism can be of importance only in cell types where adenylate kinase is very abundant. In most tissues, ThTP is believed to be synthesized from ThDP according to the reaction ThDP + ATP ↔ ThTP + ADP, catalyzed by ThDP kinase, an enzyme that remains poorly characterized. Purification procedures from bovine brain (8.Nishino K. Itokawa Y. Nishino N. Piros K. Cooper J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11871-11878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat liver (9.Voskoboev A.I. Luchko V.S. Vopr. Med. Khim. 1980; 26: 564-568PubMed Google Scholar), and brewer's yeast (10.Chernikevich I.P. Luchko V.S. Voskoboev A.I. Ostrovsky Y.M. Biokhimiya. 1984; 49: 899-907Google Scholar) were described, but in each case, the material obtained had a very low specific activity, and no sequencing of the enzyme was attempted. In contrast, the enzymes catalyzing ThTP hydrolysis have been studied in more detail. Animal tissues contain a membrane-associated as well as a soluble thiamine triphosphatase (ThTPase; EC 3.6.1.28). The membrane-bound ThTPase (11.Barchi R.L. Braun P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7668-7673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Bettendorff L. Michel-Cahay C. Grandfils C. De Rycker C.

The soluble ThTPase first described by Hashitani and Cooper (14.Hashitani Y. Cooper J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2117-2119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in rat brain has been purified to homogeneity from bovine brain (15.Makarchikov A.F. Chernikevich I.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Bovine ThTPase has an alkaline pH optimum, a relatively low Km(about 35 μm), and a virtually absolute specificity for ThTP (15.Makarchikov A.F. Chernikevich I.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Soluble ThTPase is found in most mammalian tissues studied so far (17.Penttinen H.K. Uotila L. Med. Biol. 1981; 59: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar). 2A. F. Makarchikov, unpublished results.2A. F. Makarchikov, unpublished results. In this work, we report the purification of the soluble ThTPase from calf brain and its partial sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry. The partial sequence screened against known expressed sequence tags allowed us to obtain the complete bovine and human sequences. Both were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR, the human enzyme was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, and its distribution in human tissue was investigated. After the high affinity thiamine transporter, whose mutation causes thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia (18.Fleming J.C. Tartaglini E. Steinkamp M.P. Schorderet D.F. Cohen N. Neufeld E.J. Nat.

Chemicals, if not otherwise stated, were from Sigma or Merck Eurolab (Leuven, Belgium). ThTP was obtained from Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Trypsin was from Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. (Basel, Switzerland), and acetonitrile was obtained from J. T. Baker (Mallinckrodt Baker Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ). The water used was of Milli-Q grade (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). The procedure used was derived from methods previously described (14.Hashitani Y. Cooper J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2117-2119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Makarchikov A.F. Chernikevich I.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, 16 calf forebrains (4.8 kg) from a local slaughterhouse were homogenized (Polytron blender, 25,000 rpm for 5 min, 0 °C) in 2 volumes of Tris-Cl buffer (5 mm, pH 8.2) containing 1 mm Na2EDTA. After gentle stirring at 0–4 °C for 30 min, the homogenate was centrifuged (30 min, 100,000 ×g), and the supernatant (S1) was brought to pH 4.5 with acetic acid (14.Hashitani Y. Cooper J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2117-2119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 15 min), the acidic supernatant was neutralized to pH 7.8 with NaOH, and ammonium sulfate was added to 50% saturation. After centrifugation (15 min, 15,000 × g), the pellet was suspended in 5% of the initial volume of Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 7.8), dialyzed against the same buffer, and applied on a DEAE-Sephacel resin (Amersham Biosciences). Elution was carried out using a Tris-Cl gradient (20–500 mm, pH 7.8) containing 20% glycerol. The fractions containing ThTPase activity were dialyzed before chromatography on a Toyopearl HW 65F resin (Tosoh Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) as described earlier (15.Makarchikov A.F. Chernikevich I.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After concentration of the fractions containing the highest specific activity (Centriplus 10, Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA), the enzyme was run on Sephadex G-75 and Blue-Sepharose Cl-4B (15.Makarchikov A.F. Chernikevich I.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The purity of the preparation was tested by polyacrylamide (12%) gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS according to Laemmli (20.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized by silver or Coomassie Blue staining.

Open table in a new tab If not otherwise stated, the reaction medium contained 70 μl of Bis-Tris-propane buffer (50 mm, pH 8.7), 10 μl of MgCl2 (50 mm), 10 μl of ThTP (100 μm), and 10 μl of the enzyme preparation at the appropriate dilution (20–10,000×). After incubation (10 min, 37 °C), the reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of trichloroacetic acid. After extraction with 3 × 1.5 ml of diethyl ether, the ThDP formed was estimated by HPLC (21.Bettendorff L. Peeters M. Jouan C. Wins P. Schoffeniels E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To assess the substrate specificity of either the purified bovine enzyme or the GST-ThTPase, several potential substrates were tested for enzymatic hydrolysis. For 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, the absorbance of the released 4-nitrophenolate was read at 408 nm at pH 10. For ThDP, ThMP, ATP, GTP, CTP, and ITP, the inorganic phosphate released was measured (22.Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). In all cases, the incubation was run at 37 °C for 100 min in the presence of 25 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mmsubstrate, and an enzyme concentration 20 times higher than for determination of ThTPase activity. One of the purified protein fractions (about 12 μg/ml) obtained after Blue-Sepharose chromatography was concentrated by ultracentrifugation using a Microcon-YM10 centrifugal filter device (Millipore). The initial volume of 1 ml was concentrated to about 80 μl, and the buffer was replaced by digestion buffer (500 mm ammonium acetate, 20 mm CaCl2). The protein was digested by adding 6 μl of a trypsin solution (0.1 μg/μl) reconstituted in 1 mm HCl. Acetonitrile (final concentration, 1% v/v) was added to accelerate digestion, which was performed for 12 h at 37 °C, pH 7.4. The tryptic peptides were fractionated and desalted by elution on a ZipTipC18 pipette tip (Millipore). The elution was carried out using a mixture of water/acetonitrile/acetic acid with successive volume ratios of 93/5/2, 88/10/2, 83/15/2, 73/25/2, 68/30/2, 58/40/2, 48/50/2, and 28/70/2. The fractions obtained were analyzed by nano-electrospray ionization MS/MS using a Q-TOF2 mass spectrometer (Micromass Co., Manchester, UK) as described by Shevchenkoet al. (23.Shevchenko A. Chernushevich I. Wilm M. Mann M. Methods. Mol. Biol. 2000; 146: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). The selection of the analyzed ions and the adjustment of the collision energy were made manually. The obtained fragmentation data were analyzed using sequencing software, PepSeq (Micromass Co.). Data base search was performed with the sequences obtained to eliminate those resulting from trypsin autodigestion. The peptides were delivered to the mass spectrometer by silica capillaries purchased from Protana (MDS Proteomics, Odense, Denmark). For the sequencing of the N- and C-terminal peptides, the enzyme was partially digested in the absence of acetonitrile for only 1 h at 37 °C. For the prediction of MS/MS fragmentation from peptide sequences and the comparison with mass spectra, BioLynx software (Micromass Co.) was used. One microgram of human or bovine brain poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was reverse transcribed into cDNA for 1 h at 37 °C by random priming using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. One-tenth of the reverse transcription reaction medium was submitted to 35 PCR cycles using Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For human ThTPase amplification, primers HumF (5′-TCCTTGGGAACTCAGCAAACGT-3′) and HumR (5′-AGGAGTGGACTCCGTTAGACC-3′) were used. For bovine ThTPase, primers BovF (5′-ATGGCTCAGGGCCTGATTGAAG-3′) and BovR (5′-AGCGAGAGGAGTCACTGTGAG-3′) were used. Each PCR cycle consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, hybridization at 63 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 60 s. The resulting PCR products were inserted into pCRII by TOPO cloning (Invitrogen) and sequenced using the T7 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). The human ThTPase open reading frame was amplified from the cloned cDNA using forward (5′-GGATCCCCATGGCCCAGGGCTTGATTGA-3′) and reverse (5′-GCGGCCGCCTAGCCCAGGCAGTGGTCAG-3′) primers. The amplified product was then inserted into BamHI/NotI sites of pGEX-5X-1 to produce a GST-ThTPase fusion protein. The E. coli strain BL 21 (Amersham Biosciences) was transformed with either the native or the recombinant plasmid and grown overnight on LB agar plates (1.5% (w/v) agar in LB broth) containing ampicillin (200 μg/ml). Individual bacterial colonies were grown under aerobial conditions at 37 °C in 2XYT/ampicillin medium at a density of about 5 × 109 cells/ml. Overexpression of GST or GST-ThTPase was induced by dilution of 100 μl of this bacterial culture in 1.6 ml of 2XYT/ampicillin medium in the presence of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 1.5 mg/ml. After 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 h, the bacteria were collected by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 1 min) and suspended in 150 μl of 2XYT medium. Control experiments were made under the same conditions but without IPTG. 50 μl of the bacterial suspension were diluted with 50 μl of loading buffer (2×) and boiled for 1 min, and aliquots of 4 μl were submitted to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis on 12% gels. The rest of the bacterial suspension was incubated in the presence of 10% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice and diluted 100–1000 times before determination of enzyme activity as described above. The entire cloned human ThTPase cDNA was used as a probe. It was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) using the Random Primers DNA labeling system (Invitrogen) and then purified on ProbeQuant G50 Micro columns (Amersham Biosciences). The human multiple tissue expression array (CLONTECH) was prehybridized for 1 h at 60 °C in ExpressHyb (CLONTECH). Hybridization was performed for 15 h at 60 °C in the above solution containing 5 × 106 cpm/ml of the heat-denatured probe. The multiple tissue expression array was washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C as described by the manufacturer and then exposed in a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) for 36 h. The enzyme had to be purified about 45,000-fold before a homogenous preparation was obtained, suggesting that it is a relatively rare protein in the bovine brain. Our purification procedure gave 107 μg of ThTPase with a total yield of 4.8% (Table I). Analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa (Fig. 1). Mass spectrometry gave a molecular mass of 23,892 Da, a value lower than the one obtained from SDS-PAGE. The difference between the two values might be the consequence of the overall important negative charge of the protein, which can lead to decreased mobility during SDS-PAGE (24.Matagne A. Joris B. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Chromatography on Sephadex G-75 gave a molecular mass of 25 kDa (not shown), suggesting that the native protein is a monomer, in agreement with previous results (15.Makarchikov A.F. Chernikevich I.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The purified bovine enzyme obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with aKm of 39 ± 7 μm (substrate concentration, 0.01–1 mm) and a specific activity of 9 ± 2 μmol·s−1·mg−1(Vmax at 37 °C). We can thus calculate that the catalytic constant (kcat) and the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) are 240 s−1 and 6 × 106s−1·m−1, respectively. In agreement with previous results (15.Makarchikov A.F. Chernikevich I.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16.Makarchikov A.F. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Biophys. 2001; 5: 75-82Google Scholar, 17.Penttinen H.K. Uotila L. Med. Biol. 1981; 59: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar), we found that the purified ThTPase was highly substrate-specific. A slight 4-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity was detected, but it was less than 1% of ThTPase activity. With ThDP, ThMP, and nucleoside 5′-triphosphates, no significant enzymatic hydrolysis could be detected by the very sensitive method used (22.Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar), indicating that if any enzymatic hydrolysis of those substrates occurs, it is less than 0.2% of ThTPase activity. The sequence of several internal peptides (see Fig. 2 for their sequence) was obtained by electrospray ionization MS/MS analysis. Each peptide was compared with the sequences of the GenBankTM data base using the BLAST algorithm, and all gave a nearly perfect match (Fig. 2A) with two newly described hypothetical proteins, one in human called MGC2652 (NM_024328) and another in Macaca fascicularis (AB055296). Using primers designed on the basis of the MGC2652 sequence, we were able to amplify a cDNA of the expected size from human brain poly(A)+ RNA. The human protein is 230 amino acids long and has a predicted molecular mass of 25,550 Da. Its gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 14. The amino acid composition is characterized by a high percentage of negatively charged residues (17.4% of Glu and Asp) and a low content of Ile (1.7%) and Asn (0.4%). The comparison of the sequence of the human cDNA with the bovine expressed sequence tags gave other matches (AW654551,BG690979, BF076311, and BF653287) that allowed the amplification of a cDNA encoding a 219-amino acid protein from bovine brain poly(A)+ RNA. Its sequence perfectly matches the bovine peptide sequences obtained by mass spectrometry, except for the N-terminal methionine residue (see below). The predicted average molecular mass of the bovine protein is 23,983 Da, a value slightly higher than the mass determined by mass spectrometry for the purified bovine enzyme (23,892 Da). Most of the difference can be accounted for if we assume that the N-terminal methionyl residue is cleaved and that the new N-terminal alanine is acetylated. This hypothesis was confirmed by comparing the predicted collision-induced dissociation mass spectra for two N-terminal peptides of the protein (Fig. 3). The C-terminal peptide (209–219, LLEVYGSKEKP) was obtained in a similar manner. In addition, considering that the bovine protein contains only two cysteyl residues, at positions 66 and 88, respectively (Fig. 2), the presence of a disulfide bridge would lead to the loss of two hydrogen atoms, giving a mass of 23,892 Da, exactly as determined. A difference of 2 Da is, however, within the error on the mass determination of the entire protein by mass spectrometry (100 ppm). On the other hand, modifiers of free thiols such as p-chloromercuribenzoate and Ellman's reagent (5,5′dithiobis-2-nitro-benzoic acid) inhibit the activity of the purified bovine ThTP (not shown), suggesting that the presence of free SH groups is essential for catalytic activity. In addition, we found that 2-mercaptoethanol does not change the electrophoretic mobility of the protein in polyacrylamide gels. The presence of a disulfide bridge therefore appears unlikely. At the amino acid level, the bovine ThTPase has 80 and 79% identity with the human and the macaque enzyme, respectively (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the sequences using the PROSITE motif search revealed the presence of several potential phosphorylation sites present in the three sequences, among them two consensus sites (at positions 34 and 123) for protein kinase C and three consensus sites (at positions 34, 38, and 60) for casein kinase 2. The hydrophobicity plot of the human enzyme is typical of a soluble protein (Fig. 2B), with several highly polar or charged regions. Interestingly, no homology, even partial, with any other known vertebrate protein was found. Partial short sequences with significant identity corresponding to hypothetical open reading frames were found in E. coli (AP002564 and AE000387), Caenorhabditis elegans (L23650), Drosophila melanogaster (AE003477 andAE003598), or Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NP_014781), but they do not seem to be related to each other. The human ThTPase cDNA was overproduced in E. coli as a GST fusion protein in the presence of IPTG (Fig. 4). The fusion protein had a molecular mass of 50 kDa, which corresponds to an approximate molecular mass of 25 kDa for the ThTPase moiety, as expected from the amino acid sequence. In E. coli transfected with GST, we found only a relatively low intrinsic ThTPase activity (120 ± 34 pmol·min−1·mg of protein−1,n = 7). In fact, bacteria do not appear to contain a specific ThTPase, but they do contain nonspecific phosphatases able to hydrolyze ThTP to some extent (25.Nishimune T. Hayashi R. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 1987; 33: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).2 As shown in Fig. 5, the activity was increased over 1000-fold in noninduced GST-ThTPase recombinant bacteria, reaching 0.17 μmol·min−1·mg−1. After induction by IPTG, this activity still increased over 10-fold, reaching 2.1 μmol·min−1·mg−1 after 4 h (Fig. 5C). No increase in ThTPase activity was observed after induction in bacteria transfected with GST alone (Fig. 5B). ThTP hydrolysis by recombinant GST-ThTPase resulted in the formation of ThDP only. If an unspecific phosphatase was present, ThDP would have been further hydrolyzed to ThMP, but this was not observed. Furthermore, when ATP (100 μm) replaced ThTP in the incubation medium under the same conditions (Fig. 5, D–F), no hydrolysis of ATP was observed. Although IPTG increased ThTPase activity over 10 times in GST-ThTPase recombinant bacteria, it did not increase to any significant amount the hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, ThDP, ThMP, or nucleoside 5′-triphosphates. This suggests that the recombinant enzyme, like the native ThTPase, has little or no hydrolytic activity on substrates other than ThTP. Because human ThTPase has not been studied in detail so far, we compared some properties of the GST-ThTPase with genuine ThTPase prepared from human brain. The activity of the GST-ThTPase fusion protein falls more abruptly at alkaline pH than with the enzyme prepared from human brain. Although both the human and the bovine enzyme have about the same pH optimum (around 8.5), the human enzyme has a broader pH spectrum, with a higher activity at neutral pH. ThTPase from human cerebellar cortex had a Km of 126 μm (Table II), a value three to four times higher than in crude extracts from bovine or rat brain. Notice that the Km of the bovine enzyme for ThTP was not significantly different before (32 ± 6 μm) and after (39 ± 7 μm) purification. Human ThTPase was isolated from postmortem tissue, but we have not found any effect of the postmortem delay (≤15 h) on theVmax or the Km of bovine enzyme. Actually, the enzyme was remarkably insensitive to chemical denaturation and proteolytic attack; although it was isolated from calf brain in the absence of protease inhibitors, it remained intact as was shown by sequencing. The properties of the recombinant GST-ThTPase were similar to those of the native human enzyme, with aKm of 220 ± 23 μm(n = 5).Table IIKinetic parameters of ThTPase in the crude supernatant fraction of brain in several speciesVmax2-aThe ThTP concentration varied between 10 and 200 μm.

To determine whether up-regulation of MMP-3, or stromelysin-1, was a causative factor during the development of demyelination, we have examined the expression of MMP-3 mRNA and protein in brain tissue of a spontaneously demyelinating mouse model overexpressing DM20 (ND4 line) prior to and during the progression of disease. Stromelysin-1, but not other MMP mRNA was elevated ∼10-fold in transgenic mice between 5 days and 1 month of age, more than 2 months before the onset of disease, and was coordinately expressed with the DM20 transgene.

When we crossed our ND4 mice with a line of transgenic mice overexpressing TIMP-1 in brain, clinical signs in these mice were attenuated, and the level of stromelysin-1 protein was reduced.

Multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the human central nervous system is characterized by multiple lesions within the white matter (4.Conlon P. Oksenberg J.R. Zhang J. Steinman L. Neurobiol. Dis. 1999; 6: 149-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,5.Noseworthy J.H. Lucchinetti C. Rodriguez M. Weinshenker B.G. N. Eng. J. Med. 2000; 343: 938-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (3016) Google Scholar). Although the etiology is unknown, genetic, environmental, and immune factors in various combinations are involved possibly accounting for the heterogeneity of the disease. An important role has been assigned to the extracellular matrix, the dissolution of which permits a variety of cells including astrocytes, macrophages, and sensitized lymphocytes access to myelin. The migration of cells through the brain parenchyma and the transmigration of T cells across the blood brain barrier are mediated by degradation of extracellular matrix components by powerful proteases, the matrix metalloproteinases (6.Uhm J.H.

They are Zn2+ and Ca2+ requiring neutral endopeptidases, which include collagenases, stromelysins, gelatinases, and membrane-type metalloproteinases (7.Bode W. Fernandez-Catalan C. Tschesche H.

These enzymes are tightly regulated at the transcriptional level, and with the exception of the membrane type-MMPs, they are secreted as inactive zymogens that require activation. Their activities are controlled by other proteins called tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which bind the enzymes in a 1:1 stoichiometry (10.Edwards D.R. Clendeninn N.J. Appelt K. Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 67-84Google Scholar). Gelatinase B (MMP-9) has been implicated in the transmigration of lymphocytes through the blood brain barrier in in vitrostudies (11.Leppert D. Waubant E. Burk M.R. Oksenberg J.R. Hauser S.L. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 40: 846-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 12.Stuve O. Dooley N.P. Uhm J.H. Antel J.P. Francis G.S. Williams G. Yong V.W. Ann.

Interferon β-1b, which is used in the treatment of MS, decreased the ability of T-lymphocytes to cross an artificial basement membrane in vitro, suggesting that the beneficial effects of interferon β-1b in MS may be ascribed to its inhibition of MMP-9 activity (13.Yong V.W. Chabot S. Stuve O. Williams G. Neurology. 1998; 51: 682-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MMP-9 has been reported to be selectively elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid during relapses and stable phases of MS (14.Leppert D. Ford J. Stabler G. Grygar C. Lienert C. Huber S. Miller K.M. Hauser S.L. Kappos L. Brain. 1998; 121: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Özenci et al. (15.Özenci V. Rinaldi L. Teleshova N. Matusevicius D. Kivisakk P. Kouwenhoven M. Link H. J. Autoimm. 1999; 12: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) investigated the expression of MMP-9, stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 in blood mononuclear cells obtained from normal individuals and patients with MS and other neurological diseases including inflammatory diseases. Numbers of MMP-9 mRNA-expressing cells were higher in MS than other neurological diseases, and MS patients had higher levels of MMP-3 and TIMP-1 mRNA than normal patients as well as other neurological diseases, suggesting that several MMPs may be elevated in MS (15.Özenci V. Rinaldi L. Teleshova N. Matusevicius D. Kivisakk P. Kouwenhoven M. Link H. J. Autoimm. 1999; 12: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In a study of cells in the human central nervous system, which expressed MMPs, endothelial cells in MS brain expressed MMP-3 and MMP-9. Macrophages in active and necrotic lesions expressed MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9, whereas astrocytes expressed MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9 (16.Maeda A. Sobel R.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Therefore, MS tissue expresses a number of MMPs in addition to MMP-9. To determine whether MMPs have a causative role in the pathogenesis of MS, it is essential to carry out studies prior to the development of demyelinating disease. These studies require a relevant animal model, because studies on human disease can only be done after the disease is established and diagnosis is definite. The animal model, which we have used, is a transgenic model obtained by the incorporation of various copies of the cDNA for DM20, the major myelin proteolipid protein in early development, into the genome. Mice carrying 70 copies of the transgene (ND4 line) undergo a normal birth and development up to 3 months of age. At this time, they begin to have tremors, shake, show unsteady gait, and lose weight. These early signs become worse between 3 and 8 months, and by 10 months the animals become moribund (17.Mastronardi F.G. Ackerley C.A. Arsenault L. Roots B.I. Moscarello M.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18.Simons-Johnson R. Roder J.C. Riordan J.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mice carrying 17 copies of the transgene (ND3a line) are also born and develop normally. They begin to show signs consistent with demyelinating disease at 6–8 months and become moribund by 16 months (19.Mastronardi F.G. Ackerley C.A. Roots B.I. Moscarello M.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 44: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting a gene-dosage effect. The MMP which we have focused on is stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), because it has a central position among MMPs for several reasons. Firstly, MMP-3 has a broad substrate specificity permitting it to degrade fibronectin, laminin, elastin, collagen IV, and proteoglycans (20.Fosang A.J. Neame P.J. Hardingham T.E. Murphy G. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Murphy G. Cockett M.I. Ward R.V. Docherty A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Secondly, MMP-3 activates other MMPs such as MMP-9, for example, overexpressing cell cultures needed to be supplemented with active MMP-3 to initiate the activation of pro-MMP-9 (22.Ramos-DeSimone N. Hahn-Dantona E. Sipley J. Nagase H. French D.L. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13066-13076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Stromelysins have also been shown to activate pro-collagenase (23.Knauper V. Wilhelm S.M. Seperack P.K. DeClerck Y.A. Langley K.E. Osthues A. Tschesche H. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and gelatinase A/TIMP-2 complex (24.Miyazaki K. Umenishi F. Funahashi K. Koshikawa N. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thirdly, MMP-3-dependent generation of a macrophage chemoattractant in a model of herniated disc resorption has been reported previously (25.Haro H. Crawford H.C. Fingelton B. MacDougall J.R. Shinomiya K. Spengler D.M. Matrisian L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that MMP-3 was up-regulated both at RNA and protein levels prior to the appearance of disease, whereas other MMPs were not affected. The overexpression of TIMP-1 in vivo, which binds the enzyme, ameliorated the disease in a double transgenic model. Normal, ND3a, and ND4 transgenic mice were of CD-1 background (18.Simons-Johnson R. Roder J.C. Riordan J.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The transgenic mice were produced by the incorporation of cDNA for human DM20 under the control of the human proteolipid protein (PLP) promoter into the genome of a normal CD-1 mouse. The presence of an SV40 site at the 3′ end permitted specific detection of the transgene. On Northern blots, the transgene RNA resolved into species of 1.7 and 1.25 kb, whereas the transcripts from the endogenous PLP gene were detected at 3.2 and 2.4 kb. The ND3a line carried 17 copies of the cDNA for DM20, whereas the ND4 line carried 70 copies of the cDNA. The disease course was milder in the ND3a line with first signs at 6 months of age, whereas first signs were observed at 3 months in the ND4 line. All ND3a and ND4 transgenic mice were heterozygous for the DM20 transgene. Littermates not carrying the transgene were used as normal mice. TIMP-1 transgenic founder mice were C57BL/6 (line 277-34) (26.Kruger A. Sanchez-Sweatman O.H. Martin D.C. Fata J.E. Ho A.T. Orr F.W. Ruther U. Khokha R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2419-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and were gifts from Dr. Rama Khokha. The TIMP-1 transgene was under the control of the murine metallothionein-1 promoter. All animals were genotyped by Southern blot analysis of DNA extracted from mouse tail clips. Mice were scored for clinical signs three times a week starting at 2 months of age and continued until they were 8 months old. Clinical scores were calculated based on several criteria such as the extent of body shaking, tremors of the hind limb and head area, a jerky head, and an unsteady gait. Mice were scored on a four-point scale with a “1” representing very mild signs and a “4” representing severe signs. The sum of scores/week was calculated, averaged, and plotted against animal age. RNA was isolated from brain tissue by the method of Chirgwin et al. (27.Chirgwin J. Przybyla A.E. McDonald R. Rutter W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). One half of a mouse brain was homogenized in 5 ml of guanidine thiocyanate solution (4.2m guanidine thiocyanate, 60 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, 0.1% sarkosyl, 25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The homogenate was layered over a 2-ml cesium chloride cushion (5.7 m CsCl, 50 μm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 32,000 rpm at 15 °C for 18 h. After centrifuging, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was solubilized with two 200-μl washes of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. The washes were pooled, and the RNA was precipitated with one-tenth volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 6.5, and two volumes of ethanol. The RNA was recovered by centrifuging, and the pellet was washed in 70% ethanol, dried, and redissolved in 200-μl diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. The concentration of RNA was determined from the relationship E1 cm1%= 200 at 260 nm. Total RNA (10 μg) was run on a 1.2% agarose formaldehyde gel and transferred to nylon membrane in 20× SSC (3 m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate). The membrane was prehybridized in prehybridization solution (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.35 m sodium phosphate (0.26 mNa2HPO4, 0.34% orthophosphoric acid), 7% SDS, 30% formamide) for 3 h at 55 °C. Blots were then hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes at 55 °C overnight. The membrane was washed twice in wash buffer (0.5% 20× SSC, 0.5% SDS) at 55 °C for 30 min. Blots were exposed to a phosphorimaging screen (Molecular Dynamics), and band intensities were quantitated on a phosphorimaging device (Image Quant). The probes used for Northern blotting were a rat PLP cDNA (28.Milner R.J. Lai C. Nave K.-A. Lenoir D. Ogata J. Sutcliffe J.G.

A one-half brain from normal and transgenic mice was homogenized in 4 ml of protein extraction buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2), and the resulting homogenates were fractionated into supernatant and pellet fractions by centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 30 min. Brain supernatant and pellet fractions were collected, and the protein concentration of each fraction was determined by the method of Peterson (35.Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7127) Google Scholar). 100 μl of 0.15% sodium deoxycholate was added to each sample and allowed to stand for 10 min. 100 μl of 72% trichloroacetic acid was then added, and the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of H2O. 400 μl of reagent A containing 1 volume each of copper-tartrate-carbonate, 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.8% NaOH, and H2O was added to each sample and reacted for 10 min. 200 μl of reagent B containing 1 part Folin reagent (ICN Biomedicals Inc.) to 5 parts of H2O was then added, and the mixture allowed to react for 30 min before the absorbance was read at 750 nm. Protein concentrations were obtained by interpolation from a standard curve generated with bovine serum albumin. Brain supernatant fractions (100 μg) from normal and transgenic mice at various ages were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (36.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) and transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes by the method of Towbin et al.(37.Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was carried out using a mouse monoclonal anti-MMP-3 antibody (Oncogene) against both active and latent forms of the enzyme. Transgenic mice carrying 70 copies of the cDNA for DM20 were observed for the development of clinical disease over an 8-month period. To assess the extent of the disease, each mouse was scored for clinical signs three times/week. At the end of each week, the scores were summed and plotted (see “Experimental Procedures” for scoring criteria). The data are plotted in Fig. 1, which represents the mean and standard deviation for six normal and six transgenic mice. The curve is typical of a total of more than 70 mice. Signs of the disease began at 3 months of age, increased slowly until 4 months and then rapidly between 4 and 6 months, and remained unchanged thereafter. By 10 months of age, the transgenic mice became moribund. The normal animals are also shown with weekly aggregate clinical scores of approximately 10. To examine the expression of MMP mRNA before onset of disease, stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), stromelysin-3 (MMP-11), gelatinase A (MMP-2), gelatinase B (MMP-9), matrilysin (MMP-7), and collagenase-3 (MMP-13) were examined by Northern blotting of RNA isolated from brains of normal and transgenic mice in a developmental study between 5 days and 1 month of age (Table I). Of the six MMPs studied, the expression of gelatinase A and collagenase-3 was low at all ages, whereas the expression of gelatinase B, stromelysin-3, and matrilysin expression was undetectable. Stromelysin-1 was the only enzyme examined that showed a dramatic increase during development in transgenic animals.Table IExpression of MMP mRNA in transgenic and normal miceAgeMMP-3MMP-11MMP-2MMP-9MMP-7MMP-135 days0.5ND0.95NDND1.1714 days2.42ND0.93NDND1.0118 days6.95ND0.91NDND0.521 month18.5ND0.97NDND2.94The mRNA expression of stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), stromelysin-3 (MMP-11), gelatinase A (MMP-2), gelatinase B (MMP-9), matrilysin (MMP-7), and collagenase-3 (MMP-13) was studied during development in the mouse from 5 days to 1 month. Total RNA was extracted by the method of Chirgwin et al. (27.Chirgwin J. Przybyla A.E. McDonald R. Rutter W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar) from half of a mouse brain. Northern blots were run and probed with the appropriate32P-labeled cDNA (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Total RNA was extracted by the method of Chirgwin et al. (27.Chirgwin J. Przybyla A.E. McDonald R. Rutter W.

MMP levels are expressed as a ratio of transgenic/normal. ND, not detected. In a more extensive developmental study of stromelysin-1 mRNA in ND4 transgenic mice (Fig. 2A, curve A), the expression was low at 5 days but increased rapidly between 5 and 18 days, reached maximal values between 1 and 3 months, and remained at this high level until 8 months. The expression of stromelysin-1 mRNA in normal littermates shown in Fig. 2A, curve B, was barely detectable at all ages. Although these data are from a single set of Northern blots, they have been repeated three times by two different observers with identical results. The expression of stromelysin-1 was increased approximately 10-fold in transgenic animals between 5 days and 1 month of age. However, a 40-fold increase in stromelysin-1 was observed when compared with normal animals (Table I). Because the expression of stromelysin-1 was increased in transgenic animals between 5 days and 1 month of age although clinical signs were not evident until 3 months of age, a causative role for stromelysin-1 was suggested. To determine when the DM20 transgene was expressed, Northern blots were run with RNA isolated from transgenic mice. To distinguish transgene mRNA from the transcripts from the normal PLPgene, the cDNA used for DM20 transgene contained an SV40 site at the 3′ end. The probe used to detect DM20 detects both the endogenousPLP gene transcripts at 3.2 and 2.4 kb as well as the DM20 transgene mRNA at 1.7 and 1.25 kb. The two transcripts resulting from the transgene are thought to be attributed to an alternative polyadenylation site within the transgene (18.Simons-Johnson R. Roder J.C. Riordan J.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The expression of the DM20 transgene during development is shown in Fig. 2B. The expression of the DM20 transgene was low at 5 and 9 days after birth but increased rapidly between 9 and 18 days and remained at this high level for up to 6 months. The expression pattern of stromelysin-1 and DM20 transgene was remarkably similar, suggesting that the expression of the two genes was coordinated. Another series of Northern blots were run in which the expression of stromelysin-1 was correlated with DM20 transgene dosage. To perform this experiment, RNA was isolated from normal mouse brain and transgenic mouse brain carrying 17 (Fig. 3, ND3a) and 70 (ND4) copies of the cDNA for DM20 at 1 and 8 months of age. Northern blots were probed with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for stromelysin-1 and DM20. Quantitation of these blots is shown in Fig. 3. The expression of stromelysin-1 and DM20 mRNA in normal, ND3a, and ND4 lines at 1 and 8 months of age is shown. The expression of stromelysin-1 was highest in the ND4 line carrying 70 copies of the transgene, which correlated well with the highest expression of the DM20 transgene. The amount of stromelysin-1 mRNA in the ND3a line was approximately 25% of that in the ND4 line, and again this correlated well with the DM20 transgene expression. Neither stromelysin-1 nor the DM20 transgene was expressed in kidney or liver at 8 months of age. These experiments demonstrate that the expression of stromelysin-1 occurred only in the brain, and the level of expression was proportional to the number of copies of the DM20 transgene. To determine whether the increased expression of stromelysin-1 mRNA resulted in a corresponding increase in stromelysin-1 protein, the levels of stromelysin-1 protein were examined in normal and transgenic animals by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4). At all ages, a 45- and a 28-kDa band were detected, both corresponding to the active forms of the enzyme. At 9 days of age, both 45- and 28-kDa stromelysin-1 expression was easily detected in the brain supernatants from normal mice. In the transgenic mice, the 28-kDa protein was detected in similar amount to that in normal mice, whereas the 45-kDa band was greatly reduced. At 1 month of age, protein expression was low in both normal and transgenic mice, although levels were higher in transgenic animals (Fig. 4B). At 6 months of age, both 45- and 28-kDa proteins were detected again in both normal and transgenic mice. However, both proteins were increased in transgenic mice compared with normal mice. Therefore, both mRNA (Fig. 2A) and stromelysin-1 protein were increased in ND4 mice at 1 month of age and 2 months prior to onset of the disease. The tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are capable of combining with the active form of MMPs in a 1:1 stoichiometry, thereby inhibiting their activity. The interaction between TIMP-1 and stromelysin-1 has been studied extensively (38.Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol.

To determine whether the expression of TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4 in normal and transgenic mice carrying 70 copies of the DM20 transgene was elevated, RNA was isolated from brains in a developmental study from 5 days to 6 months for Northern blot analysis. The data are shown in Table II. TIMP-3 expression was undetectable. Although the expression of TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 mRNA showed little change during development, TIMP-1 mRNA increased gradually from 5 days to 1 month and then to a transgenic/normal ratio of 2.24 at 6 months. A more detailed study of TIMP-1 expression (data not shown) showed that at 8 months TIMP-1 was approximately 5-fold increased in ND4 mice over normal mice.Table IIExpression of TIMP mRNA in transgenic and normal miceAgeTIMP-1TIMP-2TIMP-3TIMP-45 days0.641.47ND1.0814 days0.891.05ND1.0018 days0.930.75ND1.211 month1.670.52ND1.716 months2.240.92ND0.74The mRNA expression of TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4 was studied during development in the mouse from 5 days to 6 months.

The interaction between stem cell factor and its receptor, c-Kit, has been found to be essential for the maturation of male germ cells and peripheral mast cells. Based on this analogy, we investigated the expression of histidine decarboxylase (HDC), the rate-limiting enzyme of histamine synthesis, in mouse male germ cells. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that HDC is localized in the acrosomes of spermatids and spermatozoa. In the testis, epididymis, and spermatozoa, a significant amount of histamine and HDC activity were detected. W/WV mice, known to lack most of their germ cells in the seminiferous tubules, were found to lack HDC protein expression as well as HDC activity in the testis. An in vitro acrosome reaction induced by a calcium ionophore, A23187, caused the release of histamine from epididymal spermatozoa. Our observations indicate that histamine is produced in and released from the acrosomes. Histamine synthesis in male reproductive tissues remains largely unknown.

It is the only enzyme that synthesizes histamine in mammals. Histamine is well known to act as an important physiological modulator. Histamine is produced by a variety of cell types such as mast cells, basophils, enterochromaffin-like cells, and neurons (1.Beaven M.A. Histamine: Its Role in Physiological and Pathological Processes.

Neurochem. 1980; 35: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Among these cells, histamine production in mast cells has been best characterized. We previously demonstrated that the 74-kDa precursor form of HDC is a short lived protein and is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the cytosol of a rat basophilic/mast cell line (4.Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ohmura S. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 471: 203-207Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We also revealed that the 74-kDa form is processed post-translationally into its mature 53-kDa form and that histamine is produced in two distinct compartments, the cytosol and the granules of mast cells (5.Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ichikawa A. J. Biol.

Baram D. Mekori Y.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1033-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). The interaction between c-Kit (SCF receptor) of mast cells and the membrane-bound SCF of fibroblasts is required for the maturation of mast cell progenitors in vitro (6.Metcalfe D.D. Baram D. Mekori Y.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1033-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). The interaction between SCF and c-Kit has also been found to induce histamine synthesis in cultured mast cells (7.Lukacs N.W. Kunkel S.L. Strieter R.M. Evanoff H.L. Kunkel G. Key M.L. Taub D.D. Blood. 1996; 87: 2262-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such an interaction between SCF and c-Kit has also been found to occur during spermatogenesis (8.Loveland K.L. Schlatt S. J.

W/WV mice, which possess a point mutation in the kinase domain of c-Kit, are known to lack peripheral mast cells and a large proportion of their male germ cells (10.Russell E.S. Adv.

Fertilizing spermatozoa are believed to undergo an acrosome reaction, the release of a variety of hydrolytic enzymes from the acrosome onto the surface of the zona pellucida before penetrating it (13.Breil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Elements of Mammalian Fertilization. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 133-151Google Scholar). The acrosome reaction has been reported to require a massive influx of extracellular calcium (14.Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neil J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven, New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar), which is also known to be essential for the degranulation of mast cells. We investigated the expression of HDC mRNA in various mouse tissues and found a large amount of mRNA in the testis. This observation led us to the hypothesis that the maturation of male germ cells may be accompanied by histamine synthesis. In this study, we demonstrate the expression of HDC in mouse male germ cells, which may be responsible for histamine production in the acrosomes. Adult male ICR mice (9–12 weeks of age), WBB6F1-W/WV (W/WV), and WBB6F1-W/W+ (W/W+) mice (8 weeks of age) were obtained from the Shizuoka Agricultural Cooperative Association for Laboratory Animals (Hamamatsu, Japan). Various male reproductive tissues and stomach were collected from ICR mice, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Total RNAs were extracted with ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reverse transcription reaction was performed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in the presence of random hexamers. The PCR was performed with Taq DNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Tokyo, Japan) using the first strand as a template. The primer pair used for amplification of HDC transcripts were as follows: HDC (forward), 5′-CGC TCC ATT AAG CTG TGG TTT GTG ATT CGG-3′; HDC (reverse), 5′-AGA CTG GCT CCT GGC TGC TTG ATG ATC TTC-3′. Total RNAs (15 μg) from testis, epididymis, and stomach were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Biodyne-A, Pall, Port Washington, NY). Hybridization was performed with a 32P-labeled cDNA fragment specific for mouse HDC (PvuII-digested fragment) at 65 °C in 6× SSC (1× SSC is composed of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 msodium citrate), 0.5% SDS, and 5× Denhardt's solution. After hybridization, filters were washed at 68 °C in 2× SSC, 1% SDS, and the hybridized bands were detected by autoradiography. The filters were then rehybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA fragment specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (15.Sugimoto Y. Namba T. Shigemoto R. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F823-F828PubMed Google Scholar). Testes collected from ICR mice were immediately frozen. Sections (10 μm in thickness) were cut on a Jung Frigocut 3000E cryostat and thaw-mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides. Antisense riboprobes were synthesized by transcription with T3 RNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in the presence of [α-35S]CTP. The sections were fixed with 4% formalin and acetylated with 0.25% acetic anhydride. Hybridization was carried out in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 2× SSC, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1× Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.2% SDS, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 500 μg/ml sheared single-stranded salmon sperm DNA, and 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA. The 35S-labeled riboprobes were added to the hybridization mixture at 1.5 × 105cpm/μl. After incubation at 60 °C for 5 h, the slides were washed for 1 h in 2 × SSC. The sections were treated with 20 μg/ml ribonuclease A, followed by an additional wash in 0.1× SSC at 60 °C for 1 h. The slides were then dipped in nuclear track emulsion (NTB3; Eastman Kodak Co.). After exposure for 5 weeks at 4 °C, the dipped slides were developed, fixed, and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. The specificity of the signals for each probe was verified by its disappearance when an excess amount of unlabeled probe was added (data not shown). Testes were collected and treated with Bouin's fixative (Muto Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) for 24 h at 4 °C. Sections (10 μm in thickness) were cut on a Jung Frigocut 3000E cryostat. The sections were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against glutathione S-transferase fusion HDC (16.Asahara M. Mushiake S. Shimada S. Fukui H. Kinoshita Y. Kawanami C. Watanabe T.

After incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody against rabbit IgG (1:2000, Vector, Burlingame, CA) for 2 h, the antibodies were detected with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (diluted 1:2000; Vector, Burlingame, CA). Development was performed by incubation with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.02% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, 0.0045% H2O2, and 0.6% nickel ammonium sulfate for 3 min to obtain brown stained products. The sections were counterstained with methyl green for nuclear staining. For the immunofluorescence study, a rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200) was used as a secondary antibody. The nuclear staining was performed using a SYBR green dye (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). All of the immunoreactive signals obtained using the anti-HDC antibody were undetectable in the presence of an excess amount (10 μg/ml) of the antigen, glutathione S-transferase fusion HDC. Testes, epididymides, and spermatozoa were collected and homogenated in 50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, containing 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml E-64, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1% Triton X-100. The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were assayed for histidine decarboxylase activity as described previously (5.Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8177-8182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The assay mixture (1 ml) was composed of 0.8 μmol l-histidine, 0.2 μmol of dithiothreitol, 0.01 μmol of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 10 mg of polyethylene glycol 300, 100 μmol of potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and the crude extracts. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 4 h and was terminated by adding 0.04 ml of 60% perchloric acid. The histamine formed was extracted and separated on a cation exchange column, WCX-1 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) by high pressure liquid chromatography and then measured by the o-phtalaldehyde method (17.Shore P.A. Burkhalter A. Cohn V.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1959; 127: 182-186PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (18.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (218436) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin for the standards. Testes, epididymides, and epididymal spermatozoa were homogenized in 99.2 mm NaCl containing 2.68 mm KCl, 0.36 mmNaH2PO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and crude extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% slab gel) and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Tokyo, Japan). Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (5.Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8177-8182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). An anti-HDC antibody (1:500) was used as the primary antibody, and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:3000; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was used as the secondary antibody. The membrane was stained using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Partially purified HDC (53 kDa) was prepared from a mouse mastocytoma cell line, P-815, as described previously (19.Ohmori E. Fukui T. Imanishi N. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells expressing recombinant 74-kDa HDC were prepared using a baculovirus-insect cell expression system as described previously (20.Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Spermatozoa were collected from the cauda epididymis in modified fertilization medium reported by Whittingham (21.Whittingham D.G. Nature. 1968; 220: 592-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) after 1 h of “swim up” at 37 °C in a fully humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 to allow capacitation. Motile spermatozoa (3.5 × 106 cells/ml) were carefully collected and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the medium in the presence or absence of 10 μmA23187. The acrosome reaction was confirmed by the loss of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250-positive spermatozoa. In our experimental conditions, only a small proportion of spermatozoa underwent acrosome reactions spontaneously (4.80 ± 0.374%, n = 5), whereas a large proportion of spermatozoa did so in the presence of A23187(86.4 ± 1.81%, n = 5). The expression of HDC mRNA in various male reproductive organs of ICR mice was investigated. HDC mRNA expression was detected in the testis and epididymis by RT-PCR analyses. The 2.7-kb transcripts of HDC could only be detected in the testis upon Northern blot analyses (Fig. 1A). The amount of HDC mRNA accumulation in the testis was comparable with that in the stomach, which has been reported to exhibit significant levels of HDC activity (22.Watanabe T. Wada H. Parvez S. Nagatsu T. Nagatsu I. Parvez H. Methods in Biogenic Amine Research. Elsevier Science Publications B.V., Amsterdam1983: 690-720Google Scholar). HDC mRNAs were found to be expressed mainly in the cells inside the seminiferous tubules by in situhybridization (Fig. 1B). Immunohistochemical analyses with an anti-HDC antibody also demonstrated that the immunoreactive cells were localized in the seminiferous tubules (Fig. 2,A and B). A majority of immunoreactive signals demonstrated a characteristic shape of the acrosomal cap of elongating spermatids. Small signals were also detected in the round spermatids. Confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated that the immunoreactive signals were localized mainly in the cells that possessed an elongating nucleus (Fig. 3). No immunofluorescence was detected in the cells distributed near the basement membranes of the seminiferous tubules. In the epididymis, the luminal spermatozoa and epithelial cells were also immunoreactive to the anti-HDC antibody (Fig. 2, C and D).Figure 3Immunofluorescent study using an anti-HDC antibody in the testis of ICR mice. The preparations of the sections of the testis were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The sections were incubated with an anti-HDC antibody (1:200) and stained with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The nuclear staining was performed with a SYBR green dye. The fluorescent images were obtained using confocal microscopy (MRC-1024; Bio-Rad).Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The enzymatic activity of HDC and tissue histamine content in the testis, epididymis, and spermatozoa obtained form the cauda epididymis were determined. Significant amounts of enzymatic activity and tissue histamine were detected in these tissues and cells, although the levels were much lower than that in the stomach (Table I). Similar levels of specific activity of HDC were detected in the testis and epididymal spermatozoa, but a higher histamine content (more than 10-fold) was observed in the spermatozoa.Table IEnzymatic activity of HDC and histamine content in the testis, epididymis, epididymal spermatozoa, and stomachHDC activityHistaminefmol/min/mg proteinpmol/mg proteinTestis53.8 ± 3.318.00 ± 2.34Epididymis9.96 ± 1.8239.0 ± 4.93Spermatozoa46.0 ± 2.4493.7 ± 6.33Stomach5880 ± 4878030 ± 763Testis, epididymis, epididymal spermatozoa, and stomach of ICR mice were homogenized and subjected to the assay for HDC activity and histamine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are represented as the means ± S.E.

(n = 5). The molecular species of HDC detected in the mouse male reproductive system was different from those observed in a rat mast cell line. Three immunoreactive bands (69, 45, and 39 kDa) were detected in the testis by immunoblot analyses using an anti-HDC antibody (Fig. 4). In the epididymis, 69- and 39-kDa forms were detected, whereas 39- and 35-kDa forms were detected in the epididymal spermatozoa. None of these bands were detected in the presence of an excess amount of the antigen, glutathione S-transferase fusion HDC (data not shown). W/WV mice, which are genetically defective in c-Kit (stem cell factor receptor) function, have been reported to lack a significant proportion of their male germ cells. No immunoreactive cells were observed in the seminiferous tubules of W/WVmice when immunostained with an anti-HDC antibody. On the other hand, a similar staining pattern to that of ICR mice was observed in the testis of W/W+ mice (Fig. 5). Neither HDC activity nor histamine was detectable in the testis of W/WV mice. In the epididymis, W/WV mice showed a much lower HDC activity and histamine content than the W/W+ mice (Table II).Table IIHDC activity and histamine content in the testis and epididymis of W/W+ and W/Wv miceHDC activityHistamineTestisEpididymisTestisEpididymisfmol/min/mg proteinpmol/mg proteinW/W+98.9 ± 10.022.9 ± 2.509.58 ± 0.88046.7 ± 3.84W/Wv<1.002.00 ± 2.002-ap < 0.01 by Student'st test.<0.253.33 ± 1.762-ap < 0.01 by Student'st test.2-a p < 0.01 by Student'st test. Open table in a new tab In vitro acrosome reactions were performed using a calcium ionophore, A23187. Spermatozoa obtained from the cauda epididymis of ICR mice underwent acrosome reactions upon the addition of A23187. Intracellular histamine was completely lost during the reaction for 1 h and about 25% of the histamine was recovered in the medium (Table III). The addition of a diamine oxidase inhibitor, aminoguanidine, had no effect on the recovery of histamine (data not shown).Table IIIHistamine release by the acrosome reaction induced by A23187HistamineNone+A23187pmol/107cellsSpermatozoa14.3 ± 3.31<0.500Medium<0.5003.40 ± 0.270Spermatozoa were collected from the cauda epididymis in the fertilization medium.

Data are represented as the means ± S.E. (n = 3). The abundant expression of HDC mRNA was demonstrated in the mouse testis by Northern blot analysis. Since the function of histamine in the male reproductive system remains to be clarified, our current studies were performed to analyze the possible functions. HDC mRNA and protein were detected in the cells inside the seminiferous tubules. The most intense immunoreactive signals were found in the acrosomes of elongating spermatids. Since immature acrosomes of the round spermatids were also immunoreactive to the anti-HDC antibody, HDC protein expression in the seminiferous tubules may be synchronized with acrosome development. HDC mRNA was also detected by in situ hybridization in the cells located near the basement membranes of the seminiferous tubules, which were not immunoreactive to the anti-HDC antibody. Although we were unable to identify which types of cells near the basement membrane were positive upon in situ hybridization, these observations suggest that the expression of HDC in these cells may be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. W/WV mice, which possess a point mutation in the kinase domain of c-Kit (SCF receptor), are known to be sterile and to lack a significant portion of their germ cells in the seminiferous tubules (10.Russell E.S. Adv. Genet. 1979; 20: 357-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Studies with a monoclonal antibody, ACK-2, which blocks binding of SCF to c-Kit, have indicated that the SCF/c-Kit interaction is essential for the proliferation of type A spermatogonia in a normal genetic background (23.Yoshinaga K. Nishikawa S. Ogawa M. Hayashi S. Kunisada T. Fujimoto T. Nishikawa S. Development. 1991; 113: 689-699PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Tajima Y. Sawada K. Morimoto T. Nishimune Y. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1994; 102: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). W/WV mice are known to lack spermatocytes, spermatids, and spermatozoa. The absence of the HDC protein in the seminiferous tubules and the lack of enzymatic activity in the testis of W/WV mice is consistent with the observation that HDC is selectively expressed in the spermatids and spermatozoa. The relationship between membrane-bound SCF expression in Sertoli cells and c-Kit expression in male germ cells (spermatogonia and spermatids) is analogous to that between SCF in fibroblasts and c-Kit in immature mast cells. W/WV mice are also known to lack peripheral mature mast cells, indicating that the SCF/c-Kit signaling is also essential for the development of peripheral mast cells (10.Russell E.S. Adv. Genet. 1979; 20: 357-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The treatment of interleukin-3-dependent bone marrow-derived mast cells with SCF has been reported to enhance the synthesis of histamine in these cells (7.Lukacs N.W. Kunkel S.L. Strieter R.M. Evanoff H.L. Kunkel G. Key M.L. Taub D.D. Blood. 1996; 87: 2262-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The acrosome is believed to be analogous to the lysosome (25.Allison A.C. Hartree E.F. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1970; 21: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and contains a large array of hydrolyzing enzymes such as acrosin and hyaluronidase (26.Zaneveld L.J.D. De Jonge C.J. Dunbar B.S. O'Rand M.G. A Comparative Overview of Mammalian Fertilization. Plenum Press, New York1991: 63-79Crossref Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that HDC is localized in the granular fraction of a rat mast cell line, RBL-2H3 (5.Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8177-8182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Male germ cells and mast cells may share a common mechanism, a SCF/c-Kit signaling pathway, that may induce the expression and determine the intracellular localization of HDC. We previously reported that HDC is translated as a 74-kDa precursor and processed into a mature 53-kDa form in a mast cell line (5.Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8177-8182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The reported molecular mass of purified enzymes from various mammalian tissues has all been 53–55-kDa (19.Ohmori E. Fukui T. Imanishi N. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20.Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys.

Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) while the mouse HDC cDNA codes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 74 kDa (28.Yamamoto J. Yatsunami K. Ohmori E. Sugimoto Y. Fukui T. Katayama T. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that different forms of HDC (69, 45, 39, and 35 kDa) are expressed in the male reproductive tissues. We recently generated a mouse strain, genetically lacking the pyridoxal-binding site of HDC, and exhibiting no HDC activity (29.Ohtsu H. Tanaka S. Terui T. Hori Y. Makabe-Kobayashi Y. Pejler G. Tchougounova E. Hellman L. Gertsenstein M. Hirasawa N. Sakurai E. Buzas E. Kovacs P. Csaba G. Kittel A. Okada M. Hara M. Mar L. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Ishigaki-Suzuki S. Ohuchi K. Ichikawa A. Falus A.

Ohtsu H. Ichikawa A. Nagy A. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this strain, no immunoreactive bands were observed in the testis, epididymis, and epididymal spermatozoa (data not shown). Since no splice variants of HDC were detected in the testis by RT-PCR (data not shown), these multiple forms of HDC may be generated by post-translational processing. It is possible that sperm-specific forms of HDC may be produced by a different processing pathway from that in mast cells, since acrosomes are known to contain various specific proteases. A previous study has suggested the existence of a testis-specific form of the c-Kit protein (31.Sandlow J.I. Feng H. Sandra A. Urology. 1997; 49: 494-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In rat stomach, the existence of multiple forms of HDC have also been reported, where small forms of HDC (40 and 36 kDa) were found to be increased upon the refeeding of fasted rats (32.Dartsch C. Chen D. Persson L. Regul. Pept. 1998; 77: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 33.Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4932-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since the specific activity of these forms remains to be determined both in the rat stomach and in our study, it is unclear whether these small forms of HDC possess the enzymatic activity. However, since Engel et al. (34.Engel N. Olno M.T. Coleman C.S. Medina M.A. Pegg A.E. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have reported that the deletion of the amino-terminal 68 residues and the carboxyl-terminal 20-kDa region has no effect on theKm value and enzymatic activity of rat HDC, it is possible that the small forms of HDC (39 and 35 kDa) in spermatozoa exhibit enzymatic activity. In this study, we demonstrated the release of histamine from spermatozoa by an in vitro acrosome reaction induced by a calcium ionophore, A23187. Accumulating evidence suggests that fertilizing spermatozoa do not initiate the acrosome reaction in vivo until they come into contact with the zona pellucida (14.Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neil J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven, New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). Although the acrosome reaction induced by a calcium ionophore may be quite different from the zona-induced reaction, it is generally believed that the differences most probably occur during the initial steps of the reaction and not in the downstream cascade of events that occur. Although a function for histamine in fertilization has not been reported, our results suggest that histamine release may have some function in the fertilization process. We have observed normal fertility in the HDC-deficient mice (29.Ohtsu H. Tanaka S. Terui T. Hori Y. Makabe-Kobayashi Y. Pejler G. Tchougounova E. Hellman L. Gertsenstein M. Hirasawa N. Sakurai E. Buzas E. Kovacs P. Csaba G. Kittel A. Okada M. Hara M. Mar L. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Ishigaki-Suzuki S. Ohuchi K. Ichikawa A. Falus A. Watanabe T. Nagy A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), indicating that histamine production may not be essential in fertility. We are now investigating of male germ cell function and morphology using this mutant mouse strain. To clarify the mechanism as to how histamine modulates the process of fertilization, further experiments, such as in vitro fertilization, are surely required. The recovery of released histamine was quite low in our in vitro acrosome reactions. Since the addition of a diamine oxidase inhibitor, aminoguanidine, did not increase the recovery of histamine, the other histamine-metabolizing enzyme, histamineN-methyltransferase, may be involved in the degradation of histamine. We have not been able to perform further studies on this point, since we could not obtain a specific inhibitor of histamineN-methyltransferase. The expression of diamine oxidase and histamine N-methyltransferase in spermatozoa remains unknown. In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that there is significant expression of HDC in the spermatids and spermatozoa of male mice and that the release of histamine from spermatozoa can be induced by an in vitro acrosome reaction. Our results raise the possibility that histamine may play a role in the mouse reproductive system."

We found that paxillin was degraded by caspases in Ba/F3 cell apoptosis induced by withdrawal of interleukin-3 (IL-3), a survival factor for this cell, and by ionizing radiation. Also, paxillin was degraded in vitro by incubation with recombinant caspase-3. Western blot analyses of degradation products of overexpressed green fluorescence protein-tagged paxillin and site-specific mutants demonstrated that Asp-102 and Asp-301 were early caspase cleavage sites, and Asp-5, Asp-146, Asp-165, and Asp-222 were late cleavage sites. Overexpression of paxillin delayed apoptosis of Ba/F3 after IL-3 withdrawal. Furthermore, this anti-apoptotic effect of paxillin was augmented by a triple mutation in aspartic acids at caspase cleavage sites. These results suggest that paxillin plays a critical role in cell survival signaling and that the cleavage of paxillin by caspases might be an important event for focal adhesion disassembly during cell apoptosis, contributing to detachment, rounding, and death.

The N-terminal half contains five LD motifs, whereas the C-terminal half contains four LIM domains (see model in Fig. 8 B below). LD motifs (LDXLLXXL) (18.Brown M.C. Curtis M.S. Turner C.E. Nat.

The LIM2 and LIM3 domains are important for localization of paxillin to focal adhesions by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism (30.Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J.

Accumulating evidence suggests that paxillin plays a pivotal role in integrin-mediated signal pathways for adhesion, migration, and anchorage-dependent survival of cells. Apoptosis, programmed cell death, is accompanied by a succession of characteristic changes in cellular morphology such as detachment from substratum, rounding, cytoplasm shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, nuclear shrinkage and fragmentation, and DNA fragmentation (41.Zornig M. Hueber A. Baum W. Evan G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1551: F1-F37PubMed Google Scholar). It is clear that all these processes are dependent on proteolytic cleavages by caspases, a family of proteases that are activated in cascade and degrade many key cellular proteins during apoptosis. However, the basic mechanisms responsible for these phenomena and how they are integrated or interdependent have not been explored in detail. Recent studies have shown that focal adhesions are disassembled and some of their constituents, such as FAK (42.Wen L.P. Fahrni J.A. Troie S. Guan J.L. Orth K. Rosen G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 43.Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Exp.

Cell. 2000; 11: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), are cleaved by caspases during apoptosis. However, cleavage of these particular components does not appear to be critical for focal adhesion disassembly during apoptosis, because release of FAK from focal adhesion precedes cleavage of FAK by caspase (45.van de Water B. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13328-13337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is more likely that caspase cleavages of components upstream of FAK are crucial for focal adhesion disassembly. One plausible candidate for the caspase target that is critical to focal adhesion disassembly is paxillin, because binding to LD motifs and tyrosine phosphorylation sites at the N-terminal half of paxillin is essential for recruiting other critical focal adhesion proteins, such as FAK (21.Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 22.Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol.

IL-3 is a survival and proliferation factor for hematopoietic cells (47.Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Collins M. Lopez-Rivas A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Ba/F3, a murine pro-B cell line, is dependent on IL-3 for not only survival and growth but also for its polarized and elongated shape (48.Romanova L.Y. Alexandrov I.A. Blagosklonny M.V. Nordan R.P. Garfield S. Acs P. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Blumberg P.M. Mushinski J.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Ba/F3 cells express a considerable amount of paxillin, and cell adhesion and migration are essential for lymphocyte functions (37.Salgia R. Avraham S. Pisick E. Li J. Raja S. Greenfield A.E.

In this report, we show that paxillin is degraded by caspase during IL-3 withdrawal and radiation-induced Ba/F3 apoptosis. We studied the kinetics of caspase-mediated cleavage of paxillin and its cleavage sites in detail, and we demonstrate that paxillin is anti-apoptotic in IL-3 withdrawal-induced apoptosis of Ba/F3 cells. Active recombinant caspase-3 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Cell-permeable caspase inhibitors (z-VAD-fmk and z-DEVD-fmk), colorimetric caspase-3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-pNA),N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), andN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal (ALLM), proteasome inhibitor (clasto-Lactacystin β-lactone), aprotinin, leupeptin, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (ABESF) were purchased fromCalbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and CHAPS was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Alexa 647-conjugated annexin V was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Antibodies for paxillin (clone 349), green fluorescence protein (GFP) (monoclonal and polyclonal), actin (clone AC-40), and poly(A)DP-rybosyl polymerase (PARP) (polyclonal) were from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA), CLONTECH (San Francisco, CA), Sigma, and Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and -mouse IgG, were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). Enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kits, Supersignal West Pico and Supersignal West Dura, and the BCA protein assay kit were from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow was from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). pEGFP-C2 and pEGFP-N1 plasmids were from CLONTECH. The λ phagemid cDNA library of mouse testis was kindly provided by Dr. Konrad Huppi, NCI (National Institutes of Health). The IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line Ba/F3 was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 10% WEHI-3-conditioned media as a source of murine IL-3. To withdraw IL-3, cells were washed four times by centrifugation and resuspension in PBS at room temperature (pH 7.4), and 2 × 106 cells were plated into 100-mm dishes containing 10 ml of pre-warmed IL-3-free medium and incubated in a CO2incubator for various times with or without exposure to 20 Gy of γ-irradiation from a 137Cs source. A cDNA that included the entire open reading frame of mouse paxillin α was constructed using DNA from a λ phagemid library of mouse testis as a template for a series of PCR reactions. The 5′ and 3′ portions of paxillin were amplified separately using vector sequences and mouse paxillin α-specific sequences from a central part of the transcript (15.Mazaki Y. Uchida H. Hino O. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22435-22441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). λgt10 forward primer (5′-GCAAGTTCAGCCTGGTTAAGTCCAAG-3′) was paired with paxillin α-specific reverse (5′-TGGGCCATGAACTTGAAATCTGACAG-3′) primer, and λgt10 reverse primer (5′-GGTGGCTTATGAGTATTTCTTCCAGGGT-3′) was paired with paxillin α-specific forward primer (5′-CTGTCAGATTTCAAGTTCATGGCCCA-3′). The two internal paxillin primers were complementary to one another, and they crossed the splice site where paxillin β 2A complete cDNA clone for mouse paxillin β cDNA was also obtained from this library and will be reported elsewhere. is sometimes inserted by variant splicing (15.Mazaki Y.

The 5′ and 3′ halves of paxillin α were PCR amplified three or four times and sequenced. Consensus sequences (eliminating the occasional Taq polymerase mistake) were recognized by comparing the DNA sequences obtained from three or four independent PCR amplifications. A cDNA encoding the entire open reading frame was obtained by PCR amplification using a pair of primers composed of the outermost sequences in the initial clones for the two halves of paxillin and restriction sites for BglII andEcoRI, respectively. This cDNA was then cloned into pEGFP-C2 and pEGFP-N1 to create GFP-paxillin and paxillin-GFP fusion proteins, respectively. All clones were verified by DNA sequencing. A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used forin vitro mutagenesis of potential caspase-targeting aspartic acids (see below) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs encoding GFP fusion proteins with paxillin and their mutants were transfected into BaF/3 cells by electroporation using Electro Square Porator ECM830 (BTX Division of Genetronics, Inc., San Diego, CA). In detail, Ba/F3 cells (4 × 106) were washed once with 5 ml of ice-cold 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 250 mm sucrose and 1 mm MgCl2, resuspended in 0.4 ml of the same buffer, and put into 2-mm gap electroporation cuvettes that contained 20 μg of DNA. After gentle mixing and incubation on ice for 10 min, two electric pulses (375 V, 99-μs duration) were given with a 1-s interval, and cells were immediately added into 10 ml of pre-warmed medium in a 100-mm tissue culture dish. Cells were cultured for 2 days and then cloned into 96-well plates by limiting dilution under selection with 400 μg/ml G418. Clones that showed green fluorescence under the fluorescence microscope were selected for expansion, and the expression level of paxillin and GFP-paxillin fusion proteins was assayed by Western blot analysis using anti-paxillin or anti-GFP antibodies. Cells in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were washed twice by centrifugation at 4 °C and resuspension in cold PBS (pH 7.4). Appropriate amounts of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm ABESF, and 25 μm each of calpain inhibitors I and II, ALLN and ALLM, were added to the cell pellets. After brief sonication on ice and a 15-min centrifugation at maximum speed in the microcentrifuge, supernatants (soluble fraction) were assayed for protein concentration, mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and loaded onto a 4–20% gradient Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel. For the insoluble fraction, the pellet was resuspended and sonicated in an equal volume of lysis buffer and analyzed as above. Western blots of these gels were developed with antibodies and chemiluminescence. For immunoprecipitations, protein G-conjugated beads (10-μl bed volume) were added to cell extracts (0.5 mg of protein) and continuously inverted for 2 h at 4 °C. After a brief centrifugation, 1 μg of paxillin antibody and 10 μl of protein G-conjugated beads were added to the supernatant and continuously inverted overnight at 4 °C. Cell extracts (10 μg of protein) were incubated with 200 μm caspase-3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-pNA) in 100 μl of 25 mmHEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% CHAPS, and 10% sucrose, for 1 h at 37 °C. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured by a microplate reader. To study in vitro cleavage of paxillin by caspase, paxillin was isolated by immunoprecipitation from Ba/F3 cell extracts as described above. Beads were washed four times with PBS and once by 1 ml of caspase reaction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, incubated with 50 μl of reaction buffer in the absence or presence of 100 ng of active recombinant caspase-3 with or without 10 μm z-DEVD-fmk inhibitor for 1 h at 37 °C, and analyzed by Western blot analysis of half of each reaction mixture. Cells (1 × 106) were washed once with PBS containing 1 g/liter sucrose and then fixed and permeabilized overnight in 1 ml of 70% ethanol. After centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min, cell pellets were resuspended in PBS containing 1 μg/ml PI and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. One drop of this suspension of stained cells was put on a slide glass under a coverslip. Confocal fluoromicroscopic images were taken with an LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Cells (1 × 106) were washed once with PBS containing 1 g/liter sucrose and resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2 (50.Andree H.A.

Cells were incubated at room temperature for 15 min after addition of 5 μl of Alexa 647 (excitation: 647 nm; emission: 665 nm)-conjugated annexin V stock solution and 1 μg/ml PI and analyzed with the FACSCalibur system (BD PharMingen immunocytometry system, San Jose, CA). A bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit was used, and bovine serum albumin was used as protein standard (51.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

Ba/F3 cells are dependent on IL-3 for their survival and proliferation in culture, and IL-3 withdrawal-induced apoptosis of Ba/F3 cells has been well studied (47.Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Collins M.

Ba/F3 cells are sensitive to ionizing radiation. Exposure to 4 Gy of γ-radiation in the absence of IL-3 is enough to induce apoptosis in this cell line (53.Mathieu A.L. Gonin S. Leverrier Y.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 600-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Ba/F3 cells also depend on IL-3 for cell shape (48.Romanova L.Y. Alexandrov I.A. Blagosklonny M.V. Nordan R.P. Garfield S.

They have an elongated shape under optimum growth conditions, although every culture contains a low percentage of round cells. The entire cell population becomes round immediately after removal of IL-3. During the study of regulation of Ba/F3 cell shape by IL-3, we noticed that paxillin protein levels decreased following IL-3 withdrawal. Western blot analysis of cell extracts with monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody revealed two protein bands, and the intensity of both bands decreased after IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 1 A). The upper 68-kDa band is paxillin, and the lower 48- or 50-kDa band could be Hic-5 (16.Fujita H. Kamiguchi K. Cho D. Shibanuma M. Morimoto C. Tachibana K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26516-26521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or leupaxin (17.Lipsky B.P. Beals C.R. Staunton D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11709-11713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), previously described paxillin-like proteins. The lower band was not detected by commercial antibody for Hic-5 (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA, data not shown). Thus, we presume that this band is leupaxin, for which no commercial antibody is available. Paxillin was degraded more rapidly after exposure to 20 Gy of γ-radiation after withdrawal of IL-3 (Fig. 1 B). However, in neither case did we see the appearance of smaller breakdown products concurrent with disappearance of p68 paxillin or p48 presumed leupaxin (Fig. 1). Because the cell extracts used in this Western blot analysis included only the Triton X-100-soluble fraction, we also checked the insoluble fraction as described under “Experimental Procedures.” No significant band was detected in the insoluble fraction using the same paxillin antibody (data not shown). We assumed 1) that Ba/F3 cells underwent apoptosis after IL-3 withdrawal and γ-irradiation, 2) that paxillin was cleaved by proteases that were activated during the apoptosis, and 3) that this cleavage destroyed the epitope site for the monoclonal paxillin antibody or left too small epitope-bearing fragments to be detected in Western blot analyses. IL-3 withdrawal-induced apoptosis of Ba/F3 cells was analyzed with annexin V conjugation, to detect early apoptotic cells, and with parallel PI staining to detect late apoptotic cells (Fig. 2 A). Under normal conditions of culture, more than 99% of the Ba/F3 cell population was negative for both annexin V and PI staining (Fig. 2 A, 0 h). After 6 h without IL-3, a considerable proportion (19%) of the cells was converted to annexin V-positive, but the major population (80%) of the annexin V-positive cells remained negative for PI staining (early apoptotic cells). The percentage of annexin V- positive cells increased to 81% of total cells after 24-h incubation. At this time point, most of annexin V-positive cells (95%) were converted to positive for PI staining (late apoptotic cells). Apoptosis was much more rapid in cells exposed to radiation in addition to IL-3 withdrawal. Characteristic early apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology (Fig. 2 B) were revealed by PI staining of ethanol-fixed cells 8 h after IL-3 withdrawal and γ-irradiation. Virtually all the nuclei appeared apoptotic, namely, shrunken and fragmented, and the chromatin stained brighter and more homogenously (8 h), compared with nuclei in control cells (0 h). The percentage of apoptotic nuclei is plotted in Fig. 2 C, along with a"

In this study we have attempted to address the question of whether SUR heteromultimers can form using a combination of biochemical and electrophysiological approaches. We have constructed monoclonal stable lines in HEK293 cells co-expressing Kir6.2 with SUR1 and SUR2A. Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis with SUR isotype-specific antibodies two biochemical populations are distinguished, one containing SUR1 and the other SUR2A. It is not possible to detect immune complexes containing both SUR1 and SUR2A. Functional studies were undertaken and whole cell membrane currents were studied using the patch clamp. Concentrations of sulfonylureas and potassium channel openers were determined that selectively inhibited or activated SUR1/Kir6.2 and SUR2A/Kir6.2. In the cell line expressing SUR1/SUR2AKir6.2 we were unable to demonstrate a population of channels with unique pharmacological properties. Thus we conclude from these studies that heteromultimeric channel complexes containing both SUR1 and SUR2A are not formed, suggesting an incompatibility between different SUR subtypes. This incompatibility limits the pharmacological complexity of KATP channels that may be observed in native tissues.

Concentrations of sulfonylureas and potassium channel openers were determined that selectively inhibited or activated SUR1/Kir6.2 and SUR2A/Kir6.2. In the cell line expressing SUR1/SUR2AKir6.2 we were unable to demonstrate a population of channels with unique pharmacological properties. Thus we conclude from these studies that heteromultimeric channel complexes containing both SUR1 and SUR2A are not formed, suggesting an incompatibility between different SUR subtypes. This incompatibility limits the pharmacological complexity of KATP channels that may be observed in native tissues. ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATPchannels) 1The abbreviations used are:KATP channelsATP-sensitive potassium channelsSURsulfonylurea receptorare formed from a complex of an inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir6.0) and a sulfonylurea receptor (SUR), a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of proteins (1.Aguilar Bryan L.

The channel is regulated by intracellular levels of adenine nucleotides, with ATP4− inhibiting and MgADP activating channel activity (11.Noma A.

KATP channels are thus thought to form a link between the metabolic status of the cell and membrane excitability. Its best characterized physiological role is in the pancreatic β-cell, where KATP channels are important in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion (12.Ashcroft S.J. Ashcroft F.M.

KATP channels also play a role in the regulation of tone in vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle (16.Quayle J.M. Nelson M.T. Standen N.B. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1165-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) and during ischemia KATP channels in cardiac myocytes, skeletal muscle, and neurons have been proposed to serve a protective function (17.Grover G.J.

Res. 2000; 87: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The sulfonylurea class of drugs, which inhibit KATP channel activity, are used in the treatment of Type II diabetes mellitus and these channels are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of hypertension, asthma, and ischemia reperfusion injury (19.Edwards G. Weston A.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 597-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). ATP-sensitive potassium channels sulfonylurea receptor The channel is an octameric complex of Kir6.0 and sulfonylurea receptor subunits with a 1:1 stoichiometry (20.Clement J.P. Kunjilwar K.

The sulfonylurea receptor subunits play a role in the modulation of channel activity by MgADP and also confer on the channel responsiveness to a range of pharmacological agents, such as the potassium channel openers diazoxide, pinacidil, and cromakalim and the sulfonylurea class of compounds including glibenclamide and tolbutamide, which inhibit channel activity (1.Aguilar Bryan L.

The properties of a particular KATPchannel are dependent upon its subunit composition (7.Babenko A.P. Aguilar Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 8.Seino S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 337-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 9.Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M.

The co-expression of channel subunits in heterologous systems recapitulates many of the properties of nativeKATP channels. For example, co-expression of Kir6.2+SUR1, Kir6.2+SUR2A, and Kir6.1+SUR2B produces channels with characteristics similar to KATP channels observed in pancreatic β-cells, cardiac tissue, and smooth muscle, respectively. Pharmacologically, the Kir6.2/SUR1 channel complex is typified by high sensitivity to inhibition by sulfonylureas and activation by diazoxide but is relatively unresponsive to pinacidil or cromakalim (30.Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Seino S. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1412-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 31.Hu H. Sato T. Seharaseyon J. Liu Y. Johns D.C. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Mol.

Sci. 2000; 21: 439-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The Kir6.2/SUR2A channel is less sensitive to inhibition by sulfonylureas and is only weakly responsive to diazoxide but can be activated by pinacidil and cromakalim (30.Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Seino S. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1412-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 31.Hu H. Sato T. Seharaseyon J. Liu Y. Johns D.C. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Mol.

Sci. 2000; 21: 439-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The Kir6.1/SUR2B channel has a similar sensitivity to sulfonylureas as the Kir6.2/SUR2A channel. It is activated by diazoxide, cromakalim, and pinacidil (6.Isomoto S. Kondo C. Yamada M. Matsumoto S. Higashiguchi O. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24321-24324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 25.Yamada M. Isomoto S. Matsumoto S. Kondo C. Shindo T. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 715-720Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar). It is clear that the SUR subunits determine the pharmacological profile of the channel. Given that four SUR subunits are present in the channel complex there is a possibility that more than one type of SUR subunit may be present in some channel complexes. It has been shown that binding of potassium channel openers or sulfonylureas to one SUR subunit of the channel complex is sufficient to induce channel opening or closure (34.Dorschner H. Brekardin E. Uhde I. Schwanstecher C. Schwanstecher M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 35.Gross I. Toman A. Uhde I. Schwanstecher C. Schwanstecher M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, heteromultimeric channel complexes containing more than one type of SUR subunit would have novel pharmacology, thus contributing to the diversity of ATP-sensitive K+ currents observed in native tissues. SUR1 and SUR2 expression overlaps in several tissues, including rat pituitary gland, ventricular myocytes, some brain regions and some smooth muscles (1.Aguilar Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W.

In this study we have attempted to address the question of whether SUR heteromultimers can form using a combination of biochemical and electrophysiological approaches. HEK293 cells were cultured as previously described (41.Giblin J.P. Leaney J.L. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22652-22659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A monoclonal stable line constructed in a previous study, co-expressing Kir6.2+SUR2A (42.Cui Y. Giblin J.P. Clapp L.H. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), was transfected with hamster SUR1 in pcDNA3.1/hygro (Invitrogen, Netherlands) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The stable cell line was established by antibiotic selection with 727 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), 364 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen), and 364 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Monoclonal stable lines were subsequently established as described previously (41.Giblin J.P. Leaney J.L. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22652-22659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The presence of SUR1 in the stable line was determined by Western blotting with a SUR1-specific antibody (SUR1NBD1, see later) and electrophysiological analysis. We generated a line expressing SUR1/SUR2B/Kir6.2 in an analogous fashion after transfection of SUR1 into a SUR2B/Kir6.2 stable line and triple selection. Antisera were raised in rabbits to peptides corresponding to sequences in the first nucleotide-binding domains of hamster SUR1 (amino acids 942–955) and rabbit SUR2 (amino acids 651–666). Rabbits were immunized with peptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. All immunizations and subsequent bleeds were carried out commercially (Regal Group Limited, Great Bookham, Surrey, UK). The peptides used to raise the SUR1 and SUR2 antibodies had the sequences ETVMERKASEPSQGC and DSYEQARRLRPAETEDC, respectively (terminal cysteines added for coupling purposes). Antibodies were affinity purified from the terminal bleeds on a column of the appropriate antigenic peptide coupled to an Affi-Gel 10 gel support (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hemel Hempstead, UK). The antibody raised to the distal C terminus of Kir6.2 has been described in a previous publication (42.Cui Y. Giblin J.P. Clapp L.H. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation experiments were done as described previously with minor modifications (41.Giblin J.P. Leaney J.L. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22652-22659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 42.Cui Y. Giblin J.P. Clapp L.H. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell line homogenates (0.8 mg of total protein) were solubilized in solubilization buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and aggregated material removed by centrifugation at 20,800 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Solubilized extracts were subsequently pre-cleared by incubation with 3 mg of Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Bioscience) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were allowed to form by addition of 1 μl (0.15 μg of protein) affinity purified antibody followed by incubation for 12–16 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The immune complexes were precipitated by addition of 3 mg of Protein A-Sepharose followed by further incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The Sepharose was pelleted by centrifugation and washed four times with solubilization buffer followed by a final wash in solubilization buffer without Triton X-100. Immune complexes were eluted with 75 μl of 6 × loading buffer (350 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10.28% (w/v) SDS, 36% (w/v) glycerol, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 0.012% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and denatured (100 °C for 3 min) prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was done as described previously (41.Giblin J.P. Leaney J.L. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22652-22659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All antibodies were used to probe Western blots at a 1:2000 dilution. Cells were stained and imaged using a previously published method (42.Cui Y. Giblin J.P. Clapp L.H. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Whole cell recording were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). The current signals were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz (voltage step) or 2 kHz (voltage ramp) using Digidata 1200 interface and analyzed using pClamp software (v6.0, Axon Instruments). Patch pipettes, made from 1.7-mm outer diameter borosilicate capillaries (Clark Electromedical), were pulled and fire polished using a DMZ-universal puller (Zietz Instruments). The pipettes had resistance of 1.5–3 MΩ for whole cell recording when filled with electrolyte solution. The capacitance of pipettes was reduced by coating pipettes with a parafilm/mineral oil suspension and compensated for electronically. Series resistance was corrected using amplifier circuitry to at least 75%. A solution containing (in mm), 107 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 5 HEPES (KOH to pH 7.2 ∼140 mm K+) was used as the pipette solution and another that contained 140 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 HEPES (pH 7.4) was used as the bath solution. The pipette solution was supplemented with nucleotides as indicated in the figure legends and the pH adjusted to 7.2 again if necessary. Statistical analysis was carried out using one-way ANOVA and a Bonferroni post-hoc test (Prism v3). Statistical significance is as indicated (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Antibodies raised to the first nucleotide-binding domains of SUR1 and SUR2 were characterized by Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence microscopy. The characterization of the SUR2 antibody (designated SUR2NBD1) by Western blotting is shown in Fig. 1A,i. Two reactive bands that have estimated molecular masses of between 160,000 and 190,000 Daltons are observed on a Western blot of lysates from stable lines expressing Kir6.2+SUR2A and Kir6.1+SUR2B but not from a stable line expressing Kir6.2+SUR1. The two reactive bands are likely to correspond to differentially glycosylated forms of the receptor (43.Nelson D.A. Bryan J. Wechsler S. Clement J.P. Aguilar Bryan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14793-14799Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments done on the Kir6.2+SUR2A and Kir6.2+SUR1 stable cell lines showed that the SUR2NBD1 antibody can immunoprecipitate SUR2A but not SUR1 (Fig. 1A,ii + iii). In parallel experiments, the SUR1NBD1 antibody was shown to immunoprecipitate SUR1 but not SUR2A (Fig. 1A, ii + iii). The SUR2NBD1 antibody was also characterized by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1B). In cells where SUR2B is expressed, detectable fluorescent signal can be observed unlike in non-transfected and SUR1-expressing cells. The characterization of the SUR1NBD1 antibody by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy is detailed elsewhere. 2J. P. Giblin, K. Quinn, and A. Tinker, manuscript in preparation. It shows selectivity for SUR1 over SUR2 in these experimental assays (not shown). The characterization studies demonstrate that the SUR1NBD1 and SUR2NBD1 antibodies are subtype-specific and can be used in biochemical studies examining the potential for SUR subunit heteromultimerization. Monoclonal stable lines expressing SUR1+SUR2A+Kir6.2 and SUR1+SUR2B+Kir6.2 were established as described under “Materials and Methods.” In the studies reported here we largely use the SUR1+SUR2A+Kir6.2 line because theKATP complexes SUR1+Kir6.2 and SUR2A+Kir6.2 have pharmacological properties that enable them to be readily distinguished (see below). SUR2B is more similar to SUR1 and, for example, both SUR1+Kir6.2 and SUR2B+Kir6.2 are activated by similar concentrations of diazoxide. The presence of each component in the SUR1+SUR2A+Kir6.2 line was checked by immunofluorescence microscopy as shown in Fig. 1C and essentially every cell in this line expresses all three components. This was also confirmed by electrophysiological studies using selective pharmacological tools (see below). The SUR subtype-specific antibodies were used in an attempt to immunoprecipitate channel complexes containing SUR1 and SUR2A from the Kir6.2+SUR1+SUR2A stable line. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 2A. SUR1 is immunoprecipitated using the SUR1NBD1 antibody without concomitant immunoprecipitation of SUR2A. In the reciprocal experiment, the SUR2NBD1 antibody immunoprecipitates SUR2A without co-immunoprecipitation of SUR1. The presence of two separate populations of SUR subunits was confirmed by a sequential immunoprecipitation of the supernatants from the SUR1NBD1 and SUR2NBD1 immunoprecipitation experiments with the SUR2NBD1 and SUR1NBD1 antibodies, respectively. The absence of any observed decrease in signal on the Western blot between the SUR1 immunoprecipitated directly from the stable line homogenate and the SUR1 immunoprecipitated from the supernatant of the SUR2NBD1 immunoprecipitation (compare lanes labeled IP SUR1NBD1 withIP SUR2NBD1≫IP SUR1NBD1) indicates that there is unlikely to be a small population of SUR heteromultimeric complexes. This observation also applies to the SUR2A immunoprecipitates (comparelane IP SUR2NBD1 with IP SUR1NBD1≫IP SUR2NBD1). The immunoprecipitation experiments appear to indicate that SUR1 and SUR2A are not present in the same channel complexes. The diagram in Fig. 2B explains this concept and provides an interpretation of the immunoprecipitation analysis. The same experiments were done using a Kir6.2+SUR1+SUR2B monoclonal stable line and no co-immunoprecipitation of SUR1 and SUR2B was observed (data not shown). We next designed experiments to test if functional populations with novel pharmacological properties could be detected that would be compatible with the presence of SUR1 and SUR2 in an octameric complex. In particular, we examined SUR1 and SUR2A as they have a distinct selective and separable pharmacology. Our initial experiments determined the exact concentrations at which to use the sulfonylurea tolbutamide and the K channel openers diazoxide and pinacidil in our system. Membrane currents were studied with the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp in a SUR1+Kir6.2 stable line and a SUR2A+Kir6.2 stable line. 100 μm diazoxide but not 10 μm pinacidil activated SUR1+Kir6.2 and currents were inhibited by 10 μm tolbutamide and 10 μmglibenclamide (Fig. 3). In contrast, SUR2A+Kir6.2 currents were activated by 10 μm pinacidil but not 100 μm diazoxide and inhibited by 10 μm glibenclamide but not 10 μm tolbutamide (Fig. 4). Thus it is possible to use pharmacological tools to functionally discriminate these populations.Figure 4Selective responses of SUR2A+Kir6.2 currents to potassium channel openers and blockers in HEK293 cells.A, whole cell current traces were recorded from the cell stably expressing SUR2A+Kir6.2 under control conditions and in the presence of diazoxide or pinacidil alone or in combination with tolbutamide or glibenclamide. The pipette solution (see “Materials and Methods”) was supplemented with 3 mm MgATP.B, summarized data for the currents measured at −100 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As described above Schwanstecher and colleagues (34.Dorschner H. Brekardin E. Uhde I. Schwanstecher C. Schwanstecher M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 35.Gross I. Toman A. Uhde I. Schwanstecher C. Schwanstecher M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have shown that a single sulfonylurea receptor can confer activation by openers and inhibition by sulfonylureas and related drugs on the channel complex. A mixed octamer of SUR1+SUR2A+Kir6.2 might thus be expected to have mixed pharmacology. Fig. 5 shows experiments measuring whole cell currents in the SUR1+SUR2A+Kir6.2 stable line to test whether such populations exist. 100 μm diazoxide activates significant tolbutamide-sensitive currents (Fig. 5A, i) confirming the presence of SUR1+Kir6.2. The cell is subsequently washed and currents activated by 10 μm pinacidil (Fig. 5A, ii). If functional SUR1+SUR2A+Kir6.2 octamers existed it would be expected that SUR1 in the complex would confer some sensitivity to 10 μm tolbutamide. The data clearly show that this is not the case. Currents are subsequently completely inhibited by 10 μm glibenclamide. We sought to test this question in another fashion. A further difference between SUR2A+Kir6.2 and SUR1+Kir6.2 is that current inhibition after the application of glibenclamide is reversible in the former but not in the latter. For example, currents can be selectively activated by 10 μm levcromakalim in the SUR2A+Kir6.2 cell line or by 100 μm diazoxide in the SUR1+Kir6.2 cell line and then inhibited by co-application of 10 μmglibenclamide. The cells are washed for a 5-min period and the potassium channel opener reapplied (Fig. 6, A and B). This leads to current activation that is comparable in magnitude with SUR2A+Kir6.2 but no activation in the case of SUR1+Kir6.2. 10 μm levcromakalim is selective for SUR2A+Kir6.2 over SUR1+Kir6.2 in a similar manner to 10 μm pinacidil (not shown). We then examined the behavior of the SUR1+SUR2A+Kir6.2 stable line (Fig. 6, C and D). Prior application of glibenclamide and subsequent washing did not lead to a change in the current elicited by a second application of levcromakalim. This data and that in Fig. 5 suggests that there is not a functionally significant heteromeric population containing SUR1 and SUR2A with Kir6.2. The major novel finding presented here is thatKATP channel complexes containing SUR1 and SUR2 with Kir6.2 cannot be formed even after overexpression in HEK293 cells. This proposal is supported by biochemical and functional data. In particular we have focused on SUR1 and SUR2A as it is possible to perform less ambiguous functional experiments based on selective pharmacology. We have performed analogous biochemical studies with SUR1 and SUR2B with similar results. The latter combination is likely to be more important in native tissues as both SUR1 and SUR2B are more widely distributed than SUR2A (see below). However, SUR2A and SUR2B are C-terminal splice variants and differ by under 40 amino acids. SUR2A and SUR2B do display some pharmacological differences (44.Matsuoka T. Matsushita K. Katayama Y. Fujita A. Inageda K. Tanemoto M. Inanobe A. Yamashita S. Matsuzawa Y. Kurachi Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, given the large part of the protein that is identical between the splice variants our results are likely to be generally applicable to interactions between SUR1 and SUR2. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the pore forming subunits, Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 (α subunits), are able to readily heteromultimerize (42.Cui Y. Giblin J.P. Clapp L.H. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, it seems the β subunits for Kir6.0, i.e. SUR, do not enter into mixed populations and the latter process will limit the potential pharmacological complexity of KATP in cells where multiple SUR isoforms are expressed. This has implications in the design of therapeutic agents that are able to specifically targetKATP channels in different tissues given that channels with intermediate pharmacologies due to SUR heteromultimerization are unlikely to occur in vivo. The failure of β subunits to heteromultimerize is not a general theme in K+ channel assembly. For the voltage-gated family of K+ channel, heteromultimerization of auxiliary or β K+ channel subunits has been shown to have functional importance in refining their modulatory effect. For example, co-assembly of Kvβ2 and Kvβ1 subunits in a voltage-gated K+ channel complex modulates the inactivation properties of the channel (45.Rhodes K.J. Strassle B.W. Monaghan M.M. Bekele-Arcuri Z. Matos M.F. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8246-8258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Xu J. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11728-11735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These data have an important bearing on the likely molecular composition of KATP channels in native tissues. It is clear that SURs are widely expressed. For example, SUR2B is present to some level in every tissue examined (6.Isomoto S. Kondo C. Yamada M. Matsumoto S. Higashiguchi O. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24321-24324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In some neurons SUR1 and SUR2B are co-expressed and KATPchannels with intermediate sulfonylurea sensitivity have been observed (36.Liss B. Bruns R. Roeper J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, it is clear that the sulfonylurea sensitivity ofKATP channels is dependent upon several factors other than subunit composition such as cellular stress, adenine nucleotide ratios, cytoskeletal disruption, and the operative condition of the channel (47.Venkatesh N. Lamp S.T. Weiss J.N. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 623-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 48.Findlay I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 266: 456-467PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Virag L. Furukawa T.

Our data make one of these explanations more likely. Furthermore, based on antisense experiments, it has also been suggested that a population of heteromeric channels containing SUR1 and SUR2A may exist in neonatal ventricular myocytes (38.Yokoshiki H. Sunagawa M. Seki T. Sperelakis N. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, it is not easy to rule out indirect effects such as a reduction in SUR expression affecting the surface expression of Kir6.2. Our data are supported by other studies, however (35.Gross I. Toman A. Uhde I. Schwanstecher C. Schwanstecher M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These authors noted in passing that coexpression of SUR1 and SUR2B did not generate currents with the expected pharmacological properties if the two subunits could freely mix. To study the functional stoichiometry of channel activation, they had to use a chimera between SUR1 and SUR2B that was largely formed by SUR1. What are the potential mechanisms by which these SUR subunits are kept apart? The immunoprecipitation experiments showing a lack of biochemical interaction between SUR1 and SUR2 subunits suggest that it is not related to a trafficking defect whereby channel complexes containing more than one type of SUR subunit are prevented from reaching the plasma membrane. The most likely explanation is that SUR heteromultimers do not form due to an inability of different SUR subtypes to co-assemble and potentially this could be determined by SUR-SUR interactions. If each SUR molecule in the channel complex assembled with the tetramer of Kir6.0 subunits independently, then mixed heteromultimers would be expected. Intermolecular interactions between SUR subunits are not implausible as it has been shown a fusion protein of the first nucleotide-binding domain of SUR1 can form a tetramer pointing to a role of NBD1 in SUR assembly (52.Mikhailov M.V. Ashcroft S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3360-3364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The determinants on SUR molecules responsible for co-assembly and subunit compatibility is still an open question and requires further study. It also interesting that ABC transporters can function as oligomers to provide different pathways for the translocation of substrates across the membrane (53.Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3402) Google Scholar). An additional source of potential pharmacological complexity ofKATP channels may arise through assembly of the two splice variants of SUR2, SUR2A and SUR2B. There are also splice variants of SUR1 with distinct functional properties (54.Sakura H. Trapp S. Liss B. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 521: 337-350Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and similar considerations apply. We do not possess KATPchannel antibodies that discriminate between SUR2A and SUR2B (and SUR1 splice variants) and as such have not been able to determine whether co-assembly can occur. However, given that SUR2A and SUR2B are identical for all but the last 40 amino acids, it remains a possibility that these two subunits can co-assemble to form a functional channel. The identification of regions responsible for compatability would also shed light on this problem."

Since its discovery, PLA2has been a molecular target of extensive research because of its critical involvement in physiological and pathological events such as phospholipid turnover and production of proinflammatory lipid mediators (3.Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, a number of mammalian intracellular and extracellular PLA2s have been identified and classified into different families according to their biochemical features (4.Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Among them, sPLA2s have several common characteristics including a relatively low molecular mass (13–18 kDa), the presence of 6–8 disulfide bridges, and an absolute catalytic requirement for millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ (5.Tischfield J.A.

Given their potent enzymatic activities and enhanced expression in various inflammatory conditions, sPLA2s are thought to play crucial roles in the development of various disease states. For example, high levels of group IIA sPLA2 (sPLA2-IIA) were detected in the plasma of patients with sepsis, and sPLA2-IIA plays a critical role in the hydrolysis of lung surfactant phospholipids during the progression of acute lung injury (13.Vadas P.

We and other groups have shown that group X sPLA2 (sPLA2-X) possesses stronger hydrolyzing activity toward phosphatidylcholine than sPLA2-IIA and elicits marked release of arachidonic acid linked to the production of various lipid mediators in macrophages and colon cancer cells (15.Hanasaki K.

Arita H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PLA2R is a type I transmembrane protein with a molecular mass of 180 kDa. Its overall molecular organization is related to a unique member of the C-type animal lectin family (subgroup VI), which includes the macrophage mannose receptor (18.Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12156-12162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLA2R is composed of a large extracellular portion consisting of an N-terminal cystein-rich region, a fibronectin-like type II domain, a tandem repeat of eight carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs), and a short intracellular C-terminal region (19.Ishizaki J. Hanasaki K. Higashino K. Kishino J. Kikuchi N. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5897-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mice, group IB sPLA2(sPLA2-IB) was identified as the first endogenous ligand of PLA2R (20.Cupillard L. Mulherkar R. Gomez N. Kadam S. Valentin E. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7043-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, sPLA2-X was also identified as a high affinity ligand of PLA2R (21.Yokota Y. Higashino K. Nakano K. Arita H. Hanasaki K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although sPLA2-IIA can bind PLA2R with about 10-fold lower affinity compared with sPLA2-IB and -X, some inbred mouse strains possess a natural mutation in the sPLA2-IIA gene (5.Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17247-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 6.Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). We have shown that sPLA2-IB exerts various biological responses via binding to PLA2R, including cell proliferation, lipid mediator productions, and chemokinetic migration in various cell types (22.Arita H.

Furthermore, our recent analysis of PLA2R-deficient mice has revealed that PLA2R may play a role in the production of proinflammatory cytokines during the progression of endotoxic shock (25.Hanasaki K. Yokota Y. Ishizaki J. Itoh T. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32792-32797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Venomous snakes have PLA2 inhibitory proteins (PLIs) in their blood sera to protect them from leakage of their own venom PLA2s into their circulatory system (26.Inoue S. Kogaki K. Ikeda K. Samejima Y. Omori-Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian sPLA2s exhibit a wide variety of pathological functions via enzymatic activities or receptor-mediated responses; however, the existence of PLI molecules in mammalian circulation has not yet been demonstrated. In our recent analysis by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we found the presence of a soluble form of PLA2R (sPLA2R) in mouse plasma, although its biochemical features and biological significance has not been clarified yet (27.Yokota Y. Ikeda M. Higashino K. Nakano K. Fujii N. Arita H. Hanasaki K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present study, we definitely identified the sPLA2-binding protein in mouse sera as sPLA2R, which retains all of the extracellular domains of the cell-associated receptor. We found that circulating sPLA2R can block both the enzymatic activity and receptor binding activity of sPLA2-X. Thus, we report here that sPLA2R is the first example of circulating PLI in mammals.DISCUSSIONVenomous snakes have PLIs in their plasma to protect themselves from their own venomous PLA2s that elicit a wide variety of toxicities, such as neurotoxicity and myotoxicity (36.Kini R.M. Evans H.J. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 613-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are diverse types of sPLA2s that can be released outside of the cells and exist in the tissue fluids and blood plasma (3.Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study is the first to identify mouse sPLA2R as a circulating PLI for sPLA2s in mammals. Western blot analysis revealed that serum sPLA2R retained all of the extracellular domains of the membrane-bound form of the receptor, similar to rsPLA2R (Fig. 2). We have previously shown that rsPLA2R retained the same binding dissociation constant (Kd = 0.97 nm for sPLA2-IB) and ligand specificity as the membrane-bound receptor (17.Hanasaki K. Arita H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 37.Kishino J. Kawamoto K. Ishizaki J. Verheij H.M. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Scatchard plot analysis has revealed that rsPLA2R can bind one sPLA2 ligand per molecule, like the native cell surface receptor (37.Kishino J. Kawamoto K. Ishizaki J. Verheij H.M. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In fact, rsPLA2R protein strongly blocked the sPLA2-X binding to the membrane-bound receptor with an IC50 value of 1.2 nm (Fig. 4A), which coincided with the binding affinity of sPLA2-X to the cell surface PLA2R (21.Yokota Y. Higashino K. Nakano K. Arita H. Hanasaki K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present study, serum sPLA2R was found to possess binding activity for sPLA2-IB and sPLA2-X (Fig. 1). In addition, serum sPLA2R blocked the enzymatic activity and receptor binding activity of sPLA2-X (Figs. 3B and 4B). These findings demonstrate that serum sPLA2R has similar characteristics to rsPLA2R in terms of biochemical properties as well as functional activities and thus confirmed our previous estimation of the plasma sPLA2R concentration in normal mice with sandwich ELISA (0.13 nm), in which rsPLA2R was used as a conventional standard (27.Yokota Y. Ikeda M. Higashino K. Nakano K. Fujii N. Arita H. Hanasaki K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).We have previously reported that sPLA2-IB can elicit various biological responses possibly via PLA2R binding, such as proliferation and chemokinetic migration of vascular smooth muscle cells and potent vasoactive actions in cerebral arteries (17.Hanasaki K.

At the normal circulating level (0.13 nm), rsPLA2R can effectively block the enzymatic activity of sPLA2-X (0.14 nm) toward the substrate DPPC (Fig. 3A), and the prepared serum sPLA2R fractions (0.37 nm) were found to suppress the activity up to 70% (Fig. 3B). However, in mouse spleen cells, the inhibitory potency of rsPLA2R for sPLA2-X-induced arachidonic acid release was weaker compared with that in the DPPC hydrolysis, possibly because of the requirement of higher concentration of sPLA2-X for detection of the released fatty acids in intact cell systems. For the sPLA2-X binding, rsPLA2R was found to block up to 20% at the normal circulating concentration (Fig. 4A), and its inhibitory potency can be greatly enhanced at the concentration over 0.3 nm. In fact, the concentrated serum materials containing higher levels of sPLA2R (1.36 nm) could significantly block the sPLA2-X binding (Fig. 4B). It has been reported that the normal serum concentration of sPLA2-IB is 5.1 ng/ml (0.36 nm) in humans (40.Nishijima J. Okamoto M. Ogawa M. Kosaki G. Yamano T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although the normal plasma level of sPLA2-IB and sPLA2-X has not yet been examined in mice, these findings suggest that the circulating sPLA2R can play one of the endogenous inhibitors that block the biological functions of these sPLA2s in the normal conditions. In patients with acute pancreatitis and renal failure, increased systemic levels of sPLA2-IB have been observed (40.Nishijima J. Okamoto M. Ogawa M. Kosaki G. Yamano T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the plasma sPLA2R concentration is significantly elevated to up to 1.5-fold of the normal level during murine endotoxic shock (27.Yokota Y. Ikeda M. Higashino K. Nakano K. Fujii N. Arita H. Hanasaki K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), although this enhanced level is not enough for the effective suppression of the enzymatic activities and the receptor-mediated responses evoked by higher concentration of sPLA2s. Further analysis of the circulating sPLA2R and sPLA2s levels during various pathological states are required to establish the role of circulating sPLA2R as an endogenous inhibitor to protect the pathological functions of sPLA2s.In the plasma of various snakes, three distinct types of PLIs (PLI-α, -β, and -γ) have been identified. PLIα is a 75-kDa glycoprotein composed of a trimer of 20-kDa subunits having sequence homology to the CRD of C-type lectins and preferentially blocks group II acidic PLA2s (41.Okumura K. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, sPLA2R contains all of the extracellular domains of the membrane-bound receptor including the tandem repeat of eight CRD-like domains. Previous deletion experiments have demonstrated that three CRD-like domains (CRD3, CRD4, and CRD5) are representative of the sPLA2 binding activity (42.Higashino K. Ishizaki J. Kishino J. Ohara O. Arita H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 43.Nicolas J.P. Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28869-28873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, the CRD of PLIα present in the blood plasma of the Habu snake Trimeresurus flavoviridis has similarities with the CRD5 of PLA2R (28%) (6.Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Also, the soluble lung surfactant protein SP-A has been reported to have CRD that shares sequence homology with PLIα and blocks the Habu snake venom sPLA2 activity (44.Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Chander A. Beers M.F. Bates S.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Notably, SP-A can also bind to guinea pig sPLA2-IIA to suppress its enzymatic activity in contrast to the absence of inhibition of porcine sPLA2-IB (45.Arbibe L. Koumanov K. Vial D. Rougeot C. Faure G. Havet N. Longacre S. Vargaftig B.B. Bereziat G. Voelker D.R. Wolf C. Touqui L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1152-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, the binding affinity of SP-A for sPLA2-IIA has not yet been determined, and SP-A can also interact with other molecules, such as carbohydrate ligands and its high affinity receptor present in alveolar type II cells (46.Chroneos Z.C. Abdolrasulnia R. Whitsett J.A. Rice W.R. Shepherd V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16375-16383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In contrast, mouse PLA2R specifically recognizes sPLA2-IB and X with a high affinity (Kd of 1.43 and 4.6 nm, respectively) and does not possess lectin activity (20.Cupillard L. Mulherkar R. Gomez N. Kadam S. Valentin E. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7043-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, further studies are required to ascertain the biological roles of SP-A in the inhibition of sPLA2-IIA activity in the lung. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that other C-type lectin family members having CRD-like domains might also behave as physiological sPLA2 inhibitors in circulation and/or local tissue areas.Numerous types of soluble-form membrane receptors and cell adhesion molecules are known to exist in circulation as innate host defense systems against exaggerated receptor-mediated responses (47.Ehlers M.R. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10065-10074Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism underlying the production of soluble molecules is the alternative splicing event. In fact, the potential production of sPLA2R in human kidney was suggested based on the finding of an alternatively processed transcript encoding the ectodomains of PLA2R (48.Ancian P. Lambeau G. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8963-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, the existence of a soluble form of PLA2R has not been confirmed in humans, and we have not detected the alternatively spliced transcript in any of the tissues examined by Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis in mice (data not shown). In another setting, the ectodomains of many membrane proteins are released by regulated proteolytic cleavage (49.Werb Z. Yan Y. Science. 1998; 282: 1279-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, BB2516 and EDTA efficiently suppressed the proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound PLA2R in both intact PLA2R-CHO cells and the membrane preparations (Fig. 5). In particular, the IC50 value of BB2516 for inhibition of the cleavage of membrane-bound PLA2R was 4.7 nm, which corresponded well with its inhibitory potency on metalloproteinases activity in vitro (50.Barlaam B. Bird T.G. Lambert-Van Der Brempt C. Campbell D. Foster S.J. Maciewicz R. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4890-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because BB2516 can suppress all types of metalloproteinases (33.Rasmussen H.S. McCann P.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 75: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), the subtypes involved in the shedding process could not be identified in this study. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-converting enzyme, one of the members of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase family (51.Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar), is the first identified “sheddase” that is involved in the cleavage of TNF-α as well as various membrane-bound proteins including the TNF p75 receptor, L-selectin, and transforming growth factor-α (52.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). CHO cells are known to constitutively express active TNF-α-converting enzyme on the cell surface (53.Jolly-Tornetta C. Wolf B.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15282-15290Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential participation of TNF-α-converting enzyme in the cleavage of membrane-bound PLA2R, although further studies are needed to elucidate the metalloproteinases involved in vivo. A similar shedding mechanism has been observed with the mannose receptor, another member of the subgroup VI of the C-type lectin family (18.Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12156-12162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because its soluble form in mouse serum can be produced by cleavage of the membrane-bound form via a disintegrin and metalloproteinase or matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (54.Pomares L.M. Mahoney J.A. Kaposzta R. Linehan S.A. Stahl P.D. Gordon S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23376-23380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, the biological function as a soluble receptor after processing by metalloproteinases might be another critical implication for this family member. Among the metalloproteinases, MMP-14 (MT1-MMP) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) transcripts are constitutively expressed in the spleen where PLA2R and its ligands, sPLA2-IB and X, also exist (20.Cupillard L. Mulherkar R. Gomez N. Kadam S. Valentin E. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7043-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 27.Yokota Y. Ikeda M.

Nakano K. Fujii N. Ishizaki J. Arita H. Hanasaki K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 381: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, the expressions of MMP-14, MMP-13 (collagenase 3), and MMP-11 (stromelysin 1) transcripts were elevated in mouse spleen at 1 h after lipopolysaccharide injection (55.Pagenstecher A. Stalder A.K. Kincaid C.L. Volk B. Campbell I.L. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 197-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Upon endotoxin challenge, the expression of PLA2R mRNA was also elevated in the splenic lymphocytes and alveolar type II epithelial cells after 1 h, and the circulating sPLA2R level increased after 2–3 h (27.Yokota Y. Ikeda M. Higashino K. Nakano K. Fujii N. Arita H. Hanasaki K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a possible contribution of these MMPs to the production of sPLA2R in the tissues and circulation under physiological and pathological states. Further studies with specific inhibitors should help identify the metalloproteinase types involved.In conclusion, we have identified circulating sPLA2R as an endogenous inhibitor of sPLA2s in mice. In this study, the use of PLA2R-deficient mice enabled us to clearly show the existence of the receptor in serum. Because there is strict species specificity in the relationships between sPLA2 ligands and PLA2R, further studies on the identification of sPLA2R and its ligand in humans are required for elucidation of their physiological and pathological roles.

Since its discovery, PLA2has been a molecular target of extensive research because of its critical involvement in physiological and pathological events such as phospholipid turnover and production of proinflammatory lipid mediators (3.Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, a number of mammalian intracellular and extracellular PLA2s have been identified and classified into different families according to their biochemical features (4.Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Among them, sPLA2s have several common characteristics including a relatively low molecular mass (13–18 kDa), the presence of 6–8 disulfide bridges, and an absolute catalytic requirement for millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ (5.Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 19"
https://openalex.org/W2130169238,"We have recently demonstrated that anionic liposomes efficiently introduce foreign DNA into postmitotic neurons and other cell types (Lakkaraju, A., Dubinsky, J. M., Low, W. C., and Rahman, Y.-E. (2001) J. Biol. Chem.276, 32000–32007). To investigate the mechanism of liposome uptake, we followed the internalization of anionic liposome-encapsulated Cy3-labeled oligonucleotides (AL-Cy3ONs) by hippocampal neurons using confocal microscopy. Uptake of AL-Cy3ONs was widespread and time- and temperature-dependent, indicative of receptor-mediated endocytosis. The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) was crucial for anionic liposome endocytosis because the receptor-associated protein or an anti-LRP antibody inhibited internalization, and fibroblasts lacking LRP did not internalize AL-Cy3ONs. Using selective endocytosis inhibitors, we found that liposome endocytosis and intracellular transport required clathrin, dynamin, an intact cytoskeletal network, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. Cy3ONs did not significantly colocalize with recycling endosomal/lysosomal markers and entered neuronal nuclei within 1–3 h of incubation. Approximately 50% of the internalized liposomal phospholipids were recycled back to the cell surface, in keeping with the fluidity of their acyl chains. Liposome endocytosis did not require heparan sulfate proteoglycans or cause calcium influx into neurons. Thus, constitutive endocytosis of anionic liposomes by LRP utilizes only one component, in contrast to the more involved heparan sulfate proteoglycan-LRP pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We have recently demonstrated that anionic liposomes efficiently introduce foreign DNA into postmitotic neurons and other cell types (Lakkaraju, A., Dubinsky, J. M., Low, W. C., and Rahman, Y.-E. (2001) J. Biol. Chem.276, 32000–32007).

Thus, constitutive endocytosis of anionic liposomes by LRP utilizes only one component, in contrast to the more involved heparan sulfate proteoglycan-LRP pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Endocytosis in neurons has mainly been studied in the context of synaptic vesicle recycling (1.Ryan T.A. Smith S.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 983-989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and the regulation of neurotransmitter receptor numbers in the post-synaptic membrane (2.Man Y.H. Lin J.W. Ju W.H. Ahmadian G. Liu L. Becker L.E. Sheng M. Wang Y.T. Neuron. 2000; 25: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Constitutive endocytosis also occurs in neurons, albeit at a slower rate than in non-polarized or mitotically active cells. Growth factors and hormones modulate the rate of constitutive endocytosis of neurotransmitter receptors as well as receptors involved in nutrient acquisition and metabolism. Neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor and bone-derived neurotrophic factor increase both the recruitment of clathrin to the plasma membrane and the rate of constitutive endocytosis of transferrin in hippocampal neurons (3.Beattie E.C. Howe C.L. Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7325-7333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known, however, about the mechanisms of internalization of exogenous macromolecules such as phospholipids and nucleic acids in neurons. Insight into the interactions between neurons and these molecules would further our understanding of lipid and DNA transport pathways and provide potential therapeutic advantages. We have recently designed and developed an anionic liposome vector (composed of the anionic phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol and the zwitterionic phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidylcholine) for oligonucleotide delivery to neurons. Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the p53 tumor suppressor mRNA, delivered to neurons via anionic liposomes, efficiently protected hippocampal neurons from excitotoxic death by sequence-specific down-regulation of p53 protein expression (4.Lakkaraju A. Dubinsky J.M. Low W.C. Rahman Y.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32000-32007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).

Cy3ONs were encapsulated in anionic liposomes, and the uptake of these molecules by cultured rat hippocampal neurons was studied by confocal microscopy. Each stage in the endocytic pathway was retarded by biochemically interfering with specific proteins to determine the role of that protein in the internalization of liposomes. Here we demonstrate that anionic liposomes utilize constitutive endocytosis of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) to enter neurons, followed by intracellular transport and processing via a classical endocytic pathway. In addition to providing a mechanistic basis for oligonucleotide delivery by anionic liposomes, our results have also identified an efficient phospholipid transport pathway in neurons. This pathway appears to be a previously unrecognized, independent component of the more involved LRP-mediated endocytic pathway that has been implicated in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. An antisense oligonucleotide to the p53 mRNA was designed as previously described (4.Lakkaraju A. Dubinsky J.M. Low W.C. Rahman Y.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32000-32007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized and labeled at the 5′-end with Cy3 and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography to remove free dye (Integrated DNA Technologies). The oligonucleotides were reconstituted in sterile, nuclease-free Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 7.2) and stored at −20 °C. Encapsulation of oligonucleotides in anionic liposomes (87.5 mol % dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and 12.5 mol % dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol), their characterization, and complexation of oligonucleotides with cationic liposomes were all performed as previously detailed (4.Lakkaraju A. Dubinsky J.M. Low W.C. Rahman Y.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32000-32007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Liposomes labeled with N-Rh-DOPE were prepared in a manner identical to that described for liposomes encapsulating Cy3ONs, except that the lipid films contained 1–2.5 mol % N-Rh-DOPE, and the liposomes were prepared with buffer alone (i.e.without oligonucleotides). Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from neonatal rat pups (postnatal day 1 or 2) as previously described (4.Lakkaraju A. Dubinsky J.M. Low W.C. Rahman Y.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32000-32007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5.Dubinsky J.M. J.

Neurons were incubated with 2 μm Cy3ONs (free, encapsulated in anionic liposomes, or complexed with cationic liposomes) for 30 min at 37 °C unless stated otherwise. For low-temperature studies, neurons were incubated at 4 °C with AL-Cy3ONs for 10 min. The LRP-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line PEA-13 and its wild-type counterpart MEF-1 (6.Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I. Argraves W.S. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. Cell. 1995; 82: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. These cells were cultured on eight-chambered glass slides in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin and streptomycin with 10% Cosmic calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories) and incubated with AL-Cy3ONs for either 1 or 3 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation periods, uninternalized oligonucleotides, liposomes, or complexes were removed by several washes with Leibovitz L-15 medium and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The following agents were used to manipulate specific steps of the endocytic cycle: 0.45 m hyperosmolar sucrose (ICN Biochemicals); 1 μm FK506 (Calbiochem); and 100 nm wortmannin, 5 μg/ml nocodazole, 10 μg/ml cytochalasin D, 100 μg/ml heparin, and 100 μg/ml protamine sulfate (all from Sigma). The LRP inhibitor receptor-associated protein (RAP) and the LRP-blocking antibody R2629 were used at concentrations of 500 nm (7.Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Nerbonne J.M. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18521-18528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 100 μg/ml (6.Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I. Argraves W.S. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. Cell. 1995; 82: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), respectively. Cells were treated with the drugs, RAP, or R2629 for 10 min prior to incubation with AL-Cy3ONs for 30 min at 37 °C, fixed, and imaged. Intracellular fates of endocytosed liposomes and oligonucleotides were determined by comparing their intracellular distributions with those of Oregon Green 488-transferrin (OG-Tf) and Alexa 488-dextran (Molecular Probes, Inc.), used as markers for the recycling and lysosomal compartments, respectively. Neurons were incubated with AL-Cy3ONs and either 100 μg/ml OG-Tf for 0.5, 1, or 3 h or 1 mg/ml Alexa 488-dextran for 3 h. For phospholipid transport experiments, neurons were incubated with liposomes labeled with N-Rh-DOPE and either OG-Tf for 0.5, 1, or 3 h or 1 mg/ml Alexa-dextran for 3 h. These time points were chosen based on earlier work on the kinetics of transferrin and dextran endocytosis in hippocampal neurons (3.Beattie E.C. Howe C.L. Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7325-7333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Prekeris R. Foletti D.L. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10324-10337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Hemar A. Olivo J.C. Williamson E. Saffrich R. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9026-9034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation periods, cells were rinsed and fixed for imaging as described above. Imaging was performed on a Leica TCS 4D confocal microscope equipped with a mercury/xenon lamp and an argon/krypton laser. Cells were excited using the 488 nm laser line to detect OG-Tf and Alexa 488-dextran, and the emitted fluorescence was collected using a 515 nm long-pass filter. The 568 nm laser line was used to excite Cy3 and N-Rh-DOPE (LP590 emission). Cells were imaged at a plane midway between the substrate-attached plasma membrane and the top of the cell, such that neuronal nuclei were clearly identifiable. In some cases, the entire volume of the cell was scanned in 0.5-μm increments. For experiments with Alexa 488-dextran, planes in which the Alexa 488 label was most visible were chosen to enable identification of late endosomal/lysosomal structures. Optimal images were obtained by averaging 16 images in the line-scan mode at the same fixed gains for all experiments. For the colocalization experiments, the cell outlines for each set of fields were traced out manually in the corresponding bright-field image and then used to mask the fluorescence images (Metamorph, Universal Imaging Corp.). In each cell, the total fluorescence intensity was measured, and the percent of Cy3 or rhodamine label that colocalized with the Oregon Green 488 or Alexa 488 label was calculated. All the representative fluorescence images shown in the figures were equally contrast-enhanced using Adobe Photoshop®. Hippocampal neurons cultured on 35-mm glass-bottomed Petri dishes (5.Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 623-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were loaded with 4 μmfura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 30 min. The cultures were mounted in recording solution containing 139 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm NaHEPES, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 15 mm sucrose, and 0.1 mm glycine (pH 7.4) on the stage of an inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope. The recording solution also contained 1 μm tetrodotoxin to inhibit spontaneous firing of the neurons. Images were captured with a ×40 objective every 20 s (Metafluor, Universal Imaging Corp.) using the following wavelengths: fura-2, excitation at 340 ± 15 and 380 ± 15 nm attenuated with a 10% quartz neutral density filter and emission at 525 ± 25 nm; and N-Rh-DOPE, excitation at 565 ± 15 nm and emission at >590 nm (10.Brustovetsky N. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 103-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All images were corrected by subtracting a wavelength-specific background from an unpopulated portion of the dish. In preliminary experiments, the addition of recording solution or liposomes by manual pipetting caused a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+. To avoid this artifact, anionic liposomes labeled with N-Rh-DOPE were perfused onto the neurons at a rate of 1 ml/min for 10–15 min. Neurons were incubated with 100 μl of liposomes in recording solution (as described above) for 3 h with or without 500 nm RAP. The medium overlying the cells was first centrifuged at 320 × g for 8 min to remove cell debris, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 15 min at 25 °C in a Beckman ultracentrifuge to recover the liposomes (11.Johnson J.E. Giorgione J. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11360-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The liposome pellet was resuspended in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, and an aliquot was analyzed using the highly sensitive 3-(4-carboxybenzoyl)quinoline-2-carboxaldehyde (CBQCA) protein assay kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) to determine whether any proteins secreted into the medium bound to liposomes. Fluorescence associated with any protein bound to the liposomes labeled by the CBQCA reagent was detected using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55 fluorometer. Incubation of hippocampal neurons with anionic liposomes containing 2 μm Cy3ONs for 30 min at 37 °C resulted in the localization of the labeled oligonucleotides in vesicular cytoplasmic structures, but not in the nucleus (Fig. 1 a). After a 1-h incubation, diffuse Cy3 fluorescence was observed in the nucleus (Fig. 1 b). The intensity of the diffuse nuclear label increased after 3 h, and portions of the cytoplasm often contained uniform Cy3 fluorescence, in addition to the punctate label (Fig. 1 c). Virtually all the neurons examined under the microscope and/or imaged exhibited Cy3 fluorescence 30 min after incubation with anionic liposomes. Uptake of anionic liposomes was greatly reduced at 4 °C, with Cy3 fluorescence seen only at the cell surface, indicating binding of liposomes to the plasma membrane, but not internalization (Fig. 1 d). The time- and temperature-dependent uptake of anionic liposomes containing Cy3ONs suggested that liposome internalization into neurons occurred by endocytosis and was possibly receptor-mediated. To identify the cellular elements required for liposome uptake, we inhibited various steps in the endocytic pathway. Fig. 2 depicts the incidence of intracellular Cy3 fluorescence in neurons following various experimental manipulations.Figure 2Comparison of uptake of Cy3-labeled oligonucleotides encapsulated in anionic liposome across all experiments.

To determine whether clathrin-coated pits are involved in the uptake of anionic liposomes, hyperosmolar sucrose was used to disrupt clathrin assemblies (12.Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Treatment of neurons with 0.45 m sucrose completely prevented internalization of anionic liposomes containing Cy3ONs (Fig. 3 b) compared with cells treated with AL-Cy3ONs alone (Fig. 3 a). This confirmed that neuronal uptake of liposomes was receptor-mediated because hyperosmolarity inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis, but does not interfere with nonspecific fluid-phase endocytosis (13.Oka J.A. Christensen M.D. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12016-12024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clathrin-dependent endocytosis involving accessory proteins such as the GTPase dynamin, amphiphysin, and synaptojanin plays a critical role in synaptic vesicle recycling at nerve terminals (14.Brodin L. Low P. Shupliakov O. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Dynamin and amphiphysin need to be dephosphorylated by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase (calcineurin) to interact with one another and the lipid bilayer (15.Lai M.M. Luo H.R. Burnett P.E. Hong J.J. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34017-34020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We used a calcineurin inhibitor (FK506) to study the role of dynamin in anionic liposome internalization. Treatment of neurons with FK506 prior to the addition of AL-Cy3ONs significantly decreased liposome endocytosis (Fig. 3 c), providing further evidence that liposomes are internalized in neurons via clathrin-coated pits. LRP, a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene family, is highly expressed in the mammalian central nervous system and has been implicated in the endocytosis of several unrelated ligands (7.Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Nerbonne J.M. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18521-18528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A major function of lipoprotein receptors is the regulation of lipoprotein uptake and metabolism (16.Willnow T.E. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining with an antibody to LRP confirmed that this receptor was highly expressed in our hippocampal neuronal cultures (see Supplemental Material). To determine whether LRP is involved in the endocytosis of anionic liposomes, we blocked LRP using RAP, which is a potent inhibitor of all known ligand interactions of LRP (7.Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Nerbonne J.M. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18521-18528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RAP binds with high affinity to the heavy chain of LRP on multiple ligand-binding domains and induces a conformational change in the receptor, thus interfering with ligand binding (17.Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When neurons were incubated with AL-Cy3ONs in the presence of RAP, both binding and internalization of anionic liposomes were inhibited. Note the complete absence of Cy3 fluorescence both on the cell surface and within the RAP-treated neurons (Fig. 4 b) compared with treatment with AL-Cy3ONs alone (Fig. 4 a). Further evidence for the involvement of LRP in anionic liposome endocytosis was obtained when preincubation of neurons with the neutralizing LRP antibody R2629 (6.Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I. Argraves W.S. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. Cell. 1995; 82: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) also prevented AL-Cy3ON uptake (Fig. 4 c). Last, we compared the endocytosis of AL-Cy3ONs in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines that either expressed LRP (MEF-1) or lacked the receptor (PEA-13). After a 1-h incubation, almost all MEF-1 cells displayed robust Cy3 fluorescence (Fig. 5 a), in contrast to the faint signal seen in PEA-13 cells (Fig. 5 b). Following a 3-h incubation, Cy3 fluorescence was visible in the PEA-13 cultures at lower intensity than in the MEF-1 cells, indicating that liposomes were being taken up by the PEA-13 cells, albeit with very slow kinetics. In contrast to the MEF-1 cultures, where all the cells examined had the Cy3 label, only 50–60% of the PEA-13 cells exhibited Cy3 fluorescence after 3 h (Fig. 5, compare c and d). Several LRP ligands, including α2-macroglobulin, apoE, and HIV Tat protein, bind HSPGs on the cell surface prior to being internalized by LRP. Consequently, RAP does not inhibit binding of HIV Tat to the plasma membrane, but inhibits its internalization and subsequent degradation (18.Liu Y. Jones M. Hingtgen C.M. Bu G. Laribee N. Tanzi R.E. Moir R.D. Nath A. He J.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). To determine whether HSPGs are necessary for liposome endocytosis by LRP, we incubated neurons with AL-Cy3ONs along with 100 μg/ml heparin or protamine sulfate. Heparin is a specific inhibitor of HSPGs, and protamine competes with LRP ligands for HSPG-binding sites (19.Narita M. Bu G. Olins G.M. Higuchi D.A. Herz J. Broze G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24800-24804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Neither heparin (Figs. 2 and6 a) nor protamine (Fig. 2) altered the level of Cy3 fluorescence within neurons after 30 min of incubation, indicating that HSPGs are not required for anionic liposome endocytosis by LRP. To determine whether endogenous proteins secreted by neurons can bind liposomes and act as intermediaries between liposomes and LRP, we measured protein binding to liposomes after a 3-h incubation with neurons. Incubations were carried out in either the absence or presence of 500 nm RAP to increase the possibility of protein-bound liposomes being recovered from the medium. The amount of protein detected by the CBQCA assay did not significantly differ between the untreated and RAP-treated controls and liposome-treated conditions (one-way analysis of variance, p = 0.5) (Table I). As a positive control, liposomes were incubated with poly-l-lysine (lysine/lipid phosphate charge ratios of 0.6 and 2), and 100% of the added polylysine was detected in the liposome pellet (data not shown). As the amine moiety on the choline head group of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine was found to interact with the CBQCA dye, standard curves with bovine serum albumin were constructed in solutions containing liposomes, and the samples were diluted to minimize lipid interference. We were able to detect 10 ng of exogenously added bovine serum albumin (data not shown), indicating that within the limits of sensitivity of this assay, no endogenous proteins from cultured neurons bound liposomes.Table IAnalysis of endogenous protein binding to anionic liposomesConditionProtein recovered from liposome pelletngNo treatment37.484 ± 11Anionic liposomes36.955 ± 10500 nm RAP44.911 ± 4.9Anionic liposomes + 500 nm RAP40.850 ± 13Protein amounts were determined by the CBQCA assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are presented as means ± S.D.

Recent studies on cortical neurons and hippocampal slices have suggested a role for LRP in synaptic neurotransmission (20.Bacskai B.J. Xia M.Q. Strickland D.K. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11551-11556Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21.Zhuo M. Holtzman D.M. Li Y. Osaka H. DeMaro J. Jacquin M. Bu G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 542-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of activated α2-macroglobulin to cortical neurons caused a Ca2+ influx that was both spatially and temporally discrete. Only ligands that bind LRP at multiple sites were capable of eliciting this calcium response, indicating that receptor dimerization was essential. To examine whether the endocytosis of anionic liposomes via LRP causes Ca2+ influx into neurons, we studied neuronal calcium influx during a continuous perfusion of liposomes labeled with N-Rh-DOPE. Anionic liposomes did not evoke a calcium response (Fig. 6 b), although they were endocytosed as evidenced by rhodamine fluorescence in the neurons after liposome perfusion (Fig. 6 c). Microtubule-dependent movement is a predominant means of axonal and dendritic transport in neurons (22.de Hoop M.J. Dotti C.G. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1993; 17: 85-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether intracellular trafficking of AL-Cy3ONs requires an intact microtubule network, we used nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules in hippocampal neurons. When neurons were incubated with anionic liposomes in the presence of nocodazole, the Cy3 label was found only at the edges of the cell and on the plasma membrane (Fig. 7 b). Although an actin-based framework is required for the organization of clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface, the role of actin in receptor-mediated endocytosis is still unclear (23.Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 24.Lamaze C. Fujimoto L.M. Yin H.L. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20332-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in liposome endocytosis was studied using cytochalasin D to depolymerize actin filaments. In contrast to nocodazole-treated neurons, no Cy3 fluorescence was detected in neurons incubated with AL-Cy3ONs in the presence of cytochalasin D (Fig. 7 c). This confirms previous reports that the cytochalasin D-sensitive step precedes the nocodazole-sensitive step in receptor-mediated endocytosis (25.Maples C.J. Ruiz W.G. Apodaca G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6741-6751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Activation of the PI 3-kinase family of lipid kinases is involved in the rearrangement of cytoskeletal proteins, vesicle sorting, and receptor recycling during endocytosis. Specific inhibitors such as wortmannin have been widely used to study the potential sites of PI 3-kinase function in the endocytic pathway (26.Martys J.L. Wjasow C. Gangi D.M. Kielian M.C. McGraw T.E. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10953-10962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To determine whether PI 3-kinase activity is necessary for neuronal endocytosis of anionic liposomes, neurons were incubated with wortmannin prior to the addition of AL-Cy3ONs. A low level of cell-associated Cy3 fluorescence was observed in neurons pretreated with wortmannin for 10 min (Fig. 7 d), and increasing wortmannin exposure time beyond 10 min not only abolished the internalization of liposomes, but also caused formation of vacuoles associated with the plasma membrane (data not shown). Other studies have also documented a temporal correlation between exposure to wortmannin and drastic changes in organelle morphology (27.Shpetner H. Joly M. Hartley D. Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To determine the identity of vesicular structures containing the Cy3 label, we incubated neurons with AL-Cy3ONs along with either Oregon Green 488-transferrin as a marker for the recycling endosomal pathway or Alexa 488-dextran as a fluid-phase marker for"

In vivo footprinting analysis suggests that a protein complex, called a prereplication complex (pre-RC),1 is formed in the G1 phase on each origin of chromosomal DNA replication (6Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). At the G1/S boundary, cyclin-dependent protein kinases activate the pre-RC to form a preinitiation complex that then initiates DNA replication in a temporally specific manner (1Diffley J.F.

Thus, the molecular mechanism of formation of the pre-RC and its regulation are important for understanding how the cell cycle regulates initiation of chromosomal DNA replication. Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that at least four kinds of proteins are components of the pre-RC, including the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6p, and the six minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins (9Bell S.P.

Genetic analysis using mutant S. cerevisiae strains suggested that Cdc6p first binds to ORC, which is bound to origins of chromosomal DNA replication throughout the cell cycle, and then MCM is recruited onto the origins to form the pre-RC (13Detweiler C.S. Li J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 753-763PubMed Google Scholar, 15Liang C. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 17Tye B.K. Annu. Rev.

But the precise molecular mechanism of pre-RC formation, including how the MCM complex is recruited on chromatin that is already occupied by ORC and Cdc6p, is unknown. Recently, Cdt1 was identified in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Xenopus laevis as another component required for formation of the pre-RC (20Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P.

The amount of Cdc6p fluctuates during cell cycle, but ORC and MCM remain constant (6Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A.

There are at least two possibilities for the function of Cdc6p ATPase in pre-RC formation; one is contribution to its binding to ORC, and the other is to recruit the MCM protein complex onto origins of DNA replication. We recently established an in vitro system reconstituted from purified S. cerevisiae proteins and DNA fragments containing origins of replication to study ORC and Cdc6p interactions (32Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, we demonstrated that the ATP binding activity (and most likely the ATPase activity) of Cdc6p is not necessary for its binding to ORC. We found, however, that Cdc6p used its ATPase activity to alter the conformation of ORC. Based on these results, we suggested that Cdc6p changes the conformation of ORC using its ATPase activity, and together, this remodeled complex cooperates, perhaps with Cdt1 (Tah11p), to recruit the MCM complex (32Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar). This model is supported by genetic evidence showing that Cdc6p with a defective Walker A motif could not recruit MCM proteins onto chromatin in vivo (18Weinreich M. Liang C. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 33Perkins G. Diffley J.F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, because this mutation may affect its ATP binding activity, we could not be certain that the ATPase activity was involved in loading MCM onto chromatin in vivo. The sensor 1 and 2 regions are thought to be important for the ATPase activity of AAA+ family proteins (27Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray structure analysis of Escherichia coli HslU protein, which also belongs to AAA+ family, showed that a conserved arginine (Arg393) in sensor 2 region can interact with the γ phosphate of ATP (34Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Recently, the x-ray structure ofPyrobaculum aerophilum Cdc6p was reported (35Liu J. Smith C.L. DeRyckere D. DeAngelis K. Martin G.S. Berger J.M. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and the data suggested that the sensor 1 region interacts with the γ phosphate of ATP (35Liu J. Smith C.L. DeRyckere D. DeAngelis K. Martin G.S. Berger J.M. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These sensor regions are conserved in AAA+proteins and putatively detect the status of ATP versus ADP in the nucleotide-binding site and may regulate ATPase activity of these proteins (36Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 37Lenzen C.U. Steinmann D. Whiteheart S.W. Weis W.I. Cell. 1998; 94: 525-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Based on these previous findings, we searched for highly conserved amino acid residues in the sensor 1 and 2 regions of S. cerevisiae Cdc6p and found that Asn263 and Arg332 located in sensor 1 and sensor 2 regions, respectively, are important for its function in vivo. Genetic analysis of yeast strains that express mutant Cdc6p (N263A and R332E) showed that each mutant prolonged S phase because of inefficient loading of MCM onto chromatin. Biochemical analysis using purified mutant Cdc6p (N263A and R332E) showed that they were unable to change the conformation of ORC. These data further support the suggestion that Cdc6p recruits MCM onto DNA by changing the conformation of the ORC by using its ATPase activity. S. cerevisiae strains are listed in Table I.

Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Uracil-containing single-stranded DNA of M13 phage, bearing the SphI-XbaI fragment of the wild type CDC6 gene, was hybridized with an oligonucleotide primer that contained the desired mutation. The complementary DNA strand was synthesized in vitro, and the resultant double-stranded DNA was introduced into JM109. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The SphI-XbaI DNA fragment of the double-stranded DNA was used to replace that of pMW71 (18Weinreich M. Liang C. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), which contained CDC6 and LEU2 genes (derivatives of pRS415). The resultant plasmids, named pNT11, pNT12, pNT13, and pNT14, contain mutant cdc6 genes with N263A, K322E, R332E, and R339E, respectively. To construct plasmids for integration into yeast chromosomes, theHindIII-SacI DNA fragment of pNT11 or pNT13 was introduced into the HindIII and SacI sites of pRS405. The resultant plasmids were digested by HpaI and introduced in the K4055 strain to construct NT101 or NT102 (see TableI). YB209 strain was used for plasmid shuffling experiments as described (39Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). pMW71, pNT11, pNT12, pNT13, and pNT14 were transformed into YB209 by the lithium-acetate method (40St D. Gietz J.A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). The transformant was purified, spread on plates containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid without leucine, and incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. The cells were grown at 30 °C in the absence of methionine to an A600 of 0.3, and then methionine (final concentration, 20 mm) was added to repress expression of the wild type CDC6 gene on the chromosomes of K4055, YB502, NT101, and NT102. In the G2 block and α-factor release experiment, nocodazole was twice added (final concentration, 3 μg/ml) with an interval of 1 h. Methionine (final concentration, 20 mm) was added to the culture, and incubation was continued for 2 h in the presence of nocodazole. Finally, the cultures were washed with water and resuspended in SC medium containing α-factor (5 μg/ml) and 20 mmmethionine for further incubation. The samples were prepared as previously described (15Liang C. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with water, and fixed in 70% ethanol for 12 h. Then the cells were again pelleted, resuspended in 50 mm sodium citrate, sonicated for 1 min, treated with 0.25 mg/ml RNase A for 1 h at 50 °C, and then treated with 1 mg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 50 °C. DNA was stained with 50 μg/ml of propidium iodide, and then 20,000 cells from each sample were scanned with a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson). Pulse-field gel electrophoresis experiments were done as described (41Schwartz D.C. Cantor C.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 67-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar, 42Carle G.F. Olson M.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5647-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times with solution I (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1.2m sorbitol, 20 mm EDTA), resuspended in solution II (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1.2 m sorbitol, 20 mm EDTA, 5% β-mercaptoethanol), and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then suspended in solution III (0.1m sodium citrate/citric acid, 1.2 m sorbitol, 10 mm EDTA) and mixed with 2.4% agarose (Bio-Rad; low melt preparative grade). The resultant solidified blocks of agarose were transferred to solution IV (0.1 m sodium citrate/citric acid, 1.2 m sorbitol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% zymolyase) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Blocks of agarose were washed with solution III, then washed with solution I once, and incubated with solution V (0.1 m EDTA, 1% sodium lauroylsarcosine, 0.1% proteinase K) for 24 h at 50 °C. After washing with 0.2 m EDTA, the samples were applied to a 1.5% agarose slab and subjected to electrophoresis for 15.2 h at 300 V, 10 °C with a 50–100 switch interval. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide and observed under an UV illuminator. The samples were processed into soluble and insoluble (chromatin) fractions after Triton X-100 lysis of yeast spheroplasts, as previously described (15Liang C. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts (total protein) of insoluble fractions were subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed by using monoclonal antibodies against Mcm2p (Mcm2–18), Orc3p (SB3), and Cdc6p (9H8/5) (32Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type ORC was expressed in Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus and was purified as described (43Bell S.P. Mitchell J. Leber J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 83: 563-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 44Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-Cdc6p fusion proteins were purified fromE. coli cells (DH5α) transformed with overproducing plasmids 3M. Weinreich and B. Stillman, unpublished observation. by use of glutathione-agarose column chromatography (45Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed by digestion with lysozyme and centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to glutathione-agarose chromatography as specified by Sigma. GST-Cdc6p was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione, and the protein extract was dialyzed to remove glutathione (buffer A: 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol). The pull-down assay for the detection of ORC and Cdc6p interaction was performed as described (32Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar). ORC, GST-Cdc6p, and ARS1 DNA fragments (290-base pair fragments generated by PCR) were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.2 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgOAc, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm ATP. The mixture was diluted with the same buffer but without bovine serum albumin, and then 40 μl of glutathione agarose beads (Sigma, 50% slurry) were added. After 2 h of rotation at 4 °C, the beads were collected, suspended in SDS sample buffer, applied to 7.5% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS, and subjected to electrophoresis, and then proteins were immunoblotted with the anti-Orc5p monoclonal antibody, SB5 (32Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar). The trypsin digestion assay for detecting conformational changes in the ORC was done as previously described (32Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation of ORC, Cdc6p, and ARS1 DNA fragments for 10 min at 30 °C, trypsin was added and samples were further incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as above, and immunoblotted with anti-Orc6p monoclonal antibody, SB 49 (32). Sensor 1 and sensor 2 regions of S. cerevisiae Cdc6p were mapped to Thr253–Asp266 and Gly329–Pro366, based on sequence similarity to other proteins belonging to the AAA+ family (27Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These regions are essential for ATPase activities in this family of proteins (27Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and therefore conserved and essential amino acid residues in these regions (including their proximal regions) of S. cerevisiae Cdc6p were identified. Of particular interest, asparaginine and threonine in the sensor 1 region and basic amino acid residues in the sensor 2 region are important for the ATPase activity of AAA+ family proteins (27Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Residues Asn263, Lys322, Arg332, and Arg339 of S. cerevisiae Cdc6p are conserved among Cdc6p from various species (Fig.1). Using site-directed mutagenesis, four mutant cdc6 genes were constructed (cdc6N263A, cdc6K322E,cdc6R332E, and cdc6R339E). Each mutant gene was inserted into a plasmid that contained the LEU2 gene, and the plasmid was transformed into strain YB209 that contained a chromosomal CDC6 gene deletion and an alternative wild typeCDC6 gene on a plasmid with the URA3 selectable maker (46Liang C. Weinreich M. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 81: 667-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). When the transformant was grown on agar plates containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid, the URA3 plasmid was selected against and lost, causing cells to rely solely on the mutant cdc6gene (plasmid shuffling analysis). Cells that expressed Cdc6N263Ap or Cdc6R332Ep grew slowly and formed small colonies only after 4 days of incubation (Fig. 2A and data not shown). The size of colonies and doubling rate of cells that expressed Cdc6pR322E or Cdc6pR339E were indistinguishable from those of cells containing wild type Cdc6p (data not shown). These results showed that Asn263 and Arg332, but not Arg322 and Arg339, were important for the function of Cdc6p in vivo, and suggested that the ATPase activity of Cdc6p is involved in some essential steps of eukaryotic DNA replication. Cultures of cells expressing both the wild type Ccd6p and Cdc6N263Ap (YB209 transformed with pNT101) showed slow growth, with a doubling time about twice that of the wild type strain. Even slower growth was seen when the mutant cdc6 gene was introduced into cells on a high copy number plasmid (data not shown), suggesting that N263A has a weak dominant negative phenotype. In a recent publication, a similar dominant negative phenotype was reported for this mutant when the protein was over expressed from a strong promoter (47Schepers A. Diffley J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We did not observe this phenotype for other mutations, including R332E. To examine the function of Cdc6N263Ap and Cdc6R332Ep in vivo, a system in which the expression of Cdc6p could be regulated was necessary. In the K4055 strain, the original CDC6 gene is deleted, and another CDC6 gene under the control of the MET3promoter is integrated into the chromosome. Thus, in this strain, the wild type CDC6 can be repressed by adding methionine to the culture medium. cdc6N263A and cdc6R332E expressed from the endogenous CDC6 promoter were integrated into theLEU2 locus of the K4055 strain to construct strains NT101 and NT102, respectively (Table I). NT101 and NT102 did not form colonies on agar plates containing 20 mm methionine after 2 days of incubation (Fig.2B). However, these two strains formed small colonies on methionine-containing plates after a further 2 days of incubation (data not shown). Thus, in the presence of methionine, NT101 and NT102 grew more slowly than the wild type control strain (YB502), possibly because of prolongation of a distinct phase of cell cycle. To determine whether a phase of cell cycle was prolonged in NT101 and NT102 in the presence of methionine, exponentially growing YB502, NT101, and NT102 cells in methionine-free SC medium were transferred to SC medium containing 20 mm methionine, and the cellular DNA content was determined periodically by FACS analysis. Compared with wild type cells, in NT101 and NT102, the proportion of cells with an approximate 2 C DNA content at first increased over time (Fig.3A), and eventually, a small but significant number of cells accumulated with an approximate 1 C DNA content (data not shown). These data suggest that cell cycle did not stop at a distinct stage but that some stages were prolonged. FACS analysis was also performed on cells that were blocked at the G2 phase by nocodazole and then released. The cells were incubated with methionine in the presence of nocodazole and then released into nocodazole-free SC medium containing 20 mmmethionine. The results showed that NT101 and NT102 strains could be arrested in G2 with nocodazole, but when released they entered the G1 and S phase and then gradually accumulated with nearly 2C DNA content (Fig. 3B). The FACS analysis (Fig. 3) suggested that S or G2 phases of the cell cycle were prolonged in NT101 (N263A) and NT102 (R332E) cells when methionine was present to repress expression of the wild type Cdc6p. In other words, the proportion of cells in S or G2 was increased by expression of the mutant Cdc6p. To distinguish between these two phases, we performed pulse-field gel electrophoresis analysis. Chromosomal DNA from S phase cells does not enter this type of gel because of lack of condensation of chromatin and the presence of DNA replication intermediates, in contrast to DNA from other phases of the cell cycle (48Hennessy K.M. Lee A. Chen E. Botstein D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 958-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We confirmed that chromosomal DNA from S phase cells (hydroxyurea-treated cells) but not that from other phases of cell cycle (α-factor treated cells or nocodazole treated cells) remained in the wells of the gel even after very long (15.2 h at 300 V) electrophoresis (Fig. 4, comparelane 3 with lanes 1, 2, and4). YB502, NT101, and NT102 cells were incubated in SC medium containing 20 mm methionine for 10 h, and identical amounts of their chromosomal DNA were analyzed (Fig. 4, lanes 5–7). Compared with the wild type YB502 strain, a smaller proportion of chromosomal DNA from NT101 (N332A) and NT102 (R332E) cells entered into the gel. The data suggested that the proportion of cells in S phase was higher in NT101 and NT102 than in YB502. We conclude that cells expressin"

Despite decades of effort to control malaria, it is still the most devastating parasitic disease of humans, killing millions of children each year. This is due in part to continuous transmission of the malaria parasite by vector mosquitoes. Malaria transmission is a result of complex multistep development of the parasite in the insect. Upon feeding on an infected host, mosquitoes acquire gametocytes, which in turn produce female (macrogamete) and male (microgamete) gametes. These gametes mate to form zygotes, which transform into ookinetes (1.Shahabuddin M. Parasitology. 1998; 116: S83-S93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transition from zygotes to ookinetes is a complex cellular and biochemical process. Stage-specific proteins such as P28 and chitinase are expressed as the parasites transform from round zygotes to slender motile ookinetes (1.Shahabuddin M. Parasitology. 1998; 116: S83-S93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Development to motile ookinetes is crucial for malaria transmission, giving the malaria parasites the ability to egress from the ingested blood meal and cross the midgut wall and develop as oocysts (1.Shahabuddin M. Parasitology. 1998; 116: S83-S93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within oocysts, the parasites multiply into thousands of sporozoites. A week or two later, the oocysts burst and release the sporozoites. The sporozoites then invade the salivary glands from which they can be transmitted to the vertebrate host during the next blood meal. This extensive developmental program, including repeated shape changes, implies the activation of specific signaling pathways in each stage. Shape change is required for the precise functions of various cells such as lymphocytes (2.Pettit E.J. Fay F.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 949-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), neutrophils (3.Coates T.D. Watts R.G. Hartman R. Howard T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), macrophages (4.Yin H.L. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1988; 9: 169-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and platelets (5.Blockmans D. Deckmyn H. Vermylen J. Blood Rev. 1995; 9: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) in mammals as well as in protozoans such asDictyostelium, Euglena, and Entamoeba(6.Newell P.C. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 445-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7.Lonergan T.A. Williamson L.C. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 89: 365-371PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Carbajal M.E. Manning-Cela R. Pina A. Franco E. Meza I. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The mosquito stages of malaria parasite comprise a unique example of the biology of cell shape because zygotes are round cells that develop into elongated ookinetes, which then round up again when they become oocysts. These transitions in cell morphology define the functional properties of each stage of the parasite: invasive stages are polarized and elongated cells such as ookinetes and sporozoites, whereas noninvasive or vegetative stages are round and nonpolarized cells such as zygotes and oocysts. In most cells, calcium-dependent signaling pathways drive shape changes (9.Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4491) Google Scholar). In Plasmodium, calcium-triggered changes have been described earlier. Examples include invasion of erythrocytes and intraerythrocytic development of merozoites (10.McCallum-Deighton N. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11.Garcia C.R. Parasitol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Also the presence of specific calcium storage compartments and calcium transport mechanisms in infected erythrocytes has been reported (13.Desai S.A. McCleskey E.W. Schlesinger P.H. Krogstad D.J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1996; 54: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,14.Garcia C.R. Ann S.E. Tavares E.S. Dluzewski A.R. Mason W.T. Paiva F.B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, which are able to elevate intracellular calcium concentration, has been demonstrated during gametogenesis (15.Kawamoto F. Fujioka H. Murakami R. Syafruddin Hagiwara M. Ishikawa T. Hidaka H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 60: 101-107PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Martin S.K. Jett M. Schneider I. J. Parasitol. 1994; 80: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Different components of calcium signaling systems such as calcium-dependent protein kinases, Ca2+-ATPases, and noncytosolic EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins from Plasmodium falciparumhave been purified and cloned, but the role of these pathways in parasite development or infection is not fully understood (11.Garcia C.R. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 488-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the vector mosquitoes, although cyclic nucleotides and calcium were shown to affect gametogenesis, no involvement of a signal transduction pathway has been attributed to any of the subsequent stages (13.Desai S.A.

In this study we investigated the role of the calcium/calmodulin (CaM) 1The abbreviations used are: CaMcalmodulinAIPautocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptideCaMKCa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinaseKN-92(2-[N-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)]amino-N-(4-chlorocinnamyl)-N-methylbenzylamine)KN-932-[N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)]amino-N-(4-chlorocinnamyl)-N-methylbenzylamineMyrmyristoylMAPTAM1,2-bis-(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)ethane tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl estersignaling pathway in the control of zygote to ookinete differentiation and the role of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) in this process. Our data suggest that the calcium/CaM pathway controls morphological changes during zygote to ookinete differentiation. calmodulin autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (2-[N-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)]amino-N-(4-chlorocinnamyl)-N-methylbenzylamine) 2-[N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)]amino-N-(4-chlorocinnamyl)-N-methylbenzylamine myristoyl 1,2-bis-(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)ethane tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester P. gallinaceum strain 8A was maintained in White Leghorn chickens by serial passage. Processing of infected chicken blood for zygote preparation was performed as described previously (17.Kaushal D.C. Carter R. Rener J. Grotendorst C.A. Miller L.H. Howard R.J. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 2557-2562PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, infected blood was obtained by heart puncture of chicken and immediately diluted in suspended animation buffer (9 mmglucose, 8 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 138 mm NaCl) and centrifuged to separate cells from serum. Packed cells were resuspended in exflagellation medium (75% suspended animation buffer, 8% heat-inactivated chicken serum, 26 mmNaHCO3, 0.1 mm xanthurenic acid) for 45 min. The fertilized zygotes, macrogametes, and blood cells were separated from red blood cells on a cushion of Ficoll-PaqueTM Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Chicken white blood cells were removed by agglutinating with wheat germ agglutinin (0.1 mg/ml). The parasites were finally resuspended in ookinete medium (M199 medium with glutamine (Invitrogen) supplemented with glucose and penicillin/streptomycin) to a concentration of 4 × 106 cells/ml. Preparations routinely yielded 1–10 × 107 parasites with ookinete differentiation efficiency of 50–90%. Unless otherwise stated, Me2SO was used as the control in all experiments because it was the solvent for all drugs used in this study. The final concentration of Me2SO was never more than 0.1%; this concentration does not influence the rate of zygote to ookinete differentiation (data not shown). In experiments with protein kinase inhibitors, these drugs were initially used at the following final concentrations, which correspond to their publishedKi values for mammalian cells: bistyrphostin (inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity, Ki 0.4 μm), LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, Ki 1.6 μm), roscovitine (inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases; the IC50 of 0.7 μm was used as a reference because at this concentration roscovitine inhibits most p34cdc2, p33cdk2, and p33cdk5-cyclin complexes), H-89 (inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase,Ki 0.048 μm), H-9 (inhibitor of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase, Ki 0.87 μm), bisindolylmaleimide I (inhibitor of protein kinase C, Ki 0.01 μm), ML-7 (inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase, Ki 0.3 μm), KN-93 (inhibitor of CaM kinases, Ki 0.37 μm) (18.Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and KN-92 (an ineffective KN-93 analog). Autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide (AIP) (KKALRRQEAVDAL) and its myristoylated form Myr-AIP are peptides derived from the CaM kinase II substrate autocamtide-2, but alanine is substituted for threonine at the 9-position, which turns them into highly specific and potent inhibitors of CaM kinase II (19.Ishida A. Kameshita I. Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). All the above drugs as well as calcium and CaM antagonists EGTA, A23187, MAPTAM, TMB-8, W-7, and calmidazolium were obtained from CalBiochem-NovaBiochem Corp. Once zygotes were obtained, drugs were immediately added to the differentiation medium. The following day, samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 700 × g to concentrate the cells. The number of zygotes and ookinetes were estimated in each sample by direct counting in a Neubauer chamber. The values obtained in controls (only Me2SO-treated cells), referred to as 100% differentiation, were used as a reference for estimating the effect of each drug. Statistical analyses were conducted with GraphPad Prism 3 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Parasites were photographed in suspension with a Zeiss Axiolphot microscope with 40× objectives linked to a digital camera and using an illumination ring and differential interference contrast objectives (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NJ). Images were acquired and processed in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San José, CA). CaMK activity was assayed as suggested by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnologies, Piscataway, NJ) using autocamtide-2 and [32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, 6000 Ci/mmol) as substrates. Typically parasite extracts (4 × 106 cells) were prepared by addition of 0.2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mg/ml sodium azide, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were then immediately frozen at −70 °C. The following day extracts were thawed and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were used for kinase assays. Reactions (50 μl) were incubated with parasite extracts (0.1–0.4 mg/ml) for 10 min in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, 100 μm autocamtide-2, 8 μg/ml calmodulin, 2 μm cAMP-dependent protein kinase peptide inhibitor, 2 μm protein kinase C peptide inhibitor, and 100 μm [32P]ATP (500–1000 cpm/pmol) at 30 °C. Aliquots were then removed, spotted in phosphocellulose discs, washed three times in 0.75% phosphoric acid and one time in acetone, dried, and counted by liquid scintillation. Chitinase activity was assayed essentially as in Huber et al. (20.Huber M. Cabib E. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2807-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) in both culture supernatants and parasite extracts. Briefly, supernatants were concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Centripep 10, Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) and resuspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, and then used in enzyme assays. Parasite extracts were prepared by addition of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, to the cell pellet followed by vigorous vortexing, three cycles of freeze-thawing (dry ice to room temperature), and sonication (six cycles for 20 s on ice). Enzyme sources (0.01 ml) were added to 0.160 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to which 0.03 ml of 4-methylumbelliferyl-N′,N′,N“-β-d-triacetylchitotrioside was added. Enzyme reactions were incubated at room temperature. A Dynatek Fluorite 1000 (filters, excitation 365 nm, and emission 450 nm) was used for kinetic fluorescence detection for 60 min. Protein concentration was estimated using the MicroBCA kit (Pierce). Final protein concentration in the assays was 0.05 mg/ml for cell supernatant samples and 0.025 mg/ml for pellets; the results are expressed as the normalized fluorescence corresponding to 0.001 mg of protein in each condition. Cell extracts obtained as above for the chitinase assay were used for Western blotting experiments. Either Me2SO-, KN-92-, KN-93-treated, or untreated parasite extracts from the same preparation were used. Protein content was estimated as above, and samples were adjusted for the same final concentration. For immunoblotting, proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels (Novex Experimental Technology, San Diego, CA) and electroblotted to nitrocellulose using the Novex X Cell Blot II module. After overnight blocking with 3% albumin in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T), blots were incubated with primary polyclonal antibody at 1:500 dilution in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBS-T, blots were incubated with mouse secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (ECL System, Amersham Biosciences) at 1:10,000 dilution in TBS-T for 1 h. After three washes with Tris-buffered saline, blots were developed in a chemiluminescence assay using the ECL System. Monoclonal antibodies against Pgs28 were described earlier (21.Grotendorst C.A. Kumar N. Carter R. Kaushal D.C. Infect. Immun. 1984; 45: 775-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Liverpool/blackeye strain ofAedes aegypti were raised at 26 °C and 80% relative humidity and fed on sugar ad libitum. The effects of KN-93 and KN-92 on oocyst formation were tested as follows. Zygotes were treated for 3 h with 2.0 μm of each drug, a dose of KN-93 that blocks 80% of zygote elongation with no detectable effects on KN-92-treated parasites. These cells were then washed three times with M199 medium supplemented as described above. The cells were then mixed with blood and administered to the insects in a density of 0.5–1.0 × 107 cells/ml. Mosquitoes, starved for 6–18 h, were fed on blood through a Parafilm membrane. Eight days after blood feeding, mosquito midguts were dissected and stained with 1.0% mercurochrome in water, and oocysts were counted by light microscopy. As a control, a group of zygotes was treated only with 0.1% Me2SO, the solvent used for KN-92 and KN-93. All the mosquitoes in the control groups that received a blood meal were included in the analysis. Photographs of infected mosquito midguts were taken with a brightfield Zeiss Axiolphot microscope with 10× objectives attached to a digital camera. Results are described as prevalence of infection, which is the proportion of mosquitoes with oocysts in each experiment (infected mosquitoes/total mosquitoes fed), intensity of infection, which is the mean (geometric mean) number of oocysts in infected mosquitoes only, mean oocysts per midgut in each batch of mosquitoes (geometric mean of oocysts in all infected blood-fed mosquitoes including those without oocysts), and probability of occurring the differences between the control and inhibitor fed groups determined by nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum analysis on raw data using GraphPad Prism software. Because cell shape change is triggered by calcium signaling in many cell types, we tested the effect of known calcium and CaM antagonists in zygote to ookinete differentiation. Agents that affect both intracellular and extracellular calcium homeostasis were added to incubation media containing zygotes. The following day, cells were examined for the presence of ookinetes. Incubation of zygotes with the extracellular calcium chelator EGTA did not affect ookinete formation (Fig. 1A), suggesting that extracellular calcium does not play a role during zygote to ookinete transition; however, the calcium ionophore A23187, which affects intracellular calcium homeostasis, completely blocked ookinete differentiation. A similar blockage of differentiation was observed when the intracellular calcium chelator MAPTAM was added to zygote media. Inositol trisphosphate receptors are involved in the release of stored intracellular calcium (9.Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4491) Google Scholar). The addition of TMB-8, a known antagonist of inositol trisphosphate receptors, also blocked zygote differentiation. This set of results suggests that zygote to ookinete differentiation relies on the release of intracellular stored calcium pools. Because calcium often acts through its binding to CaM, we added either W-7 or calmidazolium, two commonly used CaM antagonists. Both drugs blocked zygote to ookinete differentiation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Together these results suggested that both intracellular calcium and CaM are required for the differentiation of zygote to ookinete. Protein kinases are the effectors of most known signal transduction pathways (22.Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2295) Google Scholar). Therefore a set of inhibitors of these enzymes was tested for the ability to block zygote to ookinete differentiation (Fig. 1C). The final concentration of these drugs in these initial experiments is within the Kidetermined for their effects on mammalian cells. Fig. 1Cshows that only KN-93, a specific inhibitor of CaM kinase (18.Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 23.Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), significantly blocked the formation of ookinetes. CaMKs are enzymes usually kept inactive due to the presence of an autoinhibitory domain (23.Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24.Soderling T.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Upon an increase in intracellular calcium, the binding of calcium-CaM complex to the enzyme disrupts the interaction of autoinhibitory domains. The enzyme is then fully activated following autophosphorylation. KN-93 interacts with the calcium/CaM-binding domain of CaMK and blocks the binding of calcium-CaM complex. A hydroxyethyl domain on KN-93 is responsible for this interaction. This region is missing in KN-92, an inactive analog of KN-93 (18.Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Thus KN-92 was used to test the specificity of KN-93 effects. Fig. 1D shows a dose-dependent effect of both KN-93 and KN-92 on ookinete formation. Unlike KN-93, despite its similar structure, KN-92 did not block the parasite elongation. The IC50 for KN-93 inhibition of zygote development is 0.7 μm, and few ookinetes are detected when zygotes are treated with concentrations greater than 2 μm KN-93 (Fig. 1D). KN-93 affects zygotes irreversibly when added within 4 h after their formation as removal of the inhibitor did not reverse the effect (data not shown). This suggests that the commitment between this calcium signaling pathway and the change in the parasite shape might occur in the early hours following zygote formation. Fig. 2 shows the morphological features of drug-treated parasites. KN-92-treated samples show fully differentiated ookinetes (Fig. 2D) similar to control ookinete cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the CaMK inhibitor KN-93 almost completely blocked the ookinete formation (Fig. 2C), and the shape of the parasite remained similar to the zygote (Fig. 2A). In some KN-93 samples, partially elongated parasites were seen. These data together suggest that a calcium/CaM signaling pathway through the activation of CaMK is required for differentiation of zygotes to ookinetes. To determine whether CaMK activity is present in P. gallinaceumthe following experiments were conducted. Autocamtide-2 is a peptide whose sequence is based on the autophosphorylation site of CaMK and thus is a specific substrate for these enzymes (25.Hashimoto Y. Schworer C.M. Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8051-8055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide was used to assay P. gallinaceum extracts in the presence of [32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 3 autocamtide-2 is phosphorylated by zygote extract (Fig. 3A) and ookinete extract (Fig. 3B). The activity could be blocked by classical calmodulin antagonists such as W-7, calmidazolium, and KN-93 but not by KN-92. These results demonstrated that both cell types contain CaMK activity. To test the activity of CaMK in live cells we used a cell-permeable inhibitor of the enzyme. AIP is a nonphosphorylatable analog of the peptide substrate autocamtide-2 (19.Ishida A. Kameshita I. Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and therefore a highly specific and potent inhibitor of CaMK II. Both AIP and its myristoylated cell-permeable form Myr-AIP were then added to parasite cultures to test for their ability to block zygote to ookinete differentiation. Fig. 3C shows that Myr-AIP but not its nonpermeable analog, AIP, is able to block zygote to ookinete differentiation. The apparent low efficiency in the blocking ability of the peptide when compared with KN-93 can be attributed to the higher permeability of the latter molecule. This set of results reinforces that P. gallinaceumbears a protein kinase activity with overall characteristics of the CaMK described in the mammalian system (23.Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24.Soderling T.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 26.Hook S.S. Means A.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 471-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The process of differentiation of zygote to ookinete is not well understood. As the parasite elongates, some stage-specific genes are expressed by the ookinetes. A few hours after fertilization, a 28-kDa surface antigen is expressed in ookinetes (27.Kumar N. Carter R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 14: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Also ∼12–15 h after fertilization, when P. gallinaceum ookinetes are almost transformed, a chitinase activity is secreted by the parasite (20.Huber M. Cabib E. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2807-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The chitinase is required by the parasite to cross the chitinous peritrophic matrix that surrounds the blood meal in mosquito midgut (20.Huber M. Cabib E. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2807-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To examine whether KN-93-treated parasites express these ookinete-specific proteins, we assayed chitinase secretion by treated and untreated parasites. Fig. 4A shows the levels of chitinase activity in KN-92- and KN-93-treated parasite extracts and cell supernatants. As can be seen, both groups exhibit high levels of enzyme activity when compared with nontransformed zygotes. This result indicates that although KN-93-treated parasites do not undergo the characteristic shape change of fully transformed ookinetes they are able both to produce and to secrete chitinase. We also tested whether expression of Pgs28 is affected by KN-93. Fig. 4B shows that the levels of this protein are similar in both KN-93- and KN-92-treated as well as in nontreated parasites. These results show that zygote treatment with an inhibitor of CaMK produced a biochemically mature but morphologically impaired ookinete. Expression of chitinase activity and ookinete surface antigen Pgs28 in KN-93-treated parasites suggested that some properties of mature ookinetes remain normal in untransformed parasites. We then examined whether the morphologically impaired parasites are able to develop as oocysts. Zygotes were treated for 3 h with either KN-93 or KN-92. These parasites were then washed to remove the drugs, mixed with blood, and fed to mosquitoes. Eight days later, mosquitoes were dissected, and their midguts were examined for oocysts. Typically oocysts are distributed toward the posterior end of posterior midgut. Fig. 5 shows that both untreated (Fig. 5A) and KN-92-treated (Fig. 5C) parasites infected the mosquitoes with high intensity. However, in agreement with previous results, only a few or no oocysts developed from the KN-93-treated parasites (Fig. 5B). The few parasites that developed as oocysts probably are those that could avoid the effect of the drug and developed as fully elongated ookinetes. The overall blocking of oocyst implantation is within 70–100% in three different experiments (Table I). The data suggested that expression of ookinete-specific genes is not sufficient, and morphologic elongation is required for the further development as oocysts.Table IBlocking of sporogonic development of P. gallinaceum by KN-93ExperimentGroupPrevalence1-aPrevalence of infection in parasite-fed mosquitoes (infected mosquitoes/total mosquitoes fed).Intensity1-bIntensity of infection in the mosquitoes with oocysts (geometric mean (range of number of oocysts in infected midguts)).Mean Oocysts1-cMean oocysts per gut in each batch of mosquitoes (geometric mean of all infected blood fed mosquitoes including those without oocysts).Blockingp1-dProbability of occurring the differences between the control and inhibitor-fed groups determined by nonparametric rank sum analysis on raw data using GraphPad Prism software.%1Control20 /4015.38 (1–82)2.921KN-9221 /4010.06 (1–95)2.360KN-932 /401.00 (1)0100<0.00012Control32 /4062.37 (5–216)26.29KN-9237 /4043.31 (3–142)31.65KN-9326 /4010.91 (1–73)3.72788.22<0.00013Control40 /4019.87 (2–91)18.87KN-9233 /4016.52 (3–93)9.11KN-9327 /406.816 (1–31)2.65371.070.00161-a Prevalence of infection in parasite-fed mosquitoes (infected mosquitoes/total mosquitoes fed).1-b Intensity of infection in the mosquitoes with oocysts (geometric mean (range of number of oocysts in infected midguts)).1-c Mean oocysts per gut in each batch of mosquitoes (geometric mean of all infected blood fed mosquitoes including those without oocysts).1-d Probability of occurring the differences between the control and inhibitor-fed groups determined by nonparametric rank sum analysis on raw data using GraphPad Prism software. Open table in a new tab Here we report evidence that suggests elongation of the zygote to ookinete and expression of ookinete-specific genes in P. gallinaceum are regulated by separate pathways. We show that CaMK is involved in the elongation step of the parasite, but the blocking of this enzyme activity did not interfere with expression of ookinete-specific genes Pgs28 and chitinase. Furthermore the untransformed parasites failed to develop as oocysts in mosquitoes. Several members of the eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily (22.Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2295) Google Scholar) have been reported in Plasmodium spp. (28.Kappes B. Doerig C.D. Graeser R. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 449-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These include members of three subgroups of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family such as PfPK5 (a member of the family of cyclin-dependent protein kinases), casein kinase 1 (28.Kappes B. Doerig C.D. Graeser R. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 449-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), Pfmap-2 (a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family) and its upstream regulator Pfnek-1 (29.Dorin D.

Cox L.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 109: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and calcium-dependent protein kinases (32.Zhao Y. Franklin R.M. Kappes B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently a CaM-like domain protein kinase enzyme has been described in the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (33.Kieschnick H. Wakefield T. Narducci C.A. Beckers C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12369-12377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, by using classical CaM antagonists both in vivo (Fig. 1B) and in vitro (Fig. 3, A andB) as well as the CaM kinase-specific inhibitor KN-93 we demonstrate that CaMK activity plays a role in the zygote to ookinete differentiation process. There are two main mechanisms by which calcium can perform a regulatory function in cell shape change: first through direct binding to proteins involved in the process of polymerization/depolymerization of the cytoskeleton and second by the formation of a complex with CaM, which then further interacts with different target proteins (34.Acuto O. Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). One of these proteins is CaMK (23.Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24.Soderling T.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The multifunctional CaM kinase family, consisting of CaM kinase I, II, and IV, can mediate the action of signals that elevate intracellular free calcium (23.Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24.Soderling T.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This enzyme family is widely distributed in mammalian tissues and in all eukaryotic systems examined (23.Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24.Soderling T.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Once activated, CaM kinases play an important role in cell morphology and cytoskeletal assembly in various cell models through phosphorylation of several cytoskeleton components (35.le Gouvello S. Manceau V. Sobel A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1113-1122PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Sanchez C. Diaz-Nido J. Avila J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 133-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). CaM kinases are also involved with the control of cell growth and elongation (23.Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 36.Sanchez C. Diaz-Nido J.

Protoc. 1998; 2: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In Plasmodium, involvement of the CaM kinase family has been suspected due to sensitivity of the parasite to some CaM antagonists (11.Garcia C.R. Parasitol.

Several CaM antagonists block merozoite invasion and further intraerythrocytic development byP. falciparum (39.Matsumoto Y. Perry G. Scheibel L.W. Aikawa M. Eur. J.

Parasitol. 1990; 42: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Curiously, classical antimalarial drugs such as primaquine and chloroquine, besides their overall effect as weak bases at high concentrations, also may act as CaM antagonists at lower concentrations and block the traffic of endosomal vacuoles in vivo and CaM kinase II activity in vitro (42.van Weert A.W. Geuze H.J. Groothuis B. Stoorvogel W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Some studies have addressed CaMK activity in protozoan cells such as inDictyostelium discoideum (43.Dunbar A.J. Wheldrake J.F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 115: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), Tetrahymena (44.Hirano-Ohnishi J. Watanabe Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 858-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and Trypanosoma cruzi (45.Ogueta S.B. Macintosh G.C. Tellez-Inon M.T. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1998; 45: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In Tetrahymena, this enzyme has been shown to phosphorylate cytoskeletal components such as ciliary β-tubulin (44.Hirano-Ohnishi J. Watanabe Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 858-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this protozoan it was further demonstrated that elongation factor 1α F-actin bundling activity is also regulated by calcium and CaM (46.Kurasawa Y. Hanyu K. Watanabe Y. Numata O. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In epimastigotes of T. cruzi, CaMK is tightly bound to parasite cytoskeleton and flagella, and its autophosphorylation can regulate its distribution in the cell (45.Ogueta S.B. Macintosh G.C. Tellez-Inon M.T. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1998; 45: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,47.Ogueta S. Intosh G.M. Tellez-Inon M.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 171-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The elongate shape of ookinetes allows these cells to egress from the blood bolus, cross the peritrophic matrix, and invade the mosquito midgut epithelium. Development from round, sedentary zygote to slender, motile ookinetes is therefore crucial for malaria transmission. This study is the first demonstration that zygote to ookinete differentiation during the mosquito stage of the malaria parasite cycle is a signal transduction-mediated process. Further study of this process may identify novel mechanisms involved in the complex sporogonic development of the malaria parasite and may contribute to the design of novel strategies to control malaria transmission. We are thankful to Drs. José Ribeiro and Sanjay Desai for comments on the manuscript. We also thank Dr. Adriana Costero for help in parasite preparation.

Here, we report the molecular cloning of the enzyme, which catalyzes the generation of lyso-sphingolipids from various sphingolipids (sphingolipid ceramide N-deacylase). The 75-kDa enzyme was purified from the marine bacterium, Shewanella alga G8, and its gene was cloned from a G8 genomic library using sequences of the purified enzyme. The cloned enzyme was composed of 992 amino acids, including a signal sequence of 35 residues, and its molecular weight was estimated to be 109,843. Significant sequence similarities were found with an unknown protein of Streptomyces fradiae Y59 and a Lumbricus terrestris lectin but not other known functional proteins. The 106-kDa recombinant enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli hydrolyzed various glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin, although it seems to be much less active than the native 75-kDa enzyme. In vitro translation using wheat germ extract revealed the activity of a 75-kDa deletion mutant lacking a C terminus to be much stronger than that of the full-length enzyme, suggesting that C-terminal processing is necessary for full activity.

Recently, they were found to be accumulated in cell-surface microdomains together with cholesterol and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (1.Simons K. Ikonen E.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: xi-xixCrossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Lyso-GSLs and lyso-SM, the N-deacylated derivatives of GSLs and SM, respectively, are detected in normal tissues at very low levels (3.Mano N. Oda Y. Yamada K. Asakawa N. Katayama K. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) but accumulated in several types of inherited sphingolipid storage diseases (4.Miyatake T. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1986; 367: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest a biological role for lyso-GSLs in cell activities. For example, lyso-GM3 strongly inhibited the tyrosine-specific autophosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor of A431 cells, in which lyso-GM3 was actually detected with GM3 (7.Hanai N. Nores G.A. MacLeod C. Torres-Mendez C.R. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10915-10921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various lyso-sphingolipids inhibit protein kinase C, and this may be responsible for the pathogenesis of sphingolipidoses (8.Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1987; 235: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Psychosine (galactosylsphingosine) inhibited cytokinesis to induce the formation of multinuclear cells that are observed in the brains of patients with globoid cell leukodystrophy (9.Kanazawa T.

Lyso-SM (sphingosylphosphorylcholine, SPC), was found to accumulate in the brains of patients with Niemann-Pick disease type A (10.Rodriguez-Lafrasse C. Vanier M.T. Neurochem.

SPC as well as lyso-GM1a were found to induce apoptosis in neuronal cells (12.Sueyoshi N. Maehara T. Ito M. J.

Heise C.E. Nguyen T. O'dowd B.F. Lynch K.R. J.

Baudhuin L.M. Hong G. Williams F.S. Cristina K.L. Kabarowski J.H.S. Witte O.N. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41325-41335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism underlying the generation of lyso-sphingolipids in mammals remains unclear, lyso-GSL-generating enzymes have been found in several microorganisms, includingNocardia sp. (16.Hirabayashi Y. Kimura M. Matsumoto M. Yamamoto K. Kadowaki S. Tochikura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), Pseudomonas sp. (17.Ito M. Kurita T. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24370-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), andStreptomyces sp. (18.Ashida H. Hayashi S. Sakamoto Y. Tsuji Y. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Tochikura T. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1995; 59: 2028-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The enzyme fromPseudomonas sp. TK4 was found to hydrolyze not only GSLs but also SM, generating corresponding lyso-sphingolipids and fatty acids (17.Ito M. Kurita T. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24370-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The TK4 enzyme is clearly distinguishable from ceramidase in that it hydrolyzes the same linkage of free ceramide but not GSLs or SM (19.Okino N. Tani M. Imayama S. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,20.Tani M. Okino N. Mitsutake S. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3462-3468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and thus has been tentatively designated sphingolipid ceramideN-deacylase (SCDase) (17.Ito M. Kurita T. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24370-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Herein we report the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel SCDase from a newly isolated strain of Shewanella alga G8. Although both the TK4 and G8 enzymes efficiently hydrolyzed various GSLs and SM, a distinct difference in specificity was found in the hydrolysis of NBD-GalCer, in which the ω-position of the fatty acid was labeled with NBD, and 2-palmitoyl-5-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucoside (2P5N-Glc). That is, NBD-GalCer was efficiently hydrolyzed by G8 SCDase but not TK4 SCDase, whereas 2P5N-Glc was hydrolyzed by the TK4 enzyme but completely resistant to the G8 enzyme. This study also suggests that the processing of the C-terminal region of the G8 enzyme is necessary for the full expression of activity. This is the first report of the gene cloning of SCDase, information that should prove indispensable for the elucidation of the structure and functions of the enzyme and facilitate developments in lyso-sphingolipid-related biology and pathophysiology. Crude ganglioside mixture was prepared from bovine brain as described previously (21.Kanfer J.N. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 660-664Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and GM1a was prepared from the crude ganglioside mixture using sialidase-producing bacteria,Pseudomonas sp. YF-2, as a microbial catalyst by the method described in a previous study (22.Fukano Y. Ito M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1861-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GD1b, GM3, asialoGM1, lactosylceramide (LacCer), galactosylceramide (GalCer), glucosylceramide (GlcCer), restriction endonucleases, and Ligation Pack were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Other GSLs were obtained from Iatron Laboratories, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). SM and ceramide from bovine brain were purchased from Matreya.d-erythro-(2S,3R)-SPC was purchased from Biomol Co. [14C]SM (labeled at the choline residue) was obtained from ARC. Triton X-100 and Lubrol PX were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. and Nacalai Tesque Inc. (Kyoto, Japan), respectively. A precoated Silica gel 60 TLC plate was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). pET23b and modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co. (Kyoto, Japan) and [α-32P]dCTP was from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. (Buckinghamshire, England). All other reagents were of the highest purity available. The SCDase-producing bacterium G8 was isolated from sea sand using medium A (0.05% NH4Cl, 0.05% K2HPO4, 0.1% yeast extract, 2.0% NaCl, and 0.01% bovine brain gangliosides, pH 7.0), and identified according to the 8th edition of Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (23.Buchanan R.E. Gibbons N.E. Bergeyï¿½s Mannual of Determinative Bacteriology. 8th Ed. The Williams & Wilkins Co., Baltimore, MD1974Google Scholar). This strain is currently maintained in a medium containing crude gangliosides (0.5% polypeptone, 0.1% yeast extract, 2% NaCl, 0.1% bovine brain gangliosides, and 1.6% agar, pH 7.0) in our laboratory. 16 S rDNA was amplified using the universal primers p27f (5′-AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG-3′; positions 8–27; Escherichia coli numbering (24.Brousius J. Palmer M.L. Kennedy P.J. Noller H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4801-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar)) and p1492r (5′-GGC TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′). PCR products were purified from 1.0% agarose gel and sequenced directly using nine different sequencing primers (25.Hiraishi A. Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences were aligned and analyzed using Clustal W (26.Thomopson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar), with other 16 S rDNA sequences obtained from the Ribosomal Data base Project II (27.Maidak B.L. Cole J.R. Parker Jr., C.T. Garrity G.M. Larsen N. Li B. Lilburn T.G. McCaughey M.J. Olsen G.J. Overbeek R. Pramanik S. Schmidt T.M. Tiedje J.M. Woese C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The activity of SCDase was measured using GM1a as the substrate as described previously (17.Ito M. Kurita T. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24370-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In a standard assay, the reaction mixture contained 10 nmol of GM1a and an appropriate amount of the enzyme in 20 μl of 25 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by heating in a boiling water bath for 5 min. The reaction products were freeze-dried in a Speed Vac concentrator, dissolved in 15 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), and analyzed by TLC using solvent I (chloroform/methanol/0.02% CaCl2, 5/4/1, v/v) as the developing solvent. GSLs and lyso-GSLs were visualized by spraying the plates with orcinol-H2SO4 reagent and scanning them with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner with the reflectance mode set at 540 nm. The extent of hydrolysis was calculated as follows: hydrolysis (%) = (peak area for lyso-GM1a generated) × 100/(peak area for remaining GM1a + peak area for lyso-GM1a generated). One enzyme unit was defined as the amount capable of catalyzing the release of 1 μmol of lyso-GM1a/min from GM1a under the conditions indicated above. A value of 10−3 and 10−6 units of enzyme was expressed as 1 milliunit (mU) and 1 microunit (μU), respectively. The activity of SCDase was also measured using C12-NBD-GalCer, [14C]SM (labeled at the choline residue) or [14C]GM1a (labeled at the stearic acid) as a substrate as described below. C12-NBD-GalCer was prepared by the method described by Nakagawa et al. (28.Nakagawa T. Tani M. Kita K. Ito M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 pmol of C12-NBD-GalCer and an appropriate amount of the enzyme in 20 μl of 25 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by heating in a boiling water bath for 5 min. The sample was evaporated, dissolved in 15 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and applied to a TLC plate, which was developed with solvent I. NBD-dodecanoic acid released by the action of the enzyme and the remaining C12-NBD-GalCer were separated on a TLC and then analyzed and quantified with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner (excitation 475 nm, emission 525 nm). The hydrolysis of [14]SM or [14]GM1a was performed as follows; the reaction mixture contained 100 pmol of14C-substrate, 900 pmol of each cold substrate, and 60 μU of SCDase in 20 μl of 25 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After incubation at 37 °C for the periods indicated, the sample was evaporated, dissolved in 20 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and applied to a TLC plate, which was developed with solvent I. An imaging analyzer (BAS1500, Fuji Film, Japan) was used for analysis and quantification of the14C-substrate and 14C-product. 2-Palmitoyl-5-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucoside (2P5N-Glc) was used as an alternative substrate for SCDase. 2P5N-Glc was prepared according to the method described in a previous study (29.Gal A.E. Fash F.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1976; 16: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 μg of 2P5N-Glc and an appropriate amount of the enzyme in 200 μl of 25 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.8% Triton X-100. Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the optical density at 405 nm was measured to estimate the release of 2-amino-5-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucoside from 2P5N-Glc. For quantification of hydrolysis of 2P5N-Glc, 10 μl of reaction mixture was dried and re-dissolved in 20 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v) and applied to a TLC plate, which was developed with solvent I. The released 2-amino-5-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucoside was determined by the orcinol-H2SO4 method. Reverse hydrolysis was measured by the method described previously (30.Kita K. Kurita T. Ito M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 592-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mixture contained 100 pmol of [14C]stearic acid, 900 pmol of stearic acid, 2 nmol of d-erythro-SPC (BiomolCo.), and 60 μU of SCDase in 20 μl of 25 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. Following incubation at 37 °C for the periods indicated, the reaction was terminated by heating in a boiling water bath for 5 min. The sample was evaporated, dissolved in 20 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and applied to a TLC plate, which was developed with solvent I. An imaging analyzer (BAS1500, Fuji Film, Japan) was used for analysis and quantification of the [14C]SM generated and [14C]stearic acid unreacted. Exoglycosidases were assayed using p-nitrophenylglycosides (31.Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 702-713Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar) as a substrate. Inocula from an agar slant of G8 were introduced into a cotton-plugged 500-ml flask containing 100 ml of sterilized peptone-yeast extract-ganglioside (PYG) medium (0.5% polypeptone, 0.1% yeast extract, 2.0% NaCl, 0.1% bovine brain gangliosides, pH 7.0) and incubated at 25 °C for 22 h with vigorous shaking. The culture fluid was centrifuged at 8300 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant (4,600 ml) was then concentrated using an Ultrafiltration System (Millipore) with a 30,000 cut membrane. The concentrated fluid was applied to a Butyl-Toyopearl 650M column (80 ml; Tosoh Co., Japan), previously equilibrated with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5 (buffer A), containing 2.0 m NaCl. The enzyme was eluted from the column with an increasing Lubrol PX from 0 to 2.0% in buffer A, using a BPLC-600FC HPLC system (Yamazen Co., Japan) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled (130 ml) and then applied to a DEAE-Sepharose FF column (30 ml, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), previously equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Lubrol PX, using a BPLC-600FC HPLC system (Yamazen Co., Japan). The enzyme was eluted from the column with increasing concentrations of NaCl up to 1 m at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled (129 ml), and half of this sample was applied to a HiTrap Blue column (1.0 ml, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with buffer A, containing 1.0m NaCl. The enzyme was eluted from the column with decreasing concentrations of NaCl down to 0 m at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The amount of protein was measured by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (32.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). The proteins on SDS-PAGE gel were visualized with a silver-staining solution (33.Ohsawa K. Ebata N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and quantified by a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner with the reflection mode set at 540 nm. The purified SCDase was concentrated with a Y-shaped gel (160 × 160 × 2 mm) modified from a funnel-shaped one (34.Dainese H.P. Quadroni M. Staudenmann W. James P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 264: 336-343Google Scholar). After concentration, the protein band (75 kDa) localized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue was cut out, reduced with dithiothreitol, and loaded again on the well of a SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The SCDase band was cut out and treatedin situ with lysylendopeptidase AP-1 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan). Peptides released from the membrane were fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC using a C8 column (RP-300, 1.0 × 100 mm, Applied Biosystems) and sequenced with a pulse-liquid phase protein sequencer (Procise 492 cLc, Applied Biosystems). General cloning techniques were used, essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (35.Sambrook H. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genomic DNA of S. alga G8 was isolated by the method of Saito and Miura (36.Saito H. Miura K. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 72: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems) and a DNA sequencer (model 377A, Applied Biosystems). PCR with degenerate oligonucleotides was used to amplify a DNA fragment encoding the SCDase. Sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers were designed using the N-terminal amino acid sequence of C-603 and the internal amino acid sequence of C-606. PCR was performed with the G8 genomic DNA as a template in a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (Applied Biosystems) for 35 cycles (each consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 52 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min) using AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems). Amplified PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), and their DNA was sequenced. One PCR product (named probe 1) contained the deduced amino acid sequence found in the purified SCDase. Genomic DNA (3 μg) was digested with various restriction endonucleases, and the digests were fractionated by 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis by the standard method (35.Sambrook H. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA was transferred from agarose gels onto nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Probe 1 was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Ready-To-Go DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) and used for hybridization, which was performed in 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA and 7% SDS at 65 °C for 16 h. After hybridization, the membrane was washed three times with 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1% SDS at 65 °C and exposed on an imaging plate, which was then analyzed with a BAS1500 imaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Japan). Judging from the Southern blot of the EcoRV digest obtained using probe 1, the 4.5-kbp fragment contained the SCDase gene. To clone the gene, anEcoRV digest was prepared using 10 μg of G8 genomic DNA. Restriction fragments of the DNA were fractionated by preparative 1.0-% agarose gel electrophoresis, and 4.5-kbp fragments were extracted from the gel. The EcoRV fragments were ligated to the EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK (Stratagene). The recombinant plasmids thus obtained were used to transformEscherichia coli DH5α, which were employed for the preparation of a DNA library enriched with the SCDase gene. Colony hybridization was performed by the standard procedure using probe 1. One clone was selected, and the plasmid in the clone was designated pSCD1. The following primers were used for PCR; UN1 (5′-GACGCT AGC ATG AAA AAG CTA ATC GGA CAT-3′), and LC2 (5′-CTTCTC GAG GAG GCT GGA CTT CCA CTT CTG-3′). UN1 contained a NheI site (underlined) and LC2 contained aXhoI restriction site (double underlined). PCR was performed in a GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (Applied Biosystems) for 30 cycles (each consisting of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s and extension at 68 °C for 3.5 min) using Pyrobest DNA polymerase and pSCD1 as a template. After gel purification, the amplified products were digested with NheI and XhoI. TheNheI/XhoI fragments were cloned into theNheI/XhoI-digested pET23b. The recombinant plasmid was designated pETSCD-T. The following primers were used for PCR; UN1ERV (5′-GCTGAT ATC ATG AAA AAG CTA ATC GGA CAT-3′), LSCD2125HisXho (5′-AAA CTC GAG TCA ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG GTG GGC TTC TGC GCG CTC CCA-3′), and LSCD2955HisXho (5′-AAA CTC GAG TCA ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG GAG GCT GGA CTT CCA CTT CTG). UN1ERV contained an EcoRV restriction site (underlined), and LSCD2125HisXho and LSCD2955HisXho contained an XhoI restriction site (double underlined). PCRs were performed in a T personal PCR System (Biometra, Germany) for 30 cycles (each consisting of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s and extension at 68 °C for 3 min) using Pyrobest DNA polymerase, pSCD1 as a template, and the following sets of primers: UN1ERV-LSCD2955HisXho for the construction of pEUSCD-T (encoding wild type SCDase) and UN1ERV-LSCD2125HisXho for the construction of pEUSCD-del (encoding SCDase deletion mutant). After gel purification, the amplified products were digested withEcoRV and XhoI. TheEcoRV-XhoI fragments were cloned into theEcoRV/XhoIdigested pEU-NII vector. mRNA encoding the wild type or deletion mutant of SCDase was prepared from pEUSCD-T or pEUSCD-del using T7 RNA polymerase. In vitrotranslation was performed using a PROTEIOS wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis kit (TOYOBO, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells transformed with pETSCD-T were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the optical density at 600 nm reached about 1.0. Then, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to the culture at a final concentration 1 mm, and cultivation was continued for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzensulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride and 1% Triton X-100), and sonicated. After sonication, the solution was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 3 min, and the supernatant obtained was used as the crude enzyme solution. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences were evaluated using the DNASIS computer program developed by Hitachi Software Engineering (Japan). The newly isolated SCDase-producing bacterium G8 was assigned to S. alga based on its morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics and on the results of a phylogenetic analysis using 16 S rDNA. G8 released SCDase into the culture medium (12 units/liter of culture) when cultivated at 25 °C for 20–24 h in a PYG medium. SCDase was then purified from 4.6 liters of the culture supernatant by Ultrafiltration and sequential chromatography using Butyl-Toyopearl 650M and DEAE-Sepharose FF, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SCDase was finally purified 1600-fold with an overall yield of 24% (Table I).Table IPurification of SCDase from S. alga G8StepTotal activityTotal proteinSpecific activityRecoveryPurificationunitsmgunits/mg%-foldCulture fluid55.529550.0191001Ultrafiltration43.08400.051773Butyl-Toyopearl 650M17.7141.263266DEAE-Sepharose FF13.50.4431-aEstimated by SDS-PAGE as described in the text.30.4241,6001-a Estimated by SDS-PAGE as described in the text. Open table in a new tab The final preparation of G8 SCDase was completely free from the following enzymes: α- and β-galactosidases, α- and β-glucosidases, α- and β-mannosidases, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, α-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and α-l-fucosidase, as confirmed by activity determination using 0.1 mU of the purified SCDase for each assay and an appropriate substrate for 16 h. The purified enzyme gave one major protein band having a molecular mass of 75 kDa on SDS-PAGE after staining with a silver-staining solution under reducing conditions (Fig. 1 A). To examine whether or not the 75-kDa band is SCDase per se, the SCDase preparation after DEAE-Sepharose FF chromatography was further applied to a column of HiTrap Blue, and an aliquot of the eluent was subjected to an assay for SCDase activity as well as SDS-PAGE. The elution profile of SCDase activity on the HiTrap Blue column was found to exactly coincide with that of the 75-kDa band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the 75-kDa protein is likely to be SCDase. Four peptides (C-599, C-606, C-614, and C-616) were obtained from the purified 75-kDa SCDase after digestion with lysylendopeptidase and subjected to amino acid microsequencing. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was also determined using the purified native enzyme (C-603). Finally, 59 amino acid residues of the SCDase were determined. PCR was performed using one set of primers (SS2a, 5′-CTNGCNCARCARTGYTT-3′; SA3, 5′-CCNSAYTGNACRTCDAT-3′) and G8 genomic DNA as a template. A 997-bp PCR product was obtained (probe 1), which contained DNA sequences encoding the peptide sequences of C-603, C-599, and C-606 (Fig. 2 A). Southern blotting using α-32P-labeled probe 1 showed a 4.5-kbp band in the G8 genomic DNA digested with EcoRV. A clone, designated as pSCD1, containing a 4.5-kbp insert was isolated from a DNA library enriched with the SCDase gene. The nucleotide sequence of pSCD1 was determined, and a putative open reading frame was found. T"
https://openalex.org/W1973872737,"Pre-α-inhibitor is a serum protein consisting of two polypeptides, the heavy chain and bikunin, covalently linked through an ester bond between the chondroitin sulfate chain of bikunin and the α-carboxyl group of the carboxyl-terminal residue of the heavy chain. The heavy chain is synthesized with a carboxyl-terminal extension, which is cleaved off just before the link to bikunin is formed. Our earlier studies indicate that this extension mediates the cleavage, and we have now found that a short segment on the amino-terminal side of the cleavage site is also required for the reaction. Furthermore, we previously showed that coexpression of the heavy chain precursor and bikunin in COS-1 cells leads to linkage, and we have now used this system to identify a His residue in the carboxyl-terminal extension that is specifically required for the intracellular coupling of the two proteins. In addition, we have shown that another chondroitin sulfate-containing protein, decorin, will also form a complex with the heavy chain, as will free chondroitin sulfate chains. These results suggest that in vivo there might be other, as yet unknown, chondroitin sulfate-containing polypeptides linked to the heavy chain."
https://openalex.org/W1980670550,"Rates of in vitro synthesis of radiolabeled γ and β chains made in a cell-free transcription/translation system were similar, but expressed globin chains were unstable. The addition of unlabeled β or γ chains at the start of chain synthesis generated radiolabeled β4 or γ2 and γ4 chains, respectively. If unlabeled α-globin chains were added at the start of chain synthesis, then approximately equal amounts of radiolabeled αβ or αγ bands were generated. If unlabeled Hb A or Hb F was added to reactions containing radiolabeled αβ or αγ prior to electrophoresis, then radiolabeled Hb A or Hb F tetramers, respectively, were generated. If α chains were added after synthesis of radiolabeled γ chains made in the presence of unlabeled γ chains, then little radiolabeled αγ formed. In contrast, if α chains were added after synthesis of radiolabeled β chains made in the presence of unlabeled β chains, then radiolabeled α2β2 formed. These findings suggest that β and γ chains associate with α chains during or soon after translation. This would prevent the formation of unstable monomers as well as stable γ2 dimers and suggests that α chains may bind to nascent non-α chains, acting as folding catalysts to promote functional tetrameric hemoglobin formationin vivo.

The α chains are in monomer/dimer equilibrium-favoring monomers, whereas non-α chains are in monomer/tetramer equilibrium-favoring tetramers (9.Bucci E. Fronticelli C. Chiancone E. Wyman J. Antonini E. Rossi-Fanelli A. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10.Antonini E. Bucci E. Fronticelli C. Chiancone E. Wyman J. Rossi-Fanelli A. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 17: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that dissociation of these oligomeric subunits into monomers must occur before these two different chains can combine to form αβ or αγ dimers, which then associate to form tetrameric Hb (α2β2 or α2γ2) (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12.Bunn H.F. Blood. 1987; 69: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the assembly of αβ or αγ dimer was postulated to be the rate-limiting step for assembly in vivo and has been theorized to be governed by electrostatic attractions between α- and non-α partner subunits (8.McDonald M.J. Turci S.M. Mrabet N.T. Himelstein B.P. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5951-5956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Bunn H.F. Blood. 1987; 69: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, from in vitro studies it is known that Hb F formation using purified γ- and α-globin chains is very slow compared with Hb A using purified β- and α-globin chains (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In fact, our previous studies showed approximately a 105-fold slower rate of assembly in vitro for Hb F compared with Hb A (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The slow rate of Hb F formation in vitro is caused by stable γ2 dimer formation and is unlikely to occur in erythroid precursors (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We also found that even at low concentrations (<5 μm), γ chain dimers do not dissociate readily into monomers, resulting in decreased assembly with α chains. Furthermore, our results showed that the assembly of [Ile116→His]γ chains with α chains was similar to that of β chains, whereas the assembly of [Thr112→Cys]γ with α chains was similar to wild type γ chains (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that amino acid differences between [Ile116]γ and [His116]β at α1γ1 and α1β1 interaction sites, respectively, are responsible for the different assembly rates in vitrobetween Hb F and Hb A. These results also indicate that dissociation of γ2 dimers to monomers limits the formation in vitro of Hb F and suggest that γ chains assemble in vivo with α chains prior to forming stable γ2 dimers, possibly binding to α chains as partially folded nascent γ-globin chains prior to or soon after release from polyribosomes. To evaluate the assembly of β- and γ-globin with α-globin chains in vivo, we expressed β and γ chains in a wheat germ-coupled cell-free transcription/translation system using cDNA expression vectors. In addition, we added α and γ or β chains as well as Hb F or Hb A to reactions at different times and assessed the formation of radiolabeled assembled homo-/heterodimers and tetrameric globins.DISCUSSIONStudies on the in vitro assembly of Hb A show that the α2β2 tetramer assembles via a stable αβ dimer intermediate as follows in Equation 1.2α+2β⇌2αβ⇌α2β2Equation 1 This pathway reflects the relative stability of the α2β2 tetramer and equilibration with αβ dimer (2αβ ⇌ α2β2 or 2αγ ⇌ α2γ2) and involves stable protein-protein interactions of α and β chains at α1β1 interfaces as well as α1γ1 interfaces of Hb F (1.Bunn H.F. Forget B.G. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. Saunders, Philadelphia1986: 13-140Google Scholar). The α1β1 or α1γ1interface forms first at low subunit concentrations in vitro, implying that this interface is energetically more stable than all the other subunit interfaces combined. This equilibrium exists under physiological conditions, is an important determinant of hemoglobin function, and shifts depending on various conditions such as pH, ionic strength, and Hb concentration. Subunit dissociation to dimers upon dilution has been studied by a variety of methods, all of which involve measurement of the average molecular weight of Hb dimer and tetramer (16.Turner B.W. Pettigrew D.W. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 596-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our present results show that in the presence of excess α chains, heterodimers rather than heterotetramers form because of the low concentration of newly synthesized globin chains generated in this cell-free system (∼10−8m) compared with the dissociation constant (Kd) of tetrameric Hb (∼10−6m) (16.Turner B.W. Pettigrew D.W. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 596-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17.Willams R.C. Kim H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 18.Bunn H.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1969; 48: 126-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).The biosynthesis of α- and non-α-globin polypeptide chains to form heterodimers and tetramers in vivo is normally balanced. How the linear amino acid sequence in polypeptides promotes protein folding leading to formation in vivo of functional tetramers after transcription/translation is not completely understood. We found differences in the assembly of purified γ and α chains to form Hb F and of β and α chains to form Hb A in vitro compared with expression of both tetramers in bacteria and yeast (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The difference between in vitro and in vivo assembly can be explained by our present experimental results suggesting that nascent γ-globin chains assemble with free α chains to form αγ heterotetramers during translation, or soon after, but prior to formation of stable γ2 homodimers (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our previous studies in vitro showed a 105-fold slower rate of stable γ2 dimer assembly with α chains to form Hb F compared with Hb A formation by α- and β-globin chains. This large rate difference can be explained by the fact that γ2 homodimers do not dissociate readily to monomers like β2 or β4 chains (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, if γ chains are in the monomeric state, they can associate with α chains as β chains (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our present results using this in vitrocell-free system show that in the presence of added unlabeled α chains prior to translation, newly synthesized γ-globin chains do not form unstable γ chain monomers or stable γ2 homodimers. The chains assemble with α chains and form radiolabeled αγ heterodimers that can then form Hb F tetramers. Our present results also show that γ or β chains can be stabilized by the formation of homodimers or homotetramers in the absence of α chains. In addition, it was expected that in the presence of unlabeled α- and γ-globin chains that newly synthesized γ chains would form not only αγ heterodimers but also γ2 homodimers. However, our results show that the addition of unlabeled α-globin chains or α-globin chains and Hb F at zero time produced only radiolabeled αγ or Hb F, respectively, and no γ2 or γ4. These results suggest that α chains associate with newly synthesized γ-globin chains faster than γ-globin chains, even though γ-globin chains can form stable homodimers.In addition, Komar et al. (19.Komar A.A. Kommer A. Krasheninikov I.A. Spirin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10646-10651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) demonstrated that incomplete human α-globin molecules of 140, 100, and 86 amino acid residues are capable of co-translational heme binding with an approximately equal efficiency, whereas polypeptide chains of 75, 65, and 34 amino acid residues display a significantly weaker, or just nonspecific, affinity for heme. This indicates that nascent α chains having 86 amino acids possess a structure that allows interaction with heme or that heme binding to nascent globin chains promotes formation of the proper tertiary structure of the growing polypeptide chain on polyribosomes (19.Komar A.A. Kommer A. Krasheninikov I.A. Spirin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10646-10651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20.Komar A.A. Kommer A. Krasheninikov I.A. Spirin A.S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is not clear how α- and non-α-globin genes are transcribed at nearly equal rates; however, α-globin mRNA, whether by virtue of a higher rate of transcription or greater stability, accumulates in slight excess compared with β-globin mRNA during normal adult erythropoiesis. In fact, α-globin mRNA tends to be 25–50% more abundant than β-globin mRNA in normal erythrocytes (21.Benz Jr., E.J. Forget B.G. Prog. Hematol. 1975; 9: 107-155PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in red cells the concentration of hemoglobin is very high (∼5 mm) even though free globin chain concentrations are not known. From these results, we propose that nascent non-α chains undergo folding and in the presence of α chain monomers assemble with already folded α-globin chains thereby preventing the formation of γ2or apo β2 homodimers. This would result in the formation of stable α-non-α globin heterodimers, which then leads to the formation of functional hemoglobins in vivo. Current attempts are focused on demonstrating α chain interaction with nascent γ chains during translation to form functional Hb F using cell-free systems.

The α chains are in monomer/dimer equilibrium-favoring monomers, whereas non-α chains are in monomer/tetramer equilibrium-favoring tetramers (9.Bucci E. Fronticelli C. Chiancone E. Wyman J.

It is generally assumed that dissociation of these oligomeric subunits into monomers must occur before these two different chains can combine to form αβ or αγ dimers, which then associate to form tetrameric Hb (α2β2 or α2γ2) (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12.Bunn H.F. Blood. 1987; 69: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the assembly of αβ or αγ dimer was postulated to be the rate-limiting step for assembly in vivo and has been theorized to be governed by electrostatic attractions between α- and non-α partner subunits (8.McDonald M.J.

Furthermore, from in vitro studies it is known that Hb F formation using purified γ- and α-globin chains is very slow compared with Hb A using purified β- and α-globin chains (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In fact, our previous studies showed approximately a 105-fold slower rate of assembly in vitro for Hb F compared with Hb A (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The slow rate of Hb F formation in vitro is caused by stable γ2 dimer formation and is unlikely to occur in erythroid precursors (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We also found that even at low concentrations (<5 μm), γ chain dimers do not dissociate readily into monomers, resulting in decreased assembly with α chains. Furthermore, our results showed that the assembly of [Ile116→His]γ chains with α chains was similar to that of β chains, whereas the assembly of [Thr112→Cys]γ with α chains was similar to wild type γ chains (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that amino acid differences between [Ile116]γ and [His116]β at α1γ1 and α1β1 interaction sites, respectively, are responsible for the different assembly rates in vitrobetween Hb F and Hb A. These results also indicate that dissociation of γ2 dimers to monomers limits the formation in vitro of Hb F and suggest that γ chains assemble in vivo with α chains prior to forming stable γ2 dimers, possibly binding to α chains as partially folded nascent γ-globin chains prior to or soon after release from polyribosomes. To evaluate the assembly of β- and γ-globin with α-globin chains in vivo, we expressed β and γ chains in a wheat germ-coupled cell-free transcription/translation system using cDNA expression vectors. In addition, we added α and γ or β chains as well as Hb F or Hb A to reactions at different times and assessed the formation of radiolabeled assembled homo-/heterodimers and tetrameric globins. hemoglobin haptoglobin cellulose acetate electrophoresis hemoglobin haptoglobin cellulose acetate electrophoresis DISCUSSIONStudies on the in vitro assembly of Hb A show that the α2β2 tetramer assembles via a stable αβ dimer intermediate as follows in Equation 1.2α+2β⇌2αβ⇌α2β2Equation 1 This pathway reflects the relative stability of the α2β2 tetramer and equilibration with αβ dimer (2αβ ⇌ α2β2 or 2αγ ⇌ α2γ2) and involves stable protein-protein interactions of α and β chains at α1β1 interfaces as well as α1γ1 interfaces of Hb F (1.Bunn H.F. Forget B.G. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. Saunders, Philadelphia1986: 13-140Google Scholar). The α1β1 or α1γ1interface forms first at low subunit concentrations in vitro, implying that this interface is energetically more stable than all the other subunit interfaces combined. This equilibrium exists under physiological conditions, is an important determinant of hemoglobin function, and shifts depending on various conditions such as pH, ionic strength, and Hb concentration. Subunit dissociation to dimers upon dilution has been studied by a variety of methods, all of which involve measurement of the average molecular weight of Hb dimer and tetramer (16.Turner B.W. Pettigrew D.W. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 596-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our present results show that in the presence of excess α chains, heterodimers rather than heterotetramers form because of the low concentration of newly synthesized globin chains generated in this cell-free system (∼10−8m) compared with the dissociation constant (Kd) of tetrameric Hb (∼10−6m) (16.Turner B.W.

How the linear amino acid sequence in polypeptides promotes protein folding leading to formation in vivo of functional tetramers after transcription/translation is not completely understood. We found differences in the assembly of purified γ and α chains to form Hb F and of β and α chains to form Hb A in vitro compared with expression of both tetramers in bacteria and yeast (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The difference between in vitro and in vivo assembly can be explained by our present experimental results suggesting that nascent γ-globin chains assemble with free α chains to form αγ heterotetramers during translation, or soon after, but prior to formation of stable γ2 homodimers (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our previous studies in vitro showed a 105-fold slower rate of stable γ2 dimer assembly with α chains to form Hb F compared with Hb A formation by α- and β-globin chains. This large rate difference can be explained by the fact that γ2 homodimers do not dissociate readily to monomers like β2 or β4 chains (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, if γ chains are in the monomeric state, they can associate with α chains as β chains (11.Adachi K. Zhao Y. Yamaguchi T. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12424-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our present results using this in vitrocell-free system show that in the presence of added unlabeled α chains prior to translation, newly synthesized γ-globin chains do not form unstable γ chain monomers or stable γ2 homodimers. The chains assemble with α chains and form radiolabeled αγ heterodimers that can then form Hb F tetramers. Our present results also show that γ or β chains can be stabilized by the formation of homodimers or homotetramers in the absence of α chains. In addition, it was expected that in the presence of unlabeled α- and γ-globin chains that newly synthesized γ chains would form not only αγ heterodimers but also γ2 homodimers. However, our results show that the addition of unlabeled α-globin chains or α-globin chains and Hb F at zero time produced only radiolabeled αγ or Hb F, respectively, and no γ2 or γ4. These results suggest that α chains associate with newly synthesized γ-globin chains faster than γ-globin chains, even though γ-globin chains can form stable homodimers.In addition, Komar et al. (19.Komar A.A. Kommer A. Krasheninikov I.A. Spirin A.S. J. Biol.

This indicates that nascent α chains having 86 amino acids possess a structure that allows interaction with heme or that heme binding to nascent globin chains promotes formation of the proper tertiary structure of the growing polypeptide chain on polyribosomes (19.Komar A.A.

It is not clear how α- and non-α-globin genes are transcribed at nearly equal rates; however, α-globin mRNA, whether by virtue of a higher rate of transcription or greater stability, accumulates in slight excess compared with β-globin mRNA during normal adult erythropoiesis. In fact, α-globin mRNA tends to be 25–50% more abundant than β-globin mRNA in normal erythrocytes (21.Benz Jr., E.J. Forget B.G. Prog. Hematol. 1975; 9: 107-155PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in red cells the concentration of hemoglobin is very high (∼5 mm) even though free globin chain concentrations are not known. From these results, we propose that nascent non-α chains undergo folding and in the presence of α chain monomers assemble with already folded α-globin chains thereby preventing the formation of γ2or apo β2 homodimers. This would result in the formation of stable α-non-α globin heterodimers, which then leads to the formation of functional hemoglobins in vivo. Current attempts are focused on demonstrating α chain interaction with nascent γ chains during translation to form functional Hb F using cell-free systems.

https://openalex.org/W2097070131,"The human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV) envelope glycoprotein consists of a trimer of two noncovalently and weakly associated subunits, gp120 and gp41. Upon binding of gp120 to cellular receptors, this labile native envelope complex undergoes conformational changes, resulting in a stable trimer-of-hairpins structure in gp41. Formation of the hairpin structure is thought to mediate membrane fusion by placing the viral and cellular membranes in close proximity. An in vitro-derived variant of SIVmac251, denoted CPmac, has acquired an unusually stable virion-associated gp120-gp41 complex. This unique phenotype is conferred by five amino acid substitutions in the gp41 ectodomain. Here we characterize the structural and physicochemical properties of the N40(L6)C38 model of the CPmac gp41 core. The 1.7-A resolution crystal structure of N40(L6)C38 is very similar to the six-helix bundle structure present in the parent SIVmac251 gp41. In both structures, three N40 peptides form a central three-stranded coiled coil, and three C38 peptides pack in an antiparallel orientation into hydrophobic grooves on the coiled-coil surface. Thermal unfolding studies show that the CPmac mutations destabilize the SIVmac251 six-helix bundle by 15 kJ/mol. Our results suggest that the formation of the gp41 trimer-of-hairpins structure is thermodynamically coupled to the conformational stability of the native envelope glycoprotein and raise the intriguing possibility that introduction of mutations to destabilize the six-helix bundle may lead to the stabilization of the trimeric gp120-gp41 complex. This study suggests a potential strategy for the production of stably folded envelope protein immunogens for HIV vaccine development."

Integrative recombination between specific target sites on the phage (attP) and bacterial (attB) chromosomes generates an integrated prophage bounded by attL and attR sites at the junctions of bacterial and phage DNA. Excisive recombination between attL and attR recreates theattP and attB sites and yields free viral DNA (5.Campbell A.M. Caspari E.W. Thoday J.M. Advances in Genetics.

DNA cleavage is mediated by a tyrosine hydroxyl that attacks the scissile phosphate, forming a 3′-phosphotyrosine link to the nicked DNA. This covalent protein-DNA intermediate is resolved when the 5′-terminal hydroxyl of the invading DNA strand attacks the phosphotyrosine linkage and displaces the protein. The chemistry of DNA strand exchange and the general arrangement of the “core region” are common to all of the λ Int family members except that their overlap regions vary from 6 to 8 bp in length, and their core-type binding sites vary from 9 to 13 bp. For some family members, such as Cre, XerC/D, and FLP, the core region composes the entire (minimal) att site. For other family members, such as λ and HP1 integrases, the att sites are more complex and contain additional protein-binding sites in viral DNA sequences that compose flanking “arms.” Some of these flanking sites bind to DNA bending accessory proteins like IHF, Xis, and Fis, whereas others bind to the amino-terminal domain of Int, resulting in a higher order complex where Int bridges the core and arm sequences of a sharply bent att DNA. Underlying the various layers of complexity that divide λ Int family members into several subgroups is a common carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain that executes the cleavage and rejoining of core-type DNA sequences in an energy-conserving reaction pathway that is the hallmark of these recombinases. The carboxyl-terminal “domain” of λ Int (residues 65–356) binds with low affinity to core-type sites located at the positions of strand cleavage and functions as a topoisomerase. This C65 can be further dissected by proteolysis into two smaller domains, encompassing residues 65–169 and 170–356, respectively. The latter, termed C170 or the catalytic domain, has been characterized and its crystal structure has been determined (6.Tirumalai R.S. Healey E. Landy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1389-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the catalytic domain of HP1 integrase (17.Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Craigie R.

Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) reveal protein folds resembling that of the λ Int C170 domain (7.Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R.S. Landy A. Ellenberger T. Science. 1997; 276: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, there are significant differences in the active sites of these recombinases, including different orientations of the tyrosine nucleophile and differences in nearby segments that are predicted to contact the DNA. In all of the λ Int family members there is a second domain just upstream of the catalytic domain that is also involved in binding to core-type sites. In λ Int this is called the central core binding (CB) domain because it is flanked by the carboxyl-terminal (catalytic) and amino-terminal (arm-binding) domains. In the monovalent λ Int family members that bind only to core-type sites (e.g. Cre, Flp, and XerC/D), the analogous domain is an amino-terminal domain. Previous studies in our laboratory (6.Tirumalai R.S. Healey E. Landy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6104-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) had shown that although the catalytic domain of λ Int catalyzes the cleavage and rejoining of core-type DNA sequences, it does not form electrophoretically stable complexes with att DNAs. Experiments specifically designed to identify the interface(s) between λ Int and core-type DNA all pointed to the CB domain as follows: zero length UV-induced photo-cross-linking identified Ala-125 and Ala-126, DNA-sensitive modification by pyridoxal 5′-phosphate identified Lys-103, and an isolated CB domain formed stable complexes with core-type DNA (20.Tirumalai R.S. Kwon H. Cardente E. Ellenberger T. Landy A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 513-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results were unexpected because a number of experiments from other laboratories all pointed to the primacy of the catalytic domain in binding to core-type DNA. Additionally, several mutations affecting core-type DNA binding affinity and sequence recognition specificity were also found to be located in the catalytic domain (21.Dorgai L. Yagil E. Weisberg R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22.MacWilliams M.P. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic domains of Cre and FLP can bind autonomously to core-type sites, i.e. in the absence of their amino-terminal domains, which correspond to the CB domain of λ Int (23.Hoess R. Abremski K. Irwin S. Kendall M. Mack A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24.Panigrahi G.B. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10940-10945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the Cre/loxA cocrystal structure indicated that upon binding tolox (core-type) DNA, the catalytic domain buries ∼50% more solvent-accessible surface area at the DNA interface than the amino-terminal (CB-analogous) domain (19.Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). To explore further these apparent dichotomies, we looked for a different chemistry with which to probe the Int-core DNA interface(s). We found that incorporation of the photoaffinity cross-linking analog, 4-thio-deoxythymidine (4-thioT), at a unique position in the core DNA yields high efficiency photo-cross-linking to Int. Identification of the photo-cross-linked residue as Lys-141 in the CB domain provides, along with other results, several insights about the nature of core-type DNA recognition by the bivalent recombinases of the λ Int family. An additional bonus of these experiments is the very high efficiency with which the photo-cross-link is generated, thus providing a potentially useful handle for dissecting the higher order organization of the large complex structures associated with this site-specific recombination pathway. Full-length bacteriophage λ Int, Int C65Y, and Int C65F proteins were produced inE. coli strain BL21 from expression plasmids under the control of bacteriophage T7 promoter and were purified from the insoluble (λ Int) and soluble (C65Y and C65F forms) fractions of the cell lysate (20.Tirumalai R.S.

The protein preparations, purified by a series of phosphocellulose (Whatman), SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and hydroxylapatite (Calbiochem) column chromatography, were determined to be greater than 95% pure as evaluated by Coomassie staining of an overloaded SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein concentrations were estimated by the dye-binding method (29.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Cruachem, Inc. (Dulles, VA), in lyophilized form. Before use, the oligonucleotides were resuspended in TE buffer at 1 mm. The sequences for each 4-thioT-substituted core-binding site (underlined) are as follows (where ts designates top strand, bs designates bottom strand, X = 4-thioT, and ↓ shows site of Int cleavage): T3 (ts, 23 nt), 5′-CTAXAAAGTTGCTCGAGAAGATC-3′; T3 (bs, 22 nt), 5′-GATCTTCTCGAGCAACTTT↓ATA-3′; T4 (ts, 34 nt), 5′-GTTCTAGXAAGTTGCTCGAGAAGATCTTCAGCTT-3′; T4 (bs, 30 nt), 5′-AAGCTGAAGATCTTCTCGAGCAACTTA↓CTA-3′; B4 (ts, 23 nt), 5′-CTATAAAGTTGCTCGAGAAGATC-3′; B4 (bs, 22 nt), 5′-GATCTTCTCGAGCAACTTX↓ATA-3′; B5 (ts, 23 nt), same as B4 (ts); B5 (bs, 22 nt), 5′-GATCTTCTCGAGCAACTXT↓ATA-3′; B6 (ts, 23 nt), same as B4 (ts); B6 (bs, 22 nt), 5′-GATCTTCTCGAGCAACXTT↓ATA-3′; T8 (ts, 34 nt), 5′-GTTCTAGAAAGXTGCTCGAGAAGATCTTCAGCTT-3′; T8 (bs, 30 nt), 5′-AAGCTGAAGATCTTCTCGAGCAACTTT↓CTA-3′; T9 (ts, 34 nt), 5′-GTTCTAGAAAGCXGCTCGAGAAGATCTTCAGCTT-3′; T9 (bs, 30 nt), 5′-AAGCTGAAGATCTTCTCGAGCAGCTTT↓CTA-3′; T11 (ts, 23 nt), 5′-CTATAAAGTTG XACGAGAAGATC-3′; T11 (bs, 22 nt), 5′-GATCTTCTCGTACAACTTT↓ATA-3′; B11 (ts, 23 nt), 5′-CTATAAAGTTGAACGAGAAGATC-3′; B11 (bs, 22 nt), 5′-GATCTTCTCGTX CAACTTT↓ATA-3′; T12 (ts, 23 nt), 5′-CTATAAAGTTGAXCGAGAAGATC-3′; T12 (bs, 22 nt), 5′-GATCTTCTCGATCAACTTT↓ATA-3′; B12 (ts, 23 nt), same as B11 (ts); B12 (bs, 22 nt), 5′-GATCTTCTCGXTCAACTTT↓ATA-3′; heterologous competitor (ts, 23 nt), 5′-CTAGAGAACGTCTCGAGAAGATC-3′; heterologous competitor (bs, 22 nt), 5′-GATCTTCTCGAGACGTTCTCTA-3′; non-TattL (27 nt), 5′-TCGAGCAGCTTT↓TTTATATTAAGTTGG-3′; 4ST-attL (27 nt), 5′-TCGAGCAGCTTT↓TTTATAXTAAGTTGG-3′; and PBR327 number 4 primer (20 nt), 5′-CTGCCACCA- TAGGCACGCCG-3′. Oligonucleotides used in binding and cross-linking assays were 5′-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP. Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed by heating to 90 °C for 10 min in 10 mmTris·HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, followed by a slow cooling/annealing period of 4–16 h. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed by passage through a Sephadex G-50–80 spin column, prior to gel purification of annealed DNA substrates (passive elution from a 10% polyacrylamide gel into TE buffer). Care was taken not to expose 4-thioT-substituted oligonucleotides to ultraviolet light. Radiolabeled half-att site DNA substrates (5 pmol) were incubated at 25 °C in a 10-μl mixture of 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of Int C65Y (25 pmol) and allowed to proceed for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.2% SDS buffer. Cleavage products were separated by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide in 0.5× TBE, 0.1% SDS buffer. The gels were autoradiographed on Fuji x-ray film. Binding of Int C65F (25 pmol) to radiolabeled half-att site DNA substrates modified with 4-thioT substitutions proceeded at 25 °C for 20 min in a 10-μl mixture of 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. The samples were then transferred to the surface of a porcelain plate pre-chilled to 4 °C. Photo-cross-linking of the samples was achieved by exposing the samples to a 366 nm UV light source (Blak-Ray lamp, model UVL-56, Ultra-Violet products, Inc., San Gabriel, CA) positioned 2 cm away from the samples. Photo-cross-linking was performed on ice at 4 °C for a period of 45 min. Non-covalent interactions were disassociated by addition of 0.2% SDS. Photo-cross-linking of an Int C65F titration was also performed as described above, except that a constant amount of radiolabeled T3 duplex (5 pmol) was mixed with Int C65F (500, 250, 125, 60, 30, 15, and 7.5 pmol) prior to cross-linking. UV-dependent covalent complexes were separated by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE, 0.1% SDS buffer. The gels were exposed on a PhosphorImager plate and also autoradiographed on Fuji x-ray film. The PhosphorImager plate was scanned with a Fuji BAS 1000 scanner, and the image was visualized and quantitated with the Fuji MacBAS software package. Several concentrations of Int C65F (3, 6, 12, 25, and 50 pmol) were mixed with radiolabeled core-type oligomers (25 pmol) and incubated at 25 °C in a 10 μl mixture of 10 mmTris·HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. The reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis through an 8% polyacrylamide gel in 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA buffer. The gels were exposed on a PhosphorImager plate and also autoradiographed on Fuji x-ray film. The PhosphorImager plate was scanned with a Fuji BAS 1000 scanner, and the image was visualized and quantitated with the Fuji MacBAS software package. Competition binding assays were set up as described above, except that Int C65F (12.5 pmol) was incubated with radiolabeled T3 4-thioT duplex (25 pmol) in the presence of increasing amounts of non-labeled competitor DNA (25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 pmol). The homologous competitor shared the same nucleotide sequence as the T3 4-thioT duplex except that it did not contain the 4-thioT substitution. The heterologous competitor shared the same base composition as the T3 duplex, but the sequence for the core binding domain was scrambled (see above). The gels were quantitated on the PhosphorImager. attL andattR plasmids containing the overlap sequences 5′-TTTATAX (pPEG1) and 5′-TTTATAT (pPEG2), respectively, were generated to replicate the overlap sequence of the T3 4-thioT half-att site. (Note that a bold X indicates the 4-thioT substitution.) 4-ThioT-substituted and non-substitutedattL substrates were generated by PCR amplification using the appropriate attL primer along with a downstream primer homologous to a sequence within the pBR327 backbone of the plasmid pPEG1 (see under “Oligonucleotides”). The attL substrates (∼400 bp) were gel-purified and 5′-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed by passage through a Sephadex G-50–80 spin column. Recombination assays were carried out at 25 °C for 4 h in a 20-μl mixture containing 0.10 pmol of supercoiledattR DNA substrate and 0.05 pmol of radiolabeled linearattL substrate (4-thioT-modified or non-modified), 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 6 mm spermidine, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were preincubated with 1.5 units of IHF for 20 min before the addition of 1.5 units of Xis and λ Int (8, 4, 2, and 1 pmol; 1.25 pmol λ Int is equivalent to 1 activity unit). Reactions were stopped with the addition of 0.2% SDS. Recombination products were analyzed by electrophoresis through 1.2% agarose gels that were then dried down and quantitated on the PhosphorImager. C65F (150 nmol) was photo-cross-linked to the T3 oligomer (125 nmol) in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol for 45 min at 4 °C after binding for 20 min at 25 °C. The sample was concentrated down to approximately a 200-μl volume (Centricon 30, Amicon, Inc.) and washed 5 times with 2-ml volumes of 8 m urea, 100 mmNH4HCO3 by Centricon dialysis. This serves to denature the protein as well as to remove a significant amount of the non-cross-linked DNA. The sample was then diluted to 2 murea by the addition of 3 volumes of 100 mmNH4HCO3, to make the conditions compatible with trypsin digestion. The digestion was allowed to go to completion (∼24 h), and the Int C65F photo-cross-linked to T3 4-thioT-attDNA was resolved by anion-exchange HPLC on a Sychrom AX 300 (250 × 4.6 mm) column, equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 20% (v/v) acetonitrile (equilibration buffer). The peptides were eluted by increasing the concentration of NaCl in the equilibration buffer as follows: 0–30 min, no salt; 30–90 min, a gradient from 0 to 1.0 m NaCl; 90–110 min, 1 mNaCl. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. All HPLC analyses were conducted using a Varian 9012 inert solvent delivery system equipped with a polychrome 9065 diode array detector. Peptides were monitored at 254 mm. Fractions 71–76 were pooled and further purified by reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column (Vydac) under ion-pairing conditions. The column was equilibrated with 10 mm triethylammonium acetate (pH 7.0) for 10 min. After a 5-min wash with HPLC-grade water, the peptide(s) were eluted by increasing the concentration of acetonitrile in water from 0 to 30%. The peptides were monitored at 254 nm. Fractions corresponding to peaks I (residues 67–82) and II (residues 90–102) were pooled individually and subjected to amino-terminal amino acid sequencing using the Edman degradation reaction (30.Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar) on an Applied Biosystems 470A gas phase sequencer at the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University, New Haven, CT. The resulting phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were analyzed using an on-line Applied Biosystems model 470A microbore HPLC. λ Int and its close relatives are unusual in being heterobivalent DNA-binding proteins. A short amino-terminal domain, residues 1–64, is responsible for binding to “arm-type” DNA sequences distant from the core-type DNA sequences where DNA strands are cleaved, exchanged, and religated. All of the operations on core-type DNA, including binding, are governed by the carboxyl-terminal portion of Int (residues 65–356). This autonomously functioning protein, called C65, has been cloned and purified (20.Tirumalai R.S. Kwon H. Cardente E. Ellenberger T. Landy A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 513-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and, unless noted otherwise, is considered exclusively in this paper. Its activity on core-type DNA is not only undiminished but is actually enhanced by separation from the amino-terminal domain (31.Sarkar D. Radman-Livaja M. Landy A. EMBO J. 2000; 20: 1203-1212Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To monitor the efficiency of Int C65 binding and DNA cleavage, we took advantage of a suicide core site (32.Nunes-Düby S.E. Matsumoto L. Landy A. Cell. 1987; 50: 779-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As diagrammed in Fig. 2, these substrates contain a 3′ terminus three bases from the scissile phosphate. When Int cleaves this substrate (via formation of a covalent 3′-phosphotyrosine linkage) it generates a 3-base oligonucleotide that diffuses away from theatt site DNA. Loss of the oligonucleotide removes the 5′-OH nucleophile that would otherwise attack the phosphotyrosine bond to reform the phosphodiester DNA linkage and release Int. In the absence of the 5′-OH nucleophile, the phosphotyrosine linkage is stable, and the covalent complex is readily monitored or isolated by gel electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide. In the experiments reported here we used short synthetic oligonucleotides (22/23- or 30/34-mers) containing a “half-att site.” This consists of a single 8-bp core-type Int-binding site and a portion of the 7-bp overlap region. The cleaved strands (top strands in all of the figures) contained 3 bases of the overlap region, which are lost upon Int cleavage. The bottom strands contained either 4 or the full 7 bases of the overlap region. We have not observed any differences in binding or cleavage efficiency between substrates with 4–7 bases in the bottom strand of the overlap region nor between substrates containing 12versus 20 bp preceding the Int-binding site (data not shown). We constructed 11 half-att site substrates, each containing a 4-thioT substitution at a different position and labeled with32P at the 5′ terminus of the top strands. Because we are incorporating a thio analog, and in some cases substituting a thymine for the canonical base, we tested each substrate for its ability to be cleaved by wild-type Int and form a suicide covalent complex (as diagrammed in Fig. 2) which is seen as a band with slower electrophoretic mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide than the free DNA. Most of the substrates were very efficient at forming covalent complex (Fig. 3 A). (A lane showing cleavage of the unsubstituted att site was not included in the gel shown in Fig. 3 but in similar experiments its efficiency is approximately the same as att sites T3, B4, B6, T8, T9, T11, B11, T12, and B12). The B5 att site was quite depressed for Int cleavage, and the T4 att site was not cleaved at all by Int. To test for photo-cross-linking efficiency, each of the attsites was incubated with Int C65 Y342F (C65F), a mutant in which the active site nucleophile, tyrosine 342, has been substituted by phenylalanine. We have shown previously that this mutant is completely defective in DNA cleavage as assayed by topoisomerase activity, covalent complex formation with suicide substrates, and resolution of Holliday junction recombination intermediates (14.Pargellis C.A. Nunes-Düby S.E. Moitoso de Vargas L. Landy A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7678-7685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C65F-att site reactions were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C and then irradiated at 4 °C on a pre-chilled porcelain plate with 366 nm UV light (see “Experimental Procedures”). The formation of photo-induced Int C65F covalent adducts was assayed by gel electrophoresis alongside of the wild-type covalent suicide-cleavage complexes (Fig. 3 A). Quantitation of the percent photo-cross-linking is shown in Fig. 3 B along with the position of each 4-thioT in the half-att site substrates. Those att sites such as B5 and T4, for which the 4-thioT substitution clearly interfered with Int cleavage (and/or binding), would not be expected to yield efficient photo-cross-linking, and indeed they are very poor. Their observed level of cross-linking is approximately equal to that of the unsubstituted core-type site (0.5%) (data not shown). Whereas these two substitutions may be poor photo-cross-linking substrates because the 4-thioTs intrude too severely into the Int-binding space (to the point of preventing Int cleavage), there will be other substitutions that are poor photo-cross-linking substrates because the thio group is too far from the bound Int (or from a reactive residue within Int). In this category of att sites, which are cleaved efficiently by Int but not efficiently photo-cross-linked (<3%), we find the B6, T8, T9, B11, and B12 substitutions. The group of att sites yielding intermediate photo-cross-linking efficiencies (∼5%) consists of the B4, T11, and T12 substitutions. The T3 substitution, which consistently yielded photo-cross-linking efficiencies of ∼20%, was clearly the best of those we tested. It should be noted that the level of cross-linking of even the poorest 4-thioT substrates is still well above the 0.5% that is obtained with unsubstituted attsites (data not shown).
