Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that murine fibroblasts which overexpress both these tyrosine kinases display synergistic increases in DNA synthesis, soft agar growth, and tumor formation in nude mice, and increased phosphorylation of the receptor substrates Shc and phospholipase γ as compared with single overexpressors. These parameters correlated with the ability of c-Src and EGFR to form an EGF-dependent heterocomplex in vivo. Here we provide evidence that association between c-Src and EGFR can occur directly, as shown by receptor overlay experiments, and that it results in the appearance of two novel tyrosine phosphorylations on the receptor that are seen both in vitro and in vivo following EGF stimulation. Edman degradation analyses and co-migration of synthetic peptides with EGFR-derived tryptic phosphopeptides identify these sites as Tyr845 and Tyr1101. Tyr1101 lies within the carboxyl-terminal region of the EGFR among sites of receptor autophosphorylation, while Tyr845 resides in the catalytic domain, in a position analogous to Tyr416 of c-Src. Phosphorylation of Tyr416 and homologous residues in other tyrosine kinase receptors has been shown to be required for or to increase catalytic activity, suggesting that c-Src can influence EGFR activity by mediating phosphorylation of Tyr845. Indeed, EGF-induced phosphorylation of Tyr845 was increased in MDA468 human breast cancer cells engineered to overexpress c-Src as compared with parental MDA 468 cells. Furthermore, transient expression of a Y845F variant EGFR in murine fibroblasts resulted in an ablation of EGF-induced DNA synthesis to nonstimulated levels. Together, these data support the hypothesis that c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr845 is involved in regulation of receptor function, as well as in tumor progression.

These events result in the trans-(auto)-phosphorylation of multiple Tyr residues in the COOH-terminal tail of the molecule that serve as binding sites for cytosolic signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (3Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Five sites of in vivoautophosphorylation have been identified in the EGFR: three major (Tyr1068, Tyr1148, and Tyr1173) and two minor (Tyr992 and Tyr1086) (4Downward J. Parker P.

Binding of these or other signaling proteins to the receptor and/or their phosphorylation results in transmission of subsequent signaling events that culminate in DNA synthesis and cell division. c-Src is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that functions as a co-transducer of transmembrane signals emanating from a variety of polypeptide growth factor receptors, including the EGFR (see Refs. 10Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholarand 11Wilson L.K. Luttrell D.K. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell.

Overexpression of wild type (wt) and dominant negative forms of c-Src in murine C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts that express normal levels of receptor, as well as experiments involving the microinjection of antibodies specific for Src family members, have revealed that c-Src is a critical component of EGF-induced mitogenesis (10Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 11Wilson L.K. Luttrell D.K. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell.

Cells which express high levels of EGFR become transformed upon continual exposure to EGF (14Velu T.J. Beguinot L. Vass W.C. Willingham M.C. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Lowy D.R. Science. 1987; 238: 1408-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and co-overexpression of c-Src in these cells dramatically potentiates their growth and malignant properties (15Maa M.-C. Leu T.-H. McCarley D.J. Schatzman R.C. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Together, these findings indicate that c-Src co-operates with the EGFR in the processes of both mitogenesis and transformation. Subsequent studies in 10T1/2 cells revealed that potentiation of EGF-induced growth and tumorigenesis by c-Src, which is observed only in cells overexpressing both c-Src and the receptor, correlates with the EGF-dependent formation of a heterocomplex containing c-Src and activated EGFR, the appearance of two unique in vitro non-autophosphorylation sites on receptors in complex with c-Src, and enhanced in vivo tyrosyl phosphorylation of the receptor substrates, PLCγ and Shc (15Maa M.-C. Leu T.-H. McCarley D.J. Schatzman R.C. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that c-Src-dependent phosphorylations on the EGFR can result in hyperactivation of receptor kinase activity, as measured by the enhanced ability of the receptor to phosphorylate its cognate substrates. This report identifies Tyr845 and Tyr1101 as c-Src-dependent sites of phosphorylation, which are present both in vitro andin vivo in receptor from 10T1/2 double overexpressing fibroblasts and from MDA468 human breast cancer cells. In the MDA468 cells, overexpression of c-Src results in a further increase in the phosphorylation of Tyr845, indicating that c-Src either phosphorylates this site directly or activates a secondary kinase which is responsible. Moreover, cells which transiently express EGFR bearing a Tyr to Phe mutation at Tyr845 are impaired in their ability to synthesize DNA in response to EGF, suggesting that this c-Src mediated phosphorylation site is important for receptor function. The derivation and characterization of the clonal C3H10T1/2 murine fibroblast cell lines used in this study, Neo (control), 5H (c-Src overexpressor), NeoR1 (human EGFR overexpressor), and 5HR11 (c-Src/EGFR double overexpressor) have been described previously (10Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 11Wilson L.K. Luttrell D.K. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1536-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Roche S. Koegl M. Barone M.V. Roussel M.F. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5H and 5HR11 express equal levels of c-Src (∼25-fold over endogenous), and NeoR and 5HR11 express nearly equal levels of cell surface receptors (∼2 × 105receptors/cell or ∼40-fold over endogenous). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), containing 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and G418 (400 μg/ml). When indicated, confluent cultures were starved of serum overnight, prior to stimulation with 100 ng/ml purified mouse EGF (Sigma). To create cells transiently overexpressing HER1 which contained a Tyr to Phe mutation at position 845, aDraIII-BstEII fragment from pCO11 (gift of Laura Beguinot), including the mutation at position 845, was subcloned into a pcDNA vector containing wild type human HER1 (gift of Dr. Stuart Decker, Parke Davis, Ann Arbor, MI). Neo control 10T1/2 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with 30 μg of Superfect (Qiagen, Chatsworth CA) and 4 μg of vector, wt HER1, or Y845F HER1 plasmid DNA according to the manufacturers' directions and incubated for 48 h. For overexpression of c-Src in breast cancer cells, pcDNAc-Src was constructed by inserting the c-Src XhoI fragment from an existing pVZneo vector into the multicloning site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). MDA468 cells, obtained from N. Rosen (Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York), were maintained in DMEM plus 5% serum. MDA468 cells stably overexpressing chicken c-Src (clone MDA468c-Src) were generated by LipofectinTM (Life Technologies, Inc.)-mediated gene transfer of pcDNAc-Src into parental MDA468 cells and selection with 400 μg/ml G418. Parental MDA468 cells overexpress c-Src approximately 5-fold, as compared with Hs578Bst normal breast epithelial cells, and contain approximately 106 receptors/cell (Ref.16Biscardi J.S. Belsches A.P. Parsons S.J. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 21: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), 2N. Rosen, personal communication. while MDA468c-Src cells overexpress c-Src approximately 25-fold over levels found in normal breast epithelial cells. EGFR-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 3A and 4A were provided by D. McCarley and R. Schatzman of Syntex Research, Palo Alto, CA. Their derivation has been described previously and their epitopes have been mapped to residues 889–944 and 1052–1134, respectively. EGFR-specific mAb F4, directed against amino acids 985–996, was obtained from Sigma. GD11 antibody is directed against the SH3 domain of c-Src and was characterized previously in our laboratory (17Parsons S.J. McCarley D. Ely C.M. Benjamin D.C. Parsons J.T. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 701-705Crossref Google Scholar, 18Parsons S.J. McCarley D.J. Raymond V.W. Parsons J.T. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 755-758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Q9 antibody was raised in rabbits against the COOH-terminal peptide of c-Src (residues 522–533) and exhibits a higher affinity for c-Src than for other Src family members (19Katagiri T. Ting J.P. Dy R. Prokop C. Cohen P. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4914-4922Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Oddie K.M. Litz J.S. Balserak J.C. Payne D.M. Creutz C.E. Parsons S.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 24: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Antiphosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antibody (4G10) was purchased from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Negative control antibodies included pooled and purified normal rabbit or mouse immunoglobulin. Methods for immunoprecipitation, Western immunoblotting, and in vitro kinase assays have been described previously (10Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 11Wilson L.K. Luttrell D.K. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell.

A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed either in CHAPS detergent buffer (10 mm CHAPS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5% aprotinin), or in RIPA detergent buffer (0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5% aprotinin). Protein concentrations of detergent lysates were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). 500 μg of cell lysate was used for immunoprecipitations, and 50 μg was used for Western blotting. For Western immunoblotting, binding of primary murine or rabbit antibodies to Immobilon membranes was detected with either125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) or 125I-protein A (NEN) used at 1 μCi/ml, specific activity 100 μCi/ml. For kinase assays, immunoprecipitates were prepared in and washed twice in CHAPS buffer, then washed twice with HBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Each kinase reaction was conducted in 20-μl volumes containing 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, NEN) for 10 min at room temperature. Incubations were terminated by addition of sample buffer, and labeled products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The construction and preparation of GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 domain of c-Src was described previously (21Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). To reconstitute binding between tyrosyl-phosphorylated EGFR and the SH2 domain of c-Src, 2 μg of immobilized GST-c-SrcSH2 fusion protein was incubated with 100 μg of 10T1/2 cell lysate protein prepared in RIPA buffer. After 3 h gentle mixing at 4 °C, beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and boiled. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon, and immunoblotted with either the Tyr(P) or the 3A/4A or F4 (Sigma) monoclonal EGFR antibodies. To assess direct binding of GST-c-SrcSH2 to the EGFR, receptor from 500 μg of cell lysate protein in RIPA buffer was immunoprecipitated with 3A/4A mAbs. The resulting EGFR immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon membranes, and incubated with 1 mg/ml purified GST-c-SrcSH2 fusion protein in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was then probed with 1 μg/ml affinity purified, polyclonal rabbit anti-GST antiserum in blocking buffer, 3J. H. Chang and S. Parsons, unpublished data. and immunoglobulin binding was detected by 125I-protein A. NeoR1 or 5HR11 cells were grown to 50–75% confluency in 150-mm dishes, washed with phosphate-free DMEM, and incubated for 18 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing 0.1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) in a final volume of 10 ml. For pervanadate treatment, labeling medium was adjusted to a concentration of 3 mmH2O2 and 5 μmNa3VO4 just prior to EGF stimulation. Cells were stimulated in the presence of pervanadate by addition of 100 ng/ml EGF to the labeling medium for 5 min, washed twice with phosphate-free DMEM, and lysed in CHAPS detergent buffer. Extract from an entire plate (approximately 1–2 mg of protein) was immunoprecipitated with c-Src or EGFR-specific antibodies as described above. Immunoprecipitates of in vitro or in vivo 32P-labeled EGFR were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The EGFR was localized by autoradiography, excised from the gel, and digested with trypsin as described by Boyle et al. (22Boyle W.L. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Phosphotryptic peptides were separated by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 in the first dimension and ascending chromatography in the second dimension on cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates. Chromatography buffer contained isobutyric acid, 1-butanol, pyridine, acetic acid, H2O (125:3.8:9.6:5.8:55.8). Migration of synthetic phosphopeptides was detected by spraying the dried TLC plate with a hypochlorite solution consisting of sequential sprays with 10% commercial Clorox, 95% ethanol, 1% potassium iodide, and saturatedo-tolidine in 1.5 m acetic acid, as described in Stewart and Young (23Stewart J.M. Young J.D. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL1984Google Scholar). For HPLC analysis of peptides derived from the EGFR associated with c-Src,32P-labeled phosphotryptic peptides were prepared as above and suspended in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were injected into a Perkin-Elmer Series 4 Liquid Chromatograph equipped with a Vydac C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) and eluted with increasing concentrations of acetonitrile (0 to 100%) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, as described by Wasilenko et al. (24Wasilenko W.J. Payne M. Fitzgerald D.L. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 500-μl fractions were collected, and Cerenkov counts of each fraction were determined. Fractions containing peptides “0” and “3” were identified by two-dimensional TLC analysis for their ability to co-migrate with the appropriate peptide in a mixture of total in vitrophosphorylated receptor peptides. Appropriate fractions were then lyophilized and subjected to Edman degradation. HPLC fractions of 32P-labeled EGFR phosphotryptic peptides or spots eluted from TLC plates were subjected to automated Edman degradation, as performed by the University of Virginia Biomolecular Research Facility. Briefly, phosphorylated peptides were coupled to a Sequelon aryl amine membrane (25Coull J.M. Pappin D.J.C. Mark J. Aebersold R. Koster H. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), washed with 4 × 1 ml of 27% acetonitrile, 9% trifluoroacetic acid, and 2 × 1 ml of 50% methanol, and transferred to an applied Biosystems 470A sequenator using the cartridge inverted as suggested by Stokoe et al. (26Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The cycle used for sequencing was based on that of Meyer et al. (27Meyer H.E. Hoffman-Posorske E. Donella-Deana A. Korte H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 206-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but modified by direct collection of anilinothiazolinone amino acids in neet trifluoroacetic acid as described by Russo et al. (28Russo G.L. Vandenberg M.T. Yu I.J. Bae Y.-S. Franza Jr., B.R. Marshak D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20317-20325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity was measured by Cerenkov counting. Phosphorylated peptides (corresponding to residues GMN(Y-P)LEDR, candidate for peptide 3; or E(Y-P)HAEGGK, candidate for peptide 0) were synthesized by the University of Virginia Biomolecular Research Facility. Synthetic peptides were mixed with oxidized in vitro labeled phosphotryptic peptides from c-Src-associated EGFR, separated on cellulose TLC plates, and visualized by spraying with the hypochlorite solution as described above. One candidate for peptide 3 (GMNYLEDR) was synthesized as a phosphopeptide and tested for comigration as above. Another candidate for peptide 3 (DPHY1101QDPHSTAVGNPEYLNTVQPTCVNSTF DSPAHWAQK), which was too large to chemically synthesize, was tested by further digestion ofin vitro labeled peptide 3 with a proline-directed protease (Seikagaku, Rockville, MD), according to the method of Boyle et al. (22Boyle W.L. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). In brief, the spot corresponding to peptide 3 was scraped off the TLC plate, eluted with pH 1.9 buffer, and digested with 5 units of proline-directed protease in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate at pH 7.6 at 37 °C for 1 h. Peptides were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis as described above. Neo control cells, which had been transfected with cDNAs encoding wild type EGFR, Y845F EGFR, or vector alone were cultured for 48 h, then serum starved for an additional 30 h prior to the administration of 100 μm BrdUrd and either 100 ng/ml EGF or 10% fetal calf serum in fresh growth medium. Treated cells were incubated for 18 h and co-stained for HER1 expression and BrdUrd incorporation as described by the manufacturer of the BrdUrd-specific antibody (Boehringer Mannheim). Briefly, fixed cells were treated with 2n HCl for 1 h at 37 °C and incubated with a mixture of primary antibodies (1:100 dilution of the HER1-specific Ab-4, and a 1:15 dilution of anti-BrdUrd mouse antibody in serum-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C), followed by incubation with a mixture of secondary antibodies (75 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and 4 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG) for 1 h at 37 °C. Both secondary reagents were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated a synergistic interaction between c-Src and the EGFR which led to increased cell growth and tumor development (10Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 11Wilson L.K. Luttrell D.K. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1536-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Maa M.-C. Leu T.-H. McCarley D.J. Schatzman R.C. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This functional synergism was most striking when cells overexpressed both c-Src and the EGFR (5HR cells) and correlated with the ability of c-Src and the EGFR to form specific, EGF-dependent heterocomplexes in vivo. The formation of this c-Src·EGFR complex raises the question of whether binding between c-Src and the EGFR occurs directly, or is mediated by another protein present in the complex. To test whether association could be mediated by a Tyr(P)-SH2 interaction, lysates from unstimulated and stimulated Neo, 5H, NeoR, or 5HR cells were incubated with a GST-c-SrcSH2 bacterial fusion protein linked to agarose beads, and precipitated proteins were probed with Tyr(P) antibody. Fig.1, panel A, lanes 4and 8, show that a tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein of 170 kDa was precipitated by GST-c-SrcSH2 from extracts of cells overexpressing the EGFR after activation of the receptor with EGF. This 170-kDa protein co-migrated with the EGFR precipitated with receptor-specific mAbs 3A/4A (data not shown). Other proteins that bound c-SrcSH2 included p125FAK (21Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), which was detected in all the cell lysates, a 75–80-kDa protein, cortactin, which was most prominent in 5H cells (30Maa M.-C. Wilson L.K. Moyers J.S. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2429-2438PubMed Google Scholar), and a 62-kDa protein, presumed to be related to the 62-kDa “DOK” protein associated with p120Ras-GAP(31Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 32Chang J.-H. Wilson L.K. Moyers J.S. Zhang K. Parsons S.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 959-967PubMed Google Scholar, 33Carpino N.

Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). These results suggest that in vivo, multiple Tyr(P)-containing proteins in addition to the EGFR are capable of interacting with c-Src via its SH2 domain and contribute to the highly tumorigenic phenotype of the double overexpressing cells. Incubation of cell extracts with GST-beads alone resulted in no detectable binding of Tyr(P)-containing proteins (data not shown). To confirm that the 170-kDa protein was indeed the EGFR, lysates prepared from unstimulated and stimulated NeoR and 5HR cells were precipitated with immobilized GST-c-SrcSH2, and bound proteins were immunoblotted with EGFR-specific mAbs 3A/4A. Fig. 1, Panel B, demonstrates that receptor antibody detected the 170-kDa protein only in stimulated cells, as in Panel A, confirming its identity as the EGFR. To test if the interaction between the activated EGFR and c-SrcSH2 could be direct, receptor immunoprecipitates were subjected to a “Far Western” overlay experiment, using GST-c-SrcSH2, GST-specific antibody, and125I-protein A. Fig. 1, Panel C, lanes 2 and4, shows that GST-c-SrcSH2 bound the EGFR and, as predicted, the interaction required activation by EGF. GST alone exhibited no binding (data not shown). Panel D verified that nearly equal amounts of receptor were present in all immunoprecipitates. These results provide evidence for the involvement of SH2-Tyr(P) interactions in the formation of the EGFR·c-Src complex. Overexpression of both EGFR and c-Src in 10T1/2 cells results in increased tyrosyl phosphorylation of receptor substrates, PLCγ and Shc, following EGF treatment (15Maa M.-C. Leu T.-H. McCarley D.J. Schatzman R.C. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the c-Src-associated receptor is modified in some manner as to increase its kinase activity. To examine the receptor for novel phosphorylations, the in vitro phosphorylated, c-Src-associated 170-kDa protein was excised from the gel and subjected to two-dimensional phosphotryptic peptide analysis. The phosphopeptide map of c-Src-associated receptor was then compared with the map of the free receptor, immunoprecipitated with receptor antibody. Fig.2, Panels A and B,demonstrate that the maps are nearly identical; however, two additional phosphorylations (designated peptides 0 and 3) were seen in the map of the EGFR complexed with c-Src, suggesting that c-Src was responsible for their phosphorylation. Consistent with this notion, two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis of the in vitro labeled EGFR demonstrated that peptides 0 and 3 contained only phosphotyrosine (data not shown). Panel C shows that the two novel phosphopeptides were also detected in the receptor found in complex with c-Src from32P metabolically labeled 5HR cells that had been treated with pervanadate and EGF for 5 min. These data indicate that two phosphorylations occur on the EGFR both in vitro andin vivo when c-Src becomes physically associated with the receptor following EGF stimulation. Initial attempts to detect peptides 0 and 3 in receptor immunoprecipitations from 32P-labeled NeoR or 5HR cells yielded phosphopeptide maps that contained peptide 3 but no or barely detectable levels of peptide 0 (Fig. 3,Panels A and C). Neither could peptide 3 nor peptide 0 be detected reproducibly in receptor that was associated with c-Src from 5HR cells (data not shown). Furthermore, in receptor immunoprecipitations, the levels of peptide 3 derived from NeoRversus 5HR cells appeared nearly equal (compare Panels A and C), suggesting that peptide 3 may not be anin vivo, c-Src-dependent site of phosphorylation. In these experiments, lysates were prepared in CHAPS buffer containing a mixture of conventional protease and phosphatase inhibitors, including orth"

In the anterior region, in contrast, the carboxyl-truncated form of Ci generated by protein processing represses Hh expression. In vertebrates, three Ci-related transcription factors (glioblastoma gene products (GLIs) 1, 2, and 3) were identified, but their functional difference in Hh signal transduction is unknown. Here, we report distinct roles for GLI1 and GLI3 in Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. GLI3 containing both repression and activation domains acts both as an activator and a repressor, as does Ci, whereas GLI1 contains only the activation domain. Consistent with this, GLI3, but not GLI1, is processed to generate the repressor form. Transcriptional co-activator CBP binds to GLI3, but not to GLI1. The<i>trans</i>-activating capacity of GLI3 is positively and negatively regulated by Shh and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively, through a specific region of GLI3, which contains the CBP-binding domain and the phosphorylation sites of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. GLI3 directly binds to the<i>Gli1</i> promoter and induces <i>Gli1</i> transcription in response to Shh. Thus, GLI3 may act as a mediator of Shh signaling in the activation of the target gene <i>Gli1</i>."

https://openalex.org/W1993606042,"Many substrates for P-glycoprotein, an ABC transporter that mediates multidrug resistance in mammalian cells, have been shown to stimulate its ATPase activity in vitro. In the present study, we used this property as a criterion to search for natural and artificial substrates and/or allosteric regulators of ABCR, the rod photoreceptor-specific ABC transporter responsible for Stargardt disease, an early onset macular degeneration. ABCR was immunoaffinity purified to apparent homogeneity from bovine rod outer segments and reconstituted into liposomes. All-trans-retinal, a candidate ligand, stimulates the ATPase activity of ABCR 3–4-fold, with a half-maximal effect at 10–15 μm. 11-cis- and 13-cis-retinal show similar activity. All-trans-retinal stimulates the ATPase activity of ABCR with Michaelis-Menten behavior indicative of simple noncooperative binding that is associated with a rate-limiting enzyme-substrate intermediate in the pathway of ATP hydrolysis. Among 37 structurally diverse non-retinoid compounds, including nine previously characterized substrates or sensitizers of P-glycoprotein, only four show significant ATPase stimulation when tested at 20 μm. The dose-response curves of these four compounds are indicative of multiple binding sites and/or modes of interaction with ABCR. Two of these compounds, amiodarone and digitonin, can act synergistically with all-trans-retinal, implying that they interact with a site or sites on ABCR different from the one with which all-trans-retinal interacts. Unlike retinal, amiodarone appears to interact with both free and ATP-bound ABCR. Together with clinical observations on Stargardt disease and the localization of ABCR to rod outer segment disc membranes, these data suggest that retinoids, and most likely retinal, are the natural substrates for transport by ABCR in rod outer segments. These observations have significant implications for understanding the visual cycle and the pathogenesis of Stargardt disease and for the identification of compounds that could modify the natural history of Stargardt disease or other retinopathies associated with impaired ABCR function.

Newsome D.A. Retinal Dystrophies and Degenerations. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 135-159Google Scholar). Affected individuals experience central vision loss and a progressive bilateral atrophy of the macular region of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).1 A distinctive feature of Stargardt disease is the accumulation of fluorescent, shortwave absorbing material in the RPE, which appears in postmortem samples as lipofuscin-like deposits (2Klein B.A. Krill A.E.

The spectrum of mutations identified thus far in Stargardt disease patients suggests that these individuals carry at least one partially functional allele. By contrast, some cases of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, a disease characterized by a progressive degeneration of the rod-rich peripheral retina, are associated with homozygosity of frameshift or splice site mutations in the ABCR gene which are likely to result in complete loss of ABCR function (12Martinez-Mir A.

An association between a subset of subjects with age-related macular degeneration and variant alleles of the ABCR gene has been reported (14Allikmets R. Shroyer N.F. Singh N. Seddon J.M. Lewis R.A.

Science. 1997; 277: 1805-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), but interpretation of the data has been controversial (15Dryja T.P. Briggs C.E. Berson E. Rosenfeld P.J. Abitbol M. Science. 1998; 279: 1107Crossref Google Scholar). Expression of the ABCR gene is confined exclusively to retinal rod photoreceptors, and the ABCR protein is localized to the rim and incisures of rod outer segment discs, where it is present at a molar ratio of approximately 1:120 with rhodopsin (16Illing M. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10303-10310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 17Azarian S.M. Travis G.H.

Dunbar B. Forrester J.V. Fothergill J.E. Converse C.A. Curr. Eye Res. 1997; 16: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This highly specific localization suggests that ABCR may transport a molecule or ion that plays a specialized role in photoreceptor homeostasis. Although small quantities of ABCR may also be present in the rod outer segment plasma membrane, the localization of the majority of ABCR to the internal disc membranes suggests that the relevant transport event is between the lumenal and cytosolic faces of the disc membrane. Because outer segment turnover occurs via RPE phagocytosis, a derangement in this transport mechanism (with the resulting accumulation of one or more compounds within the outer segment) could plausibly explain the progressive accumulation of material within the RPE in Stargardt disease. From the preceding discussion it is clear that identifying the molecule or ion transported by ABCR is a prerequisite to understanding the normal role of ABCR and the pathogenesis of Stargardt disease. To date, substrates have been identified for only a few of the over 30 known mammalian ABC transporters. In these few cases, critical information regarding the identity of the substrate(s) has often come from genetic studies. For example, the defect in chloride resorption in humans with cystic fibrosis provided the first indication that CFTR mediates chloride transport (20Quinton P.M. Nature. 1983; 301: 421-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and mutations in the human canalicular organic anion transporter, SPGP, have been found in a subset of patients with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, an inherited disorder of hepatobiliary excretion (21Strautnieks S.S. Bull L.N. Knisley A.S. Kocoshis S.A. Dahl N. Arnell H. Sokal E. Dahan K. Childs S. Ling V. Tanner M.S. Kagalwalla A.F. Nemeth A. Pawlowska J. Baker A. Mieli-Vergani G. Freimer N.B. Gardiner R.M.

For P-glycoprotein and its close relatives, overexpression of the corresponding genes or cloned cDNAs in a variety of mammalian cells was found to confer resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, and targeted disruption of these genes in the mouse shows that MDR1A is responsible for extrusion of hydrophobic compounds across the blood-brain barrier (22Schinkel A.H.

Cell. 1994; 77: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). For a number of transporters, including CFTR, SPGP, and P-glycoprotein, these observations have been extended by experiments in vitro. Purified and reconstituted CFTR shows chloride channel activity (23Bear C.E. Li C. Kartner N. Bridges R.J. Jensen T.J. Ramjeesingh M. Riordan J.R.

In thein vitro experiments with P-glycoprotein, ATP hydrolysis is stimulated to different extents by compounds that are extruded by this protein in living cells. A second class of compounds, called chemosensitizers, increases the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapeutic agents and also stimulates ATPase activity in vitro, possibly by uncoupling ATP hydrolysis and substrate extrusion. This work suggests that it may be possible to identify substrates and allosteric regulators of other ABC transporters by searching for compounds that stimulate the ATPase activity of the purified and reconstituted transporters. To characterize the biochemical properties of ABCR with the goal of identifying its substrate, we report here a procedure for solubilizing and functionally reconstituting the purified protein into lipid membranes. Several compounds, including amiodarone, digitonin, and various geometric isomers of retinal, produce a significant increase in ATPase activity of this preparation. Interestingly, amiodarone and digitonin greatly enhance the stimulatory activity of all-trans-retinal but not of each other, suggesting that they act by a similar mechanism which differs from the mechanism by which all-trans-retinal acts. These data, together with the clinical and histological data summarized above, suggest a model in which ABCR is involved in the recycling of retinoids that attends photoactivation of rhodopsin (the visual cycle).

ROS were prepared from dark adapted and frozen bovine retinas under dim red light as described (31Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Aliquots were stored at −80 °C in the dark. Monoclonal antibody Rim 3F4, which recognizes a linear epitope near the C terminus of bovine ABCR (16Illing M. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10303-10310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), was purified from ascites fluid by caprylic acid precipitation (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 300Google Scholar) and conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a ratio of 1 mg of antibody per ml of resin. The resin was discarded after each use to improve reproducibility in the purification of ABCR. All purification procedures prior to the elution step were performed under red dim light at 4 °C to minimize aggregation of photobleached rhodopsin. Purified ROS from 4–8 bovine retinas were diluted into greater than 10 volumes 1× phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and solubilized in 1.4 ml of ROS/CHAPS buffer (10% glycerol, 0.75% CHAPS, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5 mg/ml crude brain PE, and 0.5 mg/ml egg PC, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The sample was rotated at 4 °C in the dark for 1 h to completely solubilize the ROS membranes. Insoluble material was removed by microcentrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was added to 200 μl of Rim 3F4-Sepharose and rotated in the dark at 4 °C for 3 h. The resin was recovered by microcentrifugation at 3000 rpm and washed three times for 1 min and then two times for 20 min (with gentle rotation) using 1 ml of ice-cold ROS/CHAPS buffer. Three successive elutions were performed at 4 °C using 80 μl each of 0.2 mg/ml of a peptide (H2N-NETYDLPLHPRTAG-COOH) containing the Rim 3F4 epitope (16Illing M. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10303-10310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) in ROS/CHAPS buffer for a total of 45 min. An irrelevant peptide, JN50 (H2N-MLRNNLGNSSDC-CONH2), was used as a control for the specificity of elution. 240 μl of immunoaffinity purified ABCR in ROS/CHAPS buffer was added to a premixed solution containing 30 μl of 15% octyl glucoside and 90 μl 50 mg/ml sonicated lipid in 25 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. The sample was mixed, incubated on ice for 30 min, and then rapidly diluted into 2 ml of reconstitution buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) at room temperature and incubated at room temperature for an additional 2 min. To remove detergent, the sample was passed (at room temperature) over a 2-ml Extracti-Gel (Pierce) column that had been thoroughly prewashed with the reconstitution buffer. The flow-through was stored on ice. Light microscopic examination of the reconstituted preparation stained with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetraethylindocarbocyanine shows a heterogeneous distribution of vesicle sizes. Unless noted otherwise all reconstitutions reported here were performed with swine brain polar lipids. ATPase assays were performed using ABCR that had been purified from ROS and reconstituted into liposomes on the same day. ATPase assays were performed in 300 μl of reconstitution buffer supplemented with MgCl2 to a final concentration of 3 mm. Appropriate dilutions and/or mixtures of test compounds were prepared in ethanol and were added to 0.1% of the volume of the ATPase reaction; control reactions received the same volume of ethanol alone. The reactions were started by the addition of 30 μl of 10× ATP mix containing 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 500 μm ATP with 50 μCi/ml of 3000 Ci/mmol of [γ-32P]ATP, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. For experiments in which the ATP concentration varied, the [32P]ATP was held constant at 5 μCi/ml. At the starting and final time points, triplicate samples of 50 μl were added to 200 μl of 10% activated charcoal in 10 mm HCl, vortexed vigorously for 2 min, and microcentrifuged to pellet the charcoal. 50 μl of the resulting supernatant was counted. For experiments to differentiate the effects of retinal isomers, the ATPase assay was manipulated under dim red light and incubated in the dark. All other ATPase assays are performed in room light. Data points in Lineweaver-Burk plots were fitted to a straight line by a least squares criterion; no attempt was made to to fit the data to more complex curves. All procedures were performed under dim red light or in the dark. Retinal, retinol, and retinoic acid were dissolved in ethanol, and for each experiment their integrity was monitored by determining an absorption spectrum. Retinoids were handled in glass vials to minimize absorption to plastic. For storage, aliquots were dried under argon and maintained in the dark at −80 °C. Oxidized all-trans-retinal was prepared by exposing a sample of all-trans-retinal in ethanol to air at 37 °C overnight in a sealed glass vial. These were performed as described (18Sun H. Nathans J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed with affinity purified rabbit anti-human ABCR antibodies and were standardized using bovine ROS. The purification strategy employed in this work is essentially that of Illing et al. (16Illing M. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10303-10310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) modified by the use of a mixture of CHAPS, PC, and PE (ROS/CHAPS buffer) for the solubilization and chromatography steps. Mixtures of CHAPS/PE or CHAPS/PC have been used previously to solubilize and purify several photoreceptor membrane proteins in native form, including cone visual pigments (33Okano T. Fukada Y. Artamonov I.D. Yoshizawa T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8848-8856Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the cGMP-gated channel (34Cook N.J. Hanke W. Kaupp U.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and the Na/Ca-K exchanger (35Cook N.J. Kaupp U.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11382-11388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, we observed that the ATPase activity from the ABCR preparation (see below) was higher if solubilization and purification were performed with CHAPS than with either octyl glucoside or dodecyl maltoside. In brief, the ABCR purification involves (a) purifying bovine ROS on a sucrose step gradient, (b) solubilizing the ROS in a mixture of CHAPS, PC, and PE (ROS/CHAPS buffer), (c) selectively binding ABCR to monoclonal antibody Rim 3F4-conjugated Sepharose, and (d) selectively eluting ABCR with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the Rim 3F4 epitope. All but the last of these steps are carried out under dim red light to minimize denaturation and nonspecific trapping of rhodopsin. Fig. 1 A shows the results of the purification procedure. The specificity of the immunoaffinity purification step was assessed by halving a sample of Rim 3F4-Sepharose to which ABCR had been bound and carrying out parallel elutions with either the Rim 3F4 peptide or an irrelevant peptide, JN50. The material eluted with the JN50 peptide will be referred to throughout this paper as “mock-eluted.” Coomassie staining and Western blotting show that the ABCR polypeptide, with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 250 kDa, is eluted with the Rim 3F4 peptide but is barely detectable following elution with the JN50 peptide (Fig. 1 A). Although we cannot rule out the presence of minor ROS-derived contaminants in the final immunoaffinity purified preparation, they are likely to be considerably less abundant than ABCR as judged by the apparent homogeneity of the ABCR preparation. The extensive washing of the column-bound material should remove all low molecular weight compounds initially present in the ROS membrane sample. Reconstitution of ABCR into brain lipid membranes was accomplished by gently mixing immunoaffinity purified ABCR in ROS/CHAPS buffer with an excess of sonicated swine brain polar lipids (referred to hereafter as “brain lipid”). Efficient removal of CHAPS with a high yield of ABCR ATPase activity was most effectively achieved by absorption to Extracti-Gel resin (Pierce). This method of detergent removal is rapid and efficient and results in minimal losses of ABCR, most likely because the proteolipid complexes are effectively excluded by the low molecular weight pore size of the Extracti-Gel resin. In developing this protocol we have avoided ultracentrifugation of the reconstituted ABCR proteolipid. This circumvents problems associated with inefficient recovery of membranes in the presence of 10% glycerol, used here as a protein stabilizer, and with dispersing a compact proteolipid pellet. Several other methods for detergent removal and proteolipid formation were found to be less effective for reconstitution of ABCR as follows: rapid dilution (36Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by ultracentrifugation resulted in inefficient removal of detergent and poor recovery of proteoliposomes; gel filtration followed by ultracentrifugation (26Shapiro A. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Dunn S. Thuynsma R.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 757-763Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) resulted in loss of ABCR ATPase activity; and detergent removal by binding to Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad) followed by ultracentrifugation (38von Dippe P. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14812-14816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) efficiently removed detergent but was accompanied by significant absorption of ABCR protein to the beads. Purified ABCR solubilized in ROS/CHAPS buffer or reconstituted in brain lipid possesses considerable ATPase activity (Fig. 1 B and see Fig. 7 below). We ascribe this activity to ABCR because it is far lower in the mock-eluted sample. In the experiments described below in which various compounds were used to stimulate ATPase activity, we observed variation in ATPase stimulation relative to the basal ATPase activity of up to 1.5-fold for identical experimental protocols carried out on different ABCR preparations. This variation may reflect differences between ABCR preparations in the level of minor contaminating ATPases, which would presumably contribute to the basal activity but not the stimulated activity, and/or differences in the absolute amount of lipid present in the sample which therefore changes the ratio of lipid to the added compounds, most of which are hydrophobic. To avoid normalizing and averaging data from different ABCR preparations, all of the data presented in the figures show the results of single representative experiments. As one approach to identifying substrates or allosteric regulators of ABCR, we surveyed a group of structurally diverse compounds for their ability to stimulate or inhibit the ATPase activity of purified and reconstituted ABCR. Our earlier localization of ABCR to ROS disc membranes suggested the possibility that it might be involved in the movement of retinal or retinol (9Allikmets R. Singh N. Sun H. Shroyer N.F.

The structures of these compounds are shown in Fig. 2, and they fall into four groups as follows: retinoids (compounds 1–5), known P-glycoprotein substrates or sensitizers (compounds 6–14), detergents and digitonin-related (compounds 15–22), and compounds selected for their structural diversity (compounds 23–43). The compounds were initially tested at 20 μm (Fig.3), a concentration at which many P-glycoprotein substrates and sensitizers enhance ATP hydrolysis by P-glycoprotein (24Ambudkar S.V. Lelong I.H.

Most of the compounds had little or no effect on ATPase activity, and none significantly inhibited ATPase activity. However, seven compounds, three retinal isomers (all-trans-retinal, 11-cis-retinal, and 13-cis-retinal), amiodarone, digitonin, dehydroabietylamine, and 2-tert-butylanthroquinone, reproducibly activated the ATPase activity 2–5-fold (the fold activation depending on the compound), a degree of activation similar to that reported for purified and reconstituted P-glycoprotein in the presence of the most potent P-glycoprotein substrates and sensitizers (26Shapiro A.

COX-2 is the highly inducible isozyme of COX which is responsible for much of the prostaglandin production in inflammation and is a key factor in colon carcinogenesis. Because COX-2 activity can be rate-limiting in prostaglandin formation, COX-2 expression must be regulated tightly. Numerous factors, including mitogens, tumor promoters, and cytokines have been found to stimulate the transcription of COX-2. We show that fatty acids, prostaglandins, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, compounds that are substrates, products, and inhibitors, respectively, of COX enzymatic activity, also increase its expression. These compounds are members of a heterogeneous group of compounds known as peroxisome proliferators, and the prototypical peroxisome proliferator, WY-14,643, also enhanced COX-2 expression. We demonstrate that these compounds increase COX-2 transcription, and we identify a region of the COX-2 promoter containing a peroxisome proliferator response element that is responsible for the enhancement of COX-2 expression seen with these compounds.

Physiologically, prostaglandins regulate vascular homeostasis, kidney function, ovulation, and parturition. These compounds are equally important as mediators of inflammation, thrombosis, and pain (1Meade E.A. Jones D.A. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Bell R.M. Exton J.H. Prescott S.M. Handbook of Lipid Research, vol. 8. Plenum Press, New York1992: 285-305Google Scholar). Prostaglandins are formed by the action of cyclooxygenase, a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing both the oxidation of arachidonic acid to the prostaglandin endoperoxide PGG2 (hence the name cyclooxygenase) and its subsequent reduction to PGH2. This prostaglandin intermediate is the precursor to all biologically active prostaglandins and thromboxanes, the ultimate prostaglandin product being formed in a cell-specific manner. There are two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 expression is consistent throughout the cell cycle (2Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar, 3DeWitt D.L. Meade E.A. Arch. Biochem.

North A.J. Wells L.B. Shaul P.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2230-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). COX-1 is thought to be responsible for “housekeeping” prostaglandin production. COX-2, on the other hand, is highly inducible; its expression is elevated by a variety of stimuli, including mitogens, tumor promoters, and cytokines (1Meade E.A. Jones D.A. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Bell R.M. Exton J.H. Prescott S.M. Handbook of Lipid Research, vol. 8. Plenum Press, New York1992: 285-305Google Scholar), and, as described below, it is involved in carcinogenesis. Dietary fat is an important risk factor for certain epithelial cancers, particularly colon cancer (5Potter J.D. JAMA. 1992; 268: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), but the molecular basis for this risk is unknown. The initiation and progression of other forms of cancer, including breast cancer, may also be regulated by dietary fat. Studies by Bandyopadhyay et al. (6Bandyopadhyay G.K. Imagawa W. Wallace D. Nandi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2750-2756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that linoleic acid (LA), the major fatty acid in a normal Western diet, enhances the growth of murine mammary epithelial cells (6Bandyopadhyay G.K. Imagawa W. Wallace D. Nandi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2750-2756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carter et al. (7Carter C.A. Milholland R.J. Shea W. Ip M.M. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3559-3562PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that a diet high in fat increased the incidence of tumor formation in rats treated with the carcinogen dimethylbenz(a)anthracene. Treatment with a COX inhibitor attenuated the effects of the high fat diet, suggesting that a COX was essential to the carcinogenic process. More recent studies in colon cancer have identified induction of the COX-2 isoform as a rate-limiting step (8Eberhart C.E. Coffey R.J. Radhika A. Giardiello F.M. Ferrenbach S. DuBois R.N.

Work in the last few years has shown that fatty acids and prostaglandins are able to regulate gene expression through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (11Gottlicher M. Widmark E.

PPARs are members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily which act by altering the transcription of genes with which they associate by means of a recognition sequence known as a peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) (16Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Although nuclear localization of the receptors is independent of ligand, PPARs modulate gene expression only when ligand is bound (17Dreyer C. Keller H. Mahfoudi A. Laudet V. Krey G. Wahli W. Biol. Cell. 1993; 77: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Compounds that activate PPARs are known as peroxisome proliferators and comprise a heterogeneous group that includes fatty acids and prostaglandins, plasticizers, and anti-diabetic drugs (18 and references therein). Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) prevent colon cancer (19Giovannucci E. Egan K.M. Hunter D.J. Stampfer M.J. Colditz G.A. Willett W.C.

In patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, sulindac reduces both the size and number of polyps, which are precursors of colon cancer (22Giardiello F.M. Hamilton S.R. Krush A.J. Piantadosi S.

Work by Oshimaet al. (10Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar) further supported the involvement of COX-2 in colon carcinogenesis. This group examined polyp formation in mice with a mutation in the APC gene, the gene responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis. When these mice were crossed with COX-2 knockout mice, the offspring had only a small fraction of the intestinal polyps found in their COX-2-expressing peers. Mice that were heterozygous for expression of COX-2 had intermediate levels of colon polyps. Given the correlation between increased COX-2 expression and colon cancer, the effect of NSAIDs is most certainly mediated, at least in part, by COX inhibition. Interestingly, some NSAIDs have recently been demonstrated to act as peroxisome proliferators (24Lehmann J.M. Lenhard J.M. Oliver B.B. Ringold G.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3406-3410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may also regulate gene expression as part of their chemopreventative mechanism. In the experiments described below, we examined the ability of fatty acids, prostaglandins, and NSAIDs to regulate COX-2 expression. We demonstrate that these compounds enhance COX-2 expression and that the regulation occurs transcriptionally. Further, we define a region of the promoter responsible for at least part of the regulation of COX-2 expression by these compounds. Fatty acids, prostaglandins, NS-398, and several other NSAIDs were purchased from Cayman Chemical Company. WY-14,643, sulindac sulfide, and sulindac sulfone were purchased from BioMol. Other NSAIDs and common reagents were purchased from Sigma. Fatty acids and prostaglandins were diluted in ethanol, WY-14,643 and NSAIDs in dimethyl sulfoxide. Medium for the culture of human mammary epithelial cells was prepared in house, media for culture of colon cell lines were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Mouse anti-human monoclonal antibodies to COX-1 and COX-2 were the kind gift of J. Maclouf (INSERM, Paris). Mouse anti-human β-actin was purchased from ICN. Goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was from BIOSOURCE. We screened a human skeletal muscle 5′-STRETCH PLUS cDNA library (CLONTECH) to isolate clones for the known human isoforms of PPAR and for RXRα. PPARα (25Mukherjee R. Jow L. Noonan D. McDonnell D.P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 51: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), δ (26Schmidt A. Endo N. Rutledge S.J. Vogel R.

Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar) were obtained by screening with 30-mer oligonucleotides corresponding to the region surrounding the translational start site, according to established procedures. PPARγ (28Mukherjee R. Jow L. Croston G.E. Paterniti Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8071-8076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) was obtained by screening with a random prime-labeled cDNA probe (Cayman). Full-length cDNA clones were obtained for each. The clones were sequenced to ensure correctness and subcloned into pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen) for mammalian expression. Previous work in this laboratory isolated a 1.8-kb human COX-2 promoter clone (9Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. White R.L. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4816-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Because many PPREs are located further upstream from the translational start site (29Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar), we felt it was necessary to obtain a larger promoter clone. We designed polymerase chain reaction primers corresponding to the 5′-most end of the COX-2 promoter, which were used to isolate a P1 clone (Genome Systems). We performed a series of restriction digestions and Southern blots to identify regions of the clone corresponding to further 5′-regions of the COX-2 promoter. We chose pieces from two restriction digestions,KpnI (5,710 bases) and SacI (2,971 bases), which were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) for sequencing and then into pGL3-basic (see below) attached to our existing COX-2 promoter to allow us to search for potential PPREs in this larger promoter. The result of the subcloning gave us a total of approximately 7,270 bases of promoter for the KpnI construct and 3,920 bases of promoter for the SacI construct. The 7,270-base pair COX-2 promoter has been deposited with GenBank, Accession NumberAF044206. Regions of the 7-kb COX-2 promoter were cloned into pGL3-basic (Promega). The putative PPRE in the COX-2 promoter (located at −3900) as well as a consensus PPRE for the rat acyl-CoA oxidase gene (ACO) (30Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G. Bundell K.R. McPheat W.L.

A pGL3 promoter vector with no insert was used as a negative control in transfection experiments. PPARα cloned into pcDNAI/Amp was used for cotransfection to ensure that the cells' native PPAR would not be limiting in detection of transcriptional effects. β-Galactosidase cloned into pHOOK-2 (Invitrogen) was used as a control for normalization of transfections. 184B5 mammary epithelial cells (obtained from Martha Stampfer) (32Stampfer M.R. Bartley J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2394-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) were grown in modified MCDB 170, a serum-free defined medium. Before treatment with fatty acids, prostaglandins, or NSAIDs, the cells were made quiescent by treating for 48 h with an antibody to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (monoclonal antibody 225) at 10 μg/ml (33Stampfer M.R. Pan C.H. Hosoda J. Bartholomew J. Mendelsohn J. Yaswen P. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). HCT-116, DLD-1, CaCo-2, and HT-29 colonic epithelial cells were obtained from ATCC and grown according to recommended procedures. HCT-116 and HT-29 were cultured in McCoy's 5A with 10% fetal bovine serum, DLD-1 were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, and CaCo-2 were grown in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, supplemented with sodium pyruvate and 20% fetal bovine serum. For 24 h before treatment with NSAIDs, the colonocytes were serum starved by replacing the normal growth medium with serum-free medium. To examine COX-2 expression in both mammary epithelial cells and colonocytes, the medium was changed to fresh serum-free medium containing fatty acid, prostaglandin, WY-14,643, or NSAID. For 184B5 cells, the medium also contained the EGF receptor antibody. Cells were incubated with agonist for 4–8 h for mRNA expression or for 10–12 h for protein expression before harvest. For time-course experiments, samples were harvested at the times indicated in the figures. For experiments utilizing actinomycin D, it was added at 5 μg/ml simultaneously with agonist. For each fatty acid, prostaglandin, and NSAID used, a dose-response curve was performed. Only the maximally effective concentration of each fatty acid, prostaglandin, or NSAID is shown in the figures. Fatty acids including arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, eicosatetraynoic acid, linoelaidic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid were used at 0.3–18 μm. Prostaglandins, HETEs, and HODEs were used at the following concentrations: PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2α at 0.4–74 μm; PGA2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2, 8(R)-HETE, 8(S)-HETE, 15-HETE, 9-HODE, and 13-HODE at 0.3–18 μm. The following NSAIDs were tested from 10 to 250 μm: meclofenamate, mefenamic acid, NS-398, indomethacin, sulindac sulfone, piroxicam, resveratrol, naproxen, flurbiprofen, and ketorolac. Sulindac sulfide was tested from 1 to 250 μm. Ibuprofen and aspirin were tested from 50 to 1,000 μm. Quiescent 50% confluent 184B5 cells were transfected using 2.5 μl/P35 dish LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.25 μg/P35 dish each of luciferase reporter plasmid, PPARα (or δ, or γ, or vector only), and β-galactosidase and were performed in the presence of monoclonal antibody 225. At 24 h after transfection, the medium was changed to fresh MCDB 170 containing monoclonal antibody 225 with or without 100 μm WY-14,643. The cells were harvested 72 h later, and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed. Luciferase activity was measured using the Promega kit, and β-galactosidase was measured using Galactolight (Tropix). Triplicate wells were assayed in duplicate for each sample. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 16 mm CHAPS, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmbenzamidine hydrochloride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were scraped and placed on ice for 30 min. Unlysed cells and debris were removed by centrifugation, and protein assays were performed (BCA protein assay, Pierce) to ensure equal loading on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were separated through 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. COX-2 and COX-1 monoclonal antibodies were used according to the procedures of Habib et al. (34Habib A. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Maclouf J. J. Biol.

The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse (BIOSOURCE), and ECL (Amersham) was used as a detection method. Quantitation of Western blots was performed by scanning the blots into Photoshop and performing densitometry with NIH Image. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were resuspended in RNase-free water and concentrations determined spectrophotometrically. 10 μg of each sample was used for RNase protection assay with probes for COX-2 and GAPDH. The COX-2 probe corresponds to the region spanning −90 to +332 relative to the COX-2 translational start site. 2Dixon, D. A., and Prescott, S. M. (1998)BioTechniques 24,732–734. The GAPDH probe is commercially available (Ambion). Radioactive transcripts were prepared using [α-32P]UTP and the Ambion MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit. 80,000 cpm/sample of the COX-2 probe and 8,000 cpm/sample of the GAPDH probe were used in the RNase protection assay (RPA II, Ambion). RNA and probes were co-precipitated, resuspended in hybridization buffer, and incubated overnight at 43 °C. The following day, unbound RNA was digested with RNase, and the remaining radiolabeled RNA was precipitated, resuspended in loading buffer, and separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and exposed to BioMax MS film at −80 °C for up to 48 h. After autoradiography, the protection assay was quantitated by densitometry as above. Nuclear run-on assays were used to assess absolute levels of transcription of COX-2 after treatment with EGF, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or LA. Assays were performed essentially as described by DeWitt and Meade (3DeWitt D.L. Meade E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For nuclear isolation, 1 × 107 cells were treated with vehicle, EGF (100 ng/ml), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (60 ng/ml), or LA (18 μm) until the time when the maximal change in transcription was expected based on changes in mRNA levels (30 min for EGF, 1 h for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and 2 h for LA and vehicle). Cells were scraped into cold phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged and rinsed, and placed in buffer (50 mmTris, pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA) for storage in liquid nitrogen until assayed. mRNA and protein were harvested from identical plates at later time points to ensure that both COX-2 protein and mRNA expression were altered as expected by these treatments. For nuclear run-on assays, the following plasmids were used as probes: a cDNA fragment for COX-2 which corresponded to the entire open reading frame but did not contain the 3′-untranslated region and a full-length cDNA for COX-1. (Previous work demonstrated that COX-1 levels are unaltered by the treatments used in these experiments and that it could serve as a control in these experiments.) Both plasmids were in the same base vector, eliminating the need for a vector control. Plasmids were linearized, denatured, and applied to Hybond N membrane using a Minifold II Slot Blotter (Schleicher & Schuell). To begin run-on assays, nuclei were thawed and combined with a buffered nucleotide mixture containing [α-32P]UTP to label transcripts radioactively. Transcription was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C, and then RNase-free DNase (200 units) was added and the incubation continued a further 10 min. Next, proteins were digested by the addition of proteinase K (400 μg/ml) for 45 min at 37 °C. The samples were extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with NH4OAc and EtOH at −80 °C. After repeating the DNase and proteinase K digestions, the samples were precipitated overnight at −80 °C. The following day, the samples were centrifuged, and the RNA was resuspended in TE and denatured with NaOH for 10 min on ice. The samples were precipitated a third time and resuspended in TE. Incorporation of radiolabel into the nuclei was ascertained by scintillation counting, and an equal amount of radioactivity was added to individual slot blots for each sample. The slot blots that contained COX-1 and COX-2 probes had been prehybridized for 2 h before the addition of radiolabeled nuclei. After the addition of the nuclei, the blots were hybridized at 42 °C for 48 h. The blots were then washed as described and exposed to BioMax MS at −80 °C for up to 48 h. After autoradiography, blots were quantitated as described above. Nuclear extracts were prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with PPARα (or δ, or γ, or vector only) and with RXRα (35Andrews N.C.

The following oligonucleotides were used: ACO PPRE F, ACO PPRE R, COX-2 −3900 PPRE F, COX-2 −3900 PPRE R, whose sequences were defined earlier, and AP2 F, 5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′; and AP2 R, 5′-ACGGGCCGCGGGCGGTCAGTTCGATC- 3′. Binding reactions were performed by preincubating 20 μg of nuclear lysate in binding buffer with or without competitor oligonucleotide (50-fold excess compared with radiolabeled oligonucleotide) in a volume of 18 μl for 10 min at room temperature. Binding buffer consisted of 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 80 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μg of poly(dI·dC). 2 μl of radiolabeled oligonucleotide cassette was then added, and the reactions were incubated 20 min at room temperature. The products were separated by loading on a prerun 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 2.5% glycerol and separated in 1 × TBE buffer at 150 volts at room temperature until the bromphenol blue marker dye was approximately two-thirds of the way down the gel. Controls, including AP2 oligonucleotides, were from the Promega gel shift assay system. Gels were dried and exposed to BioMax MR autoradiography film at −80 °C for up to 48 h. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, including LA, have diverse effects on cells, and we asked whether one component of the response was to alter COX-2 expression. We exposed mammary epithelial cells to LA and found that it strongly enhanced COX-2 expression (Fig.1 A). Many fatty acids are able to stimulate cell responses, so we next tested other fatty acids for their effect on COX-2 expression. We found that all of the unsaturated fatty acids that we tested enhanced COX-2 expression, including arachidonic acid, the normal substrate for COX-2, as well as fatty acids that are abundant in fish oils, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. To determine whether metabolism of the fatty acid was necessary for stimulation of COX-2 expression, we exposed cells to linoelaidic acid, an analog of LA which has only trans-double bonds, and eicosatetraynoic acid, an analog of arachidonic acid with triple bonds, neither of which is a substrate for oxidases such as COX. These compounds also increased the level of COX-2, demonstrating that metabolism of fatty acid is not required for this effect. The pattern of fatty acids that enhanced COX-2 expression is consistent with fatty acids that have been identified recently (14Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although their physiological ligands remain uncertain, it has been demonstrated that prostaglandins and fatty acids can act as ligands. We next tested the ability of a panel of potential COX-2 products to enhance its expression. We found that many of them enhanced COX-2 expression, particularly the cyclopentanone prostaglandins PGA2 and 15ΔPGJ2, which are most potent in other PPAR-mediated responses (18Issemann I. Green S.

Of all the compounds that we tested, 15ΔPGJ2 was the most potent, strongly enhancing COX-2 expression at levels as low as 0.4 μm(Fig. 2 B). We also found that 15-HETE (Fig. 2 A), 8-HETE, and 9- and 13-HODE stimulated COX-2 expression (not shown). PGE2, which is produced at relatively high levels by mammary epithelial cells, did not alter COX-2 expression in these cells. This pattern of COX-2 expression in response to prostaglandins and HETEs supported the hypothesis that it occurred via a PPAR. As an additional test of this, we treated cells with the PPAR agonist WY-14,643 and found that i"

We report here the cloning of a novel AR coactivator ARA55 using a yeast two-hybrid system. ARA55 consists of 444 amino acids with the predicted molecular mass of 55 kDa and its sequence shows very high homology to mouse hic5, a TGF-β1-inducible gene. Yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems and co-immunoprecipitation assays all prove ARA55 can bind to AR in a ligand-dependent manner. Transient transfection assay in prostate cancer DU145 cells further demonstrates that ARA55 can enhance AR transcriptional activity in the presence of 1 nmdihydrotestosterone or its antagonists such as 100 nm17β-estradiol or 1 μm hydroxyflutamide. Our data also suggest the C-terminal half of ARA55, which includes three LIM motifs, is sufficient to interact with AR. Northern blot and polymerase chain reaction quantitation showed ARA55 can be expressed differently in normal prostate and prostate tumor cells. Together, our data suggests that ARA55 may play very important roles in the progression of prostate cancer by the modulation of AR transactivation.

Saltzman A. Yeh S. Young W. Keller E. Lee H. Wang C. Mizokami A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 97-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The well conserved DNA binding domain (DBD) within AR has two zinc finger structures that are involved in DNA binding. The C-terminal region of the AR, including the hinge region and the ligand-binding domain, is responsible for the functions of dimerization and androgen binding. The N-terminal region is involved in the transcriptional activation of AR. The discovery of transcriptional interference/squelching of SRs provided the concept of the existence of transcriptional cofactors that mediate SR function (2Meyer M.-E. Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Bocquel M.-T. Tasset D. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 57: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 3Bocquel M.T. Kumar V. Stricker C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2581-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Recently, several putative cofactors (either coactivators or corepressers) for SRs have been identified and characterized (4Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalski M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar, 5Jenster G. Spencer T.E. Burcin M.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7879-7884Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Further studies of the interaction of SRs with these cofactors suggested that these SR-cofactor complexes play essential roles for the regulation of SRs target gene transcription by interaction with general transcription factors and the remodeling of chromatin (4Chen H.

The in vivo significance of these cofactors and their relationship to diseases, however, remains unclear. Recently, an estrogen receptor coactivator, AIB1, was identified with higher expression in ovarian cancer cell lines and breast cancer cells than in other cell lines tested (6Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.-Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar), implying that increased expression of cofactors might be involved in some hormone-responsive tumors. The question whether cofactors of AR, the major promoter of prostate tumor growth, can also play vital roles for the maintenance of androgen-dependent status is thus of vital interest. Here we report for the isolation and characterization of a novel AR coactivator, ARA55, which can bind to wild type AR (wtAR) and mutant AR (mAR) in a ligand-dependent manner and enhance their transcriptional activities. The potential roles of ARA55 in prostate cancer is also discussed. A human prostate cDNA library in pACT2 yeast expression vector was a gift from Dr. S. Elledge. For construction of pAS2-wtAR or mAR, C-terminal fragments (aa 595–918) from wtAR or mAR (mART877S, point mutation threonine to serine at codon 877, from Dr. S. P. Balk (7Taplan M.-E. Bubley G.J. Shuster T.D. Frantz M.E. Spooner A.E. Ogata G.K. Keer H.N. Balk S.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar)), respectively, were inserted in pAS2 yeast expression vector (CLONTECH). pG5CAT reporter plasmid (CLONTECH) contains five GAL4 binding sites upstream of the E1b TATA box, linked to the CAT gene. A pACT2-prostate cDNA library that consists of the GAL4 activation domain (aa 768–881) fused with human prostate cDNA library was transformed into Y190 yeast cells with a plasmid of pAS2-mAR (mART877S) that contains GAL4DBD fused with the C-terminal domain of this mAR. Transformants were selected for growth on synthetic dropout (SD) plates with 25 mm 3-aminotriazole and 100 nm dihydrotestosterone (DHT) lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. Colonies were also filter-assayed for β-galactosidase activity. DNAs from positive clones were recovered from yeast, amplified in E. coli, and confirmed by sequencing. The missing 5′-coding region was isolated by 5′-RACE-PCR according to the manufacturer's protocol of Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH). The gene-specific antisense primer used for 5′-RACE-PCR was 5′-TCAGCCGAAGAGCTTCAGGAAGCAGGG-3′. The specific PCR reaction condition was 94 °C for 1 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s → 72 °C for 3 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s → 70 °C for 3 min, then 25 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s → 68 °C for 3 min. The PCR product was subcloned into pT7-Blue vector (Novagen) and sequenced. Lysates fromin vitro translated full-length AR and ARA55 were incubated with or without 10−8m DHT in the modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 0.25% gelatin) and rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. The conjugated beads were washed four times with RIPA buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by STORM 840 (Molecular Dynamics). The total RNA (25 μg) was fractionated on a 1% formaldehyde-MOPS-agarose gel, transferred onto a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and prehybridized. A probe corresponding to the 900 bp C terminus of ARA55 was32P-labeled in vitro using Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's protocol and hybridized overnight. After washing, the blot was exposed and quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). GAPDH was used to monitor the amount of total RNA in each lane. DU145 cells and PC3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). One hour before transfection, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. Phenol red-free medium was used with the E2 experiments. Cells were transfected using the modified calcium phosphate technique for 24 h, the medium was changed, and cells were treated with either steroid hormones or hydroxyflutamide (HF) for another 24 h. The cells were harvested, and cell lysates were normalized by β–galactosidase internal control and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity. CAT activity was quantified by PhosphorImager. For RT-PCR, the total RNA (2 μg) from each sample was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. cDNA (1 μl) was amplified by PCR with AmpliTaq Gold (Perkin-Elmer). The following sense and antisense primers were used: sense primer, 5′-GCACTTCGTTTGCGGAGGC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CCGAAGAGCTTCAGGAAGC-3′. This combination of primers amplifies 633 bp of the C-terminal region of ARA55. After an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 9 min, 33 cycles of amplification (denaturation at 94 °C for 9 min, annealing at 63 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min) were followed by a terminal extension at 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The 600-bp fragment of GAPDH, which was amplified with 30 amplification cycles using the sense and antisense primers for human GAPDH (Stratagene), was used to demonstrate comparable RNA amounts and quality among samples. Loss of androgen specificity in mAR may contribute to the development of prostate cancer from an androgen-dependent to androgen-independent state (7Taplan M.-E. Bubley G.J. Shuster T.D. Frantz M.E.

Moul J.W. Srivastava S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2861-2864PubMed Google Scholar). We were interested to know if wtAR and mAR might exert their functions by recruiting additional cofactors. A yeast two-hybrid system with mART877S as a bait was used to screen the human prostate cDNA library. As a result, six clones that interacted with mART877S were isolated, and one of them, named ARA55, was further characterized because its DNA sequence was highly homologous to the C terminus of mouse hic5 (a hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone) (9Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis indicated that ARA55 mRNA, with a size near 2 kilobases, could be detected in HeLa and prostate PC-3 cells but not in other cell lines such as HepG2, H1299, MCF7, CHO, PC12, P19, and DU145 (data not shown). The 5′-RACE-PCR technique was then used to clone the full-length ARA55 from HeLa cells. Sequence analysis determined that the open reading frame between the first ATG and terminal TGA encoded 444 aa for human ARA55 with the predicted molecular mass of 55 kDa (Fig.1 A). Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that human ARA55 shares 90.5% homology with mouse Hic5 (9Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another interesting finding from this deduced aa sequence was the existence of four LIM motifs in the C-terminal regions (Fig. 1 B). The LIM motif is a cysteine-rich zinc-binding motif with the consensus sequence: CX2CX16–23HX2CX2CX2CX16–21CX2(C, H, D) (10Sadler I. Crowford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Although the function of the LIM motif has not been fully defined, some data suggest that it might be involved in the protein-protein interaction (11Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Among all identified SR-associated proteins, only the thyroid hormone interacting protein 6 (Trip 6) has these similar LIM motifs (12Lee J.W. Choi H.-S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first tested whether the interaction between ARA55 and AR is ligand-dependent in the yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems. Y190 yeast cells were transformed with GAL4AD fused with ARA55251–444 and GAL4DBD fused with the C-terminal region (aa 595–918) of mART877S or wtAR. Transformants were selected by their growth on plates with DHT, testosterone, E2, progesterone, dexamethasone, or vehicle (ethanol) only. Colonies were also assayed for β–galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig.2 A, DHT and testosterone promoted the interaction between ARA55 and wtAR or mAR at concentrations of greater than 1 nm. E2 and progesterone promoted the interaction only at much higher concentrations (1 μm for E2 and 0.1 μm for progesterone). Dexamethasone and vehicle did not promote this interaction. There were no differences between wtAR and mAR in their interactions with ARA55 (data not shown). Together, these data suggested that ARA55 can interact with not only mAR, but also wtAR in the presence of DHT, testosterone, and higher concentrations of E2 or progesterone and that the presence of only the C-terminal region of ARA55 is the minimal requirement for interaction. Next, we tested this interaction in a mammalian two-hybrid system. DU145 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding the hormone binding domain of wtAR fused to the GAL4 DBD (GAL0AR) and with a plasmid encoding full-length ARA55 fused to the activation domain of VP16 (VP16-ARA55). Interaction was estimated by determining the level of CAT activity from the reporter plasmid (Fig. 2 B). A combination of GAL0 empty vector and VP16-ARA55 did not show any CAT activity (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). A combination of GAL0AR and VP16 vector showed a negligible amount of CAT activity (Fig.2 B, lane 2), and a significant level of CAT activity was induced by the co-transfection of VP16-ARA55 and GAL0AR only in the presence of 10 nm DHT (Fig. 2 B,lane 3 versus lane 4). These results indicate that ARA55 can interact with AR and that this interaction is ligand-dependent. To further prove that the interaction between AR and ARA55 is the direct interaction, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed using an in vitro transcription/translation system, which expressed high levels of AR and His·Tag fusion ARA55. A polyclonal anti-His·Tag antibody was employed for co-immunoprecipitations, and the resulting immune complexes were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the AR can only be co-immunoprecipitated by incubation with ARA55 that is fused with His·Tag, and the addition of 10−8m DHT enhances significantly the specific interaction between AR and ARA55 (Fig. 2 C, lane 3 versus lane 4) Because yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems and co-immunoprecipitations all indicated that ARA55 can interact with AR in a DHT-dependent manner, we were then interested in knowing if such an interaction can affect further AR transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig.3 , the ligand-free AR had only minimal MMTV-CAT reporter activity with or without the ARA55, and ARA55 alone also showed only minimal reporter activity (Fig. 3, lane 4). However, addition of 10 nm DHT resulted in a 4.3-fold increase of AR transcriptional activity and ARA55 further increased this induction by 5.3-fold (from 4.3-fold up to 22.8-fold) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, lanes 5–9). The induced activity reached a plateau at the ratio of AR:ARA55 to 1:4.5. A similar induction result could also be obtained when we replaced DU145 cells with PC-3 cells, or MMTV-CAT with a PSA-CAT reporter plasmid that had a 2.8-kilobase promoter region of PSA gene containing androgen responsive regions (data not shown). We then examined the effect of ARA55 on two different mARs in the presence of serial concentrations of DHT, E2, and HF. One mAR, mART877A, was identified in LNCaP cells and in advanced prostate cancers with a point mutation at codon 877 (threonine to alanine) (8Gaddipati J.P. McLeod D.G. Heidenberg H.B. Sesterhenn I.A. Finger M.J. Moul J.W. Srivastava S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2861-2864PubMed Google Scholar,13Veldscholte J. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G.J.M. Jenster G. Berrevoets C. Claassen E. van Rooij H.C.J. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The other mAR, mARE708K, has a point mutation at codon 708 (glutamine to lysine). This mARE708K was isolated by a yeast genetic screening with unique characteristics of having less sensitivity to HF and E2 as compared with wtAR (14.Wang, C., The Androgen and Antiandrogen Effects on the Transcriptional Activity of Androgen Receptor.Ph.D. thesis, 1997, University of Wisconsin-Madison.Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, wtAR and these mARs responded well to DHT at 10−11 to 10−8m, and ARA55 enhanced their transactivation by 4–8-fold. In the presence of E2 or HF, wtAR was slightly active at high concentrations (10−7m for E2 and 10−5m for HF). Co-transfection of wtAR with ARA55 at a 1:4.5 ratio, however, increased AR transcriptional activity in the presence of 10−7m for E2 or 10−6 to 10−5m for HF. Compared with wtAR, mART877A responded much better to E2 and HF, and ARA55 could further enhance significantly its transcriptional activity. Interestingly, whereas mARE708K could respond well to DHT induction and ARA55 could also further enhance its transcriptional activity, mARE708K showed very poor response to E2 and HF even at the high concentrations and ARA55 did not have any effect on its transactivation. These data suggest that although mutations at AR may still play important roles for the AR transcriptional activity, ARA55 may be needed for the proper or maximal DHT-, E2-, or HF-mediated AR transcriptional activity. As most of the identified cofactors for SRs are general and not specific to only one receptor (15Shibata H. Spencer T. Oñate S.A. Lenster G. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 141-165PubMed Google Scholar), we were interested in knowing if ARA55 was a specific coactivator for AR. To discover the answer, we tested the effect of ARA55 on transcriptions mediated by glucocorticoid receptor (GR), progesterone receptor (PR), and estrogen receptor (ER) in DU145 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, ARA55 turns out to be relatively specific to AR, although it also enhances GR and PR to a lesser degree, and has only a marginal effect on ER. While we do not know if the environmental conditions we used in the prostate DU145 cells were optimal for PR, GR, and ER, our data did indicate that ARA55 could activate PR and GR to a greater degree when compared with another AR coactivator, ARA70 (16Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). ARA70 showed much higher specificity to AR (Fig. 5), which may suggest ARA55 has more flexibility to interact with other SRs. The mARs (mART877S and mART877A) were identified in advanced prostate cancer patients and could respond to antiandrogens or estrogen as well as androgen. Because ARA55 could enhance the transactivation of these mARs as well as wtAR, we were interested in knowing whether the prostate cancer cells or the prostate tissue could express the ARA55. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that DU145 and LNCaP cells did not, but PC-3 cells did express ARA55 mRNA (Fig.6 A). Next, we examined ARA55 mRNA expression in the clinical prostate samples and the cell lines, using RT-PCR (Fig. 6 B), because these clinical samples were obtained by needle biopsy and the amount of the extracted RNA was not sufficient for Northern blotting analysis. As the Northern blotting demonstrated, PC-3 cells expressed ARA55 mRNA, but DU145 and LNCaP cells did not. Every clinical prostate sample, including normal, benign hypertrophy, and cancer, expressed ARA55 mRNA, but there were some differences in its expression level among the samples. This heterogeneity of ARA55 expression might be one of the factors that cause the different clinical courses of prostate cancer. The unique sequence of ARA55 places this AR coactivator outside the family of common SR coactivators that include SRC-1 (17Oñate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar), TIF2/GRIP1 (18Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

A. 1997; 94: 8479-8484Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). For example, ARA55 lacks some common motifs (such as basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain and Per-AhR-Sim (PAS) domain) that are shared by SR coactivators. Instead, ARA55 does have three LIM motifs in the interaction domain of the C-terminal region. The LIM motif is a cysteine-rich motif that is found in several proteins (including Trip 6), with diverse functions and subcellular distributions. The biochemical properties and the function of the LIM motifs have not been fully defined, and it has been suggested that their main function is in developmental regulation (10Sadler I. Crowford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar,21Crawford A.W. Pino J.D. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, Schmeichel and Beckerle reported that LIM motifs might be involved in protein-protein interaction (11Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Therefore, the LIM motifs in the C-terminal region of ARA55 may contribute to its interaction with AR. There is also no homology between ARA55 and the first identified AR coactivator, ARA70 (16Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 22Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Chang C. Lancet. 1997; 349: 852-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23Yeh S.

Commun. 1998; 248: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although both AR coactivators enhance AR transcriptional activity in DU145 cells, they show distinct differences: 1) ARA55 is more general to SRs whereas ARA70 is more specific to AR; 2) ARA55 has a lesser effect than ARA70 on AR-mediated transactivation in the presence of E2 and HF; and 3) ARA55 is a TGF-β-inducible gene. The precise role of these two cofactors may affect the different physiological influences on prostate cells. One of the very interesting features of ARA55 sequence is its high homology to mouse hic5, a well documented TGF-β1-inducible gene (9Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas previous studies suggested that Hic5 may play important roles in the growth-inhibitory pathway associated with senescence (27Shibanuma M. Mochizuki E. Maniwa R. Mashimo J. Nishiya N. Imai S. Takano T. Oshimura M. Nose K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the linkage of hic5 to steroid hormones and their receptors has not been demonstrated. Our findings here may therefore provide a potential connection to allow TGF-β1 to increase AR transcriptional activity via induction of ARA55 in prostate. Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignant tumor and the second leading cause of cancer death in American men (28Wingo P.A. Tong T. Bolden S. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 1995; 45: 8-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). Today, the only effective treatment for advanced prostate cancer is hormonal therapy that combines surgical or chemical castration with administration of antiandrogens, such as HF or E2. Although hormonal therapy is very effective and most of the patients initially respond to this treatment, the vast majority of them may relapse within 18 months (29Crawford E.D. Br. J. Urology. 1992; 70 Suppl. 1: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which prostate cancer cells become resistant to hormonal therapy remain unclear. One popular hypothesis to explain how prostate can progress from androgen dependent- to androgen independent-state is that mutations in AR may change this receptor's sensitivity to other steroid hormones or antiandrogens, such as E2 and HF. As ARA55 was able to induce transcriptional activity of both wtAR and mAR in the presence of DHT, E2, and HF, and ARA55 was expressed differently in various prostate tumor cells, ARA55 may therefore, play some important roles for the progression of prostate cancer and its resistance to hormonal therapy. Further studies of blocking the function of ARA55 (e.g. a small peptide or compound that can interfere with the interaction of AR and ARA55) may provide a novel clue for the development of treatments of the advanced prostate cancer.

We and others have recently demonstrated that paclitaxel also activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) signal transduction pathway in various human cell types, however, no clear role has been established for JNK/SAPK in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. To further examine the role of JNK/SAPK signaling cascades in apoptosis resulting from microtubular dysfunction induced by paclitaxel, we have coexpressed dominant negative (dn) mutants of signaling proteins of the JNK/SAPK pathway (Ras, ASK1, Rac, JNKK, and JNK) in human ovarian cancer cells with a selectable marker to analyze the apoptotic characteristics of cells expressing dn vectors following exposure to paclitaxel. Expression of these dn signaling proteins had no effect on Bcl-2 phosphorylation, yet inhibited apoptotic changes induced by paclitaxel up to 16 h after treatment. Coexpression of these dn signaling proteins had no protective effect after 48 h of paclitaxel treatment. Our data indicate that: (i) activated JNK/SAPK acts upstream of membrane changes and caspase-3 activation in paclitaxel-initiated apoptotic pathways, independently of cell cycle stage, (ii) activated JNK/SAPK is not responsible for paclitaxel-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2, and (iii) apoptosis resulting from microtubule damage may comprise multiple mechanisms, including a JNK/SAPK-dependent early phase and a JNK/SAPK-independent late phase.

In addition to pSRα and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) empty vectors, expression vectors used for control purposes include: pCMV-CD20 that was from E.

Avruch (Massachusetts General Hospital). Liposome-mediated transfections of BR cells using Tfx-50 (Promega, Madison, WI) were performed as described previously (14Wang T.H. Wang H.S. Ichijo H.

A CMV promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein construct, pEGFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), was co-transfected as a selectable marker for transfected cells. Stock solutions of paclitaxel, actinomycin-D, and cisplatin (all from Sigma) were prepared with Me2SO at concentrations of 10, 1, and 50 mm, respectively. In this study, 1 μm paclitaxel was used to treat cultured cells. Twenty-four h after co-transfection of BR cells with pEGFP and wt or dn expression vectors, 105 trypsinized cells were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with 5 μl of phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated annexin-V (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and 0.125 μg/ml of 7-amino actinomycin D (7-AAD) (Sigma) in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) and analyzed by flow cytometry with a FACStarPlus (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Flurochromes such as green fluorescent protein expressed by pEGFP, PE-annexin V, and 7-AAD were excited by laser tuned to 488 nm and emissions were detected at 507, 575, and 650 nm, respectively. Data of 10,000 cells from each sample were analyzed with the CellQuest3 software (Becton Dickinson). To compare other apoptotic characteristics in cells with or without expression of dn vectors, the green fluorescent protein positive and negative cells were sorted using a FACStarPlus flow cytometer and analyzed separately. Aliquots of cell lysate containing equal protein mass were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-HA epitope (Boehringer-Mannheim), anti-Myc (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), anti-JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-PARP (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), or anti-Bcl-2 (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) antibodies followed by relevant second antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing, proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham) as described previously (14Wang T.H. Wang H.S. Ichijo H. Giannakakou P. Foster J.S. Fojo T. Wimalasena J. J. Biol.

Endogenous JNKs were immunoprecipitated from cell lysate using an anti-JNK antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the JNK activity was assayed by levels of incorporated [γ-32P]ATP into its substrate GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79) (Santa Cruz). Green cells expressing control vector or dn expression vectors were isolated by flow cytometric sorting, fixed with 70% ethanol, treated with 0.1 mg/ml RNase (Sigma), stained with 20 μg/ml propidium iodide, and analyzed with flow cytometry. Propidium iodide-stained DNA content of each cell was used as the parameter of cell cycle profile. We used the colorimetric substrate Ac-DEVD-p-nitroaniline (Calbiochem) for caspase-3 assays in a procedure modified from the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, aliquots of sonicated cell lysate were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA), incubated with 200 μm Ac-DEVD-p-nitroaniline in assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) in 96-well plates at 37 °C for 24 h. Absorbance of the cleaved product was measured at 405 nm in a BioKinetic EL340 microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Identification of the ladder pattern of DNA fragmentation in 1.6% agarose gel was previously reported (32Preston G.A. Lang J.E. Maronpot R.R. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4214-4223PubMed Google Scholar). To quantify fragmented DNA in apoptotic cells, transfected cells isolated by flow cytometry were treated with paclitaxel or vehicle (Me2SO) and levels of fragmented DNA resulting from apoptosis were measured with a Cell Death ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Boehringer-Mannheim). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffe test for post hoc comparisons were used for statistical analyses with the STATISTICA software (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK). Thep values equal to or greater than 0.05 are considered to be not significant. To determine whether inhibition of the JNK/SAPK signaling cascade abolishes apoptosis in cells treated with paclitaxel, we analyzed paclitaxel-induced apoptosis among ovarian cancer BR cells transfected with dn-Ras, dn-ASK1, dn-Rac, dn-JNKK, or dn-JNK, along with pEGFP to allow selection of transfected cells. The efficacies of these dn expression vectors for inhibition of the JNK/SAPK have been demonstrated previously (14Wang T.H. Wang H.S. Ichijo H. Giannakakou P. Foster J.S. Fojo T. Wimalasena J. J.

Following paclitaxel treatment for the indicated times, transfected cells were stained with both PE-conjugated annexin-V (binding to both apoptotic cells and dead cells) and the viability dye 7-AAD (staining dead cells but not early apoptotic cells) to differentiate early apoptotic cells (annexin-V positive/7-AAD negative) from dead cells (7-AAD positive) (Fig.1). Percentages of early apoptotic cells among transfected cells treated with paclitaxel for 16 or 48 h are summarized in TableI. Data presented as the (percent in paclitaxel-treated cells/percent in Me2SO-treated cells) ratios among cells expressing different dn signaling proteins are compared in Fig. 2. In transfected cells without paclitaxel treatment, expression of dn vectors decreased the percentage of early apoptotic cells. These decreases in basal levels of apoptosis were specific for expression of these dn expression vectors because expression of irrelevant genes in pCMV-lacZ, pcDNA3-kinase dead-p70S6kinase, or pCMV-CD20 did not decrease basal apoptosis (data not shown). Treatment with paclitaxel for 16 h significantly increased apoptosis in both control vector-transfected and dn-Ras-transfected cells (p < 0.05), but the induction of apoptosis by paclitaxel was decreased to statistically insignificant levels (NS) in cells expressing dn-ASK1, dn-Rac, dn-JNKK, or dn-JNK (Table I and Fig. 2 A). In contrast to 16 h treatment with paclitaxel, 48 h of treatment significantly (p < 0.05) increased early apoptotic cells in all transfected cells irrespective of expression of dn vector types (Table I and Fig. 2 B).Table IApoptotic effects of paclitaxel treatment on transfected cellsTx timeExpressed vectorsMe2SOPaclitaxelStatistics16 hControl11.5 ± 0.317.7 ± 0.2p < 0.05Dn-Ras6.5 ± 0.2*9.6 ± 0.8‡p < 0.05Dn-ASK18.5 ± 0.59.5 ± 0.4‡NSaNS, not significant.Dn-Rac5.0 ± 0.4*5.9 ± 0.3‡NSDn-JNKK8.1 ± 0.39.5 ± 1.1‡NSDn-JNK7.3 ± 0.5*8.7 ± 1.0‡NS48 hControl16.5 ± 1.533.1 ± 1.3p < 0.05Dn-Ras13.9 ± 0.833.8 ± 0.7p < 0.05Dn-ASK117.8 ± 1.028.1 ± 1.2p < 0.05Dn-Rac13.6 ± 0.937.8 ± 1.4p < 0.05Dn-JNKK14.9 ± 0.631.6 ± 0.8p < 0.05Dn-JNK14.3 ± 1.132.1 ± 1.3p< 0.05Human ovarian cancer BR cells were cotransfected with pEGFP and empty (control) or dn expression vectors for 24 h, treated with 1 μm paclitaxel for 16 or 48 h, and stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated annexin-V and 7-AAD followed by flow cytometric analyses.

Open table in a new tab Human ovarian cancer BR cells were cotransfected with pEGFP and empty (control) or dn expression vectors for 24 h, treated with 1 μm paclitaxel for 16 or 48 h, and stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated annexin-V and 7-AAD followed by flow cytometric analyses.

The symbols (* and ‡) indicate significant differences (p < 0.05) between cells expressing dn vectors and cells expressing control vector (italicized values) within each treatment group (vertical comparisons). To verify that expression of dn signaling proteins efficiently inhibited endogenous JNK/SAPK activity, we co-transfected BR cells with pEGFP and dn expression vectors, isolated transfected cells by flow cytometry using expression of pEGFP (green fluorescence) as a selectable marker, treated with paclitaxel, and analyzed by immunocomplex JNK assay. We isolated only live (7-AAD negative) green cells expressing transfected vectors (Fig.3 A) and verified expression of dn signaling proteins by Western blot analyses (Fig. 3, Band C). The inability of dn vectors to protect cells from apoptosis following a 48-h treatment with paclitaxel did not result from decreased expression of dn signaling proteins. We have confirmed substantial expression of EGFP by fluorescent microscopy (data not shown) and expression of dn signaling proteins by Western blot analyses up to 48 h of paclitaxel treatment (Fig. 3, B and C). At 48 h of treatment, protein levels of dn-JNK or dn-ASK1 in Me2SO-treated cells remained as high as those at earlier time points; whereas those in paclitaxel-treated cells slightly decreased, perhaps resulting from a general protein degradation during apoptosis (Fig. 3, B and C). Despite its slight decrease in later time points of paclitaxel treatment, expression of these dn signaling proteins efficiently suppressed paclitaxel-induced JNK activation through all the time points (Fig. 3, B andC). Collectively, these results suggest that expression of dn-ASK1, dn-Rac, dn-JNKK, or dn-JNK transiently protects ovarian cancer cells from paclitaxel-induced apoptosis up to 16 h. When treated with paclitaxel for a longer time, such as 48 h, cells may undergo apoptosis through additional, JNK/SAPK-independent mechanisms. To investigate whether these dn signaling proteins inhibited paclitaxel-induced apoptosis through regulation on cell cycle progression, we analyzed cell cycle profiles of cells expressing dn signaling proteins at 16, 24, and 48 h of paclitaxel treatment. Compared with cells expressing control vector, expression of dn-ASK1, dn-Rac, dn-JNKK, or dn-JNK did not change cell cycle profiles, nor interfere with mitotic arrest of cells after paclitaxel treatment (Fig.4). To examine the time course of inhibition of apoptosis by dn signaling proteins, we treated isolated cells expressing control vector or dn signaling proteins with paclitaxel and quantified DNA fragmentation with ELISA. Expression of dn-ASK1, dn-Rac, dn-JNKK, or dn-JNK significantly inhibited paclitaxel-induced DNA fragmentation up to 16 h, whereas the inhibition declined at 24 h and completely disappeared at 36 h of treatment (Fig. 5 A). In transfected cells treated with paclitaxel for 16 h, expression of dn-ASK1, dn-Rac, dn-JNKK, or dn-JNK significantly inhibited caspase-3 activation by paclitaxel (Fig. 5 B) and suppressed paclitaxel-induced PARP cleavage (Fig. 5 C). These results are consistent with data given above for annexin-V binding (Table I and Fig. 2), again indicating that inhibition of the JNK/SAPK signaling pathways transiently protects ovarian cancer cells from paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Our data would predict that overexpression of wt signaling proteins of the JNK/SAPK pathways may promote paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Flow cytometric analyses on annexin-V binding confirmed that overexpression of wt-ASK1, wt-Rac, of wt-JNK significantly (p < 0.05) promoted apoptosis in both Me2SO-treated and 16 h paclitaxel-treated BR cells (Fig. 6 A). Consistent with flow cytometric data, overexpression of wt-ASK1, wt-Rac, or wt-JNK also significantly (p < 0.05) increased basal and paclitaxel-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6 B) and the increases in apoptosis measured by two independent methods are very similar. Western blot analyses with an anti-HA epitope antibody (12CA5) and an anti-Myc epitope antibody (9E10) confirmed expression of HA-wt-ASK1, HA-wt-JNK, and Myc-wt-Rac (Fig. 6 C, upper panel) and immunocomplex kinase assays verified the augmentation of paclitaxel-induced JNK activation by overexpressed signaling proteins (Fig. 6 C, lower panel). The increases in the apoptosis induced by paclitaxel above those due to overexpression of wt signaling proteins were the same as that in paclitaxel-treated, control-transfected cells (Fig. 6, A and B). Therefore, the effects of paclitaxel and overexpression of wt signaling proteins appear to be additive. However, among cells overexpressing these wt signaling proteins, the 8–12-fold JNK activation induced by paclitaxel (Fig. 6 C) was not proportional to the 2.5–3.5-fold increase of apoptosis (Fig. 6, A andB), suggesting that activation of JNK is not linearly related to apoptosis. To examine whether the JNK/SAPK signaling cascade plays a specific role in apoptosis resulting from microtubular dysfunction, we compared JNK activations and cytotoxicities in ovarian cancer cells treated with paclitaxel or treated with two DNA targeting agents, actinomycin D and cisplatin. Treatment with 5 μm actinomycin D or 50 μmcisplatin for 16 h induced a comparable ladder pattern of DNA fragmentation with that induced by paclitaxel treatment (Fig.7 A), whereas only paclitaxel significantly activated JNK (Fig. 7 B). Moreover, expression of dn-ASK1 or dn-JNK only inhibited DNA fragmentation induced by 16-h paclitaxel treatment but not that induced by actinomycin D or cisplatin (Fig. 7 C). To determine whether paclitaxel-activated JNK/SAPK is required for phosphorylation of Bcl-2 in paclitaxel-treated cells, we co-transfected BR cells with pEGFP and dn expression vectors and treated cells with 1 μm paclitaxel for 16 h. Following treatment, green fluorescent positive (transfected) and negative (non-transfected) cells were analyzed separately for phosphorylation of Bcl-2. Phosphorylated Bcl-2 bands exhibiting slower mobility on Western blots were identified from both transfected and non-transfected cells, irrespective of which dn vectors were overexpressed (Fig.8 A). To confirm these results by an alternative approach, we co-transfected cells with pEGFP and dn vectors, isolated transfected cells by flow cytometric sorting, then treated control or dn vector-expressing cells with paclitaxel or Me2SO for 16 h and analyzed the status of Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Consistent with previous experiments, treatment with paclitaxel induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 in all transfected cells, including those expressing control vector or vectors for dn-ASK1, dn-Rac, dn-JNKK, or dn-JNK (Fig. 8 B). Collectively, these results indicated that inhibition of the JNK/SAPK signaling cascade did not influence paclitaxel-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2. Activation of the JNK/SAPK signaling pathways has been mechanistically implicated in regulation of apoptosis (16Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, in addition to apoptosis, JNK/SAPK activation may be involved in proliferation (38Smith A. Ramos-Morales F. Ashworth A. Collins M. Curr.

On the other hand, apoptosis itself can be considered as a form of stress, hence, JNK/SAPK activation may be a stress response secondary to apoptosis, rather than a primary mediator in apoptotic pathways (19Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that in BR ovarian cancer cells treated with paclitaxel, activation of JNK/SAPK reaches a peak at 2 h when apoptosis is still minimal (14Wang T.H. Wang H.S. Ichijo H.

The present study in human endothelial cells from umbilical veins and coronary arteries investigates whether l-ascorbic acid additionally affects cellular NO synthesis. Endothelial cells were incubated for 24 h with 0.1–100 μm ascorbic acid and were subsequently stimulated for 15 min with ionomycin (2 μm) or thrombin (1 unit/ml) in the absence of extracellular ascorbate. Ascorbate pretreatment led to a 3-fold increase of the cellular production of NO measured as the formation of its co-product citrulline and as the accumulation of its effector molecule cGMP. The effect was saturated at 100 μm and followed a similar kinetics as seen for the uptake of ascorbate into the cells. The investigation of the precursor moleculel-gulonolactone and of different ascorbic acid derivatives suggests that the enediol structure of ascorbate is essential for its effect on NO synthesis. Ascorbic acid did not induce the expression of the NO synthase (NOS) protein nor enhance the uptake of the NOS substrate l-arginine into endothelial cells. The ascorbic acid effect was minimal when the citrulline formation was measured in cell lysates from ascorbate-pretreated cells in the presence of known cofactors for NOS activity. However, when the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin was omitted from the assay, a similar potentiating effect of ascorbate pretreatment as seen in intact cells was demonstrated, suggesting that ascorbic acid may either enhance the availability of tetrahydrobiopterin or increase its affinity for the endothelial NOS. Our data suggest that intracellular ascorbic acid enhances NO synthesis in endothelial cells and that this may explain, in part, the beneficial vascular effects of ascorbic acid.

NO is generated from the conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline by the enzymatic action of an NADPH-dependent NO synthase (NOS) that requires tetrahydrobiopterin, FAD, and FMN as cofactors (5Palmer R.M.J. Ashton D.S. Moncada S. Nature. 1988; 133: 664-666Crossref Scopus (4095) Google Scholar). The endothelial NOS isoform (ecNOS) is constitutively expressed and is activated upon an increase of intracellular calcium following cell stimulation with receptor-dependent stimuli such as thrombin and bradykinin or with receptor-independent stimuli like calcium ionophore (6Busse R. Mülsch A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar).Since NO interferes with key processes in atherogenesis (7Bult H. Mol. Med. Today. 1996; 2: 510-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a lack of NO might promote the development of atherosclerosis. Indeed, clinical studies have confirmed an impairment of vascular NO synthesis in patients with atherosclerosis or with increased atherogenic risk factors (8Cooke J.P. Dzau V.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 489-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The dysfunction of the endothelial NO pathway may involve impaired signal transduction mechanisms, decreased ecNOS activity, reduced intracellular availability of l-arginine, or increased inactivation of NO by superoxide anions or oxidized low density lipoproteins (7Bult H. Mol. Med. Today. 1996; 2: 510-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Cooke J.P. Dzau V.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 489-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Accordingly, initial therapeutic strategies for an improvement of endothelial vasodilator function include the application of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors that stimulate NO synthesis through the local accumulation of bradykinin as well as the supplementation of l-arginine and the use of antioxidants (7Bult H.

Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6377-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). It effectively scavenges superoxide and other reactive oxygen species and protects lipids against peroxidation (11Som S. Raha C. Chatterjee I.B. Acta Vitaminol.

Ascorbic acid is thought to play a protective role in atherogenesis since epidemiological studies have demonstrated that plasma ascorbic acid levels are inversely related to the mortality from coronary heart disease (13Weber P. Bendlich A. Schalch W. Int. J. Vitam. Nutr. Res. 1996; 66: 19-30PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a number of conditions known to be associated with an increased risk for atherosclerosis have been linked with lower plasma levels of ascorbic acid (14Schectman G. Byrd J.C. Gruchow H.W.

Recently, several studies have shown that an acute application of ascorbic acid enhanced endothelium-dependent vasodilation in patients with diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or chronic heart failure and in cigarette smokers (18Ting H.H.

These findings were attributed to the radical scavenging ability of ascorbic acid which may protect NO from inactivation. So far, however, direct effects of ascorbic acid on endothelial NO synthesis have not been examined.The present study was designed to investigate whether ascorbic acid affects NO production in human endothelial cells. The synthesis of NO was measured as the formation of its co-product citrulline and as the accumulation of its effector molecule cGMP after stimulating ascorbate-pretreated cells with the calcium-increasing agonists ionomycin and thrombin. Additionally, the influence of ascorbic acid on calcium-dependent citrulline formation in cell lysates and on the content of ecNOS protein was investigated. We report that ascorbic acid stimulates NO synthesis in endothelial cells, and we suggest that this action may be an important characteristic of this agent to exert its beneficial effects in the vascular system.DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrates that l-ascorbic acid in physiologically relevant concentrations (28Dhariwal K.R. Hartzell W.O. Levine M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 54: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 29Levine M. Conry-Cantilena C. Wang Y. Welch R.W. Washko P.W. Dhariwal K.R. Park J.B.

A. 1996; 93: 3704-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar) potentiates agonist-induced endothelial NO synthesis in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. This was shown by concomitant changes of both the formation of the NO co-product citrulline and the accumulation of the NO effector molecule cGMP, although the latter might additionally indicate an increase in biological activity of NO.The ascorbate effect on NO synthesis was most likely due to an increase of the intracellular ascorbic acid concentration since cell stimulation was performed in the absence of extracellular ascorbate. Under normal culture conditions cells are unlikely to be saturated with ascorbic acid because its concentration in culture media is generally low. Accordingly, an incubation of the cells with ascorbate may lead to an intracellular accumulation of the compound. Indeed, using 100 μm14C-labeled ascorbate we found an uptake of the compound into endothelial cells which was time-dependent and saturated between 12 and 24 h. The nature of this uptake is as yet unknown, although the involvement of an active transport mechanism has been demonstrated in endothelial cells (27Ek A. Ström K. Cotgreave I.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).We suggest that the observed rate of ascorbic acid transport into endothelial cells demonstrated in the present study may at least partially account for the time dependence of the ascorbate effect on endothelial NO synthesis. The latter followed a kinetics similar to the ascorbate uptake being about half-maximal after a 6-h incubation of cells with 100 μm ascorbic acid and maximal between 18 and 24 h. Moreover, a saturation of the ascorbate uptake into endothelial cells which might occur between 100 and 200 μm (27Ek A. Ström K. Cotgreave I.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) could explain the lack of further NO synthesis potentiation with ascorbic acid concentrations above 100 μm. Interestingly, 100 μm is in the range of plasma levels of healthy individuals (28Dhariwal K.R. Hartzell W.O. Levine M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 54: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and similar concentrations have been found in a recent pharmacokinetic study that described the ascorbic acid concentration as a function of dose in healthy volunteers (29Levine M. Conry-Cantilena C. Wang Y. Welch R.W. Washko P.W. Dhariwal K.R. Park J.B. Lazarev A. Graumlich J.F. King J. Cantilena L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3704-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar).The molecular structure of l-ascorbic acid consists of an unsaturated γ-lactone ring with an enediol configuration (–COH=COH) conjugated with a carbonyl group (Fig. 5). Our data suggest that this structure may be essential for the potentiating effect of ascorbate on NO production. l-Gulonolactone, an ascorbic acid precursor molecule, is lacking the enediol configuration and cannot be transformed into ascorbic acid in human cells due to the absence of the enzyme l-gulonolactone oxidase. Accordingly, it did not affect ionomycin-induced citrulline or cGMP synthesis. On the other hand, dehydroascorbic acid which is partially converted back to ascorbate by glutathione-dependent reactions (30Winkler B.S. Orseili S.M. Rex T.S. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1994; 17: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) exerted a partial stimulatory effect, and ascorbate 2-phosphate, known to be hydrolyzed by phosphatases to restore the unsubstituted enediol ring structure (31Machlin L.J. Garcia F. Kuenzig W. Brin M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1979; 32: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was as active as ascorbate itself in potentiating NO synthesis. Similarly, ascorbate 2-sulfate exerted a stimulatory action which was, however, less than 30% of the ascorbate effect. This might be due to a lack of the hydrolyzing enzyme arylsulfatase A (32Fluharty A.L. Stevens R.L. Miller R.T. Shapiro S.S. Kihara H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and corresponds to studies that have shown that the ascorbic acid activity of ascorbate 2-sulfate was low in humans (33Tsujimura M. Fukuda T. Kasai T.J. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 1982; 28: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Although ascorbic acid clearly enhanced agonist-induced NO production in endothelial cells, it did not induce the expression of ecNOS protein. The amount of ecNOS recognized with specific monoclonal antibodies in cell lysates or in permeabilized cells was not altered by ascorbate pretreatment. Likewise, ascorbic acid did not induce de novo synthesis of NOS since the 35S-labeled protein band which could be clearly identified as ecNOS by immunostaining was not different in untreated and ascorbate-treated cells. The potentiating effect of ascorbic acid on NO synthesis was also not due to a supplementation of the NOS substrate l-arginine because ascorbic acid did not increase the cellular uptake of this amino acid. Since the endothelial NO formation is influenced by the intracellular amount of cofactors such as NADPH, FAD, FMN, tetrahydrobiopterin, and calcium/calmodulin (34Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), we suggested that ascorbate might act through effects on the availability of these compounds. Indeed, when the NO formation was determined in cell lysates from control cells and ascorbate-pretreated cells under saturated conditions and in the presence of all NOS cofactors, the potentiating effect of ascorbic acid was largely lost. Interestingly, this was most probably due to the addition of tetrahydrobiopterin since a potentiating effect of an ascorbate pretreatment was seen in cell lysates when only tetrahydrobiopterin was omitted from the assay. Moreover, the addition of tetrahydrobiopterin reversed the ascorbate effect in the absence of the cofactors FAD, FMN, or calmodulin, and when tetrahydrobiopterin was omitted, the potentiating effect of an ascorbate pretreatment on citrulline synthesis could be seen regardless whether FAD, FMN, and calmodulin were added to the cell lysates (data not shown). From these results we can speculate that ascorbic acid may at least partially act through an effect on the availability of tetrahydrobiopterin or enhance the affinity of this cofactor toward ecNOS. An increase of intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin levels has already been shown to stimulate the constitutive NOS activity suggesting that the ecNOS is incompletely saturated with this cofactor (35Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Wachter H. Kukovetz E.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 36Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Schmidt K. Weiss G. Wachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1842-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tetrahydrobiopterin is thought to stabilize the active homodimeric NOS (37List B.M. Klösch B. Völker C. Gorren A.C.F. Sessa W.C. Werner E.R. Kukovetz W.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and probably acts as both a redox-active cofactor of l-arginine oxidation and an allosteric effector of the enzyme protein (38Mayer B. Werner E.R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 351: 351-364Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The possibility that ascorbic acid may enhance the apparent affinity of tetrahydrobiopterin for the neuronal NOS isoform has also been suggested (39Hofmann H. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13443-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).So far, protective vascular effects of ascorbic acid have been attributed to its radical scavenging properties which may lead to a protection of NO from inactivation by superoxide anion and to an increase of NO bioavailability. These mechanisms may be importantin vivo and may explain the improvement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in cardiovascular patients by an acute ascorbic acid application (18Ting H.H.

The results presented in this study describe a new mechanism for vascular protection by ascorbic acid which may be effective when plasma levels of ascorbic acid supply saturated intracellular ascorbate concentrations. We suggest that tissue saturation with ascorbic acid provides the optimal reaction conditions for adequate NO synthesis in endothelial cells and that a decrease in the cellular ascorbic acid content may support the development of endothelial dysfunction. Future clinical studies investigating ascorbate effects on endothelial functions should thus include parameters that evaluate NO formation in vivo.In summary, this study demonstrates that l-ascorbic acid potentiates agonist-induced NO formation in cultured endothelial cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The effect was time-dependent, related to an increase of intracellular ascorbate levels, and saturated within physiologically relevant concentrations. Ascorbic acid did not induce the expression of ecNOS protein and may at least partially act through an effect on the availability or affinity of tetrahydrobiopterin for ecNOS. Further studies are in progress to clarify these suggested mechanisms. The findings presented in this study suggest that NO formation in endothelial cells depends on tissue ascorbate levels and that tissue saturation with ascorbic acid may add to the strategies for an improvement of endothelial vasodilator function in humans. Endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO)1 exerts several vasoprotective activities including smooth muscle relaxation, inhibition of platelet activation, and regulation of endothelial cell permeability and adhesivity (1Furchgott R.F. Zawadski J.V. Nature. 1980; 288: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar, 2Alheid U. Frölich J.C. Förstermann U. Thromb.

NO is generated from the conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline by the enzymatic action of an NADPH-dependent NO synthase (NOS) that requires tetrahydrobiopterin, FAD, and FMN as cofactors (5Palmer R.M.J. Ashton D.S. Moncada S. Nature. 1988; 133: 664-666Crossref Scopus (4095) Google Scholar). The endothelial NOS isoform (ecNOS) is constitutively expressed and is activated upon an increase of intracellular calcium following cell stimulation with receptor-dependent stimuli such as thrombin and bradykinin or with receptor-independent stimuli like calcium ionophore (6Busse R. Mülsch A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Since NO interferes with key processes in atherogenesis (7Bult H. Mol. Med. Today. 1996; 2: 510-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a lack of NO might promote the development of atherosclerosis. Indeed, clinical studies have confirmed an impairment of vascular NO synthesis in patients with atherosclerosis or with increased atherogenic risk factors (8Cooke J.P. Dzau V.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 489-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The dysfunction of the endothelial NO pathway may involve impaired signal transduction mechanisms, decreased ecNOS activity, reduced intracellular availability of l-arginine, or increased inactivation of NO by superoxide anions or oxidized low density lipoproteins (7Bult H. Mol. Med. Today. 1996; 2: 510-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Cooke J.P. Dzau V.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 489-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Accordingly, initial therapeutic strategies for an improvement of endothelial vasodilator function include the application of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors that stimulate NO synthesis through the local accumulation of bradykinin as well as the supplementation of l-arginine and the use of antioxidants (7Bult H. Mol. Med. Today. 1996; 2: 510-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Moncada S. Higgs E.A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Ascorbic acid is the most important water-soluble antioxidant in human plasma (10Frei B. England L. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6377-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). It effectively scavenges superoxide and other reactive oxygen species and protects lipids against peroxidation (11Som S. Raha C. Chatterjee I.B. Acta Vitaminol. Enzymol. 1983; 5: 243-250PubMed Google Scholar, 12Retsky K.L. Freeman M.W. Frei B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1304-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ascorbic acid is thought to play a protective role in atherogenesis since epidemiological studies have demonstrated that plasma ascorbic acid levels are inversely related to the mortality from coronary heart disease (13Weber P. Bendlich A. Schalch W. Int. J. Vitam. Nutr. Res. 1996; 66: 19-30PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a number of conditions known to be associated with an increased risk for atherosclerosis have been linked with lower plasma levels of ascorbic acid (14Schectman G. Byrd J.C. Gruchow H.W. Am. J. Public Health. 1989; 79: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 15Ness A.R. Khaw K.-T. Bingham S. Day N.E. J.

Recently, several studies have shown that an acute application of ascorbic acid enhanced endothelium-dependent vasodilation in patients with diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or chronic heart failure and in cigarette smokers (18Ting H.H.

These findings were attributed to the radical scavenging ability of ascorbic acid which may protect NO from inactivation. So far, however, direct effects of ascorbic acid on endothelial NO synthesis have not been examined. The present study was designed to investigate whether ascorbic acid affects NO production in human endothelial cells. The synthesis of NO was measured as the formation of its co-product citrulline and as the accumulation of its effector molecule cGMP after stimulating ascorbate-pretreated cells with the calcium-increasing agonists ionomycin and thrombin. Additionally, the influence of ascorbic acid on calcium-dependent citrulline formation in cell lysates and on the content of ecNOS protein was investigated. We report that ascorbic acid stimulates NO synthesis in endothelial cells, and we suggest that this action may be an important characteristic of this agent to exert its beneficial effects in the vascular system. DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrates that l-ascorbic acid in physiologically relevant concentrations (28Dhariwal K.R. Hartzell W.O. Levine M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 54: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 29Levine M. Conry-Cantilena C. Wang Y. Welch R.W. Washko P.W. Dhariwal K.R. Park J.B. Lazarev A. Graumlich J.F. King J. Cantilena L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3704-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar) potentiates agonist-induced endothelial NO synthesis in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. This was shown by concomitant changes of both the formation of the NO co-product citrulline and the accumulation of the NO effector molecule cGMP, although the latter might additionally indicate an increase in biological activity of NO.The ascorbate effect on NO synthesis was most likely due to an increase of the intracellular ascorbic acid concentration since cell stimulation was performed in the absence of extracellular ascorbate. Under normal culture conditions cells are unlikely to be saturated with ascorbic acid because its concentration in culture media is generally low. Accordingly, an incubation of the cells with ascorbate may lead to an intracellular accumulation of the compound. Indeed, using 100 μm14C-labeled ascorbate we found an uptake of the compound into endothelial cells which was time-dependent and saturated between 12 and 24 h. The nature of this uptake is as yet unknown, although the involvement of an active transport mechanism has been demonstrated in endothelial cells (27Ek A. Ström K. Cotgreave I.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).We suggest that the observed rate of ascorbic acid transport into endothelial cells demonstrated in the present study may at least partially account for the time dependence of the ascorbate effect on endothelial NO synthesis. The latter followed a kinetics similar to the ascorbate uptake being about half-maximal after a 6-h incubation of cells with 100 μm ascorbic acid and maximal between 18 and 24 h. Moreover, a saturation of the ascorbate uptake into endothelial cells which might occur between 100 and 200 μm (27Ek A. Ström K. Cotgreave I.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) could explain the lack of further NO synthesis potentiation with ascorbic acid concentrations above 100 μm. Interestingly, 100 μm is in the range of plasma levels of healthy individuals (28Dhariwal K.R. Hartzell W.O. Levine M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 54: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and similar concentrations have been found in a recent pharmacokinetic study that described the ascorbic acid concentration as a function of dose in healthy volunteers (29Levine M. Conry-Cantilena C. Wang Y. Welch R.W. Washko P.W. Dhariwal K.R. Park J.B. Lazarev A. Graumlich J.F. King J. Cantilena L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3704-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar).The molecular structure of l-ascorbic acid consists of an unsaturated γ-lactone ring with an enediol configuration (–COH=COH) conjugated with a carbonyl group (Fig. 5). Our data suggest that this structure may be essential for the potentiating effect of ascorbate on NO production. l-Gulonolactone, an ascorbic acid precursor molecule, is lacking the enediol configuration and cannot be transformed into ascorbic acid in human cells due to the absence of the enzyme l-gulonolactone oxidase. Accordingly, it did not affect ionomycin-induced citrulline or cGMP synthesis. On the other hand, dehydroascorbic acid which is partially converted back to ascorbate by glutathione-dependent reactions (30Winkler B.S. Orseili S.M. Rex T.S. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1994; 17: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) exerted a partial stimulatory effect, and ascorbate 2-phosphate, known to be hydrolyzed by phosphatases to restore the unsubstituted enediol ring structure (31Machlin L.J. Garcia F. Kuenzig W. Brin M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1979; 32: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was as active as ascorbate itself in potentiating NO synthesis. Similarly, ascorbate 2-sulfate exerted a stimulatory action which was, however, less than 30% of the ascorbate effect. This might be due to a lack of the hydrolyzing enzyme arylsulfatase A (32Fluharty A.L. Stevens R.L. Miller R.T. Shapiro S.S. Kihara H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and corresponds to studies that have shown that the ascorbic acid activity of ascorbate 2-sulfate was low in humans (33Tsujimura M. Fukuda T. Kasai T.J. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 1982; 28: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Although ascorbic acid clearly enhanced agonist-induced NO production in endothelial cells, it did not induce the expression of ecNOS protein. The amount of ecNOS recognized with specific monoclonal antibodies in cell lysates or in permeabilized cells was not altered by ascorbate pretreatment. Likewise, ascorbic acid did not induce de novo synthesis of NOS since the 35S-labeled protein band which could be clearly identified as ecNOS by immunostaining was not different in untreated and ascorbate-treated cells. The potentiating effect of ascorbic acid on NO synthesis was also not due to a supplementation of the NOS substrate l-arginine because ascorbic acid did not increase the cellular uptake of this amino acid. Since the endothelial NO formation is influenced by the intracellular amount of cofactors such as NADPH, FAD, FMN, tetrahydrobiopterin, and calcium/calmodulin (34Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), we suggested that ascorbate might act through effects on the availability of these compounds. Indeed, when the NO formation was determined in cell lysates from control cells and ascorbate-pretreated cells under saturated conditions and in the presence of all NOS cofactors, the potentiating effect of ascorbic acid was largely lost. Interestingly, this was most probably due to the addition of tetrahydrobiopterin since a potentiating effect of an ascorbate pretreatment was seen in cell lysates when only tetrahydrobiopterin was omitted from the assay. Moreover, the addition of tetrahydrobiopterin reversed the ascorbate effect in the absence of the cofactors FAD, FMN, or calmodulin, and when tetrahydrobiopterin was omitted, the potentiating effect of an ascorbate pretreatment on citrulline synthesis could be seen regardless whether FAD, FMN, and calmodulin were added to the cell lysates (data not shown). From these results we can speculate that ascorbic acid may at least partially act through an effect on the availability of tetrahydrobiopterin or enhance the affinity of this cofactor toward ecNOS. An increase of intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin levels has already been shown to stimulate the constitutive NOS activity suggesting that the ecNOS is incompletely saturated with this cofactor (35Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Wachter H. Kukovetz E.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 36Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Schmidt K. Weiss G. Wachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1842-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tetrahydrobiopterin is thought to stabilize the active homodimeric NOS (37List B.M. Klösch B. Völker C. Gorren A.C.F. Sessa W.C. Werner E.R. Kukovetz W.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and probably acts as both a redox-active cofactor of l-arginine oxidation and an allosteric effector of the enzyme protein (38Mayer B. Werner E.R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 351: 351-364Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The possibility that ascorbic acid may enhance the apparent affinity of tetrahydrobiopterin for the neuronal NOS isoform has also been suggested (39Hofmann H. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13443-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).So far, protective vascular effects of ascorbic acid have been attributed to its radical scavenging properties which may lead to a protection of NO from inactivation by superoxide anion and to an increase of NO bioavailability. These mechanisms may be importantin vivo and may explain the improvement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in cardiovascular patients by an acute ascorbic acid application (18Ting H.H.

The results presented in this study describe a new mechanism for vascular protection by ascorbic acid which may be effective when plasma levels of ascorbic acid supply saturated intracellular ascorbate concentrations. We suggest that tissue saturation with ascorbic acid provides the optimal reaction conditions for adequate NO synthesis in endothelial cells and that a decrease in the cellular ascorbic acid content may support the development of endothelial dysfunction. Future clinical studies investigating ascorbate effects on endothelial functions should thus include parameters that evaluate NO formation in vivo.In summary, this study demonstrates that l-ascorbic acid potentiates agonist-induced NO formation in cultured endothelial cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The effect was time-dependent, related to an increase of intracellular ascorbate levels, and saturated within physiologically relevant concentrations. Ascorbic acid did not induce the expression of ecNOS protein and may at least partially act through an effect on the availability or affinity of tetrahydrobiopterin for ecNOS. Further studies are in progress to clarify these suggested mechanisms. The findings presented in this study suggest that NO formation in endothelial cells depends on tissue ascorbate levels and that tissue saturation with ascorbic acid may add to the strategies for an improvement of endothelial vasodilator function in humans.

Acta. 1976; 429: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and corresponds to studies that have shown that the ascorbic acid activity of ascorbate 2-sulfate was low in humans (33Tsujimura M. Fukuda T. Kasai T.J. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 1982; 28: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although ascorbic acid clearly enhanced agonist-induced NO production in endothelial cells, it did not induce the expression of ecNOS protein. The amount of ecNOS recognized with specific monoclonal antibodies in cell lysates or in permeabilized cells was not altered by ascorbate pretreatment. Likewise, ascorbic acid did not induce de novo synthesis of NOS since the 35S-labeled protein band which could be clearly identified as ecNOS by immunostaining was not different in untreated and ascorbate-treated cells. The potentiating effect of ascorbic acid on NO synthesis was also not due to a supplementation of the NOS substrate l-arginine because ascorbic acid did not increase the cellular uptake of this amino acid. Since the endothelial NO formation is influenced by the intracellular amount of cofactors such as NADPH, FAD, FMN, tetrahydrobiopterin, and calcium/calmodulin (34Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), we suggested that ascorbate might act through effects on the availability of these compounds. Indeed, when the NO formation was determined in cell lysates from control cells and ascorbate-pretreated cells under saturated conditions and in the presence of all NOS cofactors, the potentiating effect of ascorbic acid was largely lost. Interestingly, this was most probably due to the addition of tetrahydrobiopterin since a potentiating effect of an ascorbate pretreatment was seen in cell lysates when only tetrahydrobiopterin was omitted from the assay. Moreover, the addition of tetrahydrobiopterin reversed the ascorbate effect in the absence of the cofactors FAD, FMN, or calmodulin, and when tetrahydrobiopterin was omitted, the potentiating effect of an ascorbate pretreatment on citrulline synthesis could be seen regardless whether FAD, FMN, and calmodulin were added to the cell lysates (data not shown). From these results we can speculate that ascorbic acid may at least partially act through an effect on the availability of tetrahydrobiopterin or enhance the affinity of this cofactor toward ecNOS. An increase of intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin levels has already been shown to stimulate the constitutive NOS activity suggesting that the ecNOS is incompletely saturated with this cofactor (35Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Wachter H. Kukovetz E.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 36Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Schmidt K. Weiss G. Wachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1842-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tetrahydrobiopterin is thought to stabilize the active homodimeric NOS (37List B.M. Klösch B. Völker C. Gorren A.C.F. Sessa W.C. Werner E.R. Kukovetz W.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and probably acts as both a redox-active cofactor of l-arginine oxidation and an allosteric effector of the enzyme protein (38Mayer B. Werner E.R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 351: 351-364Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The possibility that ascorbic acid may enhance the apparent affinity of tetrahydrobiopterin for the neuronal NOS isoform has also been suggested (39Hofmann H. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13443-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). So far, protective vascular effects of ascorbic acid have been attributed to its radical scavenging properties which may lead to a protection of NO from inactivation by superoxide anion and to an increase of NO bioavailability. These mechanisms may be importantin vivo and may explain the improvement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in cardiovascular patients by an acute ascorbic acid application (18Ting H.H.

The results presented in this study describe a new mechanism for vascular protection by ascorbic acid which may be effective when plasma levels of ascorbic acid supply saturated intracellular ascorbate concentrations. We suggest that tissue saturation with ascorbic acid provides the optimal reaction conditions for adequate NO synthesis in endothelial cells and that a decrease in the cellular ascorbic acid content may support the development of endothelial dysfunction. Future clinical studies investigating ascorbate effects on endothelial functions should thus include parameters that evaluate NO formation in vivo. In summary, this study demonstrates that l-ascorbic acid potentiates agonist-induced NO formation in cultured endothelial cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The effect was time-dependent, related to an increase of intracellular ascorbate levels, and saturated within physiologically relevant concentrations. Ascorbic acid did not induce the expression of ecNOS protein and may at least partially act through an effect on the availability or affinity of tetrahydrobiopterin for ecNOS. Further studies are in progress to clarify these suggested mechanisms. The findings presented in this study suggest that NO formation in endothelial cells depends on tissue ascorbate levels and that tissue saturation with ascorbic acid may add to the strategies for an improvement of endothelial vasodilator function in humans.

E., Thomas, A., Devi, L. A., Berman, Y., Beavis, R. C., Reed, J. C., and Newcomb, E. W. (1998) Oncogene 17, 1069–1078). Here we show the sequential activation of caspases and calpain during drug-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells. Time course experiments using the topoisomerase I inhibitor 9-amino-20(S)-camptothecin revealed that cleavage of caspase-3 substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and the retinoblastoma protein as well as DNA fragmentation occurred several hours before calpain activation and Bax cleavage. Pretreatment with the calpain inhibitor calpeptin blocked calpain activation and Bax cleavage but did not inhibit PARP cleavage, DNA fragmentation, or 9-amino-20(S)-camptothecin-induced morphological changes and cell death. Pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk) inhibited PARP cleavage, DNA fragmentation, calpain activation, and Bax cleavage and increased cell survival by 40%. Interestingly, Z-VAD-fmk-treated cells died in a caspase- and calpain-independent manner that appeared morphologically distinct from apoptosis. Our results suggest that excessive or uncontrolled calpain activity may play a role downstream of and distinct from caspases in the degradation phase of apoptosis. We have previously demonstrated that calpain is responsible for the cleavage of Bax, a proapoptotic protein, during drug-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells (Wood, D. E., Thomas, A., Devi, L.

Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar), related to the Caenorhabditis elegans protease CED-3 and the mammalian interleukin-1β-converting enzyme becomes activated during apoptosis and is necessary for several processes within the apoptotic pathway. Caspases are constitutively expressed and synthesized as zymogens that require proteolytic cleavage, either through a proteolytic cascade or by intermolecular autoproteolysis, to become activated (2Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). Once activated, caspases cleave their substrates in a highly sequence-specific fashion with a near absolute requirement for an aspartic acid in the P1 position (3Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4104) Google Scholar). For example, caspase-3 cleaves its substrates at a conserved DXXD motif (2Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). Many caspase substrates have been identified and include nuclear proteins such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)1 and retinoblastoma (RB) as well as structural proteins of the nucleus and cytoskeleton including lamins and gelsolin (4Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 5An B. Dou Q.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 438-442PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lazebnik Y.A.

It is believed that cleavage of some of the known caspase substrates leads to the characteristic changes in morphology and biochemistry observed in apoptotic cells (8Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). As an example, caspase-3 mediated cleavage of DNA fragmentation factor results in chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation during apoptosis (9Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar, 10Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar).Although caspases play a major part in the demise of cells that have been triggered to undergo apoptosis, there is evidence that other proteases including calpain may also be involved in this process. Calpain is a family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases of which two isozymes, μ- and m-calpain, are ubiquitously expressed (11Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). These enzymes are heterodimeric and consist of an 80-kDa catalytic subunit and a 30-kDa subunit whose function is unclear (11Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In contrast to caspases, calpain does not appear to have strict sequence requirements for substrate cleavage (11Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Under normal physiological conditions these proteases engage in limited proteolysis of a number of different substrates found throughout the cell, including nuclear proteins such as p53 and cyclin D1(12Pariat M.

For example, proteolysis of several calmodulin-binding proteins by calpain occurs in neurons that have been exposed to neurotoxins (24Hajimohammadreza I. Raser K.J. Nath R. Nadimpalli R. Scott M.

For instance, calpain-mediated cleavage of the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin β3 subunit in human umbilical vein endothelial cells contributes to disruption of signaling and detachment from the matrix resulting in apoptosis (30Meredeth Jr., J. Mu Z. Saido T. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19525-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Previously we have shown that the proapoptotic protein Bax is cleaved from its native 21-kDa form to an 18-kDa species by calpain during drug-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells (32Thomas A. El Rouby S. Reed J.C. Krajewski S. Silber R. Potmesil M. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1055-1062PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C. Reed J.C. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Here we extend these findings and show that calpain is activated secondary to caspase activation during apoptosis. Time course experiments demonstrate that calpain activation occurs after cleavage of caspase substrates and DNA fragmentation. Experiments with HL-60 cells revealed that inhibition of calpain activity by the calpain inhibitor calpeptin failed to block caspase activity and apoptosis, whereas pretreatment of cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk) blocked both caspase and calpain activity and partially inhibited cell death. Thus, in this apoptosis model there appears to be a hierarchy of protease family activation during the degradation phase of the apoptotic program.DISCUSSIONPrevious reports have demonstrated a role for calpain in the apoptotic death of several cell types including primary cultures of thymocytes, neurons, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and neutrophils as well as in permanently established cell lines (25Squier M.K.T.

Recent data obtained in our laboratory indicated that calpain activity was present in HL-60 cells triggered to undergo apoptosis with the chemotherapeutic agent 9-AC (33Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C. Reed J.C. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In this study we wanted to determine the timing of calpain activation relative to that of the caspases. Second, we wanted to determine what role calpain may play in our model of drug-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells. The data presented here indicate a sequential relationship between activation of caspases, the primary death effector proteases, and activation of calpain. Our data suggest that there is a caspase-dependent activation of calpain during the degradation stage of apoptosis.HL-60 cells treated with the topoisomerase I inhibitor 9-AC exhibited caspase-3-like activity as early as 2 h after treatment, with peak activity at 8 h (Figs. 1 and 2). This initiation of caspase activity was coincident with membrane blebbing (Fig. 6 D), but preceded DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1 B) and condensation in cell size (Fig. 6, E and F), all of which occurred in cells still displaying intact plasma membranes (Fig. 5). In comparison with the early activation of caspases, calpain activation and subsequent cleavage of Bax took place several hours after the initiation of morphological changes and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3). Indeed, the kinetics of calpain activity paralleled the initiation and progressive loss of membrane integrity (Figs. 3 and 5). These results taken together indicate a sequential activation of proteases consisting of an early activation of caspases followed by a 6-h increase in caspase function, which at its apex coincided with calpain activation.Activation of both caspases and calpain has been reported in one other lymphoid cell line, U937, during tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis (35Vanags D.M. Porn-Ares M.I. Coppola S. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31075-31085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Similar to the results described here, calpain in U937 cells appeared to be active following the initiation of caspase activity (35Vanags D.M. Porn-Ares M.I. Coppola S. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31075-31085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, in U937 cells, calpeptin proved to be more effective than Z-VAD-fmk at inhibiting several late apoptotic events including DNA and nuclear fragmentation, plasma membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies (35Vanags D.M.

Unlike HL-60 and U937 cells, the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was found to simultaneously activate caspases and calpain during staurosporine-induced apoptosis (26Nath R. Raser K.J. Stafford D.

Interestingly, in SH-SY5Y cells caspases and calpain cleave some of the same target substrates, such as nonerythroid α-spectrin (α-fodrin) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV, to produce caspase-specific and calpain-specific fragments (26Nath R.

This situation is not observed in HL-60 cells because α-spectrin is cleaved early during apoptosis in a caspase-dependent fashion, 2D. E. Wood, unpublished observations. whereas Bax is cleaved by calpain late in apoptosis strengthening the notion of a temporal relationship between the activation of the two types of proteases in our model system. The differences reported between cell lines regarding the timing of calpain activation and the ability of calpain to effect some apoptotic changes may reflect cell lineage-specific requirements for calpain activity during apoptosis.As we noted, caspase activity was at its highest at 8 h after 9-AC treatment, which was coincident with the onset of calpain activation. It is tempting to speculate that in some cell types, such as lymphoid cell lines, calpain activity may be dependent upon caspase function. Under normal circumstances calpain activity is modulated by the presence of its endogenous inhibitor calpastatin (11Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Calpastatin is generally thought to reside in the cytosol where it complexes with calpain, resulting in its inactivation (11Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Cleavage of calpastatin by caspases has been observed in both Fas-induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells and in staurosporine-induced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells, resulting in a reduction of this inhibitor's effectiveness in vitro (45Wang K.K.W. Posmantur R. Nadimpalli R. Nath R. Mohan P. Nixon R.A. Talanian R.A. Keegan M. Herzog L. Allen H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). At present, we have been unable to identify calpastatin in HL-60 cells by Western blotting thereby precluding a determination of whether caspase-mediated cleavage of calpastatin occurs in this cell line. However, the reduction in the activity of calpastatin by caspase cleavage could provide a mechanism for the uncontrolled calpain activity that is observed during the latter stages of apoptosis.Pretreatment of HL-60 cells with the calpain inhibitor calpeptin did not prevent caspase-3-like function, DNA fragmentation, morphological changes, or plasma membrane damage associated with 9-AC-induced apoptosis. In marked contrast, pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk resulted in the inhibition of caspase-3-like function, DNA fragmentation, and morphological changes. In addition, Z-VAD-fmk treatment reduced cell death by 40% (Fig. 5). However, HL-60 cells pretreated with Z-VAD-fmk eventually died in a process that by morphological criteria did not resemble the apoptotic changes observed in cells treated with 9-AC alone (Fig. 6). These results are similar to previously reported data indicating that inhibition of caspase activity with Z-VAD-fmk results in a nonapoptotic, necrotic-like death (46Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J.

In addition to blocking caspase activation and function, calpain activation measured by the autolysis of the 30-kDa calpain subunit and Bax cleavage was also essentially eliminated by Z-VAD-fmk pretreatment. Thus it appears that in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk and 9-AC, cells will undergo a delayed, nonapoptotic death involving plasma membrane damage and cell lysis, which is essentially independent of both caspase and calpain activity, as noted previously (46Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar).The data presented here allow us to construct a scenario that can account for calpain involvement in apoptosis as well as in normal cell physiology. During nonapoptotic conditions calpain activity would be controlled by its inhibitor, calpastatin. Then, perhaps because of a brief, localized calcium influx, calpain would be activated at cellular membranes in a transient manner (50Wang K.K.W. Yeun P.-W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 37: 117-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Under these conditions only a small portion of the total calpain in a cell would be active, resulting in limited cleavage of calpain substrates, allowing for normally functioning cellular physiology (13Choi Y.H.

In contrast, under apoptotic conditions uncontrolled calpain activation might be the result of a massive and sustained influx of calcium that, together with caspase activation and the potential for caspase-mediated inactivation of calpastatin, could lead to a larger fraction of active calpain engaged in excessive proteolysis of many substrates, including Bax (45Wang K.K.W. Posmantur R. Nadimpalli R. Nath R. Mohan P. Nixon R.A. Talanian R.A. Keegan M. Herzog L. Allen H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar,50Wang K.K.W. Yeun P.-W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 37: 117-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Excessive or uncontrolled calpain activity may play a role that is downstream and distinct from caspases in the degradation phase of apoptosis. Recent work has demonstrated that a family of cysteine proteases, now termed caspases (1Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar), related to the Caenorhabditis elegans protease CED-3 and the mammalian interleukin-1β-converting enzyme becomes activated during apoptosis and is necessary for several processes within the apoptotic pathway. Caspases are constitutively expressed and synthesized as zymogens that require proteolytic cleavage, either through a proteolytic cascade or by intermolecular autoproteolysis, to become activated (2Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). Once activated, caspases cleave their substrates in a highly sequence-specific fashion with a near absolute requirement for an aspartic acid in the P1 position (3Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4104) Google Scholar). For example, caspase-3 cleaves its substrates at a conserved DXXD motif (2Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). Many caspase substrates have been identified and include nuclear proteins such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)1 and retinoblastoma (RB) as well as structural proteins of the nucleus and cytoskeleton including lamins and gelsolin (4Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 5An B. Dou Q.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 438-442PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lazebnik Y.A.

It is believed that cleavage of some of the known caspase substrates leads to the characteristic changes in morphology and biochemistry observed in apoptotic cells (8Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). As an example, caspase-3 mediated cleavage of DNA fragmentation factor results in chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation during apoptosis (9Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar, 10Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Although caspases play a major part in the demise of cells that have been triggered to undergo apoptosis, there is evidence that other proteases including calpain may also be involved in this process. Calpain is a family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases of which two isozymes, μ- and m-calpain, are ubiquitously expressed (11Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). These enzymes are heterodimeric and consist of an 80-kDa catalytic subunit and a 30-kDa subunit whose function is unclear (11Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In contrast to caspases, calpain does not appear to have strict sequence requirements for substrate cleavage (11Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Under normal physiological conditions these proteases engage in limited proteolysis of a number of different substrates found throughout the cell, including nuclear proteins such as p53 and cyclin D1(12Pariat M. Carillo S. Molinari M. Salvat C. Debussche L. Bracco L. Milner J. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2806-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13Choi Y.H. Lee S.J. Nguyen P.

https://openalex.org/W2012475101,"5,6-Dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) is a classic inhibitor of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (pol II). We have previously identified and purified a novel transcription elongation factor, termed DSIF (for DRBsensitivity-inducing factor), that makes transcription sensitive to DRB. DSIF is composed of 160- and 14-kDa subunits, which are homologs of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factors Spt5 and Spt4. DSIF may either repress or stimulate transcription in vitro, depending on conditions, but its physiological function remains elusive. Here we characterize the structure and function of DSIF p160. p160 is shown to be a ubiquitous nuclear protein that forms a stable complex with p14 and interacts directly with the pol II largest subunit. Mutation analysis of p160 is used to identify structural features essential for its in vitro activity and to map the domains required for its interaction with p14 and pol II. Finally, a p160 mutant that represses DSIF activity in a dominant-negative manner is identified and used to demonstrate that DSIF represses transcription from various promoters in vivo. 5,6-Dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) is a classic inhibitor of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (pol II).

Wada T. Handa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although it has been used for more than three decades, its mode of action has long been a mystery. DRB is unique in that it shows no effect on transcription reconstituted with purified general transcription factors (GTFs) and pol II, whereas it potently represses transcription in cruder systems or in vivo (2Chodosh L.A.

Therefore, one or more factors apart from GTFs and pol II appear to be involved in DRB-sensitive transcription (1Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Such putative factors must play general roles in pol II transcription in vivo because DRB affects most of the class II genes (4Zandomeni R. Mittleman B. Bunick D. Ackerman S. Weinmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3167-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell.

Recently, we and others have identified two elongation factors essential for DRB-sensitive transcription. One of them, positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), is a protein kinase that phosphorylates the pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) in a DRB-sensitive fashion (7Mancebo H.S. Lee G.

The other, DSIF, has been purified from HeLa cell nuclear extract, based on its ability to induce DRB-sensitivity in vitro (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). DSIF is composed of 160- and 14-kDa subunits, which are homologs of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factors Spt5 and Spt4 (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S.

DSIF/Spt4-Spt5 genetically and physically interacts with pol II, and thus may directly regulate pol II processivity (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 16Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The function of DSIF in the absence of DRB remains obscure. Small amounts of DSIF, when added back to a DSIF-depleted transcription system, repress transcription only in the presence of DRB, without affecting transcription in its absence (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Higher doses of DSIF, however, repress transcription even in the absence of DRB (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In contrast, under limiting concentrations of NTPs, DSIF stimulates transcription elongation in the absence of DRB (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis in yeast also suggests a stimulatory role for Spt4-Spt5 under low NTP concentrations in vivo (16Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). DSIF p160 has many distinctive structural features (Refs. 1Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and 3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1 A). The N-terminal region is highly acidic, and several hexapeptide repeats are found at the C terminus. In the central domain, there are four stretches with significant similarity to NusG, a prokaryotic transcription termination and anti-termination factor (17Greenblatt J. Nodwell J.R. Mason S.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 18Mogridge J. Mah T.F. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2831-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Sullivan S.L. Gottesman M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 989-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The corresponding region of NusG has recently been found to share homology with a class of proteins involved in translation and is termed the KOW motif, though its function is unknown (20Kyrpides N.C. Woese C.R. Ouzounis C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 425-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have named the four stretches KOW1 to 4, respectively (see Fig.1 A). In this report, we have characterized the structure and function of DSIF p160. We show that p160 is a nuclear protein that forms a stable complex with p14 and interacts with the pol II largest subunit. In addition, we map the regions of p160 that are involved in interactions with p14 and pol II and those that are essential for DSIF activity. Finally, we isolate a p160 mutant that acts in a dominant-negative manner and use this mutant to present evidence that DSIF is a negative regulator of transcription in vivo. For expression of recombinant proteins, the following plasmids were constructed in the expression vector pET-14b (Novagen) by subcloning from parent vectors described elsewhere (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H.

For expression of p160ΔKOW1 and ΔKOW2, which lack aa 421–447 and aa 473–499 of p160, respectively, a polymerase chain reaction-based overlap extension technique was employed (21Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Forward and reverse mutagenic primers encompassing the deletion points were used and the amplified fragments cloned into pET-14b, generating pET-p160ΔKOW1 and pET-p160ΔKOW2. For expression of GST-p14, a fragment of pBS-DSIFp14 was subcloned into pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate pGEX-p14. To construct pCMV-FLAGp160 and pCMV-FLAGp160ΔNusG, fragments of pBS-FLAGp160 and pBS-FLAGp160ΔNusG were inserted into pCAGGS (22Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). To construct pCMV-HAp14, p14 full-length cDNA was inserted into pCHA, a pCAGGS derivative that contains a sequence encoding HA epitope YPYDVPDYA. Histidine-tagged p160 and p14 were expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) transformed with pET-DSIFp160 or pET-DSIFp14 (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation and filtration, and r-p160 and r-p14 were purified from the supernatants by Ni-affinity column chromatography according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Novagen). To further purify the recombinant proteins, the purified fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the full-length proteins were recovered from a gel slice. The proteins were then precipitated with acetone, denatured with 6 m guanidine-HCl, and renatured by dialysis against 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol as described (23Wada T. Watanabe H. Usuda Y. Handa H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 557-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare in vitro translated p160 and its derivatives, either pBS-p160, pBS-p160Nterm, or pBS-p160Cterm was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, some of which cleave the p160 open reading frame to produce the C-terminally truncated products. The linearized plasmids were then transcribed with either T7 or T3 RNA polymerase, followed by translation using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. pCMV-FLAGp160 (10 μg) and pCMV-HAp14 (10 μg) were transfected into 2 × 106HeLa cells either individually or in combination. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were lysed in 500 μl of high salt buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) and cleared by centrifugation. The lysates were incubated with 2 μg of anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C and then with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with high salt buffer, the immunoprecipitates were eluted with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. Flag-p160 and HA-p14 were probed with anti-Flag and anti-HA (12CA5) monoclonal antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively, and were visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Either GST or GST-p14 protein (5 μg) was coupled to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Reactions were initiated by adding 2.5 μl of NTP mix (final 60 μm ATP, 600 μm CTP, 5 μm UTP, 80 μm 3′-O-methyl-GTP, and 50 units of RNase T1) and 2.5 μl of buffer or DRB (final 50 μm). After a 10-min incubation, reactions were terminated and the G-free transcripts analyzed by 8% urea-PAGE. In Fig. 7, reactions containing HeLa nuclear extract (4 μl) and p160ΔNusG mutant (0–200 ng) were incubated for the indicated times, and processed as above.Figure 7Identification of a p160 mutant that represses DSIF activity in a dominant-negative manner in vitro.

A total of 10 μg of DNA (5 μg of reporter plasmid, various amounts of pCMV-FLAGp160ΔNusG, and the empty vector pCAGGS) were transfected by a standard calcium phosphate method (24$$Google Scholar) into 3 × 105 cells plated on 6-cm dishes 20 h before transfection. DNA-CaPO4co-precipitates were removed 6 h later. The cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and their luciferase activities were measured. The values were normalized by protein amount and expressed as -fold activation. In our previous study, we reported the isolation of a cDNA encoding the 160-kDa subunit of DSIF (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of p160 are shown in Fig. 1 A. There was no ATG sequence upstream of the putative translation initiation site, and the adjacent sequence fitted the Kozak consensus sequence (25Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar) although there was no upstream stop codon in frame. To confirm its identity, the entire cDNA was transcribed and translated in vitro, and the size of the 35S-labeled product was compared with that of p160 purified from HeLa nuclear extract and 32P-labeled by phosphorylation with casein kinase II (Fig. 1 B). The phosphorylation did not change the migration of p160 (data not shown). From the indistinguishable migration of the two bands, we concluded that the cDNA encodes full-length p160. Two groups have reported nucleotide sequences of SUPT5H, a human homolog of S. cerevisiae SPT5 (26Chiang P.W. Fogel E. Jackson C.L. Lieuallen K. Lennon G. Qu X. Wang S.Q. Kurnit D.M. Genomics. 1996; 38: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Stachora A.A. Shafer R.E. Pohlmeier M. Maier G. Postingl H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The p160 cDNA that we have cloned is almost identical to these sequences. However, the deduced amino acid sequences which we and Stachoraet al. (27Stachora A.A. Shafer R.E. Pohlmeier M. Maier G. Postingl H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) report are different from that reported by Chiang et al. (26Chiang P.W. Fogel E. Jackson C.L. Lieuallen K. Lennon G. Qu X. Wang S.Q. Kurnit D.M. Genomics. 1996; 38: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) over two large portions, probably because of sequencing errors. Northern blot analysis of p160 using mRNA from several different human tissues detected a ubiquitously expressed band of ∼3.6 kilobases, a length consistent with the isolated cDNA (Fig.2 A). Because p160 possesses putative nuclear localization signals (Fig. 1 A), we analyzed the subcellular localization of p160. Mammalian vectors expressing Flag-tagged p160 (Flag-p160) and HA-tagged p14 (HA-p14) were transfected into HeLa cells, and their expression was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. p14/Supt4h is localized in the nucleus (13Hartzog G.A. Basrai M.A. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Hieter P. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2848-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 2Y. Yamaguchi and H. Handa, unpublished data. As shown in Fig.2 B, Flag-p160 was also exclusively localized in the nucleus, regardless of co-expression of HA-p14. These results agree with the postulated role of p160 as a general transcription elongation factor. Spt5 genetically and physically interacts with Spt4 in yeast (16Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 28Swanson M.S. Winston F. Genetics. 1992; 132: 325-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, p160 was co-fractionated with p14 through several different columns during purification of DSIF (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that p160 associates with p14. To test this, we expressed Flag-p160 and HA-p14 in HeLa cells either individually or in combination, and immunoprecipitated them with anti-Flag antibody. As shown in Fig.3 A, HA-p14 was co-precipitated with Flag-p160 (lane 8), demonstrating their interactionin vivo. The interaction was verified in vitro. GST-p14 affinity column or a control GST column was incubated with in vitrotranslated and 35S-labeled p160 under various conditions. After extensive washing with the same buffer, bound p160 was eluted and analyzed. About 50% of p160 bound to the GST-p14 column, whereas no binding to the control column was detected (Fig. 3 B,lanes 2 and 3). The interaction was unaffected by the presence of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 1 m KCl (lane 6). Because p14 contains a putative zinc finger motif conserved among different species (13Hartzog G.A. Basrai M.A. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Hieter P. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2848-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of divalent cations (lane 4) and a high concentration of a chelating agent (lane 5). Even under these conditions, p160 efficiently bound to p14, suggesting that the zinc finger is not required for the interaction. We next mapped the region of p160 involved in p14-binding. Various forms of 35S-labeled p160 were produced in vitro, and their interactions with GST-p14 were analyzed (Fig.3 C). The C-terminal half of p160 was dispensable for the interaction (lanes 8 and 9), and fine mapping of the N terminus identified a minimal region of aa 176–313 sufficient for p14-binding (lane 30). Because aa 1–270 of p160 also bound to p14 equally well (lane 28), the minimal domain is aa 176–270. We next sought to identify regions important for DSIF activity. We constructed a series of p160 mutants lacking various structural motifs (see “Materials and Methods”). These mutants were expressed in E. coli and purified, and the integrity of the recombinant proteins was verified by either silver staining (Fig.4 A) or immunoblotting with an antibody raised against the extreme C terminus of p160 (data not shown). Equal amounts (30 ng) of these mutants were assayed for DRB sensitivity-inducing activity (Fig. 4 B). This protein amount corresponds to the “low dose” of our previous report (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Wild type r-p160, in conjunction with r-p14, converted DRB-insensitive transcription to a process sensitive to DRB (lanes 1–4), as reported previously (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Δrepeat similarly induced DRB-sensitivity (lanes 11 and 12). These proteins also moderately reduced the basal level of transcription, i.e. in the absence of DRB. In contrast, all other mutants had no effect (lanes 5–10 and 13–16). The slight variations seen in Δp14BD and ΔNusG were not reproducible. The acidic region, the p14-binding region, and the NusG-homology regions of p160, therefore, appear to be important for DSIF activity. p160/Spt5 physically interacts with pol II (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 16Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In addition, Spt5 genetically interacts with the two largest subunits of pol II in yeast (16Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to determine which subunit of pol II is involved in interaction with p160. Pol II purified from HeLa cell nuclear pellet was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, renatured, and probed with 35S-labeled p160. As shown in Fig. 5 A, a clear band of ∼200 kDa, which co-migrates with the largest subunit of pol II, was detected. p160 also reacted with GST-p14 protein which was similarly blotted onto the membrane. From these results, we conclude that p160 interacts with pol II through its largest subunit pol IIa. We next mapped the region of p160 involved in pol II binding. Various forms of p160 were synthesized in vitro, and incubated with purified pol II and anti-CTD antibody. The immunocomplexes were precipitated, and the presence of p160 was analyzed. As shown in Fig.5 B, the C-terminal deletion of p160 did not affect the interaction (lanes 1–8). One predicted role for the KOW motif is interaction with RNA polymerases (20Kyrpides N.C. Woese C.R. Ouzounis C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 425-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Fine mapping, however, revealed that aa 313–420 of p160, an N-terminal region in close proximity to the KOW motifs, is sufficient for pol II binding (lane 23). aa 420–757 of p160, which contains all four of the KOW motifs, also bound to pol II weakly (lane 24). Results of deletion analyses described above are summarized in Fig.6 Because DRB is a nonphysiological compound, it is important to address the role of DSIF in the absence of DRB. Functional analyses of DSIF to date have been limited to in vitro experiments, and there is no evidence regarding its role in vivo. As a first step, we sought to isolate a dominant-negative mutant of p160. We speculated that p160 mutants that complex with p14, but have no DSIF activity, would act in a dominant-negative manner. We employed one such mutant, ΔNusG, and tested its dominant-negative effect in vitro. Increasing amounts of the mutant protein were incubated with HeLa nuclear extract for 45 min, and then transcription reactions were carried out in the presence or absence of DRB (Fig.7 A). Addition of 200 ng of the mutant slightly reduced DRB-sensitivity of the nuclear extract (lanes 7 and 8). Furthermore, when the preincubation time was prolonged to 180 min, DRB sensitivity was markedly reduced (Fig. 7 B, lanes 11 and12). The nuclear extract used contains ∼30 ng of endogenous p160 protein (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Thus, 6- to 7-fold excess of the p160 mutant protein, and a 3-h incubation period, were sufficient to inactivate most of the endogenous DSIF. It is likely that during this period, endogenous wild type p160 is replaced by the mutant to form an inactive DSIF complex with p14. These results also suggest that the p160 mutant is inactive, not simply because of incorrect folding, but because a specific function of p160 encoded within the deleted region has been lost. Next, we used ΔNusG to analyze the effect of DSIF on transcription in vivo. Four different reporter plasmids were used in which expression of the luciferase gene is controlled by the adenovirus E4 promoter, the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (Fig.8 A, LTR), the rat somatostatin (som.) promoter, and the mouse metallothionein (metal.) promoter. These promoters possess a typical TATA box but no “initiator” consensus sequence and are subject to regulation by transactivators of different classes. The E4 promoter is activated by ATF and GABP (23Wada T. Watanabe H. Usuda Y. Handa H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 557-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sawa C. Goto M. Suzuki F. Watanabe H. Sawada J. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4954-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); the HIV-1 long terminal repeat is activated by NF-κB, Sp1, and Tat (30Jones K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar); the somatostatin promoter is stimulated by the c-AMP signaling pathway and CREB (31Montminy M. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar); and the metallothionein promoter is induced by heavy metal and MTF-1 (32Glanville N. Durnam D.M. Palmiter R.D. Nature. 1981; 292: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). One of these reporter plasmids (5 μg) was co-transfected with increasing amounts of a plasmid expressing ΔNusG into HeLa cells. The total amount of DNA added per transfection was adjusted to 10 μg with the empty vector pCAGGS. ΔNusG stimulated luciferase expression 5- to 10-fold in a dose-dependent manner, irrespective of the promoter used (Fig. 8 A). The same transfectants were examined for expression of the ΔNusG protein. Immunoblotting with anti-p160 antibody detected the band of ΔNusG just below the endogenous p160 (Fig. 8 B). Provided that the reporter and the effector plasmids were introduced and expressed in 30% of the total cells, as estimated by immunostaining (not shown), approximately 1-, 3-, and 10-fold excesses of the mutant protein were obtained (lanes 2–4). These levels are consistent with that at which the dominant-negative effect is observed in vitro (Fig. 7). Taken together, these results indicate that DSIF represses transcription from these promoters in vivo, and reduction of the endogenous DSIF activity leads to derepressed transcription. Results of deletion analyses are summarized in Fig. 6. Functions of p160 to interact with p14 and pol II were assigned to different domains between the acidic region and the KOW motifs. p160-p14 interaction was shown to be very stable, remaining unaffected by 1 m KCl or 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Fig.3 B). However, we could not find any protein-protein interaction motifs within the p14-binding domain. Because this region is relatively hydrophobic (Fig. 6, top), hydrophobic interactions may contribute to the stable interaction between p160 and p14. This interaction seems dispensable for p160-pol II interaction because p160 mutants lacking the p14-binding domain can still bind to pol II (Fig. 5). The C-terminal repeat sequences were dispensable for DSIF activityin vitro (Fig. 4). Analysis in yeast, however, has demonstrated that deletion of the C-terminal part of SPT5impairs complementation of Spt− phenotype (15Swanson M.S. Malone E.A. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3009-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the C-terminal repeats play some regulatory roles in vivo. Interestingly, this portion is very rich in Ser, Thr, and Tyr and has many phosphorylation sites for several protein kinases. Thus, DSIF activity may be regulated by phosphorylation in vivo (27Stachora A.A. Shafer R.E. Pohlmeier M. Maier G. Postingl H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the other hand, most of the N terminus was required for DSIF activity. Specifically, deletion of either the acidic region, the p14-binding domain, or one of the two N-terminal KOW motifs abolished p160 function. At present, however, we could not assign functions to the acidic region or the KOW motifs. These elements may be involved in interactions with unidentified partners. In this study, we demonstrated that DSIF acts as a negative regulator, at least on some promoters, in vivo. SPT4 and SPT5, yeast counterparts of the DSIF subunits, have been identified as extragenic suppressors of δ insertion mutations of HIS4 or LYS2 genes (14, 15, 33; reviewed in Ref. 34Winston F. Analysis of SPT genes: a genetic approach toward analysis of TFIID, histones and other transcription factors of yeast.in: McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 1271-1293Google Scholar). When the δ sequence is inserted in the upstream region of a gene, the transcription signal directs transcription from the δ promoter and interferes with normal transcription of the adjacent gene. Another mutation in SPT4or SPT5 gene suppresses the aberrant transcription, restoring transcription from the normal site. A possible interpretation of this result is that Spt4-Spt5 up-regulates transcription from the δ, and down-regulates transcription of the adjacent gene. We therefore do not discount the possibility that DSIF also functions as a positive regulator on some promoters that we have not tested. In Fig. 4, p160 wild-type and the Δ repeat mutant not only induced DRB sensitivity but moderately repressed transcription in the absence of DRB. In fact, both phenomena are often observed at the same time. We postulate that the DRB sensitivity-inducing activity (low doses) and the repression activity (high doses) described previously (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) are inseparable functions of DSIF, and both are related to P-TEFb. Recently, we found that DSIF and P-TEFb possess opposite functions and act antagonistically on pol II elongation. In the absence of P-TEFb activity, DSIF strongly represses transcription regardless of the presence or absence of DRB (35Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Watanabe D. Handa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7395-7403Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Thus, in our current model, DRB inhibits P-TEFb from alleviating the negative effect of DSIF (1Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Winston F. Chaleff D.T. Valent B. Fink G.R. Genetics. 1984; 107: 179-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement for DRB in the repression by DSIF may vary with the ratio of DSIF to P-TEFb. In yeast, overexpression of SPT5 using a 2μ plasmid leads to Spt−phenotype (15Swanson M.S. Malone E.A. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3009-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The expression level of Spt5 is presumably important for its function. Thus, data obtained from overexpression experiments might prove difficult to interpret. We did in fact perform experiments of that kind and could not observe any clear-cut effect of wild type p160.2 We therefore used a dominant-negative mutant of p160 to probe the in vivo function of DSIF in this study. It was estimated that the reporter expression was stimulated several-fold in parallel with the reduction of endogenous DSIF activity. This indicates that the endogenous DSIF generally represses transcription from the reporter gene; if the endogenous DSIF influenced only part, say 10%, of the transcription, the dominant-negative effect would not be observed. This is consistent with the idea that DSIF generally affects transcription of the class II genes, as expected from its involvement in DRB action. DSIF subunits are also implicated in other cellular processes such as chromatin structure, cell cycle, and HIV replication (27, 36; reviewed in Refs. 1Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and 36Wu-Baer F. Lane W.S. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 179-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The dominant-negative mutant of p160 isolated here would be a useful tool to examine possible DSIF involvement in these events. We thank Drs. M. Hagiwara, A. Shimomura, T. Nishigaki, J. Sawada, A.

https://openalex.org/W2162386982,"Although the cardiac homeobox geneCsx/Nkx-2.5 is essential for normal heart development, little is known about its regulatory mechanisms. In a search for the downstream target genes of Csx/Nkx-2.5, we found that the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) gene promoter was strongly transactivated by Csx/Nkx-2.5. Deletion and mutational analyses of the ANP promoter revealed that the Csx/Nkx-2.5-binding element (NKE2) located at −240 was required for high level transactivation by Csx/Nkx-2.5. We also found that Csx/Nkx-2.5 and GATA-4 displayed synergistic transcriptional activation of the ANP promoter, and in contrast to previous reports (Durocher, D., Charron, F., Warren, R., Schwartz, R. J., and Nemer, M. (1997) EMBO J. 16, 5687–5696; Lee, Y., Shioi, T., Kasahara, H., Jobe, S. M., Wiese, R. J., Markham, B., and Izumo, S (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol. 18, 3120–3129), this synergism was dependent on binding of Csx/Nkx-2.5 to NKE2, but not on GATA-4-DNA interactions. Although GATA-4 also potentiated the Csx/Nkx-2.5-induced transactivation of the artificial promoter that contains multimerized Csx/Nkx-2.5-binding sites, Csx/Nkx-2.5 reduced the GATA-4-induced transactivation of the GATA-4-dependent promoters. These findings indicate that the cooperative transcriptional regulation mediated by Csx/Nkx-2.5 and GATA-4 is promoter context-dependent and suggest that the complexcis-trans interactions may fine-tune gene expression in cardiac myocytes."

In brain, the expression of Kilon is already detected in E16 stage, and its level gradually increases during development. Kilon immunostaining was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, in which the strongly stained puncta were observed on dendrites and soma of pyramidal neurons. cell adhesion molecules Triton-insoluble low density fraction glycosylphosphatidylinositol phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C peptide N-glycosidase F glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis monoclonal antibody polymerase chain reaction kilobase pair 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)1 play central roles in the establishment and the remodeling of the central nervous system. CAMs are classified into Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent groups. Cadherins are dependent on Ca2+ ions for binding. The cytoplasmic domain of different cadherins is highly conserved, and proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic domain interact with cytoskeletal proteins and signal transduction pathways to regulate cell adhesion (1Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Integrins make up a large family of heterodimeric proteins that mediate cell to cell and cell to extracellular matrix-adhesive connections, and the intracellular domain interacts with the actin cytoskeleton through several intermediate proteins such as α-actinin, vinculin, talin, and tensin (2Fields R.D. Itoh K. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 3Hortsch M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The largest classes of Ca2+-independent CAMs are members of the Ig superfamily, which contains Thy-1 (Po), MAG, NCAM, L1, F3/F11/contactin, and others. These molecules have a number of Ig motifs and fibronectin-III repeats in their extracellular domain. The number of Ig and fibronectin repeats differ in the various members of the Ig superfamily, but generally they share a similar organization. For many of the molecules, multiple isoforms with distinct functional effects and expression patterns are known. The method of attachment to the cell membrane and the length of the cytoplasmic tail are important structural features with significant functional consequences, and these consequences are under extensive investigation (2Fields R.D.

Much attention has been paid to a membranous subdomain that is insoluble in the non-ionic detergent such as Triton X-100 and has a low density (Triton-insoluble low density fraction: TIF, also called “raft”, “DIGs” (detergent-insoluble, glycolipid-enriched complexes), or “DRMs” (detergent-resistant membrane domains), “Caveolae-like domains,” etc.), since this domain has so many signal-transducing molecules such as trimeric G proteins, protein tyrosine kinases, cytoskeletal proteins, and calmodulin-binding proteins (8Simons K.

The detergent insolubility of this fraction is attributed to the enrichment of cholesterol and sphingomyelin (15Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol.

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, which are extracellular proteins anchored in the lipid bilayer by GPI instead of membrane-spanning peptides, are localized in this region (8Simons K.

Some CAMs are known to be the GPI-anchored proteins, and little is known about their signal-transducing pathways. Since GPI-anchored proteins are enriched in TIF, this region could be a good clue to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction through the GPI-anchored cell adhesion molecules. At the first step, we analyzed the GPI-anchored proteins in the TIF from 2-week-old rat brain and identified F3/contactin, T-cadherin, and Thy-1 as major GPI-anchored proteins. In addition, a novel GPI-anchored protein was identified, and the result of cDNA cloning showed that this protein belongs to the IgLON family, which contains LAMP, OBCAM, neurotrimin, CEPU-1, GP55, and AvGP50 (21Pimenta A.F.

Gooley A.A. Jeffrey P.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We call this protein Kilon, for this protein is a kindred of IgLON. TIF was prepared as described previously with slight modification (13Maekawa S. Kumanogoh H. Funatsu N. Takei N. Inoue K. Endo Y. Hamada K. Sokawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1323: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out on ice or at 4 °C, unless otherwise mentioned. Frozen whole brains from 2-week-old rat were thawed, minced with scissors, and homogenized with a Teflon glass homogenizer in 1 volume (w/v) of TME solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) containing 2% Triton X-100. Protease inhibitors used were 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% aprotinin, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.01 mg/ml pepstatin. An aliquot of 2.4 m sucrose solution was added to this homogenate, and the final sucrose concentration was adjusted to be 0.8 m. The sample was then placed in the centrifuge tubes. TME solution was overlaid, and the sample was centrifuged for 6 h at 70,000 × gusing a swing rotor (Hitachi SW27–2). A membrane fraction was concentrated at the interface of TME solution, and the original sample solution was collected and recovered as a pellet after dilution with 5 volumes of TME solution containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. This fraction was then homogenized in 5 volumes of TME solution containing 1 mNaCl. After centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 ×g, the pellet fraction was recovered and suspended in 5 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% Nonidet-40, pH 9.5, and was kept for 1 h at 0 °C. After centrifugation for 1.5 h at 100,000 × g, the resulting pellet was recovered and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmEDTA, pH 7.4. TIF, thus obtained, was frozen at −80 °C until use. GPI-anchored proteins were solubilized from TIF with PI-PLC (Funakoshi, Japan). TIF (20 mg of protein, 1 mg/ml) was incubated with 0.125 units/ml PI-PLC for 12 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100 and the protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, each 0.01 mg/ml pepstatin and leupeptin). After the addition of 4 mNaCl solution to be 0.1 m, the sample was centrifuged for 3 h at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was recovered. The supernatant was then lyophilized after dialysis against 50 mm ammonium acetate solution. The fraction was then suspended in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.6, applied to a Extracti-Gel D column (0.7 × 5 cm) (Pierce). The flow-through fraction was then recovered as the PI-PLC supernatant. To remove theN-linked sugar chain, PNGF (Boehringer Mannheim) was used. The PI-PLC supernatant was incubated first for 30 min at 56 °C in the presence of 0.1% SDS and 2 mm NaN3. PNGF was then added at a ratio of 50 units/mg protein and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Samples were incubated for 60 min at 60 °C after the addition of Laemmli sample solution. SDS-PAGE was done using a 12.5–15% gradient polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were transferred to a sheet of PVDFSQ membrane (Millipore) using a buffer containing 10 mm CAPS and 10% methanol, pH 11. The membrane was stained with a solution containing 0.1% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid and destained with distilled water. For peptide sequencing, immobilized protein bands were cut, reduced with dithiothreitol, pyridyletylated with 4-vinylpyridine, and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Wako, Japan) for 12 h at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10% acetonitrile, pH 9.0. The peptide fragments were separated on a C18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography column. For N-terminal sequence, immobilized proteins were directly applied to the sequencer. N-terminal amino acid sequence or internal amino acid sequences were then obtained with an Applied Biosystems 476A protein sequencer. From the N-terminal peptide sequence (PEP-1, VDFPWAAVDNMLVRK), a sense PCR primer (N-1, gtNgattttccNtgggcNgcNgtNgaYaaYatgYt) was constructed. From one of the internal sequences (PEP-3, DYGNYTCVATNK), an antisense PCR primer (N-3, cttgttKgtNgccacacaKgtatagtt) was constructed (where Y = c + t, R = a + g, and K = g + t). Using 2-week-old rat brain cDNA library (Uni-Zap XR, Stratagene), PCR was carried out 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 74 °C for 1.5 min using 2.5 μm primers per reaction, and a band of 0.79 kb was specifically amplified. This product was blunted and subcloned into the SmaI-cutting site of pBluescript KSII+(Stratagene). The resulting plasmid (pKS+0.79) was transformed into E. coli JM109 and was amplified in a large scale. The pKS+0.79 was double-digested withApaI and HindIII, and the resulting 0.79-kb fragment was purified. Uni-Zap XR library (450,000 plaque-forming units) was screened using the 0.79-kb fragment labeled with a thermostable alkaline phosphatase as described by the AlkPhos Direct system for chemiluminescence protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and several cDNA clones were isolated. Nucleotide sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method on an Applied Biosystems 373A automated DNA sequencer using the Thermo Sequenase dye terminator cycle sequencing pre-mix kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To express Kilon in Escherichia coli JM 109, the fragment of this clone was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the expression of the GST fusion protein was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. After 3 h incubation, cells were collected, washed, and disrupted with a sonicator. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was recovered and applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column. The unbound proteins were washed with a solution of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, and the bound proteins were eluted with the above solution containing 10 mm glutathione. Proteins eluted from TIF with PI-PLC were digested with PNGF and used as the antigen. After PNGF treatment, proteins were passed through an Extracti-Gel column to remove detergents in the solution. After dialysis against 50 mm ammonium acetate, the sample was lyophilized. The sample was finally dissolved in PBS and frozen at −80 °C until use. Each 0.04 mg of protein was injected intraperitoneally after mixing with Freund's complete adjuvant. After four times immunizations with the adjuvant, one mouse received four successive intraperitoneal injections (once a day). Two days after the last injection, the spleen was dissected and used for cell fusion with myeloma cells. The fusion of cells and screening of the hybridomas were performed as described previously (27Maekawa S. Maekawa M. Hattori S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TIF and the PNGF fraction were used for screening. Two clones (89B3 and 89E4) were found to be specific for Kilon, and 89B3 was used for immunological studies. During this screening, two other monoclonal antibodies (87F2 and 84A3) reactive for the 36-kDa band were obtained. Using these mAbs, Uni-Zap cDNA library was screened, and one clone was obtained. DNA sequencing of this clone showed that this clone contains an insert for OBCAM. Rats (9 weeks old) were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (70 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 50 ml of heparinized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 200 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The brain was postfixed with the same fixative solution for 24 h at 4 °C. The brain blocks including the cerebral cortex and hippocampus were dissected, and coronal sections were cut using a vibratome (DTK-1000, DSK, Kyoto, Japan) at the thickness of 25 μm. Free-floating sections were first pretreated with 0.1% H2O2 in PBS for 20 min and then with 0.5% sodium borohydride in PBS for 10 min. They were preincubated with 5% normal horse serum in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for at least 24 h at 4 °C and then incubated with an mAb 89B3 (dilution 1: 3,000) in PBS/Triton X-100 containing 1% normal horse serum for 48 h at 4 °C. The sections were further incubated with biotin-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (dilution 1:200, Vector, CA) for 2 h and then incubated with a avidin and peroxidase ABC solution (dilution 1:200, elite ABC kit, Vector) for 2 h. The visualization of the peroxidase was performed with 0.02% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.005% hydrogen peroxide in 0.05m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% sulfate nickel. All specific immunoreactivity was absent when the primary antibody against Kilon was omitted in control experiments. Tissue extracts were prepared from 2-week-old rats as described previously (27Maekawa S. Maekawa M. Hattori S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE, Western blotting using ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and protein determination were performed as described (13Maekawa S. Kumanogoh H. Funatsu N. Takei N. Inoue K. Endo Y. Hamada K. Sokawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1323: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Anti-Thy-1 antibodies were obtained from Cedarlane and Sigma. GPI-anchored proteins are solubilized from the membrane fractions by PI-PLC. For example, using adult chick brains, F3/F11/contactin and T-cadherin, both of which are GPI-anchored proteins, were released from the detergent-insoluble membrane fractions by PI-PLC (28Stefanova I. Horejsi V. Ansotegui I.J. Knapp W. Stockinger H. Science. 1991; 254: 1016-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 29Olive S. Dubois C. Schachner M. Rougon G. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6937-6943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We also used the PI-PLC to solubilize GPI-anchored proteins from rat brain-derived TIF and recovered the supernatant (PI-PLC supernatant) after centrifugation (Fig.1). Three major broad protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 110–140, 44–65, and 25–27 kDa were observed after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). With Western blotting using anti-Thy-1 antibodies, the 25–27-kDa band was identified as Thy-1 (data not shown). Since highly glycosylated proteins are known to show a broad band on SDS-PAGE, we next deglycosylated the PI-PLC supernatant using peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGF). After PNGF treatment (PNGF fraction), the apparent molecular masses of major proteins changed to 110, 76, 37, and 36 kDa (Fig. 1). In order to identify these protein components, N-terminal peptide sequences of the 110-, 76-, 37-, and 36-kDa protein bands were obtained. The 110-kDa protein, of which the N-terminal peptide sequence was EFT, was estimated to be F3/contactin, for this sequence coincided with the reported N-terminal sequence of F3/contactin, the molecular mass of the deglycosylated band matched well with the calculated molecular mass of F3/contactin (32Hosoya H. Shimazaki K. Kobayashi S. Takahashi H. Shirasawa T. Takenawa T. Watanabe K. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 186: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Peles E. Nativ M. Campbell P.L. Sakurai T.

Cell. 1995; 82: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), and the presence of the protein in this biochemical fraction was shown by an immunological method (29Olive S. Dubois C. Schachner M. Rougon G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2307-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The 76-kDa protein, of which the peptide sequence was SIVVSPILIPENQR, was identified as T-cadherin, for this sequence was found in the deduced amino acid sequence of human T-cadherin (34Lee S.W. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 776-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 35Tanihara H. Sano K. Heimark R.L. St John T. Suzuki S. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The presence of T-cadherin in a Triton-insoluble fraction is also reported (30Ranscht B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Neuron. 1991; 7: 391-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 31Doyle D.D. Goings G.E. Upshaw-Earley J. Page E. Ranscht B. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6937-6943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The peptide sequence of the 37-kDa protein band was GDATFPKAMDXVT, and this sequence was found in the deduced sequences of OBCAM and neurotrimin (23Struyk A.F. Canoll P.D. Wolfgang M.J. Rosen C.L. D'Eustachio P. Salzer J.L. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2141-2156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lippman D.A. Lee N.M. Loh H.H. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of the 36-kDa protein band, VDFPWAAVDNMLVRK (PEP-1), however, did not correspond to any identified proteins. Two internal peptide sequences of the 36-kDa band, GDTAVLRCYLEDGASK (PEP-2) and DYGNYTCVATNK (PEP-3), were further obtained after the high performance liquid chromatography separation of the protease digests. The sequence of PEP-2 was not found in the identified proteins. The sequence of PEP-3, on the other hand, was found in the sequence of OBCAM fragment 283–294 (36Lippman D.A. Lee N.M. Loh H.H. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). From the N-terminal (PEP-1) and an internal amino acid sequence (PEP-3), two degenerative primers for PCR (N-1 and N-3) were designed and produced. A PCR experiment using a rat brain cDNA library resulted in the amplification of a single 0.79-kb band. Since the direct sequencing of this band showed no identity with known genes, this product was used as a probe to screen a full-length cDNA from the same cDNA library. After screening 450,000 clones, 20 positive clones were isolated. The clone having the longest insert was selected. The insert was subcloned into pBluescript KSII+, and its complete sequence was determined (Fig.2 A). The insert contained 1827 base pairs, including an open reading frame of 1044 base pairs coding for 348 amino acids. The nucleotide sequence at the deduced start methionine matches the consensus initiation (37Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). Sequences in the 0.79-kb PCR product was found in the insert. The deduced amino acid sequence contained two of the peptide sequences determined from the direct sequence analysis of the protein (PEP-1 and PEP-2 in Fig.2 A). PEP-3 sequence, a sequence used for the design of the PCR primer, was not found in the sequence. We found, however, that one of the sequence patterns of the degenerative primer (N-3) matches with the nucleotide sequence from 949 to 975 (a dashed line in Fig. 2 A). As described below, this region has a considerable homology within LAMP, OBCAM, neurotrimin, and Kilon. Since the sequence of Pep-3 is observed in the sequences of OBCAM, and OBCAM-specific monoclonal antibodies react with the 36-kDa protein band (data not shown), the 36-kDa band in SDS-PAGE was judged to be a mixture of Kilon and OBCAM. From the N-terminal sequence of the protein, the original N-terminal 31-amino acid sequence of Kilon is thought to be cleaved as a signal sequence (double underlined in Fig. 2 A) (38Heijne G.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). The presence of a hydrophobic core surrounded by two hydrophilic sequences in this region coincides well with the present concept of the signal peptide (Fig. 2, A and B). This hydropathy plot also showed the presence of another hydrophobic region at the C terminus. In case of GPI-anchored proteins, the addition of the GPI anchor is known to occur after the cleavage of the C-terminal hydrophobic region (40Cross G.A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 41Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 121-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Although a putative GPI anchor attachment site was found (Gly-318 in Fig. 2 A), there is no datum to assign the C-terminal amino acid of this protein at present. A homology search of the coding sequence of this protein with SWISS-PROT data bases showed that this protein is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily having three C2 domains and six putative glycosylated sites and has high similarities to rat LAMP (56%), rat OBCAM (49%), rat neurotrimin (48%), chick GP55A (51%), and chick CEPU-1 (49%) (TableI) (21Pimenta A.F.

Like the IgLON family members, this protein has three sets of cysteines that are likely to form intradomain disulfide linkages in each of its immunoglobulin-like domains (Fig. 2 C). A sequence comparison of these proteins is shown in Fig. 3. The regions of highest homology to most of these proteins occur in the conserved sequences surrounding the cysteines involved in the intradomain disulfide bonding (shown by dots). Since these proteins are recently classified into a subfamily of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgLONs, immunoglobulin superfamily containing LAMP, OBCAM, and neurotrimin), the name, Kilon (kindred ofLON) was coined for this novel protein.Table IHomology of Kilon to other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily moleculesLAMPOBCAMNeurotriminGP55ACEPU-1Kilon5649485149(330)(324)(335)(267)(339)LAMP56555754(322)(332)(270)(325)OBCAM778468(345)(277)(346)Neurotrimin7478(276)(345)GP55A70(287)A search of the Swissprot database with the full-length peptide sequence of this protein using the FASTA program revealed significant similarity to members of the IgLON family.

Open table in a new tab A search of the Swissprot database with the full-length peptide sequence of this protein using the FASTA program revealed significant similarity to members of the IgLON family. Values indicate percent identity; values in parentheses refer to the number of overlapping amino acids. For the further characterization of Kilon, monoclonal antibody production was attempted using the PNGF fraction as the antigen. One of the mAbs (89B3) reacted with the 36-kDa protein of the PNGF fraction (Fig.4 A) and also reacted specifically with the bacterially expressed GST-Kilon fusion protein (Fig. 4 B) but did not react with the bacterially expressed GST alone (data not shown). This antibody reacted with one broad band with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa in TIF and PI-PLC fractions (Fig. 4 A). Kilon was highly enriched in the TIF, for no detectable reaction was observed in the homogenate fraction compared with TIF under this reaction condition. The tissue distribution of this protein was examined, and high expression in brain was shown (Fig.5 A). No expression was detected in other tissues such as kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, and testis. Although a broad band of about 38 kDa also reacted weakly in the skeletal muscle extract, nothing is known about the nature of this protein at present. Within brain, expression of Kilon was observed in cerebrum, brain stem, and hippocampus, and much less expression was detected in cerebellum (Fig. 5 B). A developmental change of the expression of this protein in whole brain showed that this protein is already expressed in E16 stage, and its level gradually increases during development (Fig. 5 C). Immunocytochemical studies using the mAb (89B3) showed specific staining in the rat cerebral cortex (Fig.6, A and B) and hippocampus (Fig. 6, C and D). In the cerebral cortex, numerous puncta of Kilon immunoreactivity were visible in all regions and were most densely distributed in large neurons of layer V (Fig. 6 A). These strongly stained neurons were identified as pyramidal neurons, because of their soma location in layer V, large soma size, and extension of their apical dendrite to layer I. Both soma and dendrite of pyramidal neurons were lightly stained, whereas strongly stained puncta were found on pyramidal neurons (Fig.6 B). The punctate staining appeared to be seen more frequently on dendrites than on soma of the neurons. The pattern of Kilon immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was basically similar to that in the cerebral cortex (Fig. 6, C and D). The strongly stained puncta were observed on dendrites and soma of the pyramidal neurons. The same pattern of Kilon immunoreactivity was also observed in Purkinje cell dendrites and soma of the adult rat cerebellum (data not shown). A novel GPI-anchored protein that belongs to the Ig superfamily was detected in the Triton-insoluble low density fraction of rat brain, and its amino acid sequence was deduced from the cDNA cloning. This protein, Kilon, has three C2 domains and has a homology to the IgLON family. IgLON family is a recently recognized protein family named from its member proteins, LAMP, OBCAM, and neurotrimin, and also contains CEPU-1, GP-55, and AvGP50 (21Pimenta A.F. Zhukareva V. Barbe M.F.

Brain Res. 1997; 44: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). From the data of cDNA sequences, all these proteins without the N-terminal and C-terminal signal sequences have their calculated molecular masses of about 32 kDa. The molecular masses of the expressed form of these proteins obtained from SDS-PAGE are much larger and are different each other as follows: LAMP, 68 kDa; OBCAM, 58 and 51 kDa; neurotrimin, 65 kDa; and CEPU-1, 51 kDa. The expressed form of Kilon showed a molecular mass of 46 kDa, also much larger than the deduced value from the amino acid sequences. The difference between the molecular mass obtained from SDS-PAGE and the molecular mass deduced from cDNA sequencing is attributed to the post-translational modification of the protein. In this case, the nascent polypeptide chain receives the cleavage of the N-terminal signal sequence, the cleavage of the retention signal, the addition of GPI at the C-terminal, and the addition ofN-linked carbohydrate chains. The smaller molecular mass of this protein suggests the lower level of the glycosylation than other proteins. Since the 36-kDa protein band obtained after PNGF treatment contains at least two proteins (Kilon and OBCAM), and these proteins are very homologous, it is very important to obtain specific antibodies for immunological studies. Two independent groups reported that OBCAM in rat brain has a broad band of more than 50 kDa (46Hachisuka A. Yamazaki T. Sawada J. Terao T. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 28: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 47Wick M.J. Fan G. Loh H.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Our antibodies against OBCAM reacted with the 36-kDa band in the PNGF fraction and a broad band around 46 and 51 kDa in the rat brain fraction but did not react with bacterially expressed Kilon. In contrast, 89B3 antibody recognized a band of 46 kDa in the brain fraction, reacted with bacterially expressed Kilon, but did not react with bacterially expressed OBCAM. Since the expressed form of other IgLON family proteins are much larger than Kilon, we judged that the mAb (89B3) reacts with a Kilon-specific sequence, although we have not yet identified the sequence recognized by the antibody. The expression of Kilon was evident on the neuronal processes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus at adult rat brain. The distribution of Kilon on dendrites and soma of the pyramidal neurons is similar to that of LAMP (48Zacco A. Cooper V. Chantler P.D. Fisher-Hyland S. Horton H.L. Levitt P. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 73-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of LAMP as a cell recognition molecule is fairly well recognized through the works of Levitt and colleagues (21Pimenta A.F. Zhukareva V. Barbe M.F. Reinoso B.S. Grimley C. Henzel W. Fisher I. Levitt P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 287-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 49Zhukareva V. Levitt P. Development. 1995; 121: 1161-1172PubMed Google Scholar). They showed that native, immunoaffinity purified LAMP exhibits homophilic binding. They also showed that LAMP-transfected cells selectively facilitated neurite outgrowth of primary limbic neurons, and the administration of anti-LAMP in vivo resulted in the abnormal growth of the mossy fiber projection from developing granule neurons. Chick brain-derived GP-55 is known to block the neurite outgrowth of dorsal ganglion cells (50Clarke G.A. Moss D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3393-3402PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of GP55 reaches highest levels around post-hatched day 5, after which it reaches a plateau or may decrease a little (25Wilson D.J.A. Kim D.-S. Clarke G.A. Marshall-Clarke S. Moss D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 3129-3138PubMed Google Scholar). GP55 is highly expressed in the central nervous system, and no expression was observed in non-neural tissues. The expression of neurotrimin (65 kDa in SDS-PAGE) was recognized as early as E15, increasing through early postnatal ages and declining in the adult (23Struyk A.F. Canoll P.D. Wolfgang M.J. Rosen C.L. D'Eustachio P. Salzer J.L. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2141-2156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CEPU-1 is a 51-kDa glycoprotein strongly expressed on cerebellar Purkinje cells, and its expression on the cells coincides with the growth of the dendritic tree (24Spaltmann F. Brummendorf T. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1770-1779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, identification of another GPI-anchored protein, termed Neurin-1, involved in the neuron-glia interaction, was reported. Neurin-1 (68-kDa protein in SDS-PAGE) was found on the surface of the axon and growth cone, and its N-terminal sequences were reported to be TPEGVPG. This sequence is not found in other proteins (51Asou H. Ono K. Uemura I. Sugawa M. Uyemura K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 45: 571-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), although the cDNA cloning of this protein is not yet done. The spatial and temporal expression pattern of Kilon is fairly similar to some of these proteins, although a precise comparison is not done at present. Further biochemical and immunological characterization of these proteins will be useful in elucidating the molecular mechanism of the construction and remodeling of the nervous system. Since the GPI anchor proteins do not have the transmembrane or the intracellular domains, they may mediate their biological responses by interaction with other membrane receptors that are able to recruit and activate intracellular signaling molecules (52Rosen C.L. Lisanti M.P. Salzer J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the chick brain membrane fraction, association of c-Fyn and Giα protein in the activation of signaling pathways through Thy-1 and AvGP50 is shown (53Henke R.C. Seeto G.S. Jeffrey P.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 655-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the case of F3/contactin, receptor tyrosine phosphatase β and a novel transmembrane receptor (Caspr) were discovered as the interacting proteins and characterized (54Peles E. Nativ M. Lustig M.

Future studies on the characterization of interacting molecules with GPI-anchored proteins will elucidate the signal transduction pathways through the cell membrane."

We have previously shown that shrinkage induces tyrosine phosphorylation in CHO cells, predominantly in an 85-kDa band. To identify volume-sensitive kinases and their substrates, we investigated the effect of hypertonicity on members of the Src kinase family. Hyperosmolarity stimulated Fyn and inhibited Src. Fyn activation was also observed in nystatin-permeabilized cells, where shrinkage cannot induce intracellular alkalinization. In contrast, osmotic inhibition of Src was prevented by permeabilization or by inhibiting NHE-1. PP1, a selective Src family inhibitor, strongly reduced the hypertonicity-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. We identified one of the major targets of the osmotic stress-elicited phosphorylation as cortactin, an 85-kDa actin-binding protein and well known Src family substrate. Cortactin phosphorylation was triggered by shrinkage and not by changes in osmolarity or pHi and was abrogated by PP1. Hyperosmotic cortactin phosphorylation was reduced in Fyn-deficient fibroblasts but remained intact in Src-deficient fibroblasts. To address the potential role of the Src family in the osmotic regulation of NHEs, we used PP1. The drug affected neither the hyperosmotic stimulation of NHE-1 nor the inhibition of NHE-3. Thus, members of the Src family are volume-sensitive enzymes that may participate in the shrinkage-related reorganization of the cytoskeleton but are probably not responsible for the osmotic regulation of NHE.

Most cells are equipped with a variety of volume-sensitive membrane transporters (e.g. isoforms of the Na+/H+ exchanger, Na+/K+/Cl− cotransporter, K+ and Cl− channels) that can effectively restore normal cell size after a perturbation caused either by exposure to an aniso-osmotic environment or by metabolic changes (for reviews, see Refs. 1Haussinger D.

Moreover, the cellular hydration state is not only a subtly regulated parameter but is also an important regulatory signal (1Haussinger D. Biochem.

For example, hormones such as glucagon and insulin elicit volume changes which act as “second messengers” necessary for their cellular effects. Little is known about the volume-dependent signaling mechanisms and their relationship to the different effector systems such as the ion carriers or the cytoskeleton.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16670-16678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as well as that of Krump et al. on neutrophils (13Krump E. Nikitas K. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17303-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have shown that hypertonicity induces robust tyrosine phosphorylation in various protein bands. While the phosphorylation pattern differed in the two cell types studied, the trigger for the phosphorylation of most proteins was cell shrinkage and not an increase in osmolarity or in intracellular ion concentrations. In CHO cells, hypertonicity induced phosphorylation of proteins of ∼40, 85, and 110–130 kDa, with the most prominent response occurring in the ∼85-kDa band (p85). While the ∼40-kDa protein proved to be extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2, the identity of p85 and the other higher molecular weight proteins remains to be elucidated. Further, the kinase pathways responsible for these reactions are unknown. Some of the tonicity-sensitive proteins complexed with Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains, raising the possibility that the Src family of tyrosine kinases might be potential mediators of the osmotically induced phosphorylations. This notion is further strengthened by the finding that, in neutrophils, hypertonicity altered the activity of Fgr, Hck, and Lyn (13Krump E. Nikitas K. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17303-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), members of the Src family expressed specifically in cells of hematopoietic origin. Furthermore, pharmacological data fostered the concept that the hypertonicity-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation might be causally connected to the osmotic regulation of Na+/H+ exchange. Specifically, the effect of hypertonicity on two osmotically sensitive, but oppositely regulated, isoforms of the Na+/H+ exchanger (15Kapus A. Grinstein S. Wasan S. Kandasamy R. Orlowski J. J. Biol.

Nikitas K. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17303-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), whereas the hyperosmotic inhibition of NHE-3 (in kidney cells) was prevented by genistein and herbimycin (20Good D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9883-9889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, Krumpet al. (13Krump E. Nikitas K. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17303-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) suggested that the hypertonic activation of NHE-1 in neutrophils may be due to the stimulation of certain Src kinases. To date, no information has been available about the osmotic responsiveness of the two most widely expressed, ubiquitous Src family members, p60src and p59fyn. In addition, none of the major osmosensitive phosphoproteins has been identified. The aim of this study was to gain further insight into the mechanisms of volume-dependent signaling by investigating the potential role of the Src family in the hypertonicity-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and the subsequent changes in ion transport. Specifically, we intended to investigate whether Src and Fyn can be regulated by a decrease in cell volume and whether any of the major phosphoproteins can be identified as a Src family substrate. We also wished to discern whether the Src family may play an essential role in the osmotic regulation of NHE-1 or NHE-3. Our results show that members of the Src family are regulated by cell shrinkage, and one of the major targets for volume-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation is the Src family substrate, actin cross-linking protein, cortactin. On the other hand, the osmotic regulation of NHE-1 and -3 does not appear to be mediated by Src-like kinases.

Bicarbonate-free RPMI 1640 was buffered with 25 mm Hepes to pH 7.4 (osmolarity 290 ± 5 mosm). The Iso-Na medium consisted of 140 mmNaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). When required, Iso-Na was made hypertonic (Hyper-Na, 600 mosm) by the addition of 300 mm sucrose. The Iso- and Hyper-K media had the same composition, except NaCl was replaced by KCl.

To permeabilize the cells, this medium was supplemented with 400 units/ml nystatin and 60 mm sucrose. Sucrose was included to counterbalance the intracellular colloidosmotic pressure and thereby prevent swelling of the permeabilized cells, as reported earlier by us (12Szászi K. Buday L. Kapus A. J.

The osmolarity of the isotonic solutions was adjusted to 290 ± 5 mosm with the major salt. Osmolarity was checked with an Osmette osmometer. For most studies, we used a CHO cell line (AP-1) devoid of the endogenous NHE and stably transfected with the rat NHE-1 (referred to as NHE-1 cells) or NHE-3 (referred to as NHE-3 cells), as described previously (15Kapus A.

Human neutrophils were prepared from healthy volunteers as described previously (22Suszták K. Mocsai A. Ligeti E. Kapus A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) except that lysis of red blood cells was carried out using NH4Cl. Prior to use, cells (106/ml) were kept in Hepes-buffered RPMI medium at 37 °C. Confluent cultures were incubated for at least 3 h in serum- and HCO3−-free RPMI 1640 prior to experiments. Cells were preincubated in Iso-Na medium for 10 min and then subjected to various treatments as indicated. The medium was then aspirated, and the cells were vigorously scraped into ice-cold Triton-containing or modified radioimmune precipitation buffers, supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4 and 20 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture. The Triton lysis buffer contained 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm Hepes, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5, and the radioimmune precipitation buffer was composed of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm NaF, 2 mmTris-EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.4. Lysates containing equivalent amount of protein were either mixed with an equal amount of 2× Laemmli buffer (whole cell lysates) or were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min and further processed for immunoprecipitation. Extracts were precleared for 1 h using 40 μl of 50% suspension of Protein G-Sepharose beads and then incubated with the corresponding antibodies (see details in the figure legends to Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) for 1 h. Immunocomplexes were captured using 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose, and the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were diluted with Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II apparatus. To check the effectiveness of transfer and similarity of protein amount, lanes were visualized by staining with Ponceau S. Blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with the primary antibody. The binding of the antibody was visualized by peroxidase-coupled secondary anti-mouse or rabbit antibody (1:3000 dilution) using the enhanced chemiluminescence method.Figure 5Hypertonicity activates p59fyn. Cells were treated with iso- or hypertonic solutions for 10 min or for the indicated times and lysed. Fyn was immunoprecipitated from the extracts with a monoclonal antibody, and its activity was determined essentially as described for Src under Fig. 4. A, the Cdc2 peptide was used as substrate (n = 4, reflecting the Fyn activity of cell lysates containing 270 μg of protein), whereas in B, C, and E, enolase was applied (for B andE, n = 5). D, Fyn immunoprecipitates obtained from iso- and hypertonic samples were subjected to electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine (top). The same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-Fyn (bottom). E, cells were permeabilized as detailed in the legend to Fig. 4 and were treated either with the permeabilization buffer ensuring isovolemia (I) or with this buffer supplemented with 300 mmextra sucrose, inducing shrinkage (S). After 10 min, cells were lysed and processed for the Fyn activity determination.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4The involvement of NHE-1-mediated intracellular alkalinization in the inhibition of Src kinase. A, NHE-1 cells were pretreated with Iso-Na for 10 min, and (where indicated) the medium was supplemented with 15 μmof the NHE inhibitor HOE 694 for the last minute of the preincubation. Subsequently, the medium was exchanged to Iso- or Hyper-Na, with or without the drug, and after 2.5 min the cells were lysed with Triton buffer. In vitro kinase assays and the quantification of enolase phosphorylation (n = 3) were carried out as in Fig. 3. B, after a 10-min pretreatment with Iso-Na, the medium was replaced with Iso-Na without any ionophore (Control) or with Iso-Na supplemented with either 10 μg/ml monensin (Alkalinization (mon)) or 10 μg/ml nigericin (Acidification (nig)). The cells were lysed after 2.5 min, and the lysates were processed for the Src assay (n = 3). C, after a short pretreatment in Iso-Na, cells were briefly washed with the permeabilization medium and then were permeabilized under isovolemic conditions using the same solution supplemented with 400 units/ml nystatin and 60 mm sucrose. After 7 min, the medium was aspirated and replaced either by the same medium (Isovolemic) or by the permeabilization buffer containing an extra 300 mm sucrose (Shrunken). 10 min later, the cells were lysed, and the samples were processed for the immunocomplex Src kinase assays (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3The effect of hyperosmolarity on the activity of p60src kinase. NHE-1 cells were treated with isotonic solutions or challenged with hypertonicity for 10 min (A and B) or for the indicated times (C). Thereafter, cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation (A) or Triton buffer (B andC) and subjected to immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal anti-Src antibody. Immunocomplex kinase assays were performed using [γ-32P]ATP and either a peptide fragment of Cdc2 (A) or enolase (B and C) as substrate (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The peptide was separated by phosphocellulose filters, and the incorporated activity was measured by scintillation counting (n = 4, reflecting the Src activity of cell lysates containing 120 μg of protein). When enolase was used, the samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by radiography, and phosphorylation was quantified by a PhosphorImager. No radioactive bands were detected if the primary antibody or enolase was omitted from the reaction (not shown). Data are expressed as percentage change, compared with the isotonic activity (100%). Where error bars are indicated, the results are mean ± S.E. for 3–6 independent determinations. The amount of Src in the immunoprecipitates (B) and Triton X-100-insoluble (Tx) fractions (D) obtained from iso- and hypertonically treated cells were determined by immunoblotting with anti-Src. In four repeated experiments, no significant difference was observed between the iso- and hypertonic samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 2Cell shrinkage induces tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. A and B, after preincubation of cells expressing NHE-1 (A) or NHE-3 (B) for 10 min in Iso-Na, the medium was changed for either Iso-Na or Hyper-Na (HYP) for 10 min. Where indicated, 10 μm PP1 was present throughout the experiment (HYP + PP1). Cells were then lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and cortactin was immunoprecipitated from extracts containing equal amounts of protein (280 μg) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitated molecules were separated, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine. To test the effectiveness of the immunoprecipitation, the same blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-cortactin. C, NHE-1 cells were preincubated in Iso-Na, and then the medium was changed to either Iso-Na or Iso-NMG or Iso-NMG supplemented with 400 units/ml nystatin, as indicated. After 10 min, cells were lysed, and cortactin was precipitated and analyzed as above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Quantification of the bands was performed using a Bio-Rad GS-690 imaging densitometer, and evaluation of data was carried out with the Molecular Analyst computer program (12Szászi K. Buday L. Kapus A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16670-16678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The activity of Src and Fyn was determined by immunocomplex kinase assays (23Yamaji Y. Tsuganezawa H. Moe O.V. Alpern J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C886-C893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cheng H. Nishio H. Hatase O. Ralph S. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9248-9256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates obtained from iso- or hypertonically treated cells and containing equal amounts of protein (280–500 μg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation (see above), and the precipitates were washed with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, 10 mmMnCl2, 0.25 mm Na3VO4,pH 7.1). Kinase activity was measured as the phosphorylation of either the Src family-specific substrate peptide Cdc2-(6–20) or enolase. In the former case, the Upstate Biotechnology Src kinase assay kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the immunocomplexes were incubated with 20 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 125 mm MgCl225 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm Na3VO4, 2 mmdithiothreitol), 10 μl of substrate peptide (0.6 mm stock in H2O), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of manganese/ATP mixture (0.5 mm ATP, 75 mm MnCl2 in reaction buffer) containing 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP/sample. After 10 min at 30 °C, 20 μl of trichloroacetic acid was added, and 25 μl of the mixture was layered on P81 phosphocellulose squares. After extensive washing with 0.85% phosphoric acid, radioactivity bound to the filters was determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding of radioactivity to the filters was determined in each experiment by measuring the activity of samples to which 10 μl of H2O was added instead of the peptide. The low activity measured in these samples was subtracted as background. Experiments were repeated at least three times, and the results were normalized to the amount of protein content of the initial cell lysate. When enolase was used, the immunocomplexes were incubated with 8 μl of kinase buffer, 12 μl of acid-denatured enolase (1.75 μg of enolase/sample), and 10 μl of ATP mixture (kinase buffer supplemented with 3 μm K-ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/sample). After 5 or 10 min at 30 °C for Src and Fyn, respectively, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 4× Laemmli buffer, and the samples were boiled and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried and used for direct quantification of radioactivity with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software. The gels were also subjected to radiography with an intensifying screen. Each experiment was performed at least three times, and each time duplicates or triplicates were measured. Results are expressed as -fold increase compared with the controls. pHiwas measured fluorometrically using the indicator dye BCECF, essentially as described (15Kapus A. Grinstein S. Wasan S. Kandasamy R. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23544-23552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent cultures of NHE-1 or NHE-3 cells grown on glass coverslips were loaded with 1 μmBCECF/acetoxymethylester for 10 min in Iso-Na medium. Ratio fluorometry was performed on small populations of cells (6–12 cells/measurement) using an illumination system from Photon Technologies, Inc., in the dual excitation (495 ± 10 nm/445 ± 10 nm) single emission (530 ± 30 nm) configuration. Excitation light was reflected to the cell by a 510-nm dichroic mirror, and emitted light was selected by a 520-nm longpass filter. Cells were visualized with a Nikon Diaphot TMD microscope and a Hoffman modulation contrast video system through a CCD video camera connected to a Panasonic monitor. Dye-loaded NHE-1 cells were preincubated with or without PP1, and then each coverslip was mounted to form the bottom of a thermostatted, perfusable Leydig chamber into which 0.5 ml of the same medium was added, and the basal fluorescence was recorded. The medium was then rapidly exchanged (by the addition of 10 × 0.5 ml in less than 15 s) to a hypertonic medium with or without the drug. To follow the osmotic effects on NHE-3 cells, these cells were first acidified by the ammonium prepulse technique. After 10 min of dye loading, in the presence or absence of PP1, cells were washed and then incubated in Iso- or Hyper-Na medium, supplemented with 20 mmNH4Cl, and supplemented, where indicated, with PP1 again. Thereafter, cells were washed with Iso- or Hyper-K medium and placed under the microscope in the same medium. Recovery of pHi was initiated with Iso- or Hyper-Na, again in the absence or presence of the Src inhibitor. After each measurement, fluorescence was calibrated in terms of pHi by sequential perfusion of the chamber using nigericin-containing Iso-K medium (or for hypertonic samples Iso-K supplemented with 150 mm extra KCl), at various pH values between 6 and 8 with 0.5 pH unit increments. Analysis of the data was carried out using Felix® software. In neutrophils, pHi was monitored in cell suspension (0.5 × 106/ml) using a Beckman fluorimeter (22Suszták K. Mocsai A. Ligeti E. Kapus A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Data are presented as representative immunoblots of at least three similar experiments or as mean ± S.E. of the number of experiments indicated (n). To assess whether Src kinases might play a role in the hypertonicity-induced tyrosine phosphorylation observed in CHO cells, we used PP1, a newly developed, selective pyrazolo pyrimidine-type inhibitor of this enzyme family (25Hanke J.H.

Draber P. Draberova L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1881-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows that osmotic shock evoked strong tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, the predominant response occurring in 80–85- and 110–130-kDa bands, as reported earlier by us (12Szászi K. Buday L. Kapus A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16670-16678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). PP1 caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the hypertonicity-triggered tyrosine phosphorylation in most bands. Half-maximal inhibition of p85 phosphorylation was obtained at ∼2 μm, whereas 10 μm completely abolished phosphotyrosine accumulation in this band (Fig. 1 B). This concentration dependence corr"

The MDMX-S protein can be detected in cell extracts and when overexpressed is much more effective than MDMX at inhibiting p53-mediated transcriptional activation and induction of apoptosis. Since MDMX-S lacks the central and carboxyl-terminal regions contained within full-length MDMX, it is likely to play a key role in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis in a way distinct from MDMX.

Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). The activity of p53 is in turn modulated through the action of the MDM2 protein which is amplified in a variety of tumors (4Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 5Momand J. Zambetti G.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Piette J. Neel H. Marechal V. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). MDM2 can associate with p53 (7Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2115-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and directly inhibit p53's ability to activate transcription of target genes, such as p21. MDM2 performs this function in a number of ways. First, the amino-terminal domain MDM2 binds tightly to the transcriptional transactivation domain of p53 (4Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 5Momand J. Zambetti G.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Piette J. Neel H.

Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 744-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Through this interaction, MDM2 blocks the ability of p53 to activate transcription of specific target genes by repressing the formation of the preinitiation complex mediated through the TFIIE and TATA-binding protein subunits of RNA polymerase II (10Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar, 11Thut C.J. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1974-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The second blocking activity of MDM2 is that it targets p53 for proteolytic degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (12Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 13Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar, 14Lane D.P.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Third, MDM2 also functions to shuttle p53 out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, via a nuclear export signal located within the MDM2 protein (33Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). While MDM2 was first identified as a protein that inhibits the action of p53 it has recently been shown to affect other components of the G1/S transition. MDM2 was found to associate with both the E2F1 transcription factor (15Xiao Z.X. Chen J. Levine A.J. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (pRb)1 (16Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S. La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1995; 375: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The interaction with pRb was found to be repressive, in that the association of MDM2 with the carboxyl-terminal domain of pRb inhibited the growth regulatory function of pRb (16Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S. La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1995; 375: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The interaction with E2F1, over the amino terminus of MDM2 and the carboxyl terminus of E2F1, was stimulatory in the sense that MDM2 enhanced the ability of E2F1 to activate target gene expression (15Xiao Z.X. Chen J. Levine A.J. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Thus MDM2 appears to regulate at least three of the important players in the G1/S transition: p53, pRb, and E2F1. It has therefore been concluded that MDM2 functions in the fashion of a dominantly acting oncogene, driving cells through the G1/S phase transition, by inhibiting p53 and pRb while helping to enhance the activity of E2F1. Recently a protein related to MDM2, termed MDMX, has been cloned and partially characterized (17Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. Van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. Van Ham R.C.A. Van Oordt W.V.D.H. Hateboer G. Van Der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 18Shvarts A. Bazuine M. Dekker P. Ramos Y.F.M. Steegenga W.T. Merckx G. Van Ham R.C.A. Van Oordt W.V.D.H. Van Der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Genomics. 1997; 43: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The region of highest homology between MDM2 and MDMX is within the p53-binding domain at the amino terminus of MDMX. Additionally, a zinc finger domain within the central portion of MDMX and a ring finger domain at the carboxyl terminus are conserved between MDMX and MDM2 (17Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. Van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. Van Ham R.C.A. Van Oordt W.V.D.H. Hateboer G. Van Der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 18Shvarts A. Bazuine M. Dekker P. Ramos Y.F.M. Steegenga W.T. Merckx G. Van Ham R.C.A. Van Oordt W.V.D.H. Van Der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Genomics. 1997; 43: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 198-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that MDMX associates with p53 and suppresses its activity (17Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. Van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. Van Ham R.C.A. Van Oordt W.V.D.H. Hateboer G. Van Der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). While MDMX appears very similar to MDM2, it nonetheless has a number of features that are distinct. For example, MDMX is not induced by DNA damaging agents that are known to induce MDM2 (17Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. Van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. Van Ham R.C.A. Van Oordt W.V.D.H. Hateboer G. Van Der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). This indicates that the MDMX promoter is likely not transcriptionally transactivated by p53. This is distinct from MDM2 which is transactivated by p53 (20Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 21Barak Y. Gottlieb E. Juven-Gershon T. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Also, MDM2 null mice (both alleles inactivated) are embryonic lethals (22Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 23de Oca Luna R.M. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar), in a wild-type p53 background. This indicates that if MDMX is expressed, it cannot functionally substitute for the absence of MDM2 with regard to control of p53 activity. However, it should be noted that it has not yet been demonstrated that MDMX is expressed early in development. Thus, MDMX likely functions in ways that are separate from MDM2. Yet the nature of MDMX's role in control of cell proliferation is largely unknown at this time. To gain insight into the role of MDMX in control of cell cycle, we have explored its regulation. We find that the MDMX gene is expressed as different transcripts. One transcript has a small internal deletion that leads to the introduction of a stop codon following amino acid residue 127. This novel transcript encodes only the p53-binding domain of MDMX and the protein produced is referred to here as MDMX-S. MDMX-S is better able to suppress p53-mediated transcriptional transactivation and induction of apoptosis, relative to full-length MDMX. MDMX-S expression may therefore play an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum or fetal calf serum. All transfection experiments were initiated on 50% confluent monolayer cultures as described by Ausubel et al. (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, 1987Google Scholar). Plasmids (a total of 30 μg) were transfected by the calcium phosphate procedure (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, 1987Google Scholar). The cells were glycerol shocked 5–6 h after DNA addition. The MDMX and MDMX-S cDNA constructs were cloned into Bluescript KS just 3′ to a FLAG epitope tag sequence. The epitope tag was linked in-frame to the reading frame of MDMX and MDMX-S. For expression studies the tagged MDMX and MDMX-S genes were excised from the Bluescript plasmid and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRC/CMV (Invitrogen). The wild-type p53 cDNA was cloned into and expressed from the pcDNA3 expression plasmid (Invitrogen). The target of p53 was the pRGCΔFosLacZ reporter construct containing multiple p53 consensus DNA-binding sites cloned upstream of the basal Fos promoter (30Frebourg T. Barbier N. Kassel J. Ng Y.S. Romero P. Friend S.H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6976-6978PubMed Google Scholar). As a control, the pΔFosLacZ reporter used is identical to pRGCΔFosLacZ, but lacks the p53 consensus sequences (30Frebourg T. Barbier N. Kassel J. Ng Y.S. Romero P. Friend S.H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6976-6978PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the DNA polymerase α promoter and the dihydrofolate reductase promoter linked to the CAT gene (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) were used in the co-transfection studies. Extracts were generated by multiple freeze-thaw cycles approximately 24 h after the glycerol shock. Equal amounts of protein from the soluble extracts were assayed either for CAT activity by thin layer chromatography and autoradiography or for β-galactosidase activity by a color reaction (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, 1987Google Scholar). All transfections were performed multiple times. A plasmid containing the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-long terminal repeat driving expression of the β-galactosidase gene (RSV β-gal) was included in all transfections of the CAT constructs so that the CAT activity could be normalized for differences in transfection efficiency. Additionally, a plasmid containing the SV40 early promoter linked to CAT was included in all transfections of the β-galactosidase constructs so that the β-gal activity could be normalized for differences in transfection efficiency. Apoptosis was measured by transfecting cells with the p53 expression plasmid, with or without the MDMX/MDMX-S expression plasmids, as is outlined below. Included on all transfections was the RSV-LacZ reporter plasmid. At 72 h post-transfection the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and the β-galactosidase positive cells were identified using the Beta-Gal Staining Kit from Boehringer Mannheim (the cells stain blue). The percent of apoptotic cells within the blue staining population were determined as those with a significantly rounded morphology and with membrane blebs clearly visible (as in Refs.34Yang X.

Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 614-619Google Scholar). Extracts for immunoblots were generated by lysing the cells on ice in 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 10 mmMgCl2, 15 mm NaCl, and the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), and leupeptin (1 μg/ml). The soluble fraction was termed the cytosol. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 ×g for 10 min and resuspended in extraction buffer consisting of 0.42 m NaCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), and leupeptin (1 μg/ml) for 10 min on ice, then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 8 min to pellet the residual nuclear material. This supernatant fraction was termed nuclear extract (25Moberg K.H. Logan T.J. Tyndall W.A. Hall D.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 411-421PubMed Google Scholar). To generate GST fusion proteins, the MDMX and MDMX-S cDNAs were cloned into pGEX-5T (Pharmacia) in-frame with the glutathioneS-transferase gene (GST). Fusion proteins were produced as described by Jordan et al. (27Jordan K.L. Haas A.R. Logan R.J. Hall D.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1177-1185PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the genes were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, bacteria were lysed, and protein was separated from cellular debris by centrifugation. Using the bacterial extracts, affinity columns on glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) containing the various fusion proteins were then generated. Total RNA was isolated from cells by the Triazol method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)+-enriched RNA was isolated from 400 μg of confluent NIH3T3 fibroblast total RNA. 1 μg of poly(A)+RNA was used in the initial RT-PCR reaction. Oligo(dT) was used as the primer in the reverse transcription reaction which was followed by a PCR reaction with primers that flank the start and stop codons from the published sequence of murine MDMX. For the RT-PCR reactions, 1 μg of total RNA from the various cell lines was used in each reaction with primers from the murine sequence (the 5′ primer, gccctctctatgacatgc (spanning amino acid residues 96–102) and the 3′ primer, gtcgtgaggtaggcag (spanning amino acid residues 158–163)) and human sequence (the 5′ primer, gccctctctatgatatgc, and the 3′ primer, gctctgaggtaggcag) (17Shvarts A.

Jochemsen A.G. Genomics. 1997; 43: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The primers for the human sequence represent the same positions as those used for the murine sequence. These primers flank the site of deletion in MDMX. All total RNAs were DNase I treated in the RT reaction prior to the PCR reactions. Additionally, as a control, PCR done in the absence of RT was negative for any ethidium bromide-stained bands (data not shown). In vitrotranscription reactions were performed with Bluescript KS plasmids containing the MDMX and MDMX-S cDNAs. The plasmid constructs were used directly in the TnT-coupled in vitrotranscription/translation system of Promega, using the nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate, in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. [35S]Methionine at 0.9 mCi/ml was also included in the reactions. Extracts were first electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and then the proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose, the blots were washed in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin in TBST for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated with either the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (10 ng/ml, VWR/Kodak/IBI) or polyclonal antiserum generated against MDMX-S (1:5,000 dilution). The blots were washed three times (10 min each) with TBST then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a 1:7500 dilution of secondary antibody in TBST (goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, Vector Labs). The blots were then stained using the Protoblot system from Promega. For indirect immunofluorescence, Calu cells were plated on 10-cm tissue culture dishes containing glass coverslips. The cells were transfected with the MDMX or MDMX-S expression plasmids (or the vector control) and 24 h post-transfection the plates were washed once in PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min followed by an additional rinse in PBS. To permeabilize the cells, the coverslips were treated with PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min followed by three 5-min washes in PBS plus 0.2% gelatin, as described by Harlow and Lane (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The M2 monoclonal antibody was diluted in PBS plus 0.2% gelatin. 50 μl of diluted antibody was added to a 6-cm culture dish, coverslips containing the fixed and permeabilized cells were placed cell side down on the drop of diluted antibody and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C (26Logan T.J. Jordan K.L. Hall D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The coverslips were washed three times in PBS plus 0.2% gelatin. Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) was diluted to 30 μg/ml in PBS plus 0.2% gelatin. Again 50 μl of diluted antibody were placed in a dish, the coverslips placed cell side down and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were washed in PBS plus 0.2% gelatin (10 min), PBS plus 0.2% gelatin plus 0.05% Tween 20 (10 min), and finally in PBS (10 min). The nuclei were then stained with the DNA dye 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The coverslips were rinsed three times in PBS, once in deionized water, and then they were dried, mounted, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. The MDM2 oncoprotein is a known binding partner of a number of cellular factors, namely p53, pRb, and E2F1. In our efforts to study the regulation of these key regulatory factors, we initiated work on the recently identified MDM2-related protein, termed MDMX. To begin studies on MDMX we isolated its cDNA clone by RT-PCR, using primers that flank the start and stop codons of the published open reading frame of the murine sequence. We used 1 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA from confluent nontransformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts in the reaction. It was first reversed transcribed to make cDNA, then used in the polymerase chain reaction with the primers that flank the start and stop codons. The RT-PCR products are shown in Fig. 1. It is apparent from the figure that two bands are produced in the reaction that are very close in size to each other (the expected size is 1450 base pairs). The entire reaction product was then cloned into Bluescript KS+ and a number of individual isolates were sequenced. While many of the clones produced the expected published sequence (17Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. Van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. Van Ham R.C.A. Van Oordt W.V.D.H. Hateboer G. Van Der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) a substantial fraction had an internal deletion of 68 base pairs. This deleted sequence results in a change in the reading frame of the protein because it introduces a new translation stop codon just after the sequence encoding the p53-binding domain. The deleted sequence is shown in Fig.2 A and the complete reading frame of this sequence is shown in Fig. 2 B. The first 114 amino acid residues are identical to the published sequence and represent the p53-binding domain (residues 1–100) (17Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. Van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. Van Ham R.C.A. Van Oordt W.V.D.H. Hateboer G. Van Der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The change in reading frame results in an insertion of 13 new amino acids followed by a stop codon (Fig. 2, A and B). Fig.2 C shows a comparison of full-length MDMX (489 residues) and the shortened form that we have termed MDMX-S (127 residues). It is clear that MDMX-S lacks the central and carboxyl-terminal domains containing the zinc finger and ring fingers, respectively (17Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. Van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. Van Ham R.C.A. Van Oordt W.V.D.H. Hateboer G. Van Der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar).Figure 2The open reading frame of MDMX-S reveals a shortened protein. A, the sequence within MDMX that is deleted in MDMX-S. The brackets define the boundaries of the DNA sequence in MDMX (top line) that is deleted in MDMX-S (bottom line). B, amino acid sequence of MDMX-S. The predicted p53-binding domain that aligns with that of MDM2 is represented by residues 1–107. The sequence underlined and in bold is unique to MDMX-S. C, linear alignment of MDMX and MDMX-S protein sequences. The positions of the p53-binding domain, the zinc finger, the ring finger, the putative nuclear localization sequences (NLS) are outlined in MDMX.D, an RT-PCR reaction was performed on 0.2 and 1.0 μg of cDNA generated from poly(A)+ selected mRNA from confluent NIH3T3 fibroblasts using primers that flank the site of the deletion in MDMX-S. The products of the reaction were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. The positions of MDMX (201 base pairs), MDMX-S (133 base pairs), and the markers are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the extent of expression of this new form of MDMX-S, PCR primers were generated that flank the deleted sequence and PCR was performed on the original NIH3T3 cDNA pool made from poly(A)+ mRNA from confluent cells. With these primers, a PCR product corresponding to MDMX would be 201 base pairs in length while a product corresponding to MDMX-S would be 133 base pairs. As seen in Fig. 2 D, two bands of 133 and 201 base pairs are seen in the polyacrylamide gel from the products of the PCR reaction, indicating that both MDMX and MDMX-S are expressed as transcripts in these cells. To ensure that these two bands represent bona fide MDMX and MDMX-S sequences, the bands were excised from the gel, directly cloned via TA Cloning (Invitrogen) into the pCR2.1 plasmid vector, and sequenced. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the 201-base pair band exactly matches the original MDMX sequence while the 133-base pair band exactly matches the MDMX-S sequence containing the internal deletion. It was next important to determine the extent of expression of MDMX and MDMX-S in other cell lines. Total RNA was isolated from nontransformed C3H10T1/2 murine embryonic fibroblasts that were growing, confluent or serum starved for 48 h to arrest in G0/G1phase of the cell cycle. Total RNA was isolated from the transformed murine lines psi2 (retrovirally transformed), F9 (teratocarcinoma), and SP2/0 (myloma/hybridoma). Total RNA was also isolated from nontransformed low passage rat vascular smooth muscle cells (A10 cell line) that were serum starved or starved and serum stimulated for 8 h. RT-PCR was performed on 1 μg of the total RNA using the primers that flank the site of the deletion. As shown in Fig.3, A and B, MDMX-S is expressed as a detectable transcript in all cell lines. In all cell lines, the levels of MDMX remain somewhat constant. However, in serum-starved cells, expression of MDMX-S is barely detectable while in growing cells, and especially those that are transformed, MDMX-S is easily detectable. Further quantitative methods will be needed to determine if MDMX-S expression is actually up-regulated in transformed cells and down-regulated in serum-starved primary cells. It was of interest to determine if the expression pattern of MDMX-S in human cells mirrors that seen in rodent cells. Using the DNA sequence of human MDMX (18Shvarts A. Bazuine M. Dekker P. Ramos Y.F.M. Steegenga W.T. Merckx G. Van Ham R.C.A. Van Oordt W.V.D.H. Van Der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Genomics. 1997; 43: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), primers were generated that would flank the deletion in MDMX-S. These primers were then used in an RT-PCR reaction with 1 μg of total RNA from the following human/primate cell lines: COS (SV40 T antigen transformed monkey), HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), U87Mg (human glioblastoma), 293 (adenovirus transformed human kidney), Calu-6 (human lung carcinoma), and MCF-7 (human breast cancer). Also, RNA was isolated from nontransformed 4th passage human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) that were either serum starved or growing. This is shown in Fig. 4. For comparison, an RT-PCR reaction was also performed on RNA from growing and confluent NIH3T3 fibroblasts and growing C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts, using the mouse specific primers, and the products were run on the same gel. MDMX-S is expressed as a detectable transcript in the RNA from each cell line. In serum-starved skin fibroblasts, MDMX-S transcripts are not easily detectable. However, in growing cells, and those that are transformed, MDMX-S is easily detectable. Further quantitative methods will be needed to determine if MDMX-S is up-regulated in transformed cells and down-regulated in low passage cells. In HeLa cells and MCF7 cells, MDMX-S appears low relative to MDMX. Further experiments will be needed to determine the basis of this difference. To determine if endogenous MDMX and MDMX-S protein expression could be detected in cell extracts, rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against a GST fusion with MDMX-S. These antibodies should recognize both MDMX and MDMX-S. Two separately generated antisera were used in immunoblots with 50 μg of nuclear and cytosolic extract from COS cells. COS cell extracts were used because they appeared to express high levels of the MDMX-S transcript (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 5 A, antisera from one rabbit recognizes predominantly MDMX-S present in only the nuclear extract. Its size of 27 kDa is substantially higher than its predicted molecular mass of 15 kDa, suggesting that the protein undergoes some modification. The other antisera strongly recognizes MDMX, as shown in Fig. 5 B, and weakly recognizes MDMX-S. Thus, both MDMX and MDMX-S appear to be expressed as detectable gene products in COS cells. To begin functional studies of MDMX-S, the FLAG epitope tag was cloned at the 5′ end of the MDMX-S gene (at the amino terminus of the protein). This tagged MDMX-S gene was then transcribed and translated in vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, with [35S]methionine/cysteine. The products of the reaction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the gel immunoblotted,"
https://openalex.org/W2047623534,"Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is a recently identified serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates and activates Akt and p70S6K, two downstream kinases of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. To further study the potential role of PDK1, we have screened a mouse liver cDNA library and identified a cDNA encoding the enzyme. The predicted mouse PDK1 (mPDK1) protein contained 559 amino acids and a COOH-terminal pleckstrin homology domain. A 7-kilobase mPDK1 mRNA was broadly expressed in mouse tissues and in embryonic cells. In the testis, a high level expression of a tissue-specific 2-kilobase transcript was also detected. Anti-mPDK1 antibody recognized multiple proteins in mouse tissues with molecular masses ranging from 60 to 180 kDa. mPDK1 phosphorylated the conserved threonine residue (Thr402) in the activation loop of protein kinase C-ζ and activated the enzyme in vitro and in cells. Our findings suggest that there may be different isoforms of mPDK1 and that the protein is an upstream kinase that activates divergent pathways downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1981165354,"Previous reports of Na/Ca exchanger gene 1 (NCX1) expression have revealed a major RNA transcript of 7 kilobase pairs (kb), minor transcripts of ∼13 and ∼4 kb, and a relatively abundant 1.8-kb RNA band.

The circular transcript contained the normal NCX1 start codon, a new stop codon introduced as a consequence of circularization, and encoded a protein corresponding to the NH2-terminal portion of NCX1, terminating just after amino acid 600 in the cytoplasmic loop. A linear version of the circular transcript was prepared and transfected into HEK-293 cells. A protein, matching the predicted size of ∼70 kDa, was expressed, and the transfected cells possessed Na/Ca exchange activity. Although in native tissue we could not detect a protein corresponding exactly to that predicted from the circular transcript, a prominent band of slightly shorter size, possibly representing further proteolytic processing of circular transcript protein, was observed in membranes from LLC-MK2 cells and rat kidney.

Molecular studies of the Na/Ca exchanger have revealed that NCX1 is the predominant Na/Ca exchanger gene and is expressed in almost every tissue but at a particularly high level in heart, brain, and kidney (2Philipson K.D.

Studies on the organization of the human NCX1 gene have revealed that it comprises at least 14 exons spread out over more than 200 kb of genomic DNA (3Scheller T. Kraev A. Skinner S. Carafoli E. J.

Genomics. 1996; 37: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Several reports have also identified two regions of alternative splicing in NCX1 transcripts from various tissues and animal species. The first site of alternative splicing is in the 5′-untranslated region of the NCX1 message and involves exons referred to as 1a (or 1-Br), 1b, 1c (or 1-Kc), 1d (or 1-Ht), and 1e (3Scheller T.

Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H217-H232PubMed Google Scholar). The use of tissue-specific promoters and splicing patterns involving these exons gives rise to at least three different transcripts, each with a unique exon 1 sequence at the 5′-end (3Scheller T.

Studies in rat using an RNase protection assay have demonstrated that heart expresses primarily NCX1 transcripts possessing exon 1-Ht, kidney expresses transcripts with exon 1-Kc, whereas NCX1 transcripts expressed elsewhere contain primarily exon 1-Br (5Nicholas S.B. Yang W. Lee S.L. Zhu H. Philipson K.D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H217-H232PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that this pattern of splicing may allow independent and selective regulation of NCX1 expression in different tissues. The second region of alternative splicing encodes a stretch of amino acids near the carboxyl terminus of the central intracellular loop of the NCX1 protein. At this site, six different exons (exons 3–8) are arranged in tissue-specific patterns (6Lee S.-L. Yu A.S.L. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14849-14852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Quednau B.D. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1250-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kofuji P.

Heart expresses NCX1 transcripts containing exons 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8, brain expresses transcripts with exons 3, 6, and sometimes 8, and most other tissues express transcripts possessing exons 4 and 6 (and sometimes also 8). The functional consequences of this structural heterogeneity are still uncertain (11Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lying between these two sites of alternative splicing is an unusually long exon 2 sequence (1,832 bp coding for 600 amino acids in human NCX1). Exon 2 encodes the amino-terminal half of the NCX1 protein, including the initiating methionine, the first set of hydrophobic transmembrane segments, and most of the central cytoplasmic regulatory loop. Further alternative splicing, leading to a range of deletions among the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane segments of NCX1, was proposed based on studies in which a 6-kb canine cardiac NCX1 cDNA was expressed in HEK-293 cells (13Gabellini N. Iwata T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6917-6924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

In addition to this major 7-kb transcript, less abundant transcripts of ∼13 and ∼ 4 kb and an abundant RNA band of 1.8 kb have also been reported (6Lee S.-L. Yu A.S.L. Lytton J. J. Biol.

In this report, we describe studies that demonstrate that the 1.8-kb mRNA corresponds to a circularized NCX1 exon 2 transcript encoding a truncated NCX1 protein. The distribution and possible functional role of this transcript are also investigated. All molecular procedures were performed essentially according to standard protocols (19$$Google Scholar, 20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or the directions of reagent manufacturers, unless indicated otherwise. Chemicals were of the highest quality analytical grade available and were obtained from either Fisher, BDH, or Sigma, unless indicated otherwise. Nucleic acid and protein amino acid sequence analysis was performed with the MacVector software package (Oxford Molecular Group) and by connection to the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the National Institutes of Health (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Total RNA preparations from whole tissues were isolated using the GITC-CsCl centrifugation method and from cultured cells using the GITC acid-phenol extraction protocol. Poly(A)+ mRNA preparations were isolated from total RNA by passage through an oligo(dT) column. To isolate nuclear RNA, nuclei were prepared by hypotonic detergent lysis from LLC-MK2 cells. In brief, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 5 × the packed cell volume of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 mm KCl), chilled on ice for 15 min, and then lysed by the addition of 0.6% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, followed by gentle mixing and three strokes in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted from this extract at 1,000 × gfor 3 min, and RNA was isolated using GITC acid-phenol extraction. Samples of RNA were separated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred into a nylon membrane by capillary diffusion overnight. The UV cross-linked membranes were hybridized with antisense digoxigenin UTP-labeled riboprobes according to the directions of the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim) as described previously (21Wu K.-D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C333-C341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Probe A was derived from the 5′-untranslated region exon 1-Kc (nucleotides −375 to −74) of the rat kidney F1 clone as described (6Lee S.-L. Yu A.S.L. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14849-14852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Probe B was prepared from nucleotides −23 to 2871 of the rat kidney F1 clone (spanning exons 2, 4, 6, and 9–12). Probe C was derived from nucleotides 2269 to 2720 of rat kidney NCX1 (spanning most of exon 11 and part of exon 12), prepared as described previously (17Yu A.S.L. Hebert S.C. Lee S.-L. Brenner B.M. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F680-F685PubMed Google Scholar). The schematic description of the inverse PCR (IPCR) protocol is illustrated in Fig.3 B. 5 μg of RNA from LLC-MK2 cells was reverse transcribed by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the gene-specific primer GSP1 (GTCTTGGTGGTCTCTCCATT, antisense, nucleotides 346–365; numbering is based on the published canine cardiac NCX1 (14Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), GenBank accession number M36119). The cDNA was converted to second strand essentially as described (21Wu K.-D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C333-C341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then purified, phosphorylated, and circularized by ligation in dilute solution. These circles were amplified using the primer pair IPCR-2 (ATGTCCTC[C,T]ATAGAAGTCATCAC, sense, nucleotides 289–311) and IPCR-3 (AGACCATGGCCAC[A,G]AAATACAC, antisense, nucleotides 229–250), which lie upstream from GSP1 and face away from one another. Amplified products were gel purified, subcloned, and sequenced with the Amplitaq FS kit from Perkin-Elmer. Fluorescently labeled sequencing reactions were analyzed at the University of Calgary Core DNA Service Facility. 2 μg of total RNA from LLC-MK2 cells was reverse transcribed using either GSP1 as described above or oligo(dT). The cDNA was then amplified using different pairs of primers based on the exon 2 region. The design of primers is shown in Fig.4 B. The first primer pair, C1 and C1′, face away from one another (C1, same as IPCR-1, above; C1′, GAGTGAGAGCATTGGCATCATG, sense, nucleotides 1638–1659). The second (C2 and C2′) and third (C3 and C3′) primer pairs face toward each other (C2, TTGCTGAGACAGAAATGGAAGGA, sense, nucleotides 92–114; C2′, TCCACAACACCAGGAGAGATGA, antisense, nucleotides 662–683; C3, CTGTCATCTCTCCTGGTGTTGT, sense, nucleotides 659–680; C3′, GAGCTCCAGATGTTCTCAATAC, antisense, nucleotides 1669–1690). The amplified products were gel purified, subcloned, and sequenced. To isolate the circular exon 2 transcript, we designed a 16-nucleotide, 5′-end biotin-labeled, antisense oligonucleotide (circular oligonucleotide: AGAACCTA ACAATTTC) which bridged the circularized 3′- and 5′-ends of exon 2 (8 nucleotides from each end). As a control, we also prepared a similar oligonucleotide (exon 1/2 oligonucleotide, AGAACCTA AGTTTTGA), which spanned the junction of the 3′-end of exon 1 and the 5′-end of exon 2 and was designed to isolate the full-length NCX1 transcript. Total RNA isolated from LLC-MK2 cells (30 μg) was hybridized with 1.5 μmbiotin-labeled circular oligonucleotide or exon 1/2 oligonucleotide and 10 μg of yeast tRNA for 5 min at 65 °C in 300 μl of binding buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), cooled slowly to room temperature, and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were then diluted to 2 ml with binding buffer and passed over an Immuno-Pure immobilized monomeric avidin column (Pierce). The procedure followed the instructions from the manufacturer except that phosphate-saline buffer was replaced by binding buffer. The biotin-oligonucleotide-hybridized RNA was eluted from the column in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) containing 2 mm biotin. 10 μg of yeast tRNA was added, and the sample was precipitated with cold ethanol. The precipitated samples were then analyzed by Northern blot with probe B to detect the isolated transcripts. The full-length NCX1 construct was prepared by amplifying oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcribed LLC-MK2 cell total RNA with a pair of primers containing BamHI restriction sites at their 5′-ends (Pr-1, CGCGGATCCAACATGCGGCGATTAAGTCTTTC, sense, nucleotides −3 to 20, and Pr-2, CGCGGATCCCCTTTAGAAGCCTTTTATGTGGC, antisense, nucleotides 2786–2808) using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system from Boehringer Mannheim. A linear version of the circular NCX1 exon 2 transcript was amplified from LLC-MK2 cell total RNA, reverse transcribed with GSP1 (described above), using a pair of primers (Pr-1, described above, and Pr-3, CGCGGATCCGTACACGACACTTCCAACTGT, antisense, nucleotides −24 through −6), which face away from each other. The amplified products were gel purified and cloned into theBamHI site in pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen, Inc.). The resulting constructs were confirmed by sequencing. There were three differences between the full-length and truncated proteins, presumably as a consequence of PCR errors: Glu (full-length) for Gly (truncated) at amino acid 39 (counting the initiator Met as 1); Val for Leu-219, and Ser for Phe-482. Transfection of cDNA expression constructs into HEK-293 cells was performed using a standard calcium-phosphate precipitation protocol with BES buffer essentially as described previously (22Tsoi M.

Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The circular construct cloned in the reverse orientation in the pcDNA3.1 vector was used as a control. Protein expression in crude microsome preparations was analyzed by immunoblotting with the C2C12 monoclonal antibody at 1:1,000 dilution. Calcium transport into transfected HEK cells was analyzed by Fura-2 fluorescent ratio digital imaging essentially as described previously (22Tsoi M. Rhee K.-H. Bungard D. Li X.-F. Lee S.-L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4155-4162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In brief, 2 days after transfection, cells grown on coverslips were loaded by incubation in 5 μm Fura-2/AM, 0.01% pluronic F-127, in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium buffered with 25 mm Tris-HEPES for 20–30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted in a temperature-controlled perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments), maintained at 37 °C, on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert135 microscope. The cells were perfused continually at 3 ml/min with solutions containing 10 mmTris-HEPES, pH 7.4, 11 mm glucose, 0.5 mmCaCl2, and 145 mm NaCl or LiCl. The 340 nm/380 nm excitation ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence was measured using the ImageMaster System from Photon Technology International. Crude microsome preparations and immunoblotting were performed essentially as described previously (24Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15024-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, fresh or frozen tissue from rabbit heart, rat heart, or kidney was homogenized with a Polytron in ice-cold sucrose buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim). LLC-MK2 cells were first swollen hypotonically on ice and then lysed with a Dounce homogenizer in buffer containing protease inhibitors. The cell homogenates were centrifuged, first at 8,000 × g for 20 min to remove nuclei, mitochondria, and debris and then at 100,000 × g for 60 min to pellet a crude fraction containing plasma membranes, endoplasmic reticulum, and other microsomes. These crude microsomal fractions were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by immunoblotting using SuperSignal Plus ECL reagents from Pierce. The monoclonal antibody C2C12 recognizes an epitope between amino acids 372 and 525 (26Porzig H. Li Z. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C748-C756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the central cytoplasmic loop of the exchanger. The monoclonal antibody 6H2, which was a generous gift from Robert Reilly, University of Colorado, recognizes an epitope within the first extracellular 40 amino acids of the mature exchanger protein. Several different groups have reported a relatively abundant NCX1 transcript of ∼1.8 kb in size (15Komuro I. Wenninger K.E. Philipson K.D. Izumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4769-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Kofuji P. Hadley R.W. Kieval R.S. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. Am. J.

Physiol. 1992; 262: F1105-F1109PubMed Google Scholar), although in previous studies we had not observed this species (6Lee S.-L. Yu A.S.L. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14849-14852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lytton J. Lee S.L. Lee W.S. van Baal J. Bindels R.J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. Silver J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Fig.1 shows that we were able to confirm the existence of the 1.8-kb transcript when Northern blots were analyzed with a probe spanning most of the NCX1 coding region (probe B). Indeed, we found that this transcript was present in every tissue and animal species tested. The abundance of the 1.8-kb band appeared to correlate roughly with the abundance of the major 7-kb full-length NCX1 transcript, although the precise ratio varied among animal species. A particularly high amount of 1.8-kb transcript was observed in RNA from monkey tissues and in LLC-MK2 cells, a cell line derived from monkey kidney. To characterize the nature of the 1.8-kb NCX1 transcript, we performed the experiments shown in Fig. 2. First, a Northern blot of total RNA from rat kidney was analyzed with three different probes: A (from exon 1-Kc), B (spanning most of the coding region, exons 2, 4, 6, and 9–12), and C (spanning most of exon 11 and part of exon 12). As seen in Fig. 2 A, the 1.8-kb NCX1 transcript was detected only with probe B, although 7- and ∼13-kb transcripts were clearly evident with all three probes. Next, total RNA isolated from LLC-MK2 cells was passed over an oligo(dT) column to isolate poly(A)+ mRNA. Northern blot analysis of the total RNA, poly (A)+ mRNA, and flow-through fractions revealed that the 1.8-kb NCX1 transcript was present quantitatively in the column flow-through, suggesting that it was not polyadenylated (see Fig. 2 B). Note that the poly(A)+ mRNA lane contained about six times the relative amount of material compared with the other lanes. A band of ∼4.5 kb in size was also visible in the poly(A)+mRNA, as described previously (6Lee S.-L. Yu A.S.L. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14849-14852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, cellular localization of the 1.8-kb transcript was examined. Total RNA was isolated either from a preparation of detergent-extracted LLC-MK2 cell nuclei or from an equivalent number of whole cells and analyzed by Northern blot. The majority of both 1.8- and 7-kb NCX1 transcripts were present in the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus (see Fig. 2 C). The coincidence of size and the pattern of hybridization with different probes led us to hypothesize that the 1.8-kb NCX1 transcript originated from the unusually long exon 2 sequence. We examined this issue further with a combination of IPCR and RT-PCR studies. Initially, we used the technique of IPCR to define the 5′-untranslated region of NCX1 transcripts expressed in the LLC-MK2 cell line. Following this procedure, as shown in lane 1 of Fig.3 A, two major product bands were detected: one of ∼500 bp and one of ∼1.8 kb. Subcloning and sequencing revealed that the 500-bp band extended back past the beginning of exon 2, ending in unique sequence that we presume to be the NCX1 exon 1 used in LLC-MK2 cells. The sequence of the 1.8-kb fragment also extended to the 5′-end of exon 2 but then continued directly with sequence from the 3′-end of exon 2 (based on the published exon boundaries (3Scheller T. Kraev A. Skinner S. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7643-7649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4Kraev A. Chumakov I. Carafoli E. Genomics. 1996; 37: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). It is noteworthy that the 5′-end of the human NCX1 cDNA reported by Komuro et al. (15Komuro I. Wenninger K.E. Philipson K.D. Izumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4769-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) has a structure virtually identical to the LLC-MK2 1.8-kb band, with sequence from the end of exon 2 appearing in the 5′-untranslated region upstream of position −33. Analysis of individual clones for both the 500-bp and 1.8-kb bands indicated that some clones were missing a TAG triplet at the 5′-end of exon 2. This difference may arise from the presence of two closely spaced splice acceptor sites at this location (3Scheller T. Kraev A. Skinner S. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7643-7649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4Kraev A. Chumakov I. Carafoli E. Genomics. 1996; 37: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and is consistent with our previous observation of splicing heterogeneity at the same location in the rat NCX1 gene (5Nicholas S.B. Yang W. Lee S.L. Zhu H. Philipson K.D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H217-H232PubMed Google Scholar). When reverse transcriptase was omitted from the protocol, no bands were detected, as shown in lane 3 of Fig. 3 A, indicating that the amplified products did not arise from genomic DNA contamination. Moreover, when the ligation step of the IPCR protocol was omitted, we still were able to detect the 1.8-kb band, but not the 500-bp product (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). These results suggested the possibility that the 1.8-kb fragment arose from a circularized exon 2 transcript, as illustrated in the schematic of Fig.3 B. To confirm the circular nature of the exon 2 transcript, we performed RT-PCR on LLC-MK2 cell RNA using either a gene-specific primer from exon 2 (GSP1) or oligo(dT) to prime the reverse transcription reaction. The cDNA products were then amplified with different pairs of primers from within exon 2, as shown in panel B of Fig.4. The first pair of primers (C1 and C1′) face away from one another and are therefore expected to amplify only a circular template. The other primer sets (C2 and C2′, C3 and C3′) face toward one another and will thus amplify both linear and circular templates. However, because both of these primer sets have at least one member downstream from the GSP1 reverse transcription priming site, products would only be expected from a linear template if it were primed with oligo(dT). As shown in Fig. 4 A, products were in fact seen from GSP1-primed cDNA for all three primer sets, whereas oligo(dT)-primed cDNA yielded bands only with the primer pairs designed for a linear template. Sequencing confirmed the identity of bands, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 4 B. The IPCR and RT-PCR experiments thus demonstrated the presence of a circularized NCX1 exon 2 transcript of 1.8 kb in length which was not polyadenylated. The 1.8-kb transcript observed on Northern blots was not polyadenylated and was only detected with a probe containing exon 2 sequence. To demonstrate directly that the 1.8-kb transcript corresponded to a circularized exon 2, we used oligonucleotide affinity chromatography. Biotinylated oligonucleotides spanning the junction between the ends of circular exon 2 (circular oligonucleotide) or the 3′-end of exon 1 and the 5′-end of exon 2 (exon 1/2 oligonucleotide) were hybridized with total RNA from LLC-MK2 cells. The hybridized samples were then passed over an avidin column, washed, eluted, and analyzed by Northern blot, as shown in Fig.5. It is evident from these data that hybridization with the circular oligonucleotide selectively enriched for the 1.8-kb transcript, whereas hybridization with the exon 1/2 oligonucleotide selectively enriched for the full-length 7-kb transcript. The circular NCX1 exon 2 transcript contained the normal NH2-terminal start codon for full-length NCX1 and a new stop codon introduced as a consequence of the circularization and thus encoded a protein of 602 amino acids (Fig.6). Constructs expressing the full-length LLC-MK2 cell NCX1, or a linear version of the circular exon 2 transcript encoding the truncated protein, were prepared by high fidelity PCR. The deduced amino acid sequence from these cDNAs is shown in Fig. 6. The full-length monkey kidney NCX1 molecule contained 934 amino acids and was greater than 99% identical to human cardiac NCX1 except in the region of alternative splicing, where human cardiac NCX1 contained exons 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (isoform NCX1.1; alternatively spliced exons previously referred to as A, C, D, E and F), whereas LLC-MK2 cell NCX1 contains only exons 4 and 6 (exons B and D, isoform NCX1.3). The truncated protein extends to amino acid 600 of full-length LLC-MK2 cell NCX1, plus two more amino acids (Arg and Phe). Both truncated and full-length constructs were transfected into HEK-293 cells. As seen in the left panelof Fig.7 A, immunoblots using"

In the present study, we investigated the transmembrane molecular architecture of the dystroglycan complex in Schwann cells. The cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan was co-localized with Dp116, the Schwann cell-specific isoform of dystrophin, in the abaxonal Schwann cell cytoplasm adjacent to the outer membrane. β-dystroglycan bound to Dp116 mainly via the 15 C-terminal amino acids of its cytoplasmic domain, but these amino acids were not solely responsible for the interaction of these two proteins. Interestingly, the β-dystroglycan-precipitating antibody precipitated only a small fraction of α-dystroglycan and did not precipitate laminin and Dp116 from the peripheral nerve extracts. Our results indicate 1) that Dp116 is a component of the submembranous cytoskeletal system that anchors the dystroglycan complex in Schwann cells, and 2) that the dystroglycan complex in Schwann cells is fragile compared with that in striated muscle cells.

This is further supported by the recent revelation that Mycobacterium leprae invades Schwann cells by binding to α-dystroglycan via laminin-2, to cause leprosy, a disease characterized by peripheral nerve degeneration (27Rambukkana A.

Science. 1998; 282: 2079-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).Despite these recent discoveries, there remain a number of questions to be answered concerning the molecular organization of the dystroglycan complex in Schwann cells. For instance, the submembranous cytoskeletal system that anchors the dystroglycan complex in Schwann cells remains elusive, because the full-length 427-kDa dystrophin is not expressed in peripheral nerve (29Byers T.M. Lidov H.G.W. Kunkel L.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 77-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In the present study, we asked whether dystrophin isoform Dp116 is a component of this system, for two reasons. First, Dp116 is a Schwann cell-specific isoform of dystrophin, composed mainly of the hinge 4, cysteine-rich, and C-terminal domains containing the β-dystroglycan binding site (5Jung D. Yang B.

Second, it was reported recently that peripheral myelination was disturbed in a peculiar Duchenne muscular dystrophy patient lacking Dp116 in peripheral nerve because of a unique mutation at the 5′ splice site of intron 69 of the dystrophin gene (31Comi G.P.

In this study, we also investigated the stability of the interaction of the components of the dystroglycan complex in Schwann cells and discussed its implications for the pathogenesis of muscle cell degeneration in sarcoglycanopathy.RESULTSTo determine the localization of Dp116 and β-dystroglycan in bovine peripheral nerve, we performed immunohistochemical and immunoelectron microscopic analyses using monoclonal antibodies DYS2 and 43DAG/8D5. We have reported previously that DYS2 detects Dp116 in peripheral nerve (9Matsumura K. Yamada H. Shimizu T. Campbell K.P.

Acta Neuropathol. 1994; 87: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The results of immunohistochemical analysis are shown in Fig. 2. Dp116 and the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan were both localized surrounding the outermost layer of myelin sheath of peripheral nerve fibers (Fig.2). The results of immunoelectron microscopic analysis are shown in Fig. 3. Dp116 and the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan were both localized in the abaxonal Schwann cell cytoplasm (Fig. 3). The distribution of these proteins was most prominent adjacent to the outer membrane (Fig. 3).Figure 3Immunoelectron microscopic analysis of β-dystroglycan and Dp116 in bovine peripheral nerve.β-Dystroglycan and Dp116 were detected with 43DAG/8D5 and DYS2, respectively.

The PVDF transfer of β-dystroglycan fusion proteins was overlaid with Dp116C-Ter (Fig. 4,a and c). Dp116C-Ter bound to βDGCyt1 corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan but not to βDGExt corresponding to the extracellular domain of β-dystroglycan or control GST (Fig. 4 c). As we have reported previously (10Yamada H. Shimizu T. Tanaka T. Campbell K.P. Matsumura K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Yamada H. Chiba A. Endo T.

To see whether the endogenous bovine peripheral nerve Dp116 binds to β-dystroglycan fusion proteins, the PVDF transfer of β-dystroglycan fusion proteins was overlaid with the alkaline extracts of crude bovine peripheral nerve membranes, and the Dp116, which bound to β-dystroglycan fusion proteins on the PVDF membranes, was detected with DYS2. The endogenous bovine peripheral nerve Dp116 bound to βDGCyt1 but not to βDGExt or control GST (Fig. 4 c). These results demonstrate that Dp116 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan.Figure 4Blot overlay analysis of the binding of Dp116 fusion protein or the endogenous bovine peripheral nerve Dp116 with domain-specific β-dystroglycan fusion proteins. a, preparations of Dp116 fusion protein Dp116C-Ter were separated by 3–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. CB andAnti-Dp116, SDS gel stained with Coomassie Blue and the PVDF transfer reacted with DYS2, respectively. The 110-kDa band that reacted with DYS2 strongly had the expected molecular size of the fusion protein, indicating that it is Dp116C-Ter. b, the crude bovine peripheral nerve membranes were extracted at pH 11 as described previously (10Yamada H.

Yang B. Meyer J. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27305-27310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We asked whether these amino acids were also responsible for the binding of Dp116. Surprisingly, βDGCyt2 corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan but lacking the 15 C-terminal amino acids bound both Dp116C-Ter and the endogenous bovine peripheral nerve Dp116, albeit with much lower binding affinity than βDGCyt1 (Fig. 4 c). The difference between βDGCyt1 and βDGCyt2 binding to the endogenous bovine peripheral nerve Dp116 appeared less marked than that to Dp116C-Ter (Fig. 4 c). It is possible that the native protein might have slightly altered binding properties from the fusion protein or that the binding properties of Dp116 might be modified in the presence of the Dp116-binding proteins other than β-dystroglycan in the peripheral nerve extracts (discussed below; also see Fig. 7).Figure 7Blot overlay analysis of the binding of Dp116 fusion protein with bovine peripheral nerve membrane proteins.

The extracts (Triton Extract) and pellets (Triton Pellet) were separated by 3–12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and overlaid with 25 μg/ml Dp116C-Ter.

As reported previously, the 43-kDa band (43βDG) corresponds to the full-length β-dystroglycan, whereas the 30-kDa band (30βDG) is presumed to correspond to the unglycosylated form or the proteolytic fragment of β-dystroglycan (11Yamada H.

The binding of Dp116C-Ter with βDGCyt1 was greatly reduced, but not completely abolished, by the peptide, whereas the binding with βDGCyt2 was not affected (Fig.5). In the presence of the peptide in the overlay medium, furthermore, Dp116C-Ter bound to βDGCyt1 and βDGCyt2 with similar affinity (Fig. 5). The results indicate that the 15 C-terminal amino acids of β-dystroglycan are involved in the high affinity binding of Dp116 but that they are not solely responsible for the interaction of β-dystroglycan with Dp116. It was suggested recently that the sequence of PPPY in the 15 C-terminal amino acids of β-dystroglycan might directly interact with the WW domain in hinge 4 of dystrophin (36Einbond A. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 37Yuasa K. Miyagoe Y. Yamamoto K. Nabeshima Y. Dickson G. Takeda S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, a synthetic peptide, PPPY, did not significantly affect the binding of Dp116C-Ter with βDGCyt1 (Fig. 5), suggesting that these amino acids may not be crucial for the binding.Figure 5Inhibition of the binding of Dp116 fusion protein with domain-specific β-dystroglycan fusion proteins by synthetic peptides. Domain-specific β-dystroglycan fusion proteins were separated by 3–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The PVDF transfers of βDGCyt1 and βDGCyt2 were overlaid with Dp116C-Ter in the presence (15 C-Ter Peptide (+)) or absence (15 C-Ter Peptide (−)) of 500,000 times molar excess of synthetic amino acids corresponding to the 15 C-terminal amino acids of β-dystroglycan.

To see whether this is true, we prepared fusion proteins corresponding to β-dystroglycan cytoplasmic domains lacking various lengths of C-terminal amino acids and tested whether they bind Dp116C-Ter. Dp116C-Ter bound to all of βDGCyt3, βDGCyt4, βDGCyt5, and βDGCyt6 (Fig. 6). In addition, the binding affinity of Dp116C-Ter with βDGCyt3, βDGCyt4, βDGCyt5, and βDGCyt6 was similar to that with βDGCyt2 and much weaker than that with βDGCyt1 (Fig. 6), suggesting that the 26 N-terminal amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan may also be involved in the binding of Dp116. To confirm this, we prepared the β-dystroglycan cytoplasmic domain fusion protein lacking the 26 N-terminal amino acids (βDGCyt7) or lacking both the 26 N-terminal and 15 C-terminal amino acids (βDGCyt8). The binding of Dp116C-Ter with βDGCyt7 was slightly weaker than that with βDGCyt1, and the binding with βDGCyt8 was not detectable (Fig. 6), indicating that the 26 N-terminal amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan are involved in the binding of Dp116.Figure 6Blot overlay analysis of the binding of Dp116 fusion protein with domain-specific β-dystroglycan fusion proteins. Domain-specific β-dystroglycan fusion proteins were separated by 3–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The PVDF transfers were overlaid with Dp116C-Ter.

The binding of Dp116C-Ter with βDGCyt1 and βDGCyt2 was not inhibited by EDTA, indicating that it is independent of divalent cations (results not shown). We have also observed that βDGCyt1 and βDGCyt2 in solution do not bind to Dp116C-Ter separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (results not shown). Together with the aforementioned results, this suggests that the β-dystroglycan binding site of Dp116 is vulnerable to denaturation with SDS, whereas the Dp116 binding site of β-dystroglycan is not.To identify the endogenous bovine peripheral nerve proteins that interact with Dp116, we prepared the PVDF transfers of crude bovine peripheral nerve membranes. When the PVDF transfer was reacted with 43DAG/8D5, 43- and 30-kDa bands were detected (Fig.7). As reported previously, the 43-kDa band corresponds to the full-length β-dystroglycan, whereas the 30-kDa band is presumed to correspond to the unglycosylated form or the proteolytic fragment of β-dystroglycan (11Yamada H. Chiba A. Endo T. Kobata A. Anderson L.V.B. Hori H. Fukuta-Ohi H. Kanazawa I. Campbell K.P. Shimizu T. Matsumura K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1518-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). When the identical PVDF transfer was overlaid with Dp116C-Ter, these 43- and 30-kDa bands bound Dp116C-Ter, in addition to the 60- and 35-kDa bands of undetermined origin (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the 43- and 30-kDa β-dystroglycan bands immunoprecipitated by 43DAG/8D5 bound Dp116C-Ter (Fig.8 a). These results demonstrate that Dp116 binds to the endogenous bovine peripheral nerve β-dystroglycan.Figure 8Immunoprecipitation of β-dystroglycan from crude bovine peripheral nerve membranes. a, the extracts of crude bovine peripheral nerve membranes were incubated with 43DAG/8D5. The resultant immune complex was precipitated with protein G-Sepharose, separated by 3–12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes (Anti-βDG Beads). Anti-βDG, Lam O/L, Anti-Dp116, and Dp116C-Ter O/L, PVDF transfer reacted with 43DAG/8D5, overlaid with laminin-1, reacted with DYS2, and overlaid with Dp116C-Ter, respectively; αDG,43βDG, and 30βDG, α-dystroglycan and the 43- and 30-kDa bands of β-dystroglycan, respectively.Arrows, bands of mouse IgG detected by anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. b, the extracts of crude bovine peripheral nerve membranes were incubated with or without 43DAG/8D5 (Anti-βDG Beads and Control Beads, respectively).

Both the 43- and 30-kDa bands of β-dystroglycan were precipitated completely by 43DAG/8D5 (Fig. 8,a and b). As expected, α-dystroglycan was also precipitated by 43DAG/8D5 (Fig. 8 a). However, the amount of α-dystroglycan remaining in the voids after precipitation was only slightly reduced compared with control (Fig. 8 b), indicating that only a small fraction, but not the vast majority, of α-dystroglycan was precipitated. To our surprise, laminin was not precipitated by 43DAG/8D5 (Fig. 8, a and b) (Note that the bands of laminin subunits are not detectable in the immunoprecipitates in Fig. 8 a, Lam O/L.) Dp116 was not precipitated either (Fig. 8, a and b), but this could be attributable to the fact that 43DAG/8D5 is directed against the 15 C-terminal amino acids of β-dystroglycan involved in the high affinity binding of Dp116 as described above. The results were identical using digitonin (Fig. 8) or Triton X-100 (results not shown) for extraction of peripheral nerve membranes.DISCUSSIONWhen combined together, the data presented here indicate that Dp116 is a component of the submembranous cytoskeletal system that anchors the dystroglycan complex in Schwann cells. We have found that the 15 C-terminal amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan are involved in the high affinity binding of Dp116 but that these amino acids are not solely responsible for the interaction of β-dystroglycan with Dp116. We have found that the 26 N-terminal amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan are also involved in the low affinity binding of Dp116. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the 26 N-terminal, as well as the 15 C-terminal, amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan are completely conserved among all the species investigated so far, human, cow, rabbit and mouse, suggesting that this sequence may have an important functi"
https://openalex.org/W2153860354,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a 21-amino acid peptide that binds to G-protein-coupled receptors to evoke biological responses. This report studies the effect of ET-1 on regulating glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. ET-1, but not angiotensin II, stimulated glucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 0.29 nM and a 2.47-fold stimulation at 100 nM. ET-1 stimulated glucose uptake in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells but had no effect in undifferentiated cells, although ET-1 stimulated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis to a similar degree in both. The 3T3-L1 cells expressed approximately 560,000 sites/cell of ETA receptor, which was not altered during differentiation. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining show that ET-1 stimulated the translocation of insulin-responsive aminopeptidase and GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. The effect of ET-1 on glucose uptake was blocked by A-216546, an antagonist selective for the ETA receptor. ET-1 treatment did not induce phosphorylation of insulin receptor beta-subunit, insulin receptor substrate-1, or Akt but stimulated the tyrosyl phosphorylation of a 75-kDa protein. Genistein (100 microM), an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, inhibited ET-1-stimulated glucose uptake. Our results show that ET-1 stimulates GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes via activation of ETA receptor."

The native enzyme was dimeric, being comprised of two identical subunits of approximately 50,000 Da. The protein sequence was obtained from five cyanogen bromide cleavage products giving sequences ranging from 12 to 25 amino acids in length and corresponding to 99 residues. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis of expressed sequence databases enabled the retrieval of a human expressed sequence tag cDNA clone highly homologous to one of the mouse peptide sequences. The presumed coding region of this clone was used to screen a human kidney cDNA library and secondarily to polymerase chain reaction-amplify the full-length coding sequence of the human brain cDNA corresponding to an open reading frame of 1365 nucleotides and encoding a protein of 51,040 Da. Comparison of the mouse peptide sequences with the inferred human protein sequence revealed 88 of 99 residues to be identical. The human coding sequence of the putative enzyme was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pMAL-c2, expressed, purified, and characterized as having guanine deaminase activity with a K m for guanine of 9.5 ± 1.7 μm. The protein shares a 9-residue motif with other aminohydrolases and amidohydrolases (PGX[VI]DXH[TVI]H) that has been shown to be ligated with heavy metal ions, commonly zinc.

By producing xanthine and ammonia, this reaction irreversibly eliminates the guanine base from further reutilization as a guanylate nucleotide in mammals. The product xanthine is a substrate for xanthine oxidase in the production of uric acid. Although it is an enzyme of purine catabolism, guanine deaminase is not ubiquitously expressed and exhibits a general absence in lymphoid tissues and variable expression elsewhere (1Kuzmits R. Seyfried H. Wolf A. Müller M.M. Enzyme (Basel). 1980; 25: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 2Scholar E.M. Calabresi P. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 94-103PubMed Google Scholar). The highest levels of expression were found in the proximal section of the small intestine of the mouse (3Mohamedali K.A. Guicherit O.M. Kellems R.E. Rudolph F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23728-23733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are greater than 50-fold differences in guanine deaminase among different regions of the mouse brain; the cerebral cortex and amygdala have the highest activity (4Berger S.J. Carter J.G. Lowry O.H. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 1736-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), whereas there is essentially no activity in the cerebellum of the mouse or cat (4Berger S.J. Carter J.G.

There are greater than 10-fold increases in the level of expression of guanine deaminase in the liver, kidney, and brain during the 40-day postnatal development of the rat (6Nardiello S. Galanti B. Russo M. Guarino F. Enzyme (Basel). 1978; 23: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and alterations in embryonic expression have also been characterized (7Brosh S. Sperling O. Bromberg Y. Sidi Y. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1776-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the adult mouse, fractional increases in brain and liver enzyme activity occur in response to intraperitoneal administration of a bolus of guanine (8Sitaramayya A. Ali S. Sree Kumar K. Krishnan P.S. Biochem. J. 1974; 138: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific expression and the developmental and induced changes in expression suggest a potential role for guanine deaminase in the regulation of the guanine nucleotide pool. Cellular GTP has an important role not only in specific enzyme reactions and protein synthesis, but also in signal transduction pathways. The cloning and characterization of guanine deaminase will advance our understanding of this key enzyme in the catabolism of guanine metabolites.Guanine deaminase has been purified from a number of mammalian sources (9Rossi C.A.

Cyanogen bromide cleavage and peptide sequencing facilitated the identification and retrieval of human EST1 clones that were used to isolate a full-length guanine deaminase cDNA from human brain. Subsequent expression of the recombinant human protein and characterization of its catalytic activity and kinetics properties confirmed this cDNA to encode human guanine deaminase.RESULTSMouse erythrocytic guanine deaminase was purified 900-fold to homogeneity (Table I). The purified mouse protein was analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and gave a subunit molecular mass of 50 kDa (Fig.1 A). Gel exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 HR column revealed the native protein to consist principally of a dimer of 100 kDa with approximately 5% of the protein present as a 200-kDa species, consistent with the presence of a minor tetrameric component (Fig. 1 B). Purified mouse erythrocytic guanine deaminase gave a K m of 22.7 ± 2.9 μm for guanine.Table IPurification of mouse erythrocyte guanine deaminaseStepProteinSpecific activityFold purificationRecovery(units/mg)(%)1.

Open table in a new tab Attempts to sequence the intact native protein failed, indicating that the protein was N-terminal modified. The purified protein was subjected to cyanogen bromide cleavage followed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Three principal bands were obtained, and these were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, cut out, and subjected to N-terminal gas phase sequencing. Two of these bands were comprised of two peptides each; however, their sequences could be distinguished by the differential signal intensity of the individual residues (TableII). Overall sequence was obtained for five peptides ranging from 12 to 25 residues and corresponding in total to 99 amino acids.Table IIAmino acid sequence of cyanogen bromide peptides from mouse guanine deaminase and comparison to inferred human sequenceCNBr Band IIaMouseMEVLRDHLLXVXDHumanMEVLRDHLLGVSDIbMouseMAHGXYLSEEELNIFXERGAHumanMAHGCYLSAEELNVFHERGACNBr Band IIIIaMouseMPGLVDTHIHAPQYAFAGSNVDLLLLHumanMPGLVDTHIHASQYSFAGSSIDLPLLIIbMouseMVSNVLLINKVNEKNLTLKEVFRLATHumanMVSNILLINKVNEKSLTLKEVFRLATCNBr Band IIIMouseM XQKNYPRVKPIVTPRFTLHumanMLQKNYSRVKPIVTPRFSLDifferences between mouse and inferred human sequence (from Fig. 3) are shown in bold.

Basic Local Alignment Search Tool analysis of expressed sequence databases (20Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69163) Google Scholar) using the mouse peptide sequence resulted in the identification of highly homologous human cDNA sequences; none were represented in the databases for the mouse. Only peptide IIa corresponded to an expressed sequence clone. Three EST clones were retrieved, and a determination of their size and partial sequence indicated that the clones were essentially identical. The sequence of EST clone 48404 yielded coverage of approximately 80% of the predicted open reading frame, including some 3′ noncoding sequence. The entire coding region of the dbEST clone was used to screen a human kidney cDNA library and resulted in the retrieval of a single colony. Upon sequencing this clone, the open reading frame appeared to be lacking the equivalent of approximately 40 residues at the N-terminal end; however, an out-of-frame ATG codon was apparent in approximately the right position near the 5′ end of this sequence. Primers were designed corresponding to the putative 5′- and 3′-coding ends of the gene, and a PCR product was obtained from a human brain cDNA library (MarathonTM-Ready cDNA). The sequence of this cDNA product gave an open reading frame of 1365 bp, corresponding to a protein of 51,040 Da, which is in agreement with the subunit mass of the purified mouse protein (Fig. 1 A). By comparison, there was a single base deletion at position 911 (Fig.2,ΔC) of the EST clone that was not present in either the kidney or brain cDNA sequences. In addition, a 4-bp deletion at position 124–127 (ΔATAG) of the kidney cDNA clone was not present in the brain cDNA sequence and accounted for the absence of a complete open reading frame in the kidney cDNA sequence.Figure 2The EST and kidney cDNA clones and the PCR-amplified brain cDNA guanine deaminase. The EST open reading frame was used to screen and isolate the kidney cDNA guanine deaminase. PCR primers based on the kidney cDNA sequence were used to isolate brain cDNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The complete cDNA sequence is given in Fig.3. The human translated sequence and the corresponding mouse peptide sequences are identified (Table II and Fig.3). For each mouse peptide, the residue preceding the N terminus corresponded to a methionine in the human sequence, consistent with the cyanogen bromide cleavage strategy.Figure 3cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence of human guanine deaminase. Amino acid residues corresponding to mouse peptide sequences are shown in bold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Conclusive verification of the identity for the cloned human sequence was obtained by subcloning the entire coding portion into the pMAL expression vector and the production of recombinant human protein (Fig.4). The cleaved product had an apparent molecular mass of 51 kDa and had the extra LSEF residues at the N terminus. The recombinant protein catalyzed the conversion of guanine to xanthine, with a K m of 9.5 ± 1.7 μm for guanine. The turnover number (k cat) was 17.4 s−1, and the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) was 11.8 × 103 s−1m−1. The enzyme exhibited optimal activity at pH 7.0, with theK m remaining constant between pH 6.5 and pH 7.5, as described previously for the rabbit liver enzyme (12Lewis A.S. Glantz M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3862-3866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the pseudo first-order rate constant (V m/K m) also showed a sharp optimum at pH 7.0. The human enzyme showed no increase in activity or dependence upon zinc or magnesium ion; however, the addition of manganese consistently resulted in approximately 2-fold increased activity. Optimal activity was obtained at approximately 0.5 mm and remained constant to 10 mm manganese chloride. The divalent metal content of guanine deaminase was determined by atomic absorption. No detectable manganese was found (<0.02 atom Mn2+ per monomer), whereas 0.70–0.91 atom Zn2+ was associated per monomer of guanine deaminase.Figure 4Expression and purification of recombinant human guanine deaminase as monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

The peptide sequences enabled the retrieval of human EST clones, and a portion of these was used to clone the full-length human cDNA guanine deaminase. Comparison of the mouse amino acid sequence from five cyanogen bromide peptides showed an identity of 88 of 99 residues with the inferred human protein sequence (Table II). Further verification of the function of the retrieved human cDNA was obtained by expression of the recombinant protein and its characterization as having guanine deaminase activity. The predicted molecular mass of the human cDNA, 51,040 Da, is in good agreement with the subunit composition for the mouse protein estimated at 50,000 Da (Fig. 1 A). These findings are in general agreement with previous studies of purified mammalian guanine deaminases that gaveM r subunit estimates ofM r 50,000 for pig brain (9Rossi C.A. Hakim G. Solaini G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 526: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar),M r 52,000 for rabbit liver (10Bergstrom J.D. Bieber A.L. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 1985; 236: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The native enzyme has generally been found to be dimeric (10Bergstrom J.D. Bieber A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 11Miyamato S. Ogawa H. Shiraki H. Nakagawa H. J. Biochem.

Canela E.I. Bozal J. Int. J. Biochem. (Engl. Ed.). 1981; 13: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The purified native mouse erythrocytic protein was principally dimeric in composition with a minor tetrameric component (Fig.1 B).The K m values for the purified mouse erythrocytic protein and recombinant human guanine deaminase were similar (22.7 and 9.5 μm, respectively). Michaelis constants for guanine deaminase with guanine from other sources were also in this range: 4.2 μm for bovine liver (22Galilea J.M. Canela E.I. Bozal J. Int. J. Biochem. (Engl. Ed.). 1981; 13: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), 11 μm for pig brain (9Rossi C.A. Hakim G. Solaini G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 526: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), 12.5 μm for rabbit liver (12Lewis A.S. Glantz M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3862-3866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 15.3 μm for human liver (13Gupta N.K. Glantz N.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 236: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The purified enzymes have exhibited pK a values consistent with the involvement of essential cysteine and histidine residues (9Rossi C.A. Hakim G. Solaini G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 526: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Lewis A.S. Glantz M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3862-3866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gupta N.K. Glantz N.D.

Ed.). 1982; 31: 253-260PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, has substantiated an essential role for these residues. Comparative sequence analysis now provides further evidence for the importance of histidine residues in guanine deaminase.Guanine deaminase shares a 9-residue N-terminal sequence previously recognized in other aminohydrolases and amidohydrolases (24Nygaard P. Duckert P. Saxild H.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 846-853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kim G.-J. Kim H.-S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Inspection of the SWISS-PROTEIN and TrEMBL databases using the Scan Prosite tool (26Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 217-221Crossref Scopus (754) Google Scholar) revealed that this motif is shared by 28 enzymes from 20 different species (Table III). This motif, particularly the invariant His-X-His portion, has been implicated in the association of bound Zn with dihydroorotase. This site has been examined via site-directed mutagenesis, and substitution for either one of the histidine residues in dihydroorotase results in both loss of activity and loss of associated Zn (27Zimmermann B.H. Kemling N.M. Evans D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7038-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Williams N.K. Manthey M.K. Hambley T.W. O'Donoghue S.I. Keegan M. Chapman B.E. Christopherson R.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11344-11352Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Human and mouse guanine deaminases (Table II and Fig. 3) share this 9-residue motif but are otherwise unique in primary sequence from other members of this family. Metal analysis of the recombinant human guanine deaminase confirmed the association of approximately one Zn2+ atom per enzyme monomer.Table IIIAminohydrolase and amidohydrolase enzymes sharing a 9-residue motifNo. of speciesEnzymeSequencePGX[VI]DXH[TVI]H2Guanine deaminasePGLVDTHIH2AdenasePGFID[GA]H[VI]H1AllantoinasePGLVDSHVH2ULIPPGGIDVHTH6DHPASEPG[GV][VI]D[TPEV]H[TV]H2Imidazolone propionasePGL[VI]D[PC]HTH1IsoaspartyldipeptidasePGFIDQHVH1d-aminoacylasePGFIDSHTH1N-acyl-d-aspartate amidohydrolasePGFIDSHTH3GLNAC 6-P deacylasePG[FML][VI]D[MIS]H[VI]H10DihydroorotasePG[LFV][VI]D[VLA]HVHAccession identification numbers for sequences matching the 9-residue motif in the SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL databases are as follows: adenine deaminase, P39761 and 050821; allantoinase, 032137; ULIP, Q14195 andQ62188; DHPASE, Q14117, Q63150, Q44184, P81006, Q45515 and Q59699; imidazolone propionase, 031200; P42084; isoaspartyldipeptidase; P39377;d-aminoacylase, P72349; N-acyl-d-aspartate amidohydrolase, P94212; GLNAC 6-P deacylase, 034450, 053382, andP96166; dihydroorotase, P20054, P05990, P27708, P08955, Q91437, P46538,P25995, P77884, Q58885, and 027199.

Open table in a new tab The ligand array that features a proximal histidine pair, HXH, and a third histidine rather distant in the sequence has been described as a class II zinc site (29Karlin S. Zhu Z.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14231-14236Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mammalian adenosine deaminase has a His-X-His motif at residues 15–17 that is known to be associated with Zn with an additional His at 214, but it does not share the preceding sequence of the 9-residue motif (30Kantz J. Schnakerz K.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Guanine deaminase has His-Ile-His at residues 82–84, with a third histidine at residue 112. This sequence is also likely to be responsible for the apparent 2-fold activation seen with manganese and is presumably associated with the loss of enzyme activity attributed to the plumbous ion (31Farkas W.R. Stanawitz T. Science. 1978; 199: 786-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).There is evidence that guanine deaminase has a significant role in urate production in mammals. The relative amount of xanthine formation via guanine was estimated to be 80% versus that via hypoxanthine at 16% (32van Waeg G. Niklasson F. de Verdier C.-H. Nyhan W.L. Thompson L.F. Watts R.W.E. Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism. Plenum Press, New York1986: 425-430Google Scholar). For xanthenuric adults with no xanthine dehydrogenase activity, the mean urine excretion ratio of xanthine:hypoxanthine is approximately 4:1 (33Boulieu R. Bory C. Baltassat P. Divry P. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1984; 142: 82-89Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), again pointing to the relative importance of the guanine to xanthine as opposed to the hypoxanthine to xanthine catabolic pathway. Administration of lead acetate in the pig as a model of acute lead exposure resulted in the deposition of guanine crystals in the epiphyseal plate of the femoral head, and this occurred in conjunction with lead-induced loss of guanine deaminase activity (31Farkas W.R. Stanawitz T. Science. 1978; 199: 786-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which can convert guanine to GMP in the presence of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, has aK m for guanine (34Henderson J.F. Brox L.W. Kelley W.N. Rosenbloom F.M. Seegmiller J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2514-2522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Krenitsky T.A. Papaioannou R. Elion G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1263-1270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is approximately the same as that of guanine deaminase. In tissues where both hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and guanine deaminase are expressed, the relative amounts of these enzymes and the availability of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate may be expected to determine whether guanine will be reutilized or catabolized and eliminated.Guanine deaminase has been immunohistochemically localized to the cytoplasm of human liver (36Ito S. Iwaski A. Syundo J. Tamura Y. Kishi S. Mori H. Ii K. Matsuda Y. Katsunuma N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), consistent with its isolation from the supernatant of cell and tissue lysates. The serum enzyme activity in man is among the most sensitive indicators of liver disease (1Kuzmits R. Seyfried H. Wolf A. Müller M.M. Enzyme (Basel). 1980; 25: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as a consequence of its near absence in normal human serum, erythrocytes, and lymphoid cells (2Scholar E.M. Calabresi P. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 94-103PubMed Google Scholar). There is a single report of a full-term infant who presented with acute anoxia at birth and died from respiratory distress at day 2 who was found to be deficient in brain guanine deaminase activity (37Kumar S. Ou W.-W. Rathi M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1979; 300: 1332-1333PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies may now be initiated by mapping guanine deaminase and looking for human disease correlates using model systems such as the mouse to explore the relationship between guanine deaminase deficiency and clinical and metabolic phenotypes. Guanine deaminase (guanine aminohydrolase, EC 3.5.4.3) catalyzes the hydrolytic deamination of guanine. By producing xanthine and ammonia, this reaction irreversibly eliminates the guanine base from further reutilization as a guanylate nucleotide in mammals. The product xanthine is a substrate for xanthine oxidase in the production of uric acid. Although it is an enzyme of purine catabolism, guanine deaminase is not ubiquitously expressed and exhibits a general absence in lymphoid tissues and variable expression elsewhere (1Kuzmits R. Seyfried H. Wolf A. Müller M.M. Enzyme (Basel). 1980; 25: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 2Scholar E.M. Calabresi P. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 94-103PubMed Google Scholar). The highest levels of expression were found in the proximal section of the small intestine of the mouse (3Mohamedali K.A. Guicherit O.M. Kellems R.E. Rudolph F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23728-23733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are greater than 50-fold differences in guanine deaminase among different regions of the mouse brain; the cerebral cortex and amygdala have the highest activity (4Berger S.J. Carter J.G.

There are greater than 10-fold increases in the level of expression of guanine deaminase in the liver, kidney, and brain during the 40-day postnatal development of the rat (6Nardiello S. Galanti B. Russo M. Guarino F. Enzyme (Basel). 1978; 23: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and alterations in embryonic expression have also been characterized (7Brosh S. Sperling O. Bromberg Y. Sidi Y. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1776-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the adult mouse, fractional increases in brain and liver enzyme activity occur in response to intraperitoneal administration of a bolus of guanine (8Sitaramayya A. Ali S. Sree Kumar K. Krishnan P.S. Biochem. J. 1974; 138: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific expression and the developmental and induced changes in expression suggest a potential role for guanine deaminase in the regulation of the guanine nucleotide pool. Cellular GTP has an important role not only in specific enzyme reactions and protein synthesis, but also in signal transduction pathways. The cloning and characterization of guanine deaminase will advance our understanding of this key enzyme in the catabolism of guanine metabolites. Guanine deaminase has been purified from a number of mammalian sources (9Rossi C.A. Hakim G. Solaini G. Biochim. Biophys.

We describe here the purification to homogeneity of mouse erythrocytic guanine deaminase. Cyanogen bromide cleavage and peptide sequencing facilitated the identification and retrieval of human EST1 clones that were used to isolate a full-length guanine deaminase cDNA from human brain. Subsequent expression of the recombinant human protein and characterization of its catalytic activity and kinetics properties confirmed this cDNA to encode human guanine deaminase. RESULTSMouse erythrocytic guanine deaminase was purified 900-fold to homogeneity (Table I). The purified mouse protein was analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and gave a subunit molecular mass of 50 kDa (Fig.1 A). Gel exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 HR column revealed the native protein to consist principally of a dimer of 100 kDa with approximately 5% of the protein present as a 200-kDa species, consistent with the presence of a minor tetrameric component (Fig. 1 B). Purified mouse erythrocytic guanine deaminase gave a K m of 22.7 ± 2.9 μm for guanine.Table IPurification of mouse erythrocyte guanine deaminaseStepProteinSpecific activityFold purificationRecovery(units/mg)(%)1.

The biochemical function of the protein is unknown, but the primary sequence contains motifs characteristic of nucleotide-binding sites. To study the requirement of the nucleotide-binding site for the essential function of Cdc6, we have changed the conserved Lys114 at the nucleotide-binding site to five other amino acid residues. We have used these mutants to investigate in vivo roles of the conserved lysine in the growth rate of transformant cells and the complementation of cdc6temperature-sensitive mutant cells. Our results suggest that replacement of Lys with Glu (K114E) and Pro (K114P) leads to loss-of-function in supporting cell growth, replacement of the Lys with Gln (K114Q) or Leu (K114L) yields partially functional proteins, and replacement with Arg yields a phenotype equivalent to wild-type, a silent mutation. To investigate what leads to the growth defects derived from the mutations at the nucleotide-binding site, we evaluated its gene functions in DNA replication by the assays of the plasmid stability and chromosomal DNA synthesis. Indeed, the K114P and K114E mutants showed the complete retraction of DNA synthesis. In order to test its effect on the G1/S transition of the cell cycle, we have carried out the temporal and spatial studies of yeast replication complex. To do this, yeast chromatin fractions from synchronized culture were prepared to detect the Mcm5 loading onto the chromatin in the presence of the wild-type Cdc6 or mutant cdc6(K114E) proteins. We found that cdc6(K114E) is defective in the association with chromatin and in the loading of Mcm5 onto chromatin origins. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of nucleotide-binding function, we have demonstrated that the Cdc6 protein associates with Orc1 in vitro and in vivo. Intriguingly, the interaction between Orc1 and Cdc6 is disrupted when the cdc6(K114E) protein is used. Our results suggest that a proper molecular interaction between Orc1 and Cdc6 depends on the functional ATP-binding of Cdc6, which may be a prerequisite step to assemble the operational replicative complex at the G1/S transition.

It has a conserved mechanism among eukaryotes from yeast to human. The primary control of the eukaryotic cell cycle is provided by a family of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)1 and their associated cyclins, which regulate kinase activity. In unicellular yeast cells, a single prototype CDK gene, CDC28 in the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae or cdc2 + in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe functions at different cell cycle stages. Different cyclins activate the same kinase as different points in the cycle. It is now known that the central control of cell cycle progression by CDK complexes is regulated positively and negatively to monitor each step of the progression (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar,2Arellano M. Moreno S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 559-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This regulatory control, associated with checkpoints, orchestrates various types of cell cycle genes throughout the cell cycle. In S. cerevisiae, over 70 temperature-sensitive cell division cycle (cdc) mutations have been isolated that control events throughout the cell cycle (3Pringle J.R. Hartwell L.H. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Inheritance. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981: 97-142Google Scholar, 4Wheals A.E. The Yeasts. Academic Press, London1987: 284-390Google Scholar). One of them,CDC6, is required in the late G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. At the non-permissive temperature, the cdc6mutant cells show a DNA synthesis defect (5Culotti J. Hartwell L.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 67: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The cdc6mutants undergo increased chromosomal loss and hyper-recombination, suggesting a fairly direct role in DNA replication (6Hartwell L.H. Smith D. Genetics. 1985; 110: 381-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tandem copies of different ARSs added to the mini-chromosome can suppress mitotic loss in cdc6, but not in cdc7, cdc9,cdc16, or cdc17 mutants (7Hogan E. Koshland D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3098-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suggesting a role at replication origins. The CDC6 mRNA fluctuates periodically throughout the cell cycle (8Zhou C. Jong A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19904-19909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Piatti S. Lengauer C. Nasmyth K.

DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The 5′-untranslated region of the CDC6 gene is very similar to a group of cell cycle genes that are either precursor enzymes for DNA synthesis or are directly involved in DNA replication (12Zhou C. Jong A.Y. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The involvement of Cdc6 in DNA replication has also been supported by direct analysis of origin function in cdc6–1 mutants using two-dimensional gel method (13Liang C. Weinreich M. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 81: 667-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The studies suggest that the Cdc6 and Orc5 protein interact and determine the frequency of initiation of DNA replication in yeast. Genetic interaction between CDC6 and ORC6 has also been reported (14Li J.J. Herskowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The S. pombe cdc18+ is homologous to S. cerevisiae CDC6 (15Kelly T.J. Martin G.S. Forsburg S.L. Stephen R.J. Russo A. Nurse P. Cell. 1993; 74: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 16Nishitani H. Nurse P. Cell. 1995; 83: 397-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the cdc18+ gene plays two roles in the cell cycle, mediating the initiation of DNA replication and preventing inappropriate mitosis. In S. cerevisiae, over-expression ofCDC6 induces G2 delay of the cell cycle (17Bueno A. Russell P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2167-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Both results suggest a possible second function of CDC6 at the G2/M phase boundary. Homologs of yeast Cdc6 have also been found in human (18Williams R.S. Shohet R.V. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and Xenopus (19Coleman T.R. Carpenter B.P. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The conservation of Cdc6 among species implies an essential role for this protein. Genomic footprinting has defined two cell cycle stages regarding the formation of replication complexes (RC): pre-RC in G1 phase and post-RC after S phase to M/G1 border (20Diffley J.F.X. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 21Rowley A. Cocker J.H. Harwood J. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2631-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 22Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The post-RC footprint closely resembles that produced in vitrowith purified ORC and Abf1, which protect A/B1 and B3 elements, respectively. The pre-RC is defined by its further protecting the B2 element of ARS1 in addition to the A/B1 and B3 elements. The data suggest that the initiation of DNA replication is not controlled by the binding of ORC and Abf1 to the origins; instead, modification of origins has to occur with the involvement of some additional factors. The Cdc6 protein is required for establishment and maintenance of pre-RC, because the arrested cdc6–1 mutant produces a post-replication footprint (23Detweiler C.S. Li J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 753-763PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cocker J.H. Piatti S. Santocanale C. Nasmyth K. Diffley J.F.

The Cdc6 protein is also required for the loading of MCM proteins (26Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 27Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L.S. Diffley J.F.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, the Cdc6 protein interacts with Cdc28 protein complex after p40sic1 is degraded at late G1 phase (31Elsasser S. Lou F. Wang B. Campbell J.L. Jong A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1723-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have recently found that the Cdc6 can stimulate Abf1 binding to the B3 domain of ARS1 DNA fragment (32Feng L. Wang B. Jong A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1298-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Currently, it is believed that interactions of Cdc6 with a variety of other protein complexes, such as the ORC, the MCM complex, and Cdc28 kinase are important in coordinating chromosome replication and cell cycle control (33Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, the detailed molecular mechanism of the CDC6gene action is still largely unknown. There is a conserved nucleotide-binding site in Cdc6 (34Zhou C. Huang S.-H. Jong A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9022-9029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the yeast Cdc6 is able to bind ATP and GTP (10Zwerschke W. Rottjakob H.-W. Kuntzel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23351-23356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At present, the physiological roles of the nucleotide-binding site are still obscure. One effective way to study the function of the nucleotide-binding site is to carry out site-specific mutagenesis experiments to alter the indispensable Lys residue, and examine its phenotypic consequence. In these studies, we have followed a series of steps to unravel the functions of the nucleotide-binding site. First, we changed the conserved Lys114 at the nucleotide-binding site to five other amino acid residues. We show that replacement of Lys with Glu (K114E) and Pro (K114P) leads to loss of function in supporting cell growth, replacement of the Lys with Gln (K114Q) or Leu (K114L) yields partially functional proteins, and replacement with Arg yields a phenotype equivalent to wild-type. Second, based on the plasmid stability assay and chromosomal DNA synthesis assay, the roles of the conserved Lys is most likely required for DNA replication. This guides us to investigate the formation of a functional replication complex at G1/S transition. Third, we have prepared synchronous chromatin fractions of both mutant and wild-type proteins to examine the effect of the cdc6(K114E) mutation. We found that the loading of the cdc6(K114E) and Mcm5 proteins is drastically altered in the chromatin. Finally, at the molecular level, we demonstrated that Cdc6 interacts with Orc1 in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the interaction between Orc1 and Cdc6 is impaired when the cdc6(K114E) protein is used. Our results suggest that a proper molecular interaction between Orc1 and Cdc6 depends on the functional ATP binding of Cdc6. This may lead to assemble the operational replicative complex at the G1/S transition. The biological significance of the ATP binding in this process is discussed in this report. The yeastcdc6–1 strain, 611, has been described (31Elsasser S. Lou F. Wang B. Campbell J.L. Jong A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1723-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Strain K4055 wasCDC6::hisGURA3hisG,trp1–1::TRP1 MET-CDC6 with URA3 looped out (9Piatti S. Lengauer C. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3788-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). StrainBJ2168 (a prc1–407 prb1–1122 pep4–3 leu2 trpl ura3–52) is a protease-deficient strain. Plasmid carrying alleles mutated at lysine 114 were generated by cloning a 1.8-kbHindIII-EcoRI fragment encompassing theCDC6 ORF into M13mp19, mutagenizing as described below, and cloning the resulting alleles into YEp352 (35Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Lysine 114 has been changed to Glu (K114E), Gln (K114Q), Arg (K114R), Pro (K114P), and Leu (K114L) (see Fig. 1). The YEp352 subclones are designated: YEp352-K114E, YEp352-K114L, YEp352-K114R, YEp352-K114P, and YEp352-K114Q (Table I). Plasmid YGp12 for the expression of untagged proteins were prepared by cloning the wild-type and K114E allele under the control of the GAL1,10 promoter in a 2-μm yeast vector with URA3 as selectable marker. Plasmid YGp102 is the same construct except that LEU2 is the selection marker (Fig. 2). YCp5N is derived from a single-copy shuttle vector YCplac111 and contains a 0.7-kb 5′ upstream sequence of the CDC6 gene (34Zhou C. Huang S.-H. Jong A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9022-9029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A T7 tag was inserted into 3′ end of the CDC6 open reading frame in which the TAG codon of CDC6 gene had been removed, and the fusion was subcloned into YCp5N. YEp-HA-Mcm5 is generated by inserting a MCM5 fragment into a high copy vector, YEp352, in which Mcm5 is HA-tagged at its C-terminal 751 amino acids and the expression of the MCM5 gene is driven by its own 444-bp promoter sequence (36Hennessy K.M. Lee A. Chen E. Botstein D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 958-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). A full-length of ORC1gene was subcloned into bacterial expression vector pET28b, pET28a-ORC1, for the expression of 6xHis-Orc1 protein YGp181-His-T7-ORC1 contains 6xHis and T7 tag at the N terminus of the ORC1 gene driven by the Galpromoter with Leu2 selection marker (Fig. 7 C). YGp123 is the vector with the insertion of 0.8-kb Gal1-Gal10promoter on the vector YEplac112 with Trp1 as the selection marker. The wild-type CDC6-T7 tag, cdc6(K114E)-T7 tag and temperature-sensitive cdc6–1-T7 tag genes were subcloned into YGp123, individually, for co-expression experiments (Fig. 7 C). Yeast media YPD and CSM medium SD-ura were purchased from Bio101, Inc. All chemicals were ordered from Sigma; and restriction enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. or New England Biolabs.Table ITransformation frequency of the wild-type and mutated CDC6 gene into cdc6–1 cells at the permissive (23 °C) and nonpermissive temperature (37 °C)Plasmids23 °C37 °CYEp352-CDC64.8 × 1034.7 × 103YEp352-K114E4.9 × 1031YEp352-K114L4.5 × 1033.5 × 103YEp352-K114R4.2 × 1034.0 × 103YEp352-K114P4.4 × 1032YEp352-K114Q4.7 × 1033.2 × 103Vector only4.0 × 1030Transformations are reported as colonies/ μg of transforming DNA.

CDC6 was expressed under the control of theGAL1,10 promoter as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We created strains carrying either one or two copies of the wild-type or mutant allele by transforming strain BJ2168with YGp12 alone or YGp12 and YGp102 constructs together.

The extracts were then passed through the Orc1-charged matrix, washed extensively, and subjected to protein blotting experiments.

Muta-Gene in vitromutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad) was used to carry out the experiments as described below. The mutagenic (GGT CCG CCT GGC ACT GGC (G/C)(G/C/T)G ACT) and universal primers were synthesized (12Zhou C. Jong A.Y. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 37Zoller M.J. Smith M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 468-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar); T7 DNA polymerase instead of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I was used in the reaction (38Zhou C. Abaigar L. Jong A. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 503PubMed Google Scholar). The mutagenized DNA is shown in Fig. 1. Yeast cdc6–1 shows elevated chromosomal loss. The wild-type and mutant cdc6genes were transformed into strain cdc6–1 to examine their plasmid stability. A colony grown on selective medium was resuspended in 0.2 ml of water. A 0.1-ml sample was used to inoculate 5 ml of nonselective media (either YPD or SD plus uracil), and cultures were grown at 30 °C with aeration for 5–10 generations. Dilutions of the initial suspension were plated on YPD plates, and colonies were counted to determine the initial concentration of cells. These plates were then replica-plated to SD-ura to determine the percentage of plasmid-bearing cells. The PFGE labeling method was used to investigate yeast chromosomal DNA synthesis (39Jong A.Y. Wang B. Zhang S.Q. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this method, yeast cells are first labeled with 32Pi in vivo and chromosomal DNA is then resolved by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Briefly, 20 ml of yeast cell culture was grown at room temperature to the early log phase (∼107 cells/ml) and arrested by α-factor for 90 min. The cells were then washed with 20 ml of low phosphate medium (LPM) three times, and resuspended into the same volume of LPM. After heat treatment (37 °C), 50 μCi of radioactive 32Pi was added. The culture was grown for another 1 h, and uptake was quenched with 50 mm cold phosphate. The labeled cells were harvested and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and molecules were separated using the Bio-Rad CHEF-DR II Megabase DNA pulse field electrophoresis system. The resulting gel was dried and autoradiographed. Yeast chromatin was prepared according to Lue and Kornberg (40Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, yeast strain K4055 cells harboring plasmid fusions with co-transformation of YEp-Mcm5-HA and YCp5N-Cdc6-T7, or YCp5N-cdc6(K114E)-T7. The transformant cells were grown on the CSM medium in the presence of methionine (MET+) to shut off the endogenous CDC6. The cells were synchronized at G1 with α-factor at final concentration of 10 μg/ml at room temperature for 4 h. The cells were then released from α-factor block, grown on the fresh MET+ medium, and collected at the indicated time points. Aliquots of cells were harvested at different time intervals to monitor the degree of synchrony by measurement of percentage of budded cells and FACS analysis (38Zhou C. Abaigar L. Jong A. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 503PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were washed once with 50 mm ice-cold EDTA and incubated in a solution containing 20 mm EDTA/2% β-mercaptoethanol at 30 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the cells were centrifuged and washed once with 1m sorbitol. Spheroplasts were generated by digesting the cells with 100 μg/ml yeast lytic enzyme (ICN) in a solution containing 1 m sorbitol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C for 60 min. The spheroplasts were cooled on ice for 10 min, centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and washed once with the 1 m ice-cold sorbitol. The spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation and lysed in a buffer containing 20% (w/v) Ficoll 400 (Sigma), 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 mm EDTA with a Teflon/glass homogenizer. Cell debris were removed by four spins at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Uniform white supernatants were recovered and were spun at 36,000 rpm and 4 °C for 30 min. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of the spheroplast lysis buffer described above and subjected to Ficoll 400 gradient centrifugation (20–45%) at 36,000 rpm and 4 °C for 30 min. Chromatin pellets were resuspended in a buffer H/0.1 (50 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, and 10% glycerol) and stored at −80 °C. 10 μg of protein from each chromatin sample were mixed with 4× SDS loading buffer and boiled in a water bath for 5 min. The samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (8–10%) electrophoresis at 4 °C for 4 h, and proteins were blotted onto an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Millipore). The protein blots were probed either with 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) for detecting HA-tagged proteins, or with anti-T7 tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen) for detecting T7-tagged proteins, followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. The protein samples were detected with the Tropix chemiluminescent system. 500 ml of bacterial culture containing expressed 6xHis-T7-Orc1 tagged protein was harvested and resuspended into 15 ml of Buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100) in the presence of 20 mm PMSF and 20 mm benzamidine. 10 mg of lysozyme and 2 mg of DNase were added and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was collected (∼15 ml) and mixed with 0.2 ml of Ni-NTA (Qiagene) at 4 °C for 60 min. The resulting slurry was packed onto a column and washed with 20 ml of Buffer II (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100). The Orc1-charged matrix was ready for Cdc6 interaction assay. GST-Cdc6 fusions were prepared from 250 ml of culture. Crude extracts were made in Buffer II with 20 mm PMSF and 20 mm benzamidine. Aliquot was used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to analyze their expression (Fig. 7 B,lanes 4–6). The rest (∼15 ml) was passed through Orc1-charged matrix 10 times for the interaction studies. For Orc1 and Cdc6 co-precipitation experiments (Fig. 7 C), yeast strain BJ5459 was first transformed with YGp181-His-T7-ORC1 (selection marker Leu2). The resulting strain was then transformed separately with either YGp123-CDC6-T7, or YGp-K114E-T7, or YGp1233-cdc6–1-T7 with selection marker Trp1. 500 ml of culture was induced with 2% galactose for 4 h. The cell pellets were disrupted by Bead-BeaterTM in Buffer II, supplemented with 20 mm benzamidine, 20 mm PMSF, 1 mg of DNase. Tagged Orc1 was purified by Ni-NTA matrix, concentrated 10-fold, and probed with anti-T7 antibody on protein blots. Monoclonal antibody against T7 tag can detect both His-T7-Orc1 and Cdc6-T7 on the same blot if Orc1 can bring down Cdc6-T7 proteins in the experiment shown in Fig.7 C. In vitro site-specific mutagenesis is a powerful tool to probe the relationship between the structure and activity of proteins, because the amino acid residues responsible for a particular function can be identified directly (41Botstein D. Shortle D. Science. 1985; 229: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Previous analysis of the primary sequence (34Zhou C. Huang S.-H. Jong A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9022-9029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that CDC6contains a motif conserved among known ATPases, GXXGXGKT, ranging from residues 108–115 inCDC6 (Fig. 1 A). This element plays a role in binding the pyrophosphate moiety of nucleotides, and the Lys residue is essential for electrostatic interaction between the proteins and the nucleotides (42Moller W. Amons R. FEBS Lett. 1985; 186: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In order to examine whether the conserved Lys residue represents an essential amino acid residue as in other nucleotide-binding proteins, we have mutated the Lys residue to five other residues. The mutagenic primers were similar to the wild-type sequence except for one or two altered nucleotides at the first two bases in the lysine codon (Fig. 1,A and B). The following substitutions were made at the conserved lysine: to glutamate to test the effect of introducing a negative charge, to proline to test the effect of a general disruption, to glutamine to test the effect of substituting an amide, to leucine to test the effect of introducing a neutral amino acid, and to arginine to test the effect of changing the configuration of the positive charge.

Remnant lipoproteins are also internalized by cells via the LDL receptor as well as other receptors, but the events following the internalization of these complexes, which use apolipoprotein E (apoE) as their ligand for receptor capture, have not been defined. There is evidence that apoE-containing β-very low density lipoproteins follow differential intracellular routing depending on their size and apoE content and that apoE internalized with lipoproteins can be resecreted by cultured hepatocytes and fibroblasts. In the present studies, we addressed the question of apoE sparing or recycling as a physiologic phenomenon. Remnant lipoproteins (d < 1.019 g/ml) from normal mouse plasma were iodinated and injected into normal C57BL/6 mice. Livers were collected at 10, 30, 60, and 120 min after injection, and hepatic Golgi fractions were prepared for gel electrophoresis analysis. Golgi preparations were analyzed for galactosyltransferase enrichment (>40-fold above cell homogenate) and by appearance of the Golgi stacks and vesicles on electron microscopy. Iodinated apoE was consistently found in the Golgi fractions peaking at 10 min and disappearing by 2 h after injection. Although traces of apoB48 were present in the Golgi fractions, the apoE/apoB ratio in the Golgi was 50-fold higher compared with serum. Quantitatively similar results were obtained when the very low density lipoprotein remnants were injected into mice deficient in either apoE or the LDL receptor, indicating that the phenomenon of apoE recycling is not influenced by the production of endogenous apoE and is not dependent on the presence of LDL receptors. In addition, radioactive apoE in the Golgi fractions was part of d= 1.019–1.21 g/ml complexes, indicating an association of recycled apoE with either newly formed lipoproteins or the internalized complexes.

Goldstein J.L. Srere P.A. Estabrook R.W. Microenvironments and Metabolic Compartmentation. Academic Press, Inc., New York1978: 87-96Google Scholar,2Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. J. Supramol. Struct. 1977; 6: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The LDL particle, which contains apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) as the sole protein component, is internalized as a lipoprotein-receptor complex within an endosomal compartment that subsequently fuses with lysosomes. Whereas the LDL receptor recycles back to the cell surface, the lipoprotein particle continues on its routing toward the lysosomal compartment where complete hydrolysis of apoB and the lipid components of the particle occurs (3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3330-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). It is not known whether other lipoproteins follow the same intracellular pathways of LDL after internalization. Chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) remnants, for example, despite containing apoB utilize apoE as the ligand for receptor interactions (4Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3385) Google Scholar, 5Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 6th Ed. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. I. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1989: 1195-1213Google Scholar). In addition to binding to the LDL receptor, apoE can also interact with the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) (6Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 7Beisiegel U. Weber W. Ihrke G. Herz J. Stanley K.K. Nature. 1989; 341: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 8Willnow T.E. Sheng Z. Ishibashi S. Herz J. Science. 1994; 264: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), as well as with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface (9Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Svenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Because of these multiple choices of cellular entry, it is possible that the fate of internalized apoE-containing lipoproteins may be different from that of LDL. Previous studies have shown that the routing of β-VLDL, an apoE-containing remnant lipoprotein, is dependent upon size and possibly the apoE content of the lipoprotein. In two studies, Tabaset al. (10Tabas I. Lim S. Xu X.-X. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 11Tabas I. Myers J.N. Innerarity T.L. Xu X.-X. Arnold K. Boyles J. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported that smaller β-VLDL are routed to the perinuclear region of the mouse macrophage in a similar fashion to LDL, whereas larger β-VLDL remained closer to the plasma membrane. Although this phenomenon appeared to be mostly dependent on particle size, it is also possible that the higher apoE content of larger β-VLDL was at least partially responsible for the different intracellular routing of this particle. Recent studies have shown that incubation of tissue culture cells with 125I-labeled lipoproteins results in the secretion of apoE-associated label after heparinase treatment (12Beisiegel U. Weber W. Heeren J. Hilpert J. Circulation. 1995; 92 (Suppl. I): 691Google Scholar, 13Chen C.-M. Al-Haideri M. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. Vogel T. Galeano N.F. Sturley S.L. Deckelbaum R.J. Circulation. 1995; 92: I-691Google Scholar). In addition, following the injection of radiolabeled lipoproteins in rats, the contribution of exogenous apoB to the total apoB endosomal content was less than 10%, whereas that of exogenous apoE was higher than 60% (relative to total apoE) (14Wong L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 141: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These data would indicate that apoE internalized by cells may not undergo complete degradation, and thus it can be hypothesized that some of this apoE may be utilized for resecretion. Based on this information, we propose that apoE-containing lipoproteins undergo an intracellular destiny different from that of apoB-containing lipoproteins and that a portion of the apoE component of the lipoprotein is spared from degradation and routed through a secretory pathway that might involve the Golgi apparatus. A series of studies were performed in normal C57BL/6 mice and in mutant apoE and LDLR null mice to determine whether exogenously administered apoE could be found in the liver Golgi fraction at different time points after intravenous injection of 125I-labeled remnant lipoproteins (d < 1.019 g/ml). Our studies show that apoE recycling is a physiologic phenomenon in the mouse liver in vivo. This phenomenon is evident in normal mice as well as in mice lacking apoE or the LDL receptor, suggesting that a different receptor, possibly the LRP, is involved in the selective retroendocytosis of apoE. Thed < 1.019 lipoproteins were prepared from Triton-treated mice as described previously (15Linton M.F. Atkinson J.B. Fazio S. Science. 1995; 267: 1034-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Briefly, in each experiment four donor C57BL/6 mice were treated with 10% tyloxapol (Sigma, 4 μl/g of body weight) via tail vein injection. Four hours following injection, mice were exsanguinated, and serum was separated by centrifugation. The d < 1.019 g/ml fraction was isolated by ultracentrifugation at 120,000 × g for 2.5 h on a Beckman TL-120 tabletop centrifuge. Iodination was carried out according to a modification of the McFarlane ICl method (16McFarlane A.S. Nature. 1958; 132: 53Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 17Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). The iodinated d < 1.019 lipoproteins were dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl. The protein concentration was determined by the Lowry procedure (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and samples were diluted to 20 μg/ml. The integrity of the VLDL preparation was verified by electrophoresis on 4–12% SDS gels followed by exposure to film. The specific activities of the lipoprotein preparations ranged from 300 to 800 cpm/ng. Recipient mice were anesthetized with methoxyflurane (Mallinckrodt Veterinary, Mundelein, IL), and 5 μg (200 μl) of radioactive fraction was injected into the jugular bulb. At various times following injection, blood was collected from the retro-orbital venous plexus. The mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the liver was quickly removed, trimmed of excess fat and connective tissue, rinsed in distilled water, blotted, and weighed. Golgi apparatus-rich fractions were isolated from the liver according to a modification of the method of Swift et al. (19Swift L.L. Manowitz N.R. Dunn G.D. LeQuire V.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 415-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Swift L.L. Padley R.J. Getz G.S. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 207-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The livers were minced finely with scalpel blades and placed in homogenization buffer (0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, 0.25 m sucrose, 1% dextran, and 0.01 mMgCl2). Pools of three livers were homogenized together for 18 s with a Polytron at setting 0.5 (model PT 10-35, Brinkmann Instruments). The homogenate was centrifuged in an SW 40 rotor at 4 °C at 2600 rpm for 10 min and 9700 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and 1.7 ml of the homogenizing buffer was added to the pellet. The top one-third of the pellet was dislodged and layered on 8 ml of 1.2 m sucrose in an SW 40 centrifuge tube (5100 rpm for 10 min, 10,200 rpm for 10 min, and 25,600 rpm for 45 min). At the end of the centrifugation the white band at the interface was carefully removed, diluted with ice-cold distilled water, and pelleted in the SW 40 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. To analyze galactosyltransferase activity, the pellet was resuspended in 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl and frozen in liquid nitrogen. To recover the nascent lipoproteins, the Golgi-enriched fraction was resuspended in 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.0, and incubated on ice for 60 min. The membranes were pelleted by centrifugation in an SW 50.1 rotor at 45,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% EDTA, pH 7.4, overnight. The density was raised to 1.019 g/ml using solid NaCl, and the d < 1.019 g/ml fraction was isolated by centrifugation in a Beckman Optima TLX tabletop ultracentrifuge at 120,000 rpm for 2.5 h. A d < 1.019 g/ml fraction was isolated from serum in a similar manner. The Golgi and serum lipoprotein fractions were stored in lyophilized form. A similar set of procedures was used in the experiment with rats. Because we cannot exclude the presence of minor endocytic contaminants, the Golgi preparations will be referred to as Golgi apparatus-enriched fractions throughout the article. SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels (3–20% gradient) were run as described by Swift et al. (20Swift L.L. Padley R.J. Getz G.S. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 207-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were solubilized in 0.06 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol by heating at 100 °C for 5 min and separated by gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried and exposed to film using DuPont Cronex Lightning Plus intensifying screens. Gels were exposed to film for up to 3 weeks. Densitometric analyses were performed on a MultiImage light cabinet equipped with AlphaImage 3.24 software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Galactosyltransferase activity was assayed using the method of Morre et al. (21Morre D.J. Merlin L.M. Keenan T.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and modified to include ATP at the initial concentration of 1 mm to reduce nonspecific hydrolysis of the UDP galactose (22Palmiter R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 178: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). At the specified time points after injection of the radiotracer, mice were killed and blood was collected. Perfusion of the carcass was done using 20 ml of cold saline injected at physiologic pressure from the tip of the heart after making an incision in the abdominal aorta below the renal artery level, and the perfusion continued until the liver was completely depleted of blood. The radioactivity in a 10-μl aliquot of plasma and the whole liver were measured in a γ-counter. Plasma clearance of the radiolabel was calculated assuming that the total plasma volume of a mouse is 3.5% of body weight and by dividing the total plasma counts at each time point by the injected amount (minus any losses during injection). Liver uptake at each time point was calculated as the ratio between liver counts and initial counts in plasma. The aim of this study was to determine whether intact exogenous apolipoproteins could be identified in the Golgi apparatus-rich fractions of different strains of mice after injection of radiolabeled murine VLDL (d < 1.019 g/ml lipoproteins). The purity of mouse hepatic Golgi apparatus-enriched fractions was evaluated by both morphologic and biochemical criteria. By negative stain electron microscopy, the fractions exhibited morphologic characteristics consistent with the known features of the Golgi apparatus. Among the identifiable structures were cisternae, appearing as central plates or fenestrated plates continuous with an anastomosing tubular network containing secretory vesicles filled with lipoproteins (Fig.1 A). Intravesicular particles, as well as particles inside plates, measured 40–70 nm, which is consistent with the size of VLDL. By thin section electron microscopy, the Golgi-enriched fractions consisted of parallel stacks of flattened cisternae along with secretory vesicles, some of which remained attached to the cisternae (Fig. 1 B). Structures with characteristics of multivesicular bodies were not observed within our preparations of Golgi apparatus-enriched fractions (23Hornick C.A. Hamilton R.L. Spaziani E. Enders G.H. Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1558-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Biochemically, the purity of Golgi-rich fractions was assessed by the activity of galactosyltransferase, a Golgi-specific enzyme. Golgi-rich fractions were enriched in galactosyltransferase activity from 43- to 96-fold compared with the initial liver homogenates, not unlike values obtained using rat liver (19Swift L.L. Manowitz N.R. Dunn G.D. LeQuire V.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 415-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fate of injected lipoproteins in a representative experiment is shown in Fig. 2. More than 70% of the label disappeared from plasma within 2 h after injection, whereas about 20% of the initial serum counts accumulated in the liver over the same period of time. The injected d < 1.019 g/ml lipoproteins were composed primarily of apoB100 and apoB48 and contained relatively smaller amounts of apoE (Fig.3, A and B,lanes 1 and 2). On average, the radioactive label in the apoB proteins was 50-fold greater than in apoE. This preponderance of radioactive apoB was maintained in the plasma and VLDL fraction of the mice receiving the radiotracer, indicating that no selective loss or degradation of the injected particles was occurring. This ratio was dramatically altered in the luminal lipoproteins recovered from the Golgi apparatus-rich fractions of the liver of recipient mice where apoB100 was barely detectable, and apoB48 was consistently decreased compared with apoE (Fig.4). Interestingly, this enrichment in apoE was most evident at 10 min postinjection, a time at which only a small portion of the radiolabeled material was taken up by the liver.Figure 3Evidence of apoE recycling in mouse liver. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of VLDL and Golgi preparations from C57BL/6 mice after injection of125I-labeled mouse VLDL (d < 1.019 g/ml).

Data are mean and standard deviation of five (VLDL) or three (Golgi-rich fraction) separate experiments with three mice in each experiment. The difference between VLDL and both Golgi time points is significant (Student's t test, p < 0.001). The difference between the two Golgi time points is also significant (p < 0.005).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Selective sparing of apoE from the degradative pathway following lipoprotein internalization can best be shown by the appearance of internalized apoE in the secretory pathway. When C57BL/6 mice were injected with radiolabeled VLDL, the Golgi-rich fractions from pooled livers were selectively enriched in apoE (Fig. 3), an indication that a portion of the internalized apoE was carried back into the secretory pathway. Considering that the radioactivity distribution in the original VLDL preparation (Fig. 3 A, lane 1) and in the plasma VLDL of mice after injection (Fig. 3 A,lane 2) is more than 98% associated with apoB, it is apparent that the appearance of plasma apoE in the Golgi apparatus-enriched fractions represents a selective mechanism that excludes apoB100 and, to a lesser degree, apoB48. As determined in four separate experiments, the ratio apoE/apoB showed a 50-fold increase in the Golgi-rich fractions relative to the plasma compartment. The effect was time-dependent with the peak accumulation of labeled apoE being detected 10 min after injection (Fig. 3, A andB, lane 3) and progressively diminishing by 30 (Fig. 3 A, lane 4) and 60 min (Fig. 3 B,lane 4). No radioactivity in the Golgi-rich fraction was detected 120 min after injection of the radiotracer (data not shown). Plasma clearance of the injected tracer was only about 30% by the 10-min time point, and only about 13% of the initial serum counts were detected in the liver (Fig. 2). To determine whether the phenomenon of apoE recycling was affected by parameters such as the lack of endogenously produced apoE or the absence of the LDL receptor on the cell surface, we performed a similar series of experiments in genetically engineered mice carrying the homozygous disruption of either the apoE (24Zhang S.H.

As shown in Fig. 5 A(lanes 4 and 6), apoE was visible in the Golgi-enriched fractions of both groups of mice 10 min after the injection of 125I-VLDL. However, the time-dependent progression of internalized apoE in the Golgi apparatus-rich fraction of apoE(−/−) and LDLR(−/−) mice was different from that of normal mice with the peak apoE radioactivity being reached at 30 min after injection (Fig. 5 B,lanes 2 and 4) rather than at 10 min. This was likely an effect of the retarded clearance of the radiotracer in mice lacking either apoE or the LDL receptor. Studies were performed to examine whether apoE, which had reentered the secretory pathway, existed as a free protein or as part of a lipoprotein. Fig. 6 shows studies to determine the density distribution of radioactive Golgi apoE from livers of normal mice 10 min after injection of the tracer. Panel A shows that the radioactive apoE in the Golgi-rich fraction is primarily associated with a lipoprotein particle of density 1.006–1.210 g/ml, whereas some of the apoB48 could also be identified in the d < 1.006 g/ml region. Only traces of apoE were detected in the d < 1.006 g/ml and the lipoprotein-free bottom fractions. In Panel B, a similar experiment was performed to determine whether apoE in the Golgi apparatus-rich fraction would maintain the density distribution of the original VLDL preparation (d < 1.019 g/ml). As shown in lanes 3 and 4, a clear density shift occurs at the level of the Golgi-rich fraction, where all of the apoE is part of a complex with d >1.019 g/ml. Fig. 7 shows that the phenomenon of apoE enrichment in the liver Golgi is not limited to the mouse system but extends also to the rat, an established model of hepatic Golgi studies. The presence of internalized apoE in the Golgi-rich fraction of livers from rats 10 min after injection of radiolabeled rat VLDL was more dramatic than in the mouse system. ApoE was barely visible in the original preparation (not shown) and in the plasma of the injected animals (lane 1) and was selectively enriched in the Golgi-enriched fraction at the expenses of apoB100 and, to a lesser extent, apoB48. In this study we show that the various apoprotein components of exogenously administered VLDL are processed differently by the mouse liver after internalization. The vast majority of the radioactivity in the 125I-labeled murine d < 1.019 g/ml lipoproteins was associated with apoB100 and apoB48, whereas only a small portion of the radioiodine was associated with apoE. The ratio apoE/apoB48 in the Golgi-rich fraction increased 10-fold relative to serum, and only traces of apoB100 were detected. The implications of such findings are as follows: 1) unlike LDL, components of the internalized VLDL are spared from complete intracellular degradation and appear in the secretory pathway; 2) apoB48-containing VLDL may have a different intracellular fate than apoB100-containing VLDL; and 3) apoE can recycle through the secretory pathway either free or associated with lipoproteins. It is important to notice that the phenomenon of apoE recycling to Golgi was also present in mice lacking either apoE or the LDL receptor, suggesting that the recycling of apoE is not affected by the production of endogenous apoE, which in liver does not appear to be increased by the common lipogenic stimuli (26Davis R.A. Dluz S.M. Leighton J.K. Brengaze V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8970-8977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Fazio S. Yao Z. McCarthy B.J. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6941-6945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that the route of VLDL internalization followed by apoE recycling does not depend exclusively on the LDL receptor. A possible argument against our interpretations is that the enrichment of apoE within the Golgi-rich fraction simply reflects the prioritization of lipoprotein uptake by the liver with apoE-rich particles being selected more avidly and more rapidly for internalization than apoE-poor particles. This would be especially true if endosomal contamination was present in the Golgi preparations. Some Golgi apparatus-enriched fractions have been shown to be contaminated with endosomal vesicles (28Hamilton R.L. Moorehouse A. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 529-543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elimination of this contaminant is crucial in assessing the true secretory products within the Golgi fraction. Our methodology for preparation of Golgi fractions from mouse liver was based on procedures developed in our laboratory (29Swift L.L. Manowitz N.R. Dunn G.D. LeQuire V.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and subsequently modified specifically to eliminate endosomal contamination (23Hornick C.A. Hamilton R.L. Spaziani E. Enders G.H. Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1558-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Harrison J.C. Swift L.L. LeQuire V.S. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1439-1449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic analysis of our preparations demonstrated enrichment in galactosyltransferase, a recognized marker of Golgi purity. Further morphologic analyses by electron microscopy revealed a fraction enriched in Golgi elements devoid of other recognizable elements (with the exception of scattered rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane). From an experimental standpoint it is difficult to eliminate completely endosomal contamination because of the absence of a unique marker for elements of the endocytic compartment. However, in addition to this experimental evidence other observations argue against endosomal contamination as an explanation of our results. If the 10-fold increase in the VLDL apoE/apoB48 ratio from plasma to Golgi-rich fractions was just a consequence of endosomal contamination, it would represent the rapid uptake of a select group of apoE-enriched, apoB48-containing remnants within the larger number ofd < 1.019 g/ml tracer lipoproteins. Later time points should then reflect the uptake of the remaining particles, with an expected increase in apoB48 relative to apoE and eventually with the appearance of apoB100. However, this was not the case. Although the ratio apoE/apoB48 in Golgi-rich fractions decreases slightly after 30 min, it never reaches the values found in the plasma compartment, and apoB100 only represents a faint band in our Golgi-enriched preparations even 2 h after injection. Moreover, even if these results were partly because of endosomal contamination, the relevance of the observation would not be diminished, i.e. apoE undergoes an intracellular processing uniquely different from that of the apoB components of the same lipoprotein vehicle. Although our studies do not define whether apoE recycles in free or lipoprotein-associated form, the data presented in Fig. 6 show that apoE in the Golgi-rich fractions is part of a lipoprotein complex of density smaller than the original radiolabeled VLDL. This could be due either to the association of recycling lipoprotein-free apoE with the nascent lipoproteins in the Golgi or to the recycling of apoE as part of smaller remnant particles. The presence of detectable levels of apoB48 in the Golgi-rich fraction allows us to speculate that the recycling particles may be small apoB48 remnants highly enriched in apoE. The finding that 125I-labeled apoB48 was isolated from the Golgi apparatus-enriched fraction floats in the same density range as 125I-labeled apoE is also compatible with this hypothesis and suggests the presence of a unique intracellular pathway in the liver that directs apoE-rich remnant particles through a recycling route, which may eventually lead to resecretion of the particle as such or after repackaging. The finding that in vivo recycling of apoE is not affected by the absence of the LDLR is a strong indication that additional receptors may be involved in this pathway. A possible candidate is the LDLR-related protein or LRP, which is abundantly expressed in the liver (6Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) and whose hepatic inactivation leads to dramatic accumulations of remnant lipoproteins in plasma (8Willnow T.E. Sheng Z. Ishibashi S. Herz J. Science. 1994; 264: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 31Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). LRP is uniquely responsive to apoE-containing lipoproteins, as was recently demonstrated in our laboratory, where mice lacking both LDLR and apoE were transplanted with wild-type bone marrow and showed no changes in lipoprotein levels despite high levels of macrophage-derived apoE in plasma (32Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Babaev V.R. Fazio S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1726-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Additionally, this phenomenon may be related to direct lipoprotein uptake through heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Ji et al. (33Ji Z.-S. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13452-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) have presented evidence of a differential cellular accumulation of apoE isoforms in neuronal cells that is detectable in the absence of both LDLR and LRP but is eliminated by heparan sulfate proteoglycan inactivation. Finally, it is also possible that apoE recycling is dependent on the lipoprotein size, composition, and apoE content rather than on the kind of receptor involved in particle uptake. The concept that internalized remnants may experience an intracellular fate different from that of LDL, although not of intuitive physiologic significance, is in line with previous studies of intracellular routing of internalized lipoproteins. Tabas et al. (10Tabas I. Lim S. Xu X.-X. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the uptake of small remnants from macrophages in vitrowas followed by a perinuclear distribution of the particles similar to that described for LDL. However, large remnant particles for the most part had a superficial distribution under the plasma membrane as well as a prolonged residence time within the cell (10Tabas I. Lim S. Xu X.-X. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although the authors reported that the size of the remnant particles was the main promoter of differential routing (11Tabas I. Myers J.N. Innerarity T.L. Xu X.-X. Arnold K. Boyles J. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it is possible that apoE content also plays a role in directing the particle to an alternate pathway, which may lead to particle resecretion. This possibility has been suggested in recent in vitro studies, where incubation of either fibroblasts or HepG2 cells with 125I-labeled VLDL followed by heparinase treatment resulted in the appearance of125I-labeled apoE in the media during the chase period (12Beisiegel U. Weber W. Heeren J. Hilpert J. Circulation. 1995; 92 (Suppl. I): 691Google Scholar,13Chen C.-M. Al-Haideri M. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. Vogel T. Galeano N.F. Sturley S.L. Deckelbaum R.J. Circulation. 1995; 92: I-691Google Scholar). Additional evidence for a unique role of internalized apoE is provided by a study in which cultured macrophages were incubated with model triglyceride-rich particles with or without apoE. Particles with apoE resulted in higher triglyceride degradation and higher cholesteryl ester synthesis than particles without apoE, indicating that apoE has effects on modulating intracellular lipid metabolism after lipoprotein internalization (34Schwiegelshohn B. Presely J.F. Gorecki M. Vogel T. Carpentier Y.A. Maxfield F.R. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1761-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The authors speculated that some apoE may be spared from lysosomal degradation to affect postlysosomal trafficking of lipid molecules to subcellular compartments such as the peroxisomes. Two important issues that remain to be discussed are how and why apoE might recycle in vivo. A mechanistic insight is provided by transferrin (35Jackle S. Runquist E.A. Miranda-Brady S. Havel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1396-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transferrin, a major serum glycoprotein that transports iron into cells, binds to its receptor and is internalized in coated vesicles. Once in the endosome, the reduction in pH provokes the dissociation of iron from transferrin, but apotransferrin remains associated with its receptor and recycles back to the cell surface, thus escaping lysosomal degradation (36Dautry-Varsat A. Biochimie (Paris). 1986; 68: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). From the invagination of coated pits to the formation of endosomes, the pathway of receptor-mediated endocytosis is common to all ligands studied. However, the fate of the receptor-ligand complex is determined in the endosome depending on whether the ligand can remain associated with the receptor at acidic pH. Ligands such as asialoglycoprotein and LDL dissociate from their receptors and are then routed to the lysosomal compartment (37Goldstein J.L. Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 7th Ed. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 2. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1981-2030Google Scholar). It is possible that, like transferrin, apoE has the ability to remain associated with its receptor(s) at the acidic pH of the endosome and to recycle back to the cell surface. Although it is not known whether apoE-containing lipoproteins remain associated to their receptors at low pH, if binding affinity for a recycling receptor plays any role in ligand retroendocytosis, the fact that apoE binds to its membrane receptor with a 23-fold higher affinity than apoB (38Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Arnold K.S. Mahley R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2311-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) may explain the differential routing of lipoproteins entering the cell through one or the other receptor. It is evident from previous studies in our laboratory and other laboratories that only 10% of normal apoE levels is required to maintain cholesterol homeostasis under physiologic conditions when both the LDLR and the LRP are functioning normally (15Linton M.F. Atkinson J.B. Fazio S. Science. 1995; 267: 1034-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 39Boisvert W.A. Spangerberg J. Curtiss L.K. J. Clin.

In this situation, extrahepatic apoE will induce the clearance of lipoproteins without the need for the extra amount of ligand provided by the hepatic apoE secretion capture pathway (42Ji Z.-S. Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ji Z.-S. Brecht W.J. Miranda R.D. Hussain M.M. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol.

Invest. 1994; 93: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, in situations where the LDLR does not function properly, additional apoE may be required in the sinusoidal space of Disse to facilitate the clearance of the accumulating remnant lipoproteins (32Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Babaev V.R. Fazio S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1726-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). ApoE retroendocytosis may represent a mechanism to ensure increased availability of apoE in the hepatic sinusoid. Additionally, recycling of apoE or apoE-rich lipoproteins may serve as a chaperone for proper targeting and repositioning of recycling LRP or other receptors to the cell surface (45Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Because apoE is not structurally entangled within the lipoprotein particles, a system designed to reuse this functionally active molecule would be more efficient than simply targeting this ligand to the lysosomal compartment for proteolytic degradation."

This enzyme complex is composed of four α- and four β-subunits; the α-subunit harbors the enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase domains, whereas the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase domain is located on the β-subunit (3Kamijo T.

Additionally, the distance between the two loci is short, which suggests that the two genes exist side by side (8Aoyama T. Wakui K. Orii K.E. Hashimoto T. Fukushima Y. Cytogenet.

The most common phenotype is long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, with normal or near-normal activities of long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase and long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (10Wanders R.J.A.

The other phenotype is characterized by decreased activity of all three enzyme activities (12Jackson S. Kler R.S. Bartlrtt K. Briggs H. Bindoff L.A. Pourfarzam M. Gardner-Medwin D. Turnbull D.M. J.

Formation of the enzyme complex apparently requires the presence of a similar number of molecules of α- and β-subunits in mitochondria, which raises the possibility of a synchronized regulation of the expression of the both subunits. We isolated clones of the two genes, including their 5′ flanking regions, and characterized their structures and transcriptional regulation.DISCUSSIONWe obtained evidence that human HADHA andHADHB genes encoding subunits of the multienzyme complex TP exist side by side in a head-to-head arrangement on chromosome 2p23. The multienzyme complex of fatty acid β oxidation in various organisms has been identified. The complex consists of two subunits with high amino acid sequence homology to human TP (3Kamijo T.

In prokaryotes, two genes for the enzyme complex fadA and B inEscherichia coli and faoA and B inPseudomonas fragi, which are multienzyme complexes similar to human TP, are tandemly arranged on the bacterial operon (9Sato S.

Head-to-head arrangement of human TP genes differs from these cases and may have occurred by gene inversion with during processes of evolution. The structure of the HADHA and HADHB locus is unique.The intergenic region between exons 1 of HADHA andHADHB has bidirectional promoter function regulated by transcription factor Sp1. The two Sp1 sites are critical for promoter expression of both genes, but they are not the minimal elements required for expression. Thus, this region probably functions as a common promoter of the two genes. In our foregoing reports, we stated that the association of both subunits is required for stabilization in mitochondria (14Ushikubo S. Aoyama T. Kamijo T. Wanders R.J.A. Rinaldo P. Vockley J.

The coordinated gene expression ofHADHA and HADHB, regulated by the common promoter, seems appropriate for the association and for subsequent stabilization. However, levels of individual subunit mRNA in organs are not always similar (3Kamijo T. Aoyama T. Miyazaki J. Hashimoto T. J. Biol.

Thus the expression of many genes at β oxidation of fatty acids seems to relate to Sp1.It was reported that induction of TP in rat liver by the administration of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, one of the peroxisome proliferators, was 10-fold (1Uchida Y. Izai K. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1034-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α null mice, it has just been reported that expression ofHADHA and HADHB genes in the liver is enhanced coordinately by administration of a potent hypolipidemic reagent, Wy-14,643, and that these enhancements are mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (33Aoyama T.

In our numerous experiments done to identify peroxisome proliferator responsive elements on both the HADHA and HADHB genes, we found no active element binding with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, at least in 15-kb regions sandwiching the common promoter region (data not shown). Thus, the mechanism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-dependent induction of HADHA andHADHB expression remains to be determined. Mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation is a major energy-producing pathway, and at least 10 different enzymes are involved in this function. A mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TP)1 catalyzes the last three steps of the β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids (1Uchida Y. Izai K. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1034-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Carpenter K. Pollitt R.J. Middleton B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26452-264609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme complex is composed of four α- and four β-subunits; the α-subunit harbors the enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase domains, whereas the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase domain is located on the β-subunit (3Kamijo T. Aoyama T. Miyazaki J. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26452-264609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two subunits are encoded in independent genes, HADHA and HADHB (3Kamijo T. Aoyama T. Miyazaki J. Hashimoto T. J. Biol.

Commun. 1994; 199: 818-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In humans, genomic organization of the α-subunit (HADHA) was determined by Zhang and Baldwin (5Zhang Q.X. Baldwin G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and that of the β-subunit (HADHB) was determined in our laboratories (6Orii K.E. Aoyama T. Wakui K. Fukushima Y. Miyajima H. Yamaguchi S. Orii T. Kondo N. Hashimoto T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). BothHADHA and HADHB are located on chromosome 2p23 (6Orii K.E.

Hoovers J.M.N. Jakobs M.E. Wanders R.J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Additionally, the distance between the two loci is short, which suggests that the two genes exist side by side (8Aoyama T. Wakui K. Orii K.E. Hashimoto T. Fukushima Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1997; 79: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), as do the two genes of the subunits of the bacterial fatty acid β-oxidation multienzyme complex (9Sato S. Hayashi M. Imamura S. Ozeki Y. Kawaguchi A. J. Biochem. 1992; 111: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Deficiencies in this enzyme complex can cause sudden, unexplained death in children, acute hepatic encephalopathy, skeletal myopathy, and cardiomyopathy (10Wanders R.J.A. Duran M.

Wanders R.J.A. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1994; 153: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). TP deficiency was classified into two biochemical phenotypes. The most common phenotype is long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, with normal or near-normal activities of long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase and long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (10Wanders R.J.A.

IJlst L. Wanders R.J.A. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1994; 153: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The other phenotype is characterized by decreased activity of all three enzyme activities (12Jackson S. Kler R.S. Bartlrtt K. Briggs H. Bindoff L.A. Pourfarzam M. Gardner-Medwin D. Turnbull D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1219-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 13Kamijo T. Wanders R.J.A. Saudubray J.-M. Aoyama T. Komiyama A. Hashimoto J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1740-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These analyses showed that formation of the enzyme complex is important for related functions (14Ushikubo S. Aoyama T. Kamijo T. Wanders R.J.A. Rinaldo P. Vockley J. Hashimoto T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 979-988PubMed Google Scholar, 15Orii K.E. Aoyama T. Souri M. Jiang L.L. Hayashi S. Orii K.O. Yamaguchi S. Orii T. Kondo N. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Formation of the enzyme complex apparently requires the presence of a similar number of molecules of α- and β-subunits in mitochondria, which raises the possibility of a synchronized regulation of the expression of the both subunits. We isolated clones of the two genes, including their 5′ flanking regions, and characterized their structures and transcriptional regulation. DISCUSSIONWe obtained evidence that human HADHA andHADHB genes encoding subunits of the multienzyme complex TP exist side by side in a head-to-head arrangement on chromosome 2p23. The multienzyme complex of fatty acid β oxidation in various organisms has been identified. The complex consists of two subunits with high amino acid sequence homology to human TP (3Kamijo T. Aoyama T. Miyazaki J. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26452-264609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20DiRusso C.C. J.

In prokaryotes, two genes for the enzyme complex fadA and B inEscherichia coli and faoA and B inPseudomonas fragi, which are multienzyme complexes similar to human TP, are tandemly arranged on the bacterial operon (9Sato S. Hayashi M. Imamura S. Ozeki Y. Kawaguchi A. J. Biochem. 1992; 111: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20DiRusso C.C. J.

Head-to-head arrangement of human TP genes differs from these cases and may have occurred by gene inversion with during processes of evolution. The structure of the HADHA and HADHB locus is unique.The intergenic region between exons 1 of HADHA andHADHB has bidirectional promoter function regulated by transcription factor Sp1. The two Sp1 sites are critical for promoter expression of both genes, but they are not the minimal elements required for expression. Thus, this region probably functions as a common promoter of the two genes. In our foregoing reports, we stated that the association of both subunits is required for stabilization in mitochondria (14Ushikubo S. Aoyama T. Kamijo T. Wanders R.J.A. Rinaldo P. Vockley J. Hashimoto T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 979-988PubMed Google Scholar, 15Orii K.E. Aoyama T. Souri M. Jiang L.L. Hayashi S. Orii K.O. Yamaguchi S. Orii T. Kondo N. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The coordinated gene expression ofHADHA and HADHB, regulated by the common promoter, seems appropriate for the association and for subsequent stabilization. However, levels of individual subunit mRNA in organs are not always similar (3Kamijo T. Aoyama T. Miyazaki J. Hashimoto T. J. Biol.

Therefore, other regions and/or other transcription factors may be involved in regulating the cell type-specific expression of the two genes.Promoters having bidirectional functions have been identified in surf-1 and surf-2 of the surfeit locus (22Lennard A.C.

https://openalex.org/W2003271682,"The eukaryotic subtilisin-like endoprotease furin is found predominantly in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and cycles between this compartment, the cell surface, and the endosomes. There is experimental evidence for endocytosis from the plasma membrane and transport from endosomes to the TGN, but direct exit from the TGN to endosomes via clathrin-coated vesicles has only been discussed but not directly shown so far. Here we present data showing that expression of furin promotes the first step of clathrin-coat assembly at the TGN, the recruitment of the Golgi-specific assembly protein AP-1 on Golgi membranes. Further, we report that furin indeed is present in isolated clathrin-coated vesicles. Packaging into clathrin-coated vesicles requires signal components in the furin cytoplasmic domain which can be recognized by AP-1 assembly proteins. We found that besides depending on the phosphorylation state of a casein kinase II site, interaction of the furin tail with AP-1 and its μ1subunit is mediated by a tyrosine motif and to less extent by a leucine-isoleucine signal, whereas a monophenylalanine motif is only involved in binding to the intact AP-1 complex. This study implies that high affinity interaction of AP-1 or μ1 with the cytoplasmic tail of furin needs a complex interplay of signal components rather than one distinct signal.

Here we present data showing that expression of furin promotes the first step of clathrin-coat assembly at the TGN, the recruitment of the Golgi-specific assembly protein AP-1 on Golgi membranes. Further, we report that furin indeed is present in isolated clathrin-coated vesicles. Packaging into clathrin-coated vesicles requires signal components in the furin cytoplasmic domain which can be recognized by AP-1 assembly proteins. We found that besides depending on the phosphorylation state of a casein kinase II site, interaction of the furin tail with AP-1 and its μ1subunit is mediated by a tyrosine motif and to less extent by a leucine-isoleucine signal, whereas a monophenylalanine motif is only involved in binding to the intact AP-1 complex. This study implies that high affinity interaction of AP-1 or μ1 with the cytoplasmic tail of furin needs a complex interplay of signal components rather than one distinct signal. trans-Golgi network mannose-6-phosphate receptor(s) clathrin-coated vesicle(s) assembly proteins(s) casein kinase II phosphofurin acidic cluster-sorting protein-1 phosphate-buffered saline glutathione S-transferase 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis wild type GST-furin fusion proteins The trans-Golgi network (TGN)1 constitutes the sorting station where soluble and membrane proteins, targeted to different post-Golgi compartments, are packed into distinct carrier vesicles. Three TGN exit routes are known: constitutive transport to the cell surface, transport to secretory granules in cells with a regulated secretory pathway, and transport to endosomes (for review, see Ref. 1Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The last pathway is followed primarily by lysosomal enzymes bound to the mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) by their mannose 6-phosphate residues (for review, see Ref. 2Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Vesicles leaving the TGN for subsequent transport to the endosomes are clathrin-coated. Formation of these clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) involves binding of AP-1 Golgi-specific assembly proteins to the TGN membrane. AP-1 binding is regulated by the ADP-ribosylation factor ARF-1, a small GTP-binding protein (3Stammes M.A. Rothman J.

CCVs are transport intermediates of vesicular traffic not only from the TGN to endosomes, but also from the plasma membrane to endosomes. Golgi- and plasma membrane-derived CCVs can be distinguished by their different sets of assembly proteins; AP-1 complexes are restricted to coated buds and vesicles of the TGN, whereas AP-2 complexes act in endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Both adaptor complexes are heterotetrameric. The AP-1 complex is composed of two 100-kDa subunits, γ and β1 adaptin, a medium subunit μ1 (47 kDa), and a small subunit ς1 (19 kDa). The AP-2 complex is of similar size and composition with two large subunits, α and β2 adaptin (100 kDa), in association with a μ2 (50 kDa) and a ς2 subunit (17 kDa) (for review, see Ref. 8Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). A major function of both adaptor complexes is to promote clathrin cage assembly onto the respective membrane via their β subunits (9Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20089-20093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second important function of AP-1 and AP-2 is the binding to cytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins (for review, see Ref. 10Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin.

Furin is a membrane-associated, subtilisin-like eukaryotic endoprotease that proteolytically cleaves a large number of proproteins C-terminally at the consensus sequence RXK/RR. Among these substrates are membrane-bound and secretory proteins such as prohormones, proproteins of receptors, plasma proteins, growth factors, and also bacterial toxins and many surface glycoproteins of enveloped viruses (27; for review, see Refs. 28Steiner D.F.

J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Furin is concentrated in the TGN and cycles between this compartment, the plasma membrane, and endosomes. The responsible routing and TGN localization signals reside in the cytoplasmic domain of furin (30Chapman R.E. Munro S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 31Bosshart H. Humphrey J. Deignan E. Davidson J. Drazba J. Yuan L. Oorschot V. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J.

The sorting signals include the tyrosine-based signal YKGL765, which mediates endocytosis, and an acidic cluster CPSDSEEDEG783, which is required for TGN localization (33Schäfer W. Stroh A.

Deletion analysis and mutagenesis of the furin tail revealed a leucine-isoleucine (LI760) sorting signal and a critical phenylalanine (F790), which separately mediate internalization of chimeric furin proteins. 2A. Stroh, W. Schäfer, S. Berghöfer, M. Eickmann, M. Teuchert, I. Bürger, H.-D. Klenk, and W. Garten (1999) Eur. J. Cell Biol., in press. The two serine residues of the acidic cluster are phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII) in vivo and in vitro. Phosphorylation is assumed to regulate trafficking of furin in endosomes (35Jones B.G. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Thulin C.D. Fry M.D. Walsh K.A. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5869-5883Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 36Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Banno T. Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol.

Recently, a cytosolic connector protein, PACS-1 (phosphofurin acidic cluster-sorting proteins), was identified, which directs transport of furin from the endosomes back to the TGN by binding to the phosphorylated acidic cluster and connecting the endoprotease to the clathrin sorting machinery (38Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas S. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In the regulated secretory pathway of neuroendocrine cells, retrieval of furin from clathrin-coated immature secretory granules depends on the interaction of AP-1 with CKII-phosphorylated furin tail (39Dittié A.S. Thomas L. Thomas G. Tooze S.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4859-4870Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the routing of furin at the exit of the TGN and especially the motifs required at this sorting station are not well understood. In this study we show that furin is able to promote AP-1 recruitment, the first step of clathrin coat assembly at the TGN, and that furin is present in isolated CCVs. Usingin vitro binding and peptide competition assays, we have examined in detail the interaction of the furin cytoplasmic tail sorting signals with the μ1 subunit and the whole AP-1 complex. A cDNA fragment coding for the furin tail (amino acids 741–797) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pSG5:bfur (33Schäfer W. Stroh A. Berghöfer S. Seiler J. Vey M. Kruse M.-L. Kern H.F. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2424-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and ligated into the EcoRI-HindIII sites of the Escherichia coli expression vector pMALTM-c2 (New England Biolabs, Germany). The plasmid was transfected into theE. coli TB1 strain. The furin tail containing the maltose-binding protein was purified by affinity chromatography according to the protocol provided by Biolabs (Germany), dialyzed against PBS, and used in 200-μg portions for the immunization of rabbits by four injections at 4-week intervals. The serum was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. The μ1 subunit of TGN adaptor AP-1 (AP47) was cloned by polymerase chain reaction from human lung λgt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH, USA). The primers were derived from the mouse sequence (M62419) (40Nakayama Y. Goebl M. O'Brine G.B. Lemon S. Pingchang C.E. Kirchhausen T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar): forward primer, 5′-CCTTCCAAAGCCGCCATGTCCGCCAGCGCCGTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAGAGGCCTCTCACTGGGTCCGGAGCTGATAATC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was ligated in the TA vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain method using the ABI PRISMTM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin-Elmer). After excision byEcoRI, the cDNA of the μ1chain was inserted into the multiple cloning site of pBluescript vector (Stratagene). For generation of the different furin tail mutants the pSG5:bfur construct, described by Schäfer et al. (33Schäfer W. Stroh A. Berghöfer S. Seiler J. Vey M. Kruse M.-L. Kern H.F. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2424-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), was used. Substitutions in the cytoplasmic tail were introduced by a polymerase chain reaction-based approach using pSG5:bfur as a cDNA template and synthetic oligonucleotides that contained the desired mutations within their sequence. Generation of the deletion mutants was done as described by Schäfer et al. (33Schäfer W. Stroh A. Berghöfer S. Seiler J. Vey M. Kruse M.-L. Kern H.F. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2424-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The sequences of all of the tail mutants were verified by dideoxy sequencing. The cDNA coding for the cytoplasmic domains of wild type furin and furin tail mutants was ligated in-frame to the COOH terminus of GST using the pGEX-5X-1 vector (Pharmacia, Germany). The fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21, and protein purification was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia, Germany). Bovine brain cytosol was prepared as described (41Campbell C. Squicciarini J. Shia M. Pilch P.F. Fine R.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4420-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine brains were homogenized in buffer A (0.1 m MES, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.0) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.2 mmdithiothreitol. Nuclei, membranes, and other sedimental components were removed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 130,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the cytosol supernatant was determined by protein assay (Pierce Chemical Co.) using BSA as a standard. CCVs were isolated from MPR-deficient mouse fibroblasts (42Ludwig T. Munier-Lehmann H. Bauer U. Hollinshead M. Ovitt C. Lobel P. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3430-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) stably expressing furin by a standard procedure (43Woodman P.G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After three washes with PBS containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-Ca/Mg), cells were scraped and spun for 10 min at 2,000 × g. The cells were resuspended in vesicle buffer (140 mmsucrose, 75 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm MES, pH 6.7, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) and homogenized. From a postnuclear supernatant, a postmitochondrial supernatant was prepared, which was fractionated by two gradient centrifugations using a 10-ml continuous gradient of 10–90% (w/v) 2H2O (Sigma) in vesicle buffer and then a 10-ml continuous gradient from 2% (w/v) Ficoll, 9% (w/v)2H2O to 20% Ficoll, 90%2H2O in vesicle buffer. After centrifugation of the second gradient to equilibrium, 1-ml fractions were collected from the bottom, and aliquots of each fraction were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration) for Western blotting analysis. The bovine furin subcloned into the pSG5 vector was stably expressed in MPR-negative fibroblasts as described (18Mauxion F. Le Borgne R. Munier-Lehmann H. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2171-2178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, a calcium phosphate precipitate was made containing 20 μg of the linearized vector and 1 μg of pBhygr, a plasmid containing the hygromycin resistance gene. The cells were incubated with the precipitate for 24 h, split, and plated in the presence of 350 μg/ml hygromycin B (Boehringer Mannheim). After 12–14 days of selection, colonies were picked, expended, and tested for expression of furin by immunofluorescence. HeLa cells or immortalized MPR-deficient mouse fibroblasts (42Ludwig T. Munier-Lehmann H. Bauer U. Hollinshead M. Ovitt C. Lobel P. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3430-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and MPR-deficient mouse fibroblasts stably expressing bovine furin were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. For transient expression, HeLa cells were transfected with pSG5:bfur constructs by the calcium phosphate method (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). At 7 h post-transfection protein expression was stimulated by the addition of sodium butyrate (5 mm final concentration) to the culture medium. The in vitrobinding of AP-1 was performed as described (5Le Borgne R. Schmidt A. Mauxion F. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22552-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Le Borgne R. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). MPR-negative mouse fibroblasts stably expressing furin and MPR-negative mouse fibroblasts as control cells were cocultured on coverslips for 24 h to 90% confluence. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS-Ca/Mg and KOAc buffer (25 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.0, 111.5 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm MgCl2), permeabilized by immersion in ice-cold KOAc buffer containing 40 μg/ml digitonin for 4 min, and then washed twice with cold KOAc buffer again. For AP-1 binding the permeabilized cells were incubated with 200 μl of bovine brain cytosol (9 mg of protein/ml in KOAc buffer) at 37 °C for 10 min and replaced on ice for two washes with cold KOAc buffer. Then the cells were subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. Furin-transfected HeLa cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and then quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS. For permeabilization, cells were rinsed with 0.2% saponin (Sigma) that was dissolved in PBS and then incubated with a furin-specific antiserum from rabbit directed against the cytoplasmic tail (diluted 1:1,000) and γ adaptin-specific monoclonal antibody 100/3 (diluted 1:100) (Sigma) diluted in PBS containing 0.2% saponin and 1% BSA. The primary antibodies were detected by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody from goat and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody from goat (Dianova, Germany), both diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 1% BSA. Finally, the cells were mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst, Germany) and 10% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. MPR-deficient mouse fibroblasts were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS, and then incubated with primary and secondary antibodies, diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA, as described for HeLa cells. The intensity of the perinuclear γ adaptin fluorescence signal was quantitated on the single cell level. Digitized images were recorded using a laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) working with the blue line (408 nm wavelength) of an argon laser. For each sample, images of about 100 furin-expressing cells and as control a similar number of furin negative cells were recorded and saved as TIFF files. The intensity of perinuclear staining for γ adaptin was quantitated using the PC BAS software (Raytest, Germany). The μ1 chain was translatedin vitro in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine (Amersham, Germany) using the pBluescript μ1 DNA as template and a coupled in vitro transcription translation kit (Promega). In vitro translated samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) loaded with 30 μg of wild type or mutated GST-furin fusion protein were incubated with or without CKII (25 units/μl) (Biolabs, Germany) and 2 mm ATP in 30 μl of CKII buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) for 1 h at 30 °C. Then precleared in vitrotranslated μ1 was added followed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C in 500 μl of binding buffer (0.05% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 10% glycerol, 0.1% BSA, 200 mm NaCl). Sample buffer was added to washed beads, and the eluted material was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The radiolabeled bands were detected by fluorography. Quantitation was done by using a BioImager (Raytest, Germany). For binding of AP-1 to immobilized furin tails 30 μg of GST-furin fusion protein were adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose 4B and incubated with or without CKII as described above. The immobilized fusion proteins were suspended in 400 μl of bovine brain cytosol (6 mg of protein/ ml in buffer A) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were washed three times with cold buffer A (see above) and then resuspended in sample buffer. The bound material was separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with γ adaptin-specific monoclonal antibodies. Oligopeptides homologous to the furin tail were synthesized by using an ABI 432A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). In vitro translated,35S-labeled μ1 chain was preincubated in 100 μl of binding buffer in the presence or absence of peptides for 15 min on ice. Then immobilized GST-furin fusion protein was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. For AP-1 competition, 100 μl of bovine brain cytosol (1 mg of protein/ml in buffer A) was preincubated with or without peptides for 15 min on ice followed by incubation with immobilized GST-furin fusion protein for 1 h at 4 °C. Detection of bound AP-1 or μ1 was done as described above. Electrophoretic transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes was done by standard procedure (46Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). Incubations with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 were performed for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse antibody from rabbit (Dako, Denmark), and the secondary antibodies were detected using the Super Signal system (Pierce). When blots were probed sequentially with different antibodies, the membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C after each immunodetection. Quantitation of the signals was done with a BioImager. The primary antibodies were: anti-γ adaptin monoclonal antibody against mouse γ adaptin, anti-α adaptin monoclonal antibody generated from mouse αA adaptin, anti-clathrin heavy chain monoclonal antibody generated from rat clathrin H. C. (Transduction Laboratories), anti-γ adaptin monoclonal antibody 100/3 against AP-1 adaptor from bovine brain, anti-β-COP monoclonal antibody (Sigma), and mon139 monoclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of furin (a kind gift from Dr. J. Creemers, Leuven). Proteins like the MPRs, which are transported from the TGN to the endosomes via CCVs, have been shown to promote AP-1 recruitment onto Golgi membranes (5Le Borgne R. Schmidt A.

To prove sorting of furin along the TGN/endosomal pathway we investigated first whether furin also promotes AP-1 translocation. For this purpose, wild type furin (wt) and furin tail mutants lacking the tyrosine-motif (dYKGL) or the cytoplasmic domain (d743–797) or one that contains a nonphosphorylatable acidic signal (S776A/S778A) (Fig.1 A) were expressed in HeLa cells. To discriminate adaptin recruited by furin from adaptin recruited by other Golgi resident proteins, furin expression was stimulated by the addition of sodium butyrate. Then the cells were double labeled with a polyclonal anti-furin antibody to discriminate transfected from nontransfected cells, and with a monoclonal antibody directed against γ adaptin to identify the AP-1 complex. Quantitation of AP-1 recruitment by measuring the fluorescence associated with the Golgi region (Fig. 1 C) and qualitative analysis of AP-1 recruitment (Fig. 1 B, a–h) have shown that overexpression of wild type furin correlates with an increase of γ adaptin staining in the perinuclear region. Cells expressing the furin mutants dYKGL and S776A/S778A show only a slight increase in a perinuclear γ adaptin signal, whereas the tail-less furin mutant (d743–797), which was also found partly in the perinuclear region because of its overexpression, remains without any significant effect on adaptin binding. As a control, highly expressed influenza virus hemagglutinin, a protein known to follow the constitutive secretory pathway toward the plasma membrane, showed no specific increase in the perinuclear γ adaptin signal (data not shown). In a second assay we investigated recruitment of AP-1 by furin at a lower and thus more physiological level of furin expression. We took advantage of the MPR-negative fibroblasts generated and described by Ludwig et al. (42Ludwig T. Munier-Lehmann H. Bauer U. Hollinshead M. Ovitt C. Lobel P. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3430-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These cells exhibit a low capacity for recruiting AP-1, which can be restored by reexpressing physiological levels of the MPRs (6Le Borgne R. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2162-2170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). MPR-deficient mouse fibroblasts stably expressing furin and MPR-deficient mouse fibroblasts as control were cocultured, permeabilized with digitonin, and incubated with bovine brain cytosol. Recruitment of bovine AP-1 was examined by indirect immunofluorescence using a polyclonal anti-furin antibody and monoclonal antibody 100/3 against γ adaptin. As shown in Fig.2, cells expressing furin exhibit a markedly enhanced perinuclear γ adaptin signal compared with nontransfected fibroblasts (Fig. 2, a and b). When bovine brain cytosol was omitted from the incubation, no AP-1 was detected because the antibody does not recognize mouse adaptin (Fig. 2,c and d).

We investigated the role of the β-subunit in the membrane insertion and stability of the HKAα expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Individual membrane segments M1, M2, M3, M4, and M9 linked to a glycosylation reporter act as signal anchor (SA) motifs, and M10 acts as a partial stop transfer motif. In combined HKAα constructs, M2 acts as an efficient stop transfer sequence, and M3 acts as a SA sequence. However, M5 and M9 have only partial SA function, and M7 has no SA function. Consistent with the membrane insertion properties of segments in combined α constructs, M1–3 α-proteins are resistant to cellular degradation, and M1–5 up to M1–10 α-proteins are not resistant to cellular degradation. However, co-expression with β-subunits increases the membrane insertion of M9 in a M1–9 α-protein and completely protects M1–10 α-proteins against cellular degradation. Our results indicate that HKAα N-terminal (M1–M4) membrane insertion and stabilization are mediated by intrinsic molecular characteristics; however, the C-terminal (M5–M10) membrane insertion and thus the stabilization of the entire α-subunit depend on intramolecular and intermolecular β-subunit interactions that are similar but not identical to data obtained for the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit.

They are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by the signal recognition particle and interaction with the signal recognition particle receptor. A polar, transmembrane channel (the translocon) consisting of several subunits permits the passage of hydrophilic protein domains as well as the integration of hydrophobic membrane segments into the lipid bilayer (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Deber C.M. Goto N.K. von Heijne G. Membrane Protein Assembly. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997: 25-34Google Scholar, 2High S. Laird V.

It has been proposed that membrane proteins integrate into the membrane by a series of alternating signal anchor (SA)1 or stop transfer (ST) sequences. However, increasing evidence suggests that the acquisition of a correct membrane topology of polytopic membrane proteins is often more complicated and involves intermolecular interactions that require specific sequence determinants within or adjacent to the hydrophobic sequences. Furthermore, in oligomeric proteins, subunit assembly may play a role in the correct packing of polytopic proteins. We studied the in vivo membrane insertion of the polytopic α-subunit of H,K-ATPase which, in its mature form, is associated with the β-subunit, a type II membrane protein. Little is known as to how the assembly of the β-subunit may influence the membrane topology of transmembrane segments of the α-subunit. However, it is clear that association with the β-subunit is needed for the structural maturation of the α-subunit of oligomeric P-type ATPases such as H,K-ATPase (HKAα) and Na,K-ATPase (NKAα) because only β-subunit-assembled α-subunits become trypsin-resistant, are protected from cellular degradation, and become functionally active (4Chen P.-X.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). There is general agreement that the HKAα and NKAα have 10 transmembrane segments with the N and the C termini located at the cytoplasmic side in the mature β-associated enzyme (for reviews and references, see Refs. 6Bayle D. Weeks D. Hallen S. Melchers K. Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1997; 17: 29-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 7Karlish S.J.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

The hydropathy profile of the two enzymes is quite similar but differs significantly in the level of hydrophobicity in M7, M8, M9, and M10. Thus, M7, for example, has a lower hydrophobicity value in HKAα than in NKAα, and M9 has a higher hydrophobicity value in HKAα than in NKAα. An in vitro transcription/translation assay showed that the putative transmembrane segments M1, M2, M3, M4, and M9 of the gastric HKAα can act both as signal anchor (SA) and stop transfer (ST) sequences, M8 and M10 can act only as ST sequences, and M5, M6, and M7 have no membrane insertion properties (9Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is a gap of three known membrane-inserted sequences in a sequential folding model determined entirely by the hydrophobicity of the membrane segments. Similarly,in vitro translation assays of M5 and M6 of the Na,K- (10Xie Y. Morimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11985-11991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase α-subunits (11Bayle D. Weeks D. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25678-25684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have been unable to show efficient SA and ST properties of these segments. In vivo translation/insertion experiments in Xenopusoocytes showed that M5, M7, and M9 of NKAα exhibit partial SA function. In the mature enzyme, the β-subunit is closely associated with the extracellular loop immediately preceding M8 in both NKAα and HKAα, and the assembly of the β-subunit plays an important role in the correct packing of the C-terminal membrane domain in NKAα (12Béguin P. Hasler U. Beggah A. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24921-24931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The in vitro transcription/translation system may lack factors present in the intact cell, and it is difficult to study the effect of β-subunit association in the in vitro system. Therefore, we reassessed the SA or ST properties of the transmembrane sequences of HKAα after expressing them in Xenopus oocytes in the presence or absence of the β-subunit. As a test for membrane insertion, we assessed the presence or absence of glycosylation of chimera containing single or multiple transmembrane segments of α-subunits and the ectodomain of the β-subunit that contains several glycosylation sites. We also assessed the stability of the synthesized proteins by pulse-chase experiments. Whereas the three N-terminal membrane segments are efficiently and stably integrated into the membrane during synthesis, the C-terminal membrane segments do not conform to the sequential signal anchor-hydrophilic segment-stop transfer motif. Furthermore, association with the β-subunit plays a role in the correct packing of the C-terminal membrane domain and the stabilization of HKAα, as has also been observed in NKAα (12Béguin P. Hasler U. Beggah A. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24921-24931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the specific requirements for the proper folding of the C-terminal membrane domain are distinct in the two P-type ATPases. The rabbit gastric HKA chimera containing single or multiple putative transmembrane segments of the α-subunit (see Table I) and the 177 C-terminal amino acids of the rabbit HKA β-subunit were prepared as described previously (9Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but all constructs were subcloned into the pSD5 vector containing a modifiedXenopus 5′-untranslated region, which improves the translation of foreign cRNA in Xenopus oocytes as described previously (13Béguin P. Peitsch M.C. Geering K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14098-14108Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Table IDescription of α constructs and summary of results Open table in a new tab For the preparation of truncated α constructs lacking the HKAβ ectodomain, we introduced the modified Xenopus5′-untranslated region into the original pGEM7zf+ chimeric M1 construct (e.g. containing the cDNA sequence for the first 139 amino acids of the α-subunit ending in the extracellular loop following M1 and for the ectodomain of the HKA β-subunit; Ref. 9Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by using appropriate restriction sites. By polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis, we then introduced a stop codon at the junction between the α and the β sequence upstream of the artificialBglII/HindIII linker. The variable domains containing the putative transmembrane segments were excised from the chimeric constructs by BglII and HindIII digestion and introduced into the BglII/HindIII linker of this new vector. Finally, the constructs were subcloned from the pGEM7zf+ vector to the pSD5 vector using EcoRI restriction sites. All constructs generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification were sequenced by dideoxy sequencing. Stage V–VI oocytes were obtained from Xenopus laevis females (Noordhoek) as described previously (5Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In vitro synthesized RNA (cRNA) was prepared as described by Melton et al. (14Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4042) Google Scholar). Routinely, 8–10 ng of mutant HKAα cRNA and/or 2 ng of rabbit gastric HKAβ cRNA were injected into oocytes. Oocytes were metabolically labeled with 0.6 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (Hartmann Analytic) for 24 h and, in some instances, subjected to a 48-h chase period. Microsomal fractions were prepared, and the pellets were taken up in 0.5% digitonin and subjected to immunoprecipitation under nondenaturating conditions (5Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with polyclonal antibodies that recognize the α- and β-subunits of HKA (15Claeys D. Saraga E. Rossier B.C. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1136-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (Calbiochem) treatment was performed as described previously (16Jaunin P. Jaisser F. Beggah A.T. Takeyasu K. Mangeat P. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on the immunoprecipitated proteins without or with Endo H treatment, and the protein pattern was quantified by densitometry with a LKB 2202 Ultrascan. To follow the topogenic properties of membrane segments of HKAα synthesized in vivo, we used the reporter glycosylation scanning approach. This method has been used successfully for topological mapping of several polytopic membrane proteins (6Bayle D. Weeks D. Hallen S. Melchers K. Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1997; 17: 29-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 17Singh P. Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Hong W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6435-6441Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,18Wahle S. Stoffel W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The presence or absence of glycosylation of a C-terminal, topographically neutral reporter sequence indicates whether a translated sequence ends on the luminal or the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, if one assumes that all membrane-inserted protein is glycosylated. Glycosylation of putative membrane-spanning sequences containing the last 177 amino acids of the HKA β-subunit at their C terminus including five glycosylation sites was assessed after their expression in Xenopus oocytes by cRNA injection, radioactive labeling, and immunoprecipitation. Endo H that specifically cleavesN-linked high mannose core sugars was used to distinguish glycosylated protein species from nonglycosylated protein species to confirm the origin of the shift in the protein migration on SDS polyacrylamide gels. Fig. 1 shows the Endo H sensitivity of several membrane-spanning sequences of HKAα (summarized in TableI) expressed in Xenopusoocytes after cRNA injection and labeled for 24 h with [35S]methionine. M1 (lanes 1 and2), M2 (lanes 3 and 4), M3 (lanes 7 and 8), M4 (lanes 9 and10), and M9 (lanes 11 and 12), which were synthesized in vivo from cRNAs that are preceded by the first 101 amino acids (cytoplasmic N terminus) of rabbit gastric HKAα, were all efficient SA sequences that were Endo H-sensitive due to the glycosylation of the total protein population. In the oocyte, asin vitro (9Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glycosylation of M2 was prevented when it was preceded by M1 (M1/2,lanes 5 and 6), indicating that in this construct, M2 acts as a ST sequence, and the first membrane loop is firmly anchored in the membrane. A set of larger constructs (Table I) was used to test whether and how naturally preceding membrane-spanning segments influence the orientation of C-terminal membrane sequences. The total population of a M1–3 translation product was Endo H-sensitive (Fig.2 B, lanes 1 and 2), showing that M3 also acts as an efficient SA sequence when preceded by the membrane-integrated M1/2 pair. M4, which acts as an efficient SA sequence when synthesized alone (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and10), became partially but not entirely protected from glycosylation when preceded by M1–3. Also, the M1–4 protein showed aberrant migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a lower molecular mass than the M1–3 protein (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and4), as noted previously in vitro (9Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that M5, M6, and M7 following the large cytoplasmic loop had neither SA nor ST function in an in vitrotranslation system led to the conclusion that M5–M7 must be inserted into the membrane by a different mechanism than the other seven transmembrane segments (9Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One possibility that was considered was the insertion of this region in an already folded state into a membrane domain that included M1–M4 and M9–M10. However, when synthesized inXenopus oocytes, about 40–45% of the total HKA M1–5 population was glycosylated (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and6), suggesting that HKA M5 has some intrinsic SA functionin vivo. The addition of M6 (M1–6) completely prevented glycosylation (lanes 7 and 8), indicating that M6 can form a pair with M5 that may be membrane-bound or retained in the cytoplasm. In combined HKAα constructs, M9 of gastric HKAα displays SA function and M7 does not display SA function when synthesized in vitro and in vivo in intact cells. When synthesized in the oocyte, HKA M1–7 and M1–8 proteins were Endo H-resistant and thus were not glycosylated (lanes 9 and 10), whereas 40–45% of the total M1–9 population was Endo H-sensitive and glycosylated (lanes 13 and 14). Individual M10, which was devoid of SA activity in vitro(9Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), became partially glycosylated when expressed in the oocyte (Fig.1, lanes 13 and 14). Thus, in vivo, M10 can adopt a Nout-Ccyt as well as a Ncyt-Cout orientation. Although M10 added to M1 could not act as a ST sequence in intact cells (Fig. 1, lanes 15 and 16), it completely prevented glycosylation when added to M1–9 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 15 and 16,M1–10), indicating that M10 can form a pair with M9 that is either retained in the cytoplasm or membrane-bound. The results shown in Fig. 2 are also summarized in Table I. The differences in the membrane insertion efficiency of certain membrane segments of HKAα synthesized in vitro or in intact cells cannot be easily explained. It is possible that due to the longer synthesis time allowed in intact cells compared with that used in in vitro translations, a steady-state level of folding and membrane insertion of certain membrane segments can only be achieved in the former and not in the latter translation system. In this context, however, it is interesting to note that P-glycoprotein synthesized in two different in vitro translation systems adopts a different topography, possibly due to the presence or absence of certain soluble cytoplasmic factors (19Zhang J.T. Ling V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9159-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Whatever might be responsible for the subtle differences between the in vivoand in vitro systems does not change the main conclusions that can be drawn from the reporter glycosylation scanning assays. The results obtained in both systems indicate that the formation of N-terminal and C-terminal membrane pairs in HKAα is governed by different mechanisms: the former is governed by sequential signal anchor and stop transfer mechanisms, and the latter is governed by more complicated interactions. We tested the role of β-subunit interactions on the correct packing of the C-terminal membrane domain of HKAα. A domain that interacts with the β-subunit has been identified in the extracellular loop just before M8 in the α-subunit of both H,K-ATPase (20Shin J.M. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8642-8646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Melle-Milovanovic D. Milovanovic M. Nagpal S. Sachs G. Shin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Na,K-ATPase (22Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The effect of β-subunit assembly on the membrane insertion of HKAα was determined by the co-expression of HKAβ with HKA M1–7–M1–10 α-proteins. Endo H sensitivity and thus the apparent topography of HKA M1–7, M1–8, or M1–10 α-proteins were similar when they were expressed alone or together with β-subunits (compare Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–4, 7, and 8 with Fig. 2 A, lanes 9–12, 15, and16) showing an absence of glycosylation. In contrast, the M1–9 protein consistently showed a change in the ratio between glycosylated, Endo H-sensitive and nonglycosylated, Endo H-resistant species when it was expressed with β-subunits. The percentage of glycosylated species increased from 40–45% in M1–9 expressed alone to about 80–85% in M1–9 co-expressed with β-subunits (compare Fig.2 B, lanes 5 and 6 with Fig. 2 A, lanes 13 and 14; Table I). This result suggests that assembly with β-subunits increases the efficiency of membrane integration of M9 in the HKA M1–9 α-protein. To further analyze the role of β-subunit assembly in the membrane integration of the HKAα, we determined the resistance against cellular degradation of various HKAα constructs synthesized in the absence or presence of β-subunits, an indicator of correct folding of polytopic integral membrane proteins. To test the stability of HKAα proteins synthesized in the presence or absence of β-subunits, we prepared truncated HKAα constructs lacking the glycosylation reporter sequence because we have previously observed that the glycosylation reporter sequence itself can destabilize chimeric NKAα constructs when it is exposed to the cytoplasm (12Béguin P. Hasler U. Beggah A. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24921-24931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), leading to cellular degradation. Fig.3 A shows pulse-chase experiments performed in oocytes expressing truncated HKA M1–3–M1–10 α-proteins in the absence of β-subunits. M1–3 proteins were completely resistant to cellular degradation (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 2), consistent with the efficient membrane insertion of this construct observed in the reporter glycosylation scanning assay. M1–4 constructs produced two different protein populations. One of the proteins had a lower molecular mass than the M1–3 protein and likely corresponds to the aberrantly migrating M1–4 protein that shows an inefficient ST activity in the reporter glycosylation scanning assay (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and4). This protein population was significantly degraded during a 48-h chase period (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and4). The second protein population synthesized from the M1–4 construct exhibited the expected molecular mass, which was greater than that of the M1–3 protein, and it was relatively resistant to cellular degradation (lanes 3 and 4). This result indicates that the particular M1–4 construct used in this study is indeed able to form an α-protein population in vivo that corresponds to a stably inserted M1–4 membrane domain. It is possible that the removal of the hydrophilic glycosylation reporter sequence favors the ST function of M4 in this particular construct. All other truncated HKAα proteins comprising C-terminal membrane segments up to M10 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5–16) synthesized in the absence of β-subunits were almost completely degraded during a 48-h chase, similar to the full-length α-subunit (lanes 17 and18). These results are consistent with the inefficient membrane insertion of M1–5–M1–10. Co-expression with the HKAβ had no effect on the stability of the HKA M1–7 α-proteins (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2) but partially protected the M1–8 (lanes 3 and 4) and M1–9 proteins (lanes 5 and 6) from cellular degradation. Furthermore, HKA M1–10 proteins (lanes 7 and8) were completely stabilized after co-expression with β-subunits, similar to the full-length HKAα (lanes 9 and10). These results confirm that association with the β-subunit is an important factor for correct membrane insertion and stabilization of the C-terminal membrane domain of the HKAα. The present study shows a membrane insertion process of HKAα that is characterized by major differences in the mechanisms that govern membrane integration of the four N-terminal and the six C-terminal membrane segments. The former segments act as alternate SA and ST sequences and are sequentially inserted into the membrane to form stable membrane pairs, whereas the latter segments need both intramolecular interactions and assembly with β-subunits for correct membrane packing and protection against cellular degradation. Full SA activity of HKAα M1 and M3 and an efficient ST activity of M2 were observed in vivo (this study) and in vitro(9Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which provide the basis for stable membrane integration of a domain comprising a M1/M2 pair and M3. This was also confirmed by the observation that M1–3 α-proteins are completely resistant to cellular degradation. On the other hand, the particular sequence used in this study for HKA M4 produced aberrant migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and degradation of part of the M1–4 protein population, and it had inefficient ST activity in vivo. This contrasts with the efficient ST activity observed in vitro(9Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result may indicate that pair formation of M3 and M4 in vivo is necessary but is not sufficient to determine the four-membrane segment topology of the HKAα N terminus in contrast to recent results obtained for NKAα synthesized in Xenopusoocytes (12Béguin P. Hasler U. Beggah A. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24921-24931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is more likely that M4 in the HKA M1–4 protein that ends at Leu-357 may be too short to assure its membrane retention as an efficient ST sequence. According to a current model (Ref. 8Moller J.V. Juul B. Lemaire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar; see Table I), HKA M4 would end at Ala-359; consequently, the M1–4 protein lacks two positively charged residues that follow the transmembrane domain and may be important for the ST properties of M4 in the HKA M1–4 protein synthesized in vivo. Positive charges following a membrane-inserted domain have been shown to be important for ST function (6Bayle D. Weeks D. Hallen S. Melchers K. Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1997; 17: 29-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, part of the HKA M1–4 α-protein population was able to adopt a relatively stable membrane-inserted conformation with a correct molecular mass, supporting the hypothesis that the N-terminal membrane domain of HKAα is formed by sequential insertion of the two membrane pairs M1/M2 and M3/M4, as in NKAα (12Béguin P. Hasler U. Beggah A. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24921-24931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). M5, M7, and M9, which should act as SA sequences according to the 10-transmembrane segment model, produced a mixture of glycosylated and nonglycosylated species in HKA M1–5 and M1–9 α-proteins and only nonglycosylated species in the M1–7 α-protein synthesized in vivo in the absence of β-subunits. Similar observations were made with NKAα, but the insertion efficiency of NKA M5, M7, and M9 differed from that of HKA membrane segments. The NKA M1–5 α-proteins produced only about 5% glycosylated species, but M1–7 and M1–9 produced about 50% glycosylated species (12Béguin P. Hasler U. Beggah A. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24921-24931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), perhaps due to the greater hydrophobicity of M7 in NKAα. Consistent with the poor membrane insertion properties, all α-proteins containing C-terminal membrane segments of both HKAα and NKAα (23Béguin P. Geering K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 540-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) were rapidly degraded during a chase period. Because we have recently shown that major domains of NKAα are not exposed to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum during synthesis (12Béguin P. Hasler U. Beggah A. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24921-24931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it is likely that unassembled α-subunits of P-type ATPases are degraded from the cytoplasmic side, as recently suggested for misfolded polytopic membrane proteins (24Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The degradation of the α-subunit, which is likely to start in the C-terminal domain and/or the central cytoplasmic loop, also destabilizes the intrinsically stable N-terminal domain and renders it susceptible to degradation because a proteolytic fragment corresponding to the N-terminal domain is never observed. The poor efficiency of membrane insertion and the associated instability of the C-terminal membrane domain likely reflect a distinct, low level of hydrophobicity of HKAα and NKAα M5, M7, and M9 that reduces interactions with nonpolar surfaces. In NKAα, the presence of proline, polar, and/or charged residues in NKA M5, M7, and M9 was shown to be responsible for the partial membrane insertion of these membrane segments (12Béguin P. Hasler U. Beggah A. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24921-24931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As a consequence of their moderate hydrophobicity, membrane insertion of M5, M7, and M9 of HKAα and NKAα must be mediated by other factors, for instance, interaction between membrane peptide segments in the translocon during translation. Such peptide-peptide interaction is consistent with the recently proposed two-dimensional crystal structure of the Ca-ATPase (25Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) that would place two or three membrane segments in a structure where their surfaces interact largely with other transmembrane segments, whereas the other segments face the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Furthermore, we show in this study and in previous studies of NKAα (12Béguin P. Hasler U. Beggah A. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24921-24931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Béguin P. Geering K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 540-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) that in oligomeric P-type ATPases, association with the β-subunit plays an important role in the stabilization of the moderately hydrophobic membrane pairs in the membrane. Co-expression of HKAα proteins with β-subunits had two major effects. On the one hand, it increased the efficiency of membrane insertion of M9 in a M1–9 α-protein, and on the other hand, it partially protected M1–8 and M1–9 α-proteins and completely protected M1–10 proteins against cellular degradation. Together with the observation that the interaction of the β-subunit with the region of the extracytoplasmic loop between M7 and M8 participates in the stable membrane insertion of the M7/M8 pair in the NKAα (12Béguin P. Hasler U. Beggah A. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24921-24931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), this result indicates that in hetero-oligomeric P-type ATPases, not only intramolecular but also intermolecular interactions between subunits participate in the correct packing of the C-terminal membrane domain of the α-subunits. Our data indicate that the precise role of β-subunit assembly and intramolecular interactions in the stable membrane insertion of HKAα and NKAα may vary, possibly due to the differences in the intrinsic SA and ST function of M7 and M10, respectively, in the two proteins. According to the reporter glycosylation scanning assay, HKA M7 in a HKA M1–7 α-protein has no visible SA function (Ref. 9Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and this study), but NKA M7 in a NKA M1–7 α-protein has partial SA function and produces 50% glycosylated forms (12Béguin P. Hasler U. Beggah A. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24921-24931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In both α-subunits, the addition of M8 produces only nonglycosylated forms. These observations suggest that in NKA M1–8 α-proteins, an equilibrium exists between membrane-inserted and cytoplasmic forms of the NKA M7/M8 pair, whereas in HKA M1–8 proteins, the equilibrium may be significantly shifted in favor of the cytoplasmic forms of the HKA M7/M8 pair, as illustrated in the model in Fig. 4. In consequence, the probability of β-subunit assembly with the extracellular loop between M7 and M8 in M1–8 proteins is smaller in HKAα than in NKAα. This may be reflected by the partial stabilization as compared with the complete stabilization of the HKA M1–8 and NKA M1–10 α-proteins, respectively, when they are co-expressed with β-subunits. The difference in the stabilizing effect of the β-subunit on HKA and NKA M1–8 α-proteins also indicates that M9/M10 pair formation has a distinct role in the correct folding of the HKAα and NKAα. In HKAα, co-expression with β-subunits favors membrane insertion of M9, but only M1–10 proteins are stabilized (Fig. 4). This infers that M9/M10 pair formation and probably its interaction with the M7/M8 pair are necessary for an efficient membrane insertion of HKA M7/M8 and consequently for an efficient β-assembly and stabilization of HKAα. On the other hand, in NKAα, β-assembly with the M7/M8 extracellular loop is sufficient to stabilize the entire α-subunit, although it restrains M9 membrane insertion (Fig. 4). In NKAα, the formation of the M9/M10 pair may only be possible due to the better ST function of NKA M10 as compared with that of HKA M10. In conclusion, in both HKAα and NKAα, the correct membrane integration of the N-terminal domain appears to be determined by the properties of the individual segments, whereas the insertion and stabilization of the C-terminal membrane domain depend on interactions with other membrane segments as well as on intermolecular association with the β-subunit. However, subtle differences exist between the two P-type ATPases in the fine control of the insertion process. We thank Dirk Claeys for providing the HKAα and HKAβ antibody.

After birth, expression greatly diminishes in those sites and shifts to expression in the stomach and proximal small intestine. Gastrin expression occurs in adenocarcinoma of the colon (3Van Solinge W.W. Nielsen F.C. Friis-Hansen L. Falkmer U.G. Rehfeld J.F.

Therefore, elucidation of transcriptional control mechanisms may provide insights into induction of oncofetal gene expression in neoplasia. Transgenic studies with rat-human gastrin gene hybrids demonstrate appropriate tissue-specific and developmental expression as long as the promoter contains proximal 5′-flanking sequence joined to the first exon (5Wang T.C.

Further studies have shown that gastrin transcriptional regulation is in large part mediated through trans-factor interactions along the proximal 5′-flanking sequence (5Wang T.C. Babyatsky M.W.

Systematic scanning mutagenesis of the proximal gastrin promoter suggests that the CACC element, located approximately 110 bp1 from the transcriptional start site, is necessary for promoter activity in rat insulinoma (8Chung D.C. Brand S.J. Tillotson L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8829-8836Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and human colon cancer cell lines (12Tillotson L. Chung D. Brand S. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104 (abstr.): 456Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the CACC element showed a close correlation between DNA binding by protein complexes and transcriptional activation of gastrin-luciferase reporter genes in insulinoma cell lines. Efforts to purify DNA-binding proteins by sequence-specific affinity chromatography (13Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) were successful, but the yield was too low for peptide sequencing (6Tillotson L.G. Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2234-2240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a different approach was followed by probing electrophoretic blots of insulinoma cell extracts with multimerized CACC element DNA probes. These Southwestern blots revealed several DNA-binding protein bands from 70–110 kDa in size (6Tillotson L.G. Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2234-2240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence specificity of the DNA binding was verified by probing with a multimerized analog of the CACC element containing two base mutations. The same mutations rendered a gastrin-luciferase reporter gene functionally inactive, and hence, when used as a southwestern probe, clearly differentiated specific from nonspecific binding. In the current study, a Southwestern binding approach was employed to screen a λ phage, insulinoma cDNA expression library for CACC-binding proteins. RIN 38A cell total RNA preparation and two rounds of poly(A) selection (oligo(dT)-cellulose spin column; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were accomplished by established methods (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.12-7.22Google Scholar). A λ gt11 cDNA library was then commercially prepared (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Subsequent screening of the library for CACC DNA binding employed the Southwestern blot method of Singh and co-workers (15Singh H. LeBowitz J.H. Baldwin A.S. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The unamplified library (106 plaque-forming units) was plated with Y1090 bacteria and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactoside-coated nitrocellulose filters for 6 h. Filters were then treated and probed as described previously (6Tillotson L.G. Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2234-2240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nick-translated, double-stranded DNA probes were prepared from concatamers of CACC element containing sequences (CCCCACCCCAT)6 (wild type minimal CACC element), (CCCCACCCCATTCCTCTCGCCTGGA)4 (wild type), and (CCACACCACATTCCTCTCGCCTGGA)4 (mutant gastrin promoter elements). After four rounds of plaque isolation, those phage positive for wild type binding and negative for the mutant probe were amplified and prepared (lambda kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Phage cDNA inserts were subcloned into pGem 7 vectors (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced by dideoxy sequencing methods (Sequenase; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subsequent rounds of library screening for cDNA fragments overlapping with clone 25A were accomplished by nucleic acid hybridization with nick-translated fragments ofEcoRI/SalI 25A and EcoRI/Bsu1 25B digests. Clone 25F had approximately 75% GC content, which necessitated sequencing by the Maxim-Gilbert chemical method (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.12-7.22Google Scholar). All cDNA fragments subcloned in pGEM 7 were sequenced along both sense and antisense strands to confirm the sequence information. Sequence formatting, assembly, and analysis were aided by MacVector and AssemblyLIGN programs (Oxford Molecular Group, PLC) and GenBank 228 (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Total RNA was prepared from fresh BALB/c rat tissues by established methods (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.12-7.22Google Scholar). Fetal rat tissues were obtained on approximately days 5–7 of gestation. cDNA transcripts were synthesized from a 20-μl reaction of 1 μg of total RNA in 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 5 mm MgCl2, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (RNasin, Promega), 25 units of M-murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and 20 pmol of a RIN ZF antisense primer, 5′-TGATCCCGTGATGAAGTCAGGCCATCTCTA (double underline, Fig. 2). After incubation at 42° for 1 h, the reaction was stopped by heating to 95 °C for 5 min. The reaction was diluted to 100 μl and the buffer adjusted to 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 20 pmol of a RIN ZF forward primer, 5′-GCGGTACTCCAATGATACTG (underline, Fig. 2) was added. The reaction was heated to 95 °C and cooled to 80 °C before 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase (AmpliTaq, Perkin-Elmer) was added to start the PCR reaction for a total of 35 cycles (94 °C/30 s, 60 °C/30 s, 72 °C/2 min). A 5′-truncated version of RIN ZFsv was developed by PCR amplification from clone 25C of a 962-bp fragment (bases 1181–2143) that was subsequently ligated into the SalI site of clone 25A-pGem 7. The recombinant product was then excised with BamHI digest and ligated into a pGex 2T bacterial expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-truncated RIN ZFsv, and GST-Elk were expressed in JM109 Escherichia coli by a modified bacterial expression method (17Suter-Crazzolara C. Unsicker K. Biotechniques. 1995; 19: 202-204PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, transformed bacteria were grown at 37 °C overnight on LB ampicillin (50 μg/ml) plates. The bacterial colonies were then suspended into LB broth (100 μg/ml ampicillin, 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-galactoside, 10 μmZnSO4) and incubated at 30 °C for 3 h (200 rpm shaking) before harvest and protein extraction. Extracts were prepared by sonication and purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity binding by well established methods (18Smith D.B. Corcoran L.M. Chanda V. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 16.7.1-16.7.7Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays were by previously described methods (6Tillotson L.G. Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2234-2240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length coding region and 3′-untranslated sequences of RIN ZF and RIN ZFsv were excised and ligated in-frame with a start codon into an actin promoter-driven expression vector, pPac (19Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The coding region and 3′-untranslated region for clone 25A, designated truncated RIN ZF (Fig. 5 A), was ligated in-frame with a start site into a pPac expression vector. Expression of all three versions was confirmed by in vitro transcription and translation (data not shown). Gastrin-luciferase reporter plasmids (6Tillotson L.G. Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2234-2240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) included one with a proximal gastrin promoter and another with a concatamer of the CACC element. The 200 Gas-Luc plasmid has 200 bp of 5′-flanking sequence and noncoding exon 1 of human gastrin ligated to the coding sequence for luciferase. The (CACC)6 pT81Luc plasmid has a 6-mer of CCCCACCCCAT oligonucleotide from the CACC element ligated to a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter and luciferase reporter gene. Drosophila SL2 cells were passaged in complete Schneider's media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 1 day before transfection. Plasmid preparations were by anionic exchange resin (Qiagen) and subsequent Ca3(PO4)2-mediated transfection into 6-well plates (35-mm wells) was by established methods (18Smith D.B. Corcoran L.M. Chanda V. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 16.7.1-16.7.7Google Scholar). Expression and reporter gene plasmids were cotransfected in equivalent amounts (0.5 μg/well), and cells were harvested for luciferase and Bradford protein assays (20Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) at 48 h post-transfection. Transfected wells were in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated four times for confirmation. A λ gt11 phage expression library was constructed from poly(A)-selected RNA obtained from RIN 38A cells, a rat insulinoma cell line. Previously, several DNA-binding proteins demonstrating sequence-specific binding to the CACC element in the gastrin promoter were detected in nuclear extracts from RIN 38A cells. Approximately 1 × 106 plaque-forming units of phage were screened by a Southwestern binding assay using a nick-translated-labeled six-copy concatamer of the human gastrin CACC element. Twelve positive clones were identified and subsequently screened with a mutated CACC concatamer probe to verify sequence specificity. Four true-positive CACC-binding phage isolates were then plaque-purified. After subcloning and sequencing the cDNA inserts, gene fragments homologous to rat Sp1 (accession number D12768) (20Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and closely homologous to mouse Pur-1 (95% identity, accession numberL04649) (21Kennedy G.C. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11498-11502Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and human SPR-2 (94% identity, accession number X68560) (22Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) were identified. All of the cDNA inserts identified in this assay for CACC binding possessed zinc finger domains of the Cys2-His2 type, including one, clone 25A, which otherwise had no close homology with known genes. The latter clone was chosen for further investigation. Clone 25A was fully sequenced and found to be 2082 bases long and had an open reading frame (ORF) from the 5′ end extending 1413 bases. Within the 25A ORF were two complete and one partial Cys2-His2 zinc finger domains. The subsequent screening, plaque purification, subcloning, and sequencing of cDNA fragments homologous to 25A is shown in schematic form in Fig.1. cDNA fragments 25B, C, D, and E were identified by screening for homology to the 5′-Sal fragment of 25A. Clones 25B and E were identical in their overlapping regions, as were 25C and D. However, the pairs differed from each other presumably by splice variation in an 87-base pair region that was not present in 25C and D. A 5′-Bsu fragment from 25B was then used to screen the library for the clone 25F. The overlapping sequences of 25F with 25B–E were identical. As shown in Fig.2, assembly of the overlapping 25A–F-cloned fragments yielded a cDNA sequence of 3850 bases. Analysis of the assembled cDNA sequence revealed a single long ORF from 674 to 3180 (Fig. 2). The ATG codon from base 674 is within a favorable context for initiation (23Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). This putative initiator codon has three upstream, in-frame terminator codons. Of the other three upstream ATG sequences present, all are out-of-frame and have a very weak context for initiation. The full-length ORF encodes a putative protein of 836 amino acids in length with a predicted molecular weight of 91 kDa. As previously noted, several of the cDNA sequences differed in the lack of an 87-base pair sequence shown in Fig. 2 in theboxed sequence. This apparent splice variation is located between bases 1457 and 1544, which is equivalent to a 29-codon difference. The exon donor and recipient half-sites conform with known splice site consensus motifs (24Mount S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar). The predicted molecular weight of the smaller splice variant is 89 kDa. The zinc finger motifs are of the Cys2-His2 type and are located near the COOH-terminal region. Two complete zinc finger domains and one partial domain are present and have the typical seven-codon HC connector sequences. However, these sequences are not similar to the Krüppel consensus motifs (25Bellefroid E. Lecocq P. Benhida A. Poncelet D. Belayew A. Martial J. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Gapped BLAST (V2.0) (16Altschul S. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E. Lipman D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar) sequence analysis of the RIN ZF DNA and its translated sequences did not find any matches or close homologies with known genes. To determine the expression of theRIN ZF genes, poly(A)-selected RNA from Rin 38A, Rin B6, and Rin 1056 cell lines were probed in Northern blot analysis. Only three weak bands were detected at approximately 2.0, 5.0, and 9.0 kb in size (data not shown). An RT-PCR approach was then employed to determine the tissue and developmental expression pattern of the RIN ZFgenes. Oligonucleotide primers flanking the putative splice sites were used in the RT-PCR assay shown in Fig. 3. Panels of adult and fetal rat RNA samples were screened and yielded the predicted PCR products of 791 and 704 bp in size. Both PCR products were isolated, subcloned, and sequenced, confirming their identity with the selected regions of the full-length and splice variant cDNA library clones. The RIN ZF gene appears to be ubiquitously expressed, having message present in all the fetal and adult rat tissues tested. Although both forms of RIN ZF were detected, the relative expression of each may be variable because this RT-PCR assay was not quantitative. RNA from RIN cell lines 38A, B2, B6, 1056C, rat fibroblast Rat2, myoblast L8, and pancreatic AR42J cell lines also yielded PCR products of 791 and 704 bp (data not shown). An expression vector for GST fusion-RIN ZF protein was developed by ligating an in-frame sequence of a truncated form of the splice variant into pGEX 2T vector. Recombinant GST-RinZF protein was prepared and had an approximate molecular size of 66 kDa (data not shown). Recombinant GST, GST-Elk, and GST-RIN ZF were used in a gel mobility shift assay with a gastrin CACC element probe. As shown in Fig.4, only the GST-RIN ZF had CACC DNA binding and probe shift. The GST-RIN ZF binding was sequence-specific, because 50-fold excess of cold wild type competitor oligonucleotide completely competed probe binding. However, a 50-fold excess of an oligonucleotide with a 2-bp mutation failed to compete. Therefore, recombinant RIN ZF has the correct sequence specificity of DNA-binding proteins that interact with the gastrin CACC cis-regulatory element. It is noteworthy that the doublet banding pattern of the gel-shifted probe obtained with GST-RIN ZF is similar to that previously observed with Rin 38A nuclear extracts (6Tillotson L.G. Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2234-2240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was initially predicted that RIN ZF would be an activating transcription factor because the CACC element was a positivecis-regulatory element in the gastrin promoter. However, initial results of expression of RIN ZF in mammalian cells showed only weak activation, perhaps because of the presence of other transcription factors. Therefore, RIN ZF expression vectors were transfected intoDrosophila SL2 cells, as they had no Sp1-like activity (26Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, pPac vectors for the expression of full-length, splice variant, and 5′-truncated forms of RIN ZF were utilized. These expression vectors were cotransfected into SL2 cells with a proximal gastrin promoter luciferase reporter gene, and the results shown in Fig. 5 B. The full-length and splice variant versions had only modest activating effects on 200 Gastrin-Luc reporter gene expression, resulting in 2–3-fold increase over the empty vector, pPac. A 5′-truncated version of RIN ZF lacking 365 codons of the 5′-coding region but still possessing the zinc finger domains failed to activate the reporter gene expression. Because the function of some zinc finger transcription factors may be concentration-dependent (28Singh H. Clerc R.G. LeBowitz J.H. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar), RIN ZF expression plasmids were transfected over a concentration range of 0.05–2.0 μg/well. However, there was no significant change in the overall pattern of weak transcriptional activation of gastrin-luciferase expression (data not shown). To examine whether RIN ZFsv can act synergistically with Sp1 or inhibit Sp1 transactivation, expression plasmids for both were cotransfected into SL2 cells with a (CACC)6pT81Luc reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 6, Sp1 strongly transactivated CACC-Luc expression compared with the modest transactivation associated with RIN ZFsv. When the two expression vectors were cotransfected in equivalent amounts, the CACC-Luc transactivation was 80% lower than the Sp1 alone. Increasing the amounts of RIN ZFsv further diminished but did not completely block the Sp1 effect. Similar results were obtained from cotransfection of the full-length form of RIN ZF with Sp1 (data not shown). These results suggest that RIN ZF does not act synergistically with Sp1 but rather completes for binding to the CACC element. Several hundred transcription factors have been cloned and identified by a variety of methods over the past decade (27Pabo C. Sauer R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Some, like Sp1, were identified after purification of the native factor by DNA affinity chromatography (13Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Although this approach was initially applied to the gastrin CACC-binding protein (6Tillotson L.G. Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2234-2240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it proved to be impractical given the low abundance of the CACC binding factors. An alternative approach of screening of a cDNA expression library by DNA binding (28Singh H. Clerc R.G. LeBowitz J.H. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar) was pursued because several CACC-binding proteins ranging in size from 70–110 kDa were evident on a Southwestern blot of RIN 38A cell extracts (6Tillotson L.G. Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2234-2240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Potential disadvantages of this approach are that many transcription factors do not retain their DNA binding properties under the screening conditions, and some require co-factors or dimerization to bind in a sequence-specific manner. In addition, DNA-binding proteins possessing broad sequence specificity can generate false positive clones (29Stuempfle K. Floros J. Biotechniques. 1997; 22: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). With these caveats in mind, screening a RIN 38A cDNA library yielded several clones that showed strong binding activity to a concatamer of the gastrin CACC element. A secondary screen with mutant CACC concatamer probe verified sequence specificity by RIN ZF and several known zinc finger transcription factors. To ensure that RIN ZF CACC binding was not an artifact of a concatamerized probe, sequence specificity was confirmed by gel mobility shift assay with a monomeric CACC element probe. As previously noted, although several CACC binding proteins were detected in RIN cell nuclear extracts, a 70-kDa protein appeared most prominent. Interestingly, none of the positive clones identified in the Southwestern screen appeared to encode a 70-kDa protein. Although unlikely, it is possible that RIN ZF and the 70-kDa protein are the same if RIN ZF has an alternative translational initiation site from the one predicted by ORF analysis. A number of viral and cellular genes have been identified that yield multiple protein products resulting from alternative initiation of translation. It has been observed that growth factor and transcription factor mRNAs possessing long G + C-rich 5′-untranslated regions exhibit alternative translation initiation, often through internal ribosome entry sites (30Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 31Akiri G. Nahari D. Finkelstein Y. Le S.Y. Elroy-Stein O. Levi B.Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 32Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Similarly, RIN ZF has greater than 75% G + C content in the 5′ kilobases of sequence, which likely has significant secondary structure inhibitory of ribosomal scanning. The issue of the relative size of native RIN ZF proteins remains to be resolved by immunoblotting studies with antisera prepared against recombinant RIN ZF. Apart from the Cys2-His2 zinc finger domains, the RIN ZF coding sequence bears little resemblance to other reported zinc finger genes. Specifically, there were no Krüppel (25Bellefroid E. Lecocq P. Benhida A. Poncelet D. Belayew A. Martial J. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) or BTB domains (33Zollman S. Godt D. Priv G.G. Couderc J.L. Laski F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10717-10721Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), which were first described in Drosophilabut are common in higher organisms. Other transcription factor domains such as homeotic (34Affolter M. Schier A. Gehring W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Harada R. Dufort D.

Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar), Ets (38Wasylyk B. Hahn S. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar), and basic helix-loop-helix (39Jan Y. Jan L. Cell. 1993; 75: 827-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) also were not found in RIN ZF. Subdividing the RIN ZF coding sequence and searching by BLAST alignment failed to reveal any close homology with known genes. However, searching an expressed sequence-tagged data base revealed a close match with an expressed sequence tag derived from microdissected human prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia 2 cells (accession number AA602975). This 299-bp expressed sequence tag overlapped 221 bases of the RIN ZF from 2044 to 2265, with an homology of 94%. In separate studies, we used the RIN ZF PCR primers and DNA prepared from a human gastric tumor cell line, AGS, to amplify the splice site domains. After subcloning the PCR products, sequencing revealed a 98% homology between rat and human sequences (data not shown). These results suggest that RIN ZF is a conserved gene and has a human homolog. The mRNA expression pattern of RIN ZF is not limited to those tissues that express gastrin. Both splice forms appear to be ubiquitously expressed and not developmentally regulated. However, these observations are limited by the RT-PCR method to a qualitative assessment of message in whole tissues. Immunohistochemistry with antisera specific to the full-length and splice variant forms of RIN ZF would better define the expression pattern and perhaps provide insights into functionality. It is noteworthy that some zinc finger transcription factors are developmentally regulated by expression of alternatively spliced variants (40Hsu T. Gogos J. Kirsh S. Kafatos F. Science. 1992; 257: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Several transcription factors were found to have splice variations in the DNA binding domains (41Cabanillas A.M. Darling Y.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as well as in activation or repression domains (42Foulkes N. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1992; 68: 411-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, the RIN ZF splice site domain, which is 5′ to the zinc finger domains, consists of largely neutral amino acids and has no recognizable motif. Therefore the functional differences between the splice variants remains to be determined. Both full-length and splice variant RIN ZF appeared to have weaktrans-activating effects on the gastrin promoter, whereas the truncated form had no effect (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that within the RIN ZF amino-terminal region is an activation domain, despite the lack of recognizable activation motifs, such as homopolymeric glutamine and proline-rich stretches (43Gerber H.-P. Seipel K. Georgiev O. Hofferer M. Hug M. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Science. 1994; 263: 808-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Instead, RIN ZF possesses several regions rich in basic residues, often associated with repressor domains (44Saha S. Brickman J. Lehming N. Ptashne M. Nature. 1993; 363: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It may be that RIN ZF have intrinsically weak transactivation domains or may require the presence of coactivating factors (45Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) not present in the Drosophilacells. Some zinc finger proteins contain both activation and repression domains (46Yet S.-F. McA'Nulty M.M. Folta S.C. Yen H.-W. Yoshizumi M. Hsich C.-M. Layne M.D. Chin M.T. Wang H. Perrella M.A. Jain M.K. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1026-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and may be regulated by the context of the promoter binding site or transcriptional cofactors. Further studies with chimeric RIN ZF deletional constructs are in progress to determine functional activity of RIN ZF domains. It has been shown that some zinc finger proteins, such as Krüppel, have opposite regulatory effects that are concentration-dependent (47Sauer F. Jackle H. Nature. 1993; 364: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Sauer and Jäckle (47Sauer F. Jackle H. Nature. 1993; 364: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) found that monomers of Krüppel activate, whereas dimers repress transcription even though both forms bind to the same element. In contrast, RIN ZF expression vector did not vary in its activating effects on gastrin-luciferase transcription throughout a wide concentration range. Alternatively, RIN ZF may have a down-regulatory effect on gastrin transcription by interfering with Sp1 binding or function. BKLF, or basic Krüppel-like factor, is one example of a zinc finger protein that competes with Sp1 binding at a CACCC element of the β-globin gene in erythroid cells (48Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Similarly, ZBP-89 competes with Sp1 in binding to a GC-rich proximal element in the gastrin gene (49Merchant J. Iyer G. Taylor B. Kitchen J. Mortensen E. Wang Z. Flintoft R. Michel J. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As Merchant and her colleagues have shown (49Merchant J. Iyer G. Taylor B. Kitchen J. Mortensen E. Wang Z. Flintoft R. Michel J. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), ZBP-89 inhibits Sp1 binding and blocks epidermal growth factor induction of gastrin transcription. Other mechanisms of altering Sp1 activity include functional interactions with other transcription factors (50Lin S.-Y. Black A.R. Kostic D. Pajovic S. Hoover D.N. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1668-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), changing the Sp1 phosphorylation state (51Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or targeting Sp1 for proteolysis (52Mortensen E. Marks P. Shiotani A. Merchant J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16540-16547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The most likely mechanism is that RIN ZF competes with Sp1 binding at the CACC element, but further studies are needed to determine binding affinities and footprints. I am grateful to Philip J. Davis, James F. Preston, and Dr. Shu-Li Wang for technical assistance. Many thanks to Dr. Todd S. Gulick for advice regarding recombinant protein expression.

Multiple MDM2 proteins have been detected in tumors and in cell lines expressing high levels ofmdm2 mRNAs. Here we show that one of these proteins (p76) is expressed, along with p90, in wild-type andp53-null mouse embryo fibroblasts, indicating that it may have an important physiological role in normal cells. Expression of this protein is induced, as is that of p90, by UV light in a p53-dependent manner.

In cells, p90 and p76 can be synthesized from mdm2 mRNAs transcribed from both the P1 (constitutive) and P2 (p53-responsive) promoters. Site-directed mutagenesis reveals that these RNAs give rise to p76 via internal initiation of translation. In addition, mdm2 mRNAs lacking exon 3 give rise to p76 exclusively, and such mRNAs are induced by p53 in response to UV light.

The effects of MDM2 on these processes depend, in part, on its ability to inactivate the p53 tumor suppressor protein. For example, mice with a homozygous deletion of the mdm2 gene die during embryogenesis, and this deficiency is rescued if p53is also deleted (1Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 2Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). In human tumors, the homologue of MDM2 is overexpressed most often in the subset lacking inactivating mutations in the p53 gene (7Leach F.S. Tokino T. Meltzer P. Burrell M. Oliner J.D. Smith S. Hill D.E. Sidransky D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2231-2234PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, high levels of MDM2 may be redundant with mutational inactivation of p53. Following exposure of cells to γ-radiation, MDM2 inactivates the G1 block mediated by p53 (5Chen C.-Y. Oliner J.D. Zhan Q. Fornace A.J. Vogelstein B. Kastan M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2684-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In some cell types, MDM2 can inhibit apoptosis mediated by p53 (8Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1596-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). MDM2 binds to p53, inhibiting the transcriptional activation function of p53 (3Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar, 9Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J.

Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3659) Google Scholar, 11Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2814) Google Scholar). Recently, MDM2 has been shown to bind to another tumor suppressor protein, p19ARF(12Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Yarborough W.G. Cell. 1998; 92: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 13Pomerantz J. Schreiber-Agus N. Liegeois N.J. Silverman A. Alland L. Chin L. Potes J. Chen K. Orlow I. Lee H.-W. Cordon-Cardo C. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The ability of MDM2 to stimulate degradation of p53 is inhibited by p19ARF, indicating that the interaction of p19ARF and MDM2 may be an important determinant of cell cycle progression.In addition to interacting with p53 and p19ARF, MDM2 binds to and alters the function of other proteins that regulate cell division. For example, overexpression of MDM2 stimulates the activity of the E2F transcription factor (14Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S. La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1995; 375: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) and reverses an arrest in the cell cycle mediated by either the retinoblastoma protein (15Xiao Z.-X. Chen J. Levine A.J. Modjtahedl N. Xing J. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) or a related protein, p107 (6Dubs-Poterszman M.-C. Tocque B. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2445-2449PubMed Google Scholar). These effects of MDM2 do not depend on the presence of p53. Further evidence for p53-independent functions of MDM2 was provided by Lundgren et al. (4Lundgren K. Montes de Oca Luna R. McNeill Y.B. Emerick E.P. Spencer B. Barfield C.R. Lozano G. Rosenberg M.P. Finlay C.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), who generated mice expressing high levels of MDM2 in the mammary gland. The mammary epithelial cells of these mice developed polyploidy, and this effect of MDM2 was also seen in mice lacking p53. Mammary tumors arose in mice overexpressing mdm2, but the dependence on p53 was not measured since mice lacking p53 die before mammary tumors would have developed. Sigalis et al. (16Sigalis I. Calvert A.H. Anderson J.J. Neal D.E. Lunec J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) found that alternatively spliced mdm2 mRNAs were overexpressed in some human tumors. Introduction of these mRNAs into NIH3T3 cells resulted in morphological transformation, even though a subset of them encoded MDM2 proteins that could not bind p53. Therefore, some of the oncogenic effects of MDM2 are independent of p53.Several MDM2 proteins are detectable in cells overexpressing MDM2, including human tumor cells and transformed murine cell lines (17Olson D.C. Marechal V. Momand J. Chen J. Romocki C. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2353-2360PubMed Google Scholar, 18Landers J.E. Haines D.S. Strauss J.F. George D.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar). Olson et al. (17Olson D.C. Marechal V. Momand J. Chen J. Romocki C. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2353-2360PubMed Google Scholar) hypothesized that these proteins arise through alternative splicing, proteolytic processing, or post-translational modification. It has not been clear whether these proteins arise through mechanisms used in the normal regulation ofmdm2 expression. Multiple MDM2 proteins can be translated from single mRNAs in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, indicating that internal initiation may be a mechanism whereby multiple MDM2 proteins are expressed in cells (19Barak Y. Gottlieb E. Juven-Gershon T. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In fact, there is evidence that enhanced translation accounts for the overexpression of multiple MDM2 proteins in some human tumors (18Landers J.E. Haines D.S. Strauss J.F. George D.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar). In the DM3T3 cell line, in which themdm2 gene is amplified, multiple MDM2 proteins and mRNAs are expressed (17Olson D.C. Marechal V. Momand J. Chen J. Romocki C. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2353-2360PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The most abundant protein in DM3T3 cells (p90) is the well characterized mdm2 gene product that binds to p53 and inhibits its function (3Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L.

The primary structure and source of p76 have not been established.Here we show that p76 is a bona fide product of the mdm2gene, as it is expressed in normal wild-type MEFs,1 but not inmdm2-null fibroblasts. Expression of p76 is induced by UV light in a p53-dependent manner. Using epitope mapping and site-directed mutagenesis, we show that p76 appears to be the product of translational initiation at codon 50 (AUG). Both internal initiation and alternate splicing can give rise to p76 in cells. The p53-responsive internal promoter of mdm2 is induced by UV light, and a fraction of the induced RNA is spliced such that it lacks exon 3 and the first two AUG codons. In this alternatively spliced mRNA, AUG codon 50 (referred to hereafter as AUG 50) is the first initiation codon. We provide evidence that the increase in this alternatively spliced mRNA accounts for the induction of p76 expression in response to UV light. Identification and characterization of p76 are important because it is likely to share some oncogenic functions with p90.DISCUSSIONWe have shown here that the p76 MDM2 protein is synthesized in normal cells. Alternatively spliced mdm2 mRNAs lacking exon 3 express p76, but not p90, and such mRNAs are induced by UV light. Synthesis of p76 is initiated at an AUG codon at position 50 of the coding sequence for p90, and p76 lacks the N-terminal domain required for interaction with p53. However, the protein retains many of the structural motifs of p90, including the nuclear localization signal, nuclear export signals, acidic domain (20Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), and RING finger (38Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Borden K.L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 198-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is likely that p76 shares some functions with p90, and its presence in normal cells indicates that it may mediate some of the physiological functions of MDM2.The ability of MDM2 to stimulate the degradation of p53 requires that MDM2 bind p53 (10Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3659) Google Scholar, 11Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2814) Google Scholar). However, the level of p76 may influence the stability of p53 because p76 could bind factors that regulate the process. For example, p76 binds the p19ARF protein, which inhibits the ability of p90 to stimulate degradation of p53 (13Pomerantz J. Schreiber-Agus N. Liegeois N.J. Silverman A. Alland L. Chin L. Potes J. Chen K. Orlow I. Lee H.-W. Cordon-Cardo C. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). An increase in the amount of p76 relative to p90 might free p90 to be more effective at stimulating degradation of p53. Alternatively, it is possible that p76 is a dominant-negative inhibitor of the ability of p90 to stimulate degradation of p53 since p76 might titrate factors required for that function of p90. We have preliminary evidence that the second model is correct. Overexpression of p76 antagonizes the decrease in p53 levels mediated by p90. 4M. Holubar and M. E. Perry, unpublished results. Therefore, regulation of the relative amounts of p76 and p90 MDM2 may be an important mediator of p53 levels.The ratio of p90 to p76 protein is determined, at least in part, by the ratio of the four different mdm2 mRNAs described here. The most abundant mdm2 mRNA in unstressed C127 cells is expressed from the P1 promoter and contains exon 3. This mRNA gives rise to p90 predominantly. Our RT-PCR analysis indicated thatmdm2 mRNAs lacking exon 3 account for 25% of the totalmdm2 mRNA in unstressed C127 cells. Such mRNAs give rise to p76 only. The results of the transfection experiments indicate that mRNAs lacking exon 3 may be up to five times more efficient at giving rise to p76 than are normally spliced mRNAs, if equal transfection efficiencies and RNA stabilities are assumed. If this number is valid, then more than half of the p76 present in C127 cells arises from alternatively spliced mRNA. These observations indicate that the ratio of normally spliced mRNA to alternatively spliced mRNA affects the ratio of p90 to p76. Indeed, 2 h following exposure to a dose of UV light of 4 J/m2, C127 cells have a higher ratio of p90 to p76, in part because there is more normally spliced mRNA relative to alternatively spliced mRNA than in the absence of exposure. In addition, the induced transcript is more efficient than the constitutive transcript at giving rise to p90 relative to p76. Under these same conditions, p53 levels are high, and the p53 protein is active as a transcriptional activator (29Saucedo L.J. Carstens B.C. Seavey S.E. Albee L.D. Perry M.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 119-130PubMed Google Scholar). Later in the UV response, p53 levels return to normal. The relative ratio of p76 to p90 may change throughout the UV response and determine whether p53 is stable. Since p53 stimulates apoptosis in response to UV light (39Zeigler A. Jonason A.S. Lefell D.J. Simon J.A. Sharma H.W. Kimmelman J. Remington L. Jacks T. Brash D.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar), its levels may be critical determinants of cell survival.Dissection of the functions of p76 may reveal p53-independent functions of MDM2. For example, p76 retains the recently identified HECT domain, which is required for the ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2 (40Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). Perhaps p76 targets a protein other than p53 for degradation. Evidence suggests that some of the oncogenic effects of MDM2 are mediated by mechanisms independent of p53 (4Lundgren K. Montes de Oca Luna R. McNeill Y.B. Emerick E.P. Spencer B. Barfield C.R.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar). The human gene has AUG codons at positions 1, 6, 50, 62, and 102 (3Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar), and a human p76 protein is expressed in normal fibroblasts.4 It may be that p76 is overexpressed in tumors and contributes to development of cancer. Identification of any oncogenic properties of p76 is important because therapeutic interventions are being designed to disrupt the interaction between p90 and p53. In tumors overexpressing p76, such therapies may not be effective. The mdm2 oncogene is a determinant of embryogenesis (1Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and cell cycle progression (5Chen C.-Y. Oliner J.D. Zhan Q. Fornace A.J. Vogelstein B. Kastan M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The effects of MDM2 on these processes depend, in part, on its ability to inactivate the p53 tumor suppressor protein. For example, mice with a homozygous deletion of the mdm2 gene die during embryogenesis, and this deficiency is rescued if p53is also deleted (1Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 2Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). In human tumors, the homologue of MDM2 is overexpressed most often in the subset lacking inactivating mutations in the p53 gene (7Leach F.S. Tokino T. Meltzer P. Burrell M. Oliner J.D. Smith S. Hill D.E. Sidransky D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2231-2234PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, high levels of MDM2 may be redundant with mutational inactivation of p53. Following exposure of cells to γ-radiation, MDM2 inactivates the G1 block mediated by p53 (5Chen C.-Y. Oliner J.D. Zhan Q. Fornace A.J. Vogelstein B. Kastan M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2684-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In some cell types, MDM2 can inhibit apoptosis mediated by p53 (8Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1596-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). MDM2 binds to p53, inhibiting the transcriptional activation function of p53 (3Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar, 9Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar) and stimulating degradation of p53 (10Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3659) Google Scholar, 11Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2814) Google Scholar). Recently, MDM2 has been shown to bind to another tumor suppressor protein, p19ARF(12Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Yarborough W.G. Cell. 1998; 92: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 13Pomerantz J. Schreiber-Agus N. Liegeois N.J. Silverman A. Alland L. Chin L. Potes J. Chen K. Orlow I. Lee H.-W. Cordon-Cardo C. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The ability of MDM2 to stimulate degradation of p53 is inhibited by p19ARF, indicating that the interaction of p19ARF and MDM2 may be an important determinant of cell cycle progression. In addition to interacting with p53 and p19ARF, MDM2 binds to and alters the function of other proteins that regulate cell division. For example, overexpression of MDM2 stimulates the activity of the E2F transcription factor (14Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S. La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1995; 375: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) and reverses an arrest in the cell cycle mediated by either the retinoblastoma protein (15Xiao Z.-X. Chen J. Levine A.J. Modjtahedl N. Xing J. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) or a related protein, p107 (6Dubs-Poterszman M.-C. Tocque B. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2445-2449PubMed Google Scholar). These effects of MDM2 do not depend on the presence of p53. Further evidence for p53-independent functions of MDM2 was provided by Lundgren et al. (4Lundgren K. Montes de Oca Luna R. McNeill Y.B. Emerick E.P. Spencer B. Barfield C.R. Lozano G. Rosenberg M.P. Finlay C.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), who generated mice expressing high levels of MDM2 in the mammary gland. The mammary epithelial cells of these mice developed polyploidy, and this effect of MDM2 was also seen in mice lacking p53. Mammary tumors arose in mice overexpressing mdm2, but the dependence on p53 was not measured since mice lacking p53 die before mammary tumors would have developed. Sigalis et al. (16Sigalis I. Calvert A.H. Anderson J.J. Neal D.E. Lunec J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) found that alternatively spliced mdm2 mRNAs were overexpressed in some human tumors. Introduction of these mRNAs into NIH3T3 cells resulted in morphological transformation, even though a subset of them encoded MDM2 proteins that could not bind p53. Therefore, some of the oncogenic effects of MDM2 are independent of p53. Several MDM2 proteins are detectable in cells overexpressing MDM2, including human tumor cells and transformed murine cell lines (17Olson D.C. Marechal V. Momand J. Chen J. Romocki C. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2353-2360PubMed Google Scholar, 18Landers J.E. Haines D.S. Strauss J.F. George D.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar). Olson et al. (17Olson D.C. Marechal V. Momand J. Chen J. Romocki C. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2353-2360PubMed Google Scholar) hypothesized that these proteins arise through alternative splicing, proteolytic processing, or post-translational modification. It has not been clear whether these proteins arise through mechanisms used in the normal regulation ofmdm2 expression. Multiple MDM2 proteins can be translated from single mRNAs in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, indicating that internal initiation may be a mechanism whereby multiple MDM2 proteins are expressed in cells (19Barak Y. Gottlieb E. Juven-Gershon T. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In fact, there is evidence that enhanced translation accounts for the overexpression of multiple MDM2 proteins in some human tumors (18Landers J.E. Haines D.S. Strauss J.F. George D.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar). In the DM3T3 cell line, in which themdm2 gene is amplified, multiple MDM2 proteins and mRNAs are expressed (17Olson D.C. Marechal V. Momand J. Chen J. Romocki C. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2353-2360PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The most abundant protein in DM3T3 cells (p90) is the well characterized mdm2 gene product that binds to p53 and inhibits its function (3Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L.

However, the level of p76 may influence the stability of p53 because p76 could bind factors that regulate the process. For example, p76 binds the p19ARF protein, which inhibits the ability of p90 to stimulate degradation of p53 (13Pomerantz J. Schreiber-Agus N. Liegeois N.J. Silverman A. Alland L. Chin L. Potes J. Chen K. Orlow I. Lee H.-W. Cordon-Cardo C. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). An increase in the amount of p76 relative to p90 might free p90 to be more effective at stimulating degradation of p53. Alternatively, it is possible that p76 is a dominant-negative inhibitor of the ability of p90 to stimulate degradation of p53 since p76 might titrate factors required for that function of p90. We have preliminary evidence that the second model is correct. Overexpression of p76 antagonizes the decrease in p53 levels mediated by p90. 4M. Holubar and M. E. Perry, unpublished results. Therefore, regulation of the relative amounts of p76 and p90 MDM2 may be an important mediator of p53 levels. The ratio of p90 to p76 protein is determined, at least in part, by the ratio of the four different mdm2 mRNAs described here. The most abundant mdm2 mRNA in unstressed C127 cells is expressed from the P1 promoter and contains exon 3. This mRNA gives rise to p90 predominantly. Our RT-PCR analysis indicated thatmdm2 mRNAs lacking exon 3 account for 25% of the totalmdm2 mRNA in unstressed C127 cells. Such mRNAs give rise to p76 only. The results of the transfection experiments indicate that mRNAs lacking exon 3 may be up to five times more efficient at giving rise to p76 than are normally spliced mRNAs, if equal transfection efficiencies and RNA stabilities are assumed. If this number is valid, then more than half of the p76 present in C127 cells arises from alternatively spliced mRNA. These observations indicate that the ratio of normally spliced mRNA to alternatively spliced mRNA affects the ratio of p90 to p76. Indeed, 2 h following exposure to a dose of UV light of 4 J/m2, C127 cells have a higher ratio of p90 to p76, in part because there is more normally spliced mRNA relative to alternatively spliced mRNA than in the absence of exposure. In addition, the induced transcript is more efficient than the constitutive transcript at giving rise to p90 relative to p76. Under these same conditions, p53 levels are high, and the p53 protein is active as a transcriptional activator (29Saucedo L.J. Carstens B.C. Seavey S.E. Albee L.D. Perry M.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 119-130PubMed Google Scholar). Later in the UV response, p53 levels return to normal. The relative ratio of p76 to p90 may change throughout the UV response and determine whether p53 is stable. Since p53 stimulates apoptosis in response to UV light (39Zeigler A. Jonason A.S. Lefell D.J. Simon J.A. Sharma H.W. Kimmelman J. Remington L. Jacks T. Brash D.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar), its levels may be critical determinants of cell survival. Dissection of the functions of p76 may reveal p53-independent functions of MDM2. For example, p76 retains the recently identified HECT domain, which is required for the ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2 (40Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). Perhaps p76 targets a protein other than p53 for degradation. Evidence suggests that some of the oncogenic effects of MDM2 are mediated by mechanisms independent of p53 (4Lundgren K. Montes de Oca Luna R. McNeill Y.B. Emerick E.P. Spencer B. Barfield C.R.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar). The human gene has AUG codons at positions 1, 6, 50, 62, and 102 (3Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar), and a human p76 protein is expressed in normal fibroblasts.4 It may be that p76 is overexpressed in tumors and contributes to development of cancer. Identification of any oncogenic properties of p76 is important because therapeutic interventions are being designed to disrupt the interaction between p90 and p53. In tumors overexpressing p76, such therapies may not be effective. We thank Moshe Oren for mdm2cDNA constructs; Arnold J.

https://openalex.org/W2069340648,"Negative DNA superhelicity can destabilize the local B-form DNA structure and can drive transitions to other conformations at susceptible sites. In a molecule containing multiple susceptible sites, superhelicity can couple these alternatives together, causing them to compete. In principle, these superhelically driven local structural transitions can be either facilitated or inhibited by proteins that bind at or near potential transition sites. If a DNA region that is susceptible to forming a superhelically induced alternate structure is stabilized in the B-form by a DNA-binding protein, its propensity for transition will be transferred to other sites within the same domain. If one of these secondary sites is in a promoter region, this transfer could facilitate open complex formation and thereby activate gene expression. We previously proposed that a supercoiling-dependent, DNA structural transmission mechanism of this type is responsible for the integration host factor-mediated activation of transcription from theilvPG promoter of Escherichia coli(Sheridan, S. D., Benham, C. J. & Hatfield, G. W. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 21298–21308). In this report we confirm the validity of this mechanism by demonstrating the ability of a distant Z-DNA-forming site to compete with the superhelical destabilization that is required for integration host factor-mediated transcriptional activation, and thereby delay its occurrence."

Because previous work has implicated vesicular trafficking as a mechanism of regulating capacitative calcium entry, we investigated whether disruption of vesicular trafficking could lead to decreased capacitative calcium entry and subsequent apoptosis of cells.

Treatment of cells with bafilomycin (30–100 nm), an inhibitor of the endosomal proton ATPase, produced an accumulation of vesicles, decreased capacitative entry, and induced apoptosis.

In contrast to the lack of consensus on a role for cytosolic calcium in apoptosis, a number of groups, including our own, have recently suggested that changes in compartmentalized calcium are important in the regulation of apoptosis (1Preston G.A.

Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Free calcium in the cytoplasm is maintained at approximately 100 nm, whereas compartments such as the ER1 exhibit a severalfold higher (μm to mm) concentration of calcium (16Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 17Chen W. Steenbergen C. Levy L.A. Vance J. London R.E. Murphy E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7398-7403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Calcium gradients are maintained in the cell by membrane transporters. In response to many hormones and growth factors, transient elevations in cytoplasmic calcium occur through the opening of channels located at the ER and plasma membranes. Cytoplasmic calcium changes are initiated through the mobilization of signaling factors such as inositol trisphosphate and cyclic ADP-ribose (18Murphy C.T. Poll C.T. Westwick J. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 19Marks A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H597-H605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These molecules act on calcium efflux channels at the ER membrane and promote release of ER calcium stores. The subsequent depletion of ER calcium stores is hypothesized to lead to the activation of a plasma membrane calcium channel, the capacitative calcium entry (CCE) channel (20Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar, 21Fasolato C. Innocenti B. Pozzan T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 22Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). The ensuing influx of calcium from the extracellular milieu serves to enhance the calcium signal and refill depleted ER stores. This coupling of ER calcium pools with capacitative entry is essential for generating transient intracellular calcium changes. The tight maintenance of calcium gradients and the generation of transient calcium changes provides a key regulatory mechanism for cellular function (23Berridge M.J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 24Sargeant P. Sage S.O. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1994; 64: 395-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Whitfield J.F.

In a previous study we investigated the role of calcium alterations during apoptosis in two immortalized cell lines derived from mutagenized Syrian hamster embryo cells (1Preston G.A. Barrett J.C. Biermann J.A. Murphy E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 537-542PubMed Google Scholar). An early preneoplastic cell line, termed sup(+), was shown to undergo a high rate of apoptosis in low serum conditions. In contrast, a later stage preneoplastic cell line, termed sup(−), was relatively resistant to apoptosis in low serum. An increase in cytoplasmic free calcium was not associated with apoptosis in this cell model; however, consistent with studies of Baffyet al. (6Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Lam et al. (14Lam M. Dubyak G. Distelhorst C.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we found that a decrease in ER calcium was associated with apoptosis in the sup(+) model. The sup(−) cells, which were resistant to apoptosis in low serum, showed no alteration in ER calcium. Pharmacological reduction of ER calcium stores with thapsigargin resulted in apoptosis of sup(−) cells in low serum and of sup(+) cells in 10% serum (normal growth conditions). Conversely, maintaining ER calcium levels of sup(+) cells in low serum prevented the DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis. Furthermore, the previous study suggested that decreased ER calcium in apoptotic sup(+) cells was due, at least in part, to decreased CCE leading to poor refilling of ER calcium stores (1Preston G.A. Barrett J.C. Biermann J.A. Murphy E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 537-542PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we sought to expand our understanding of the relationship between mechanisms responsible for decreased calcium entry and apoptosis. We find that preventing CCE by treating with the CCE inhibitor SKF96365 or by chelating extracellular calcium with BAPTA could induce apoptosis of sup(+) cells. We therefore sought to understand the mechanism responsible for perturbation of CCE in apoptotic sup(+) cells. Many hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanism by which capacitative calcium entry is activated (for reviews, see Refs. 18Murphy C.T. Poll C.T. Westwick J.

During apoptosis we find an accumulation of vesicles within the cell, consistent with altered vesicular trafficking. Thus we considered the possibility that perturbation of vesicle trafficking during apoptosis may lead to disrupted signaling to CCE. We find that perturbing vesicle trafficking in normally growing sup(+) cells by treatment with the macrolide antibiotic bafilomycin (Baf) results in vesicle accumulation concomitant with decreased CCE and apoptosis. Furthermore, we find that in the sup(−) population, which does not undergo apoptosis in reduced serum conditions, perturbation of either CCE (with SKF96365) or vesicle trafficking (with bafilomycin) led to apoptosis. These findings support a role for vesicle trafficking and CCE in apoptosis. Fura-2 AM, BCECF-AM, and nigericin were obtained from Molecular Probes, proteinase K from Boehringer Mannheim, and RNase A from 5 Prime → 3 Prime. All other chemicals were acquired from Sigma/Aldrich. Institute for Biological Research medium was obtained from Life Technologies Inc. and fetal calf serum was obtained from Summit Biotechnologies. Two Syrian hamster embryo-derived lineages, originally immortalized via mutagenesis, were used in these studies (40Koi M. Barrett J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5992-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 41Preston G.A. Lang J.E. Maronpot R.R. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4214-4223PubMed Google Scholar). The sup(+) lineage represents an early stage of tumorigenesis which has lost a senescence gene(s) but retains tumor suppressor capability; whereas the sup(−) lineage represents a later stage of tumorigenesis which has lost both senescence and tumor suppressor genes. During normal passage, sup(+) and sup(−) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Institute for Biological Research medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 10% CO2, 90% air. For experiments, cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/100-mm culture plate or 6 × 104 cells/30-mm culture plate and grown under normal conditions for 24 h prior to treatment. Low serum conditions were either 0.2 or 0.8% fetal calf serum. As the serum aged, later experiments required the higher percentage of fetal calf serum. Four treatment groups were used in the study: 1) 10% serum (control); 2) low serum; 3) 10% + drug (e.g. SKF96365 or bafilomycin); and 4) low serum + drug. Cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 104 cells/plate in 30-mm plates containing 22-mm diameter round glass coverslips. Following 24 h of growth, cells were treated for 4 h. Fura-2 AM (2 μm) was introduced to each plate 30 min prior to measurements (after ∼3.5 h of treatment). Coverslips were then washed twice with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline and placed in a custom-built holder. The entire unit was placed on the stage of a Nikon inverted epifluorescence microscope coupled to a PTI Deltascan dual wavelength excitation spectrofluorometer. Measurements were taken in a window containing 2–6 cells. Cells were excited at 340 and 380 nm and emitted fluorescence was measured at 510 nm. Background fluorescence, measured in non-fura-2 loaded cells, was subtracted. The ratio of fluorescence intensity was obtained by dividing the emitted fluorescence for excitation at 340 nm by the emitted fluorescence for excitation at 380 nm. R min and R max values were determined as described previously (1Preston G.A. Barrett J.C. Biermann J.A. Murphy E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 537-542PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular calcium concentration was calculated as described previously by Grynkiewiczet al. (42Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The cytosolic location of fura-2 was confirmed for each treatment condition using saponin (43Murphy E. Freudenrich C.C. Levy L.A. London R.E. Lieberman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2981-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Saponin was able to release approximately 80–85% of loaded dye in all conditions. ER and capacitative calcium entry were measured as follows: fura-2 loaded cells were treated with the ER calcium ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (2 μm) in the absence of extracellular calcium. Thapsigargin stimulates the release of ER calcium into the cytoplasm thus permitting measurement of the stored ER calcium pool. Following pool emptying, calcium is removed from the cytoplasm presumably by extrusion via the plasma membrane transporters. Once basal cytosolic readings were restored, extracellular calcium was raised to 1 mm and the rapid increase in cytoplasmic calcium (induced by ER store depletion) was measured as peak fluorescence with fura-2. Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/plate in 100-mm plates and grown for 24 h. Cells were washed with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline and 10 ml of the appropriate treatment media was added. Following 16–24 h (see figure legends) cells were scraped into the treatment media and pelleted. The cell pellets were washed with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and lysed in 50–100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5% sodium lauryl sarcosine, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K). DNA was extracted and analyzed for fragmentation as described previously (1Preston G.A. Barrett J.C. Biermann J.A. Murphy E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 537-542PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 104 cells/plate in 30-mm plates containing 22-mm diameter round glass coverslips. Following 24 h of growth, cells were washed and treated for 4 h. BCECF-AM (4 μm) was introduced to each plate 15 min prior to measurements. Coverslips were then washed twice with media containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and placed in a custom-built holder. One ml of media containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, was added to the chamber and the entire unit was placed on the stage of a Nikon inverted epifluorescence microscope coupled to a PTI Deltascan dual wavelength excitation spectrofluorometer. Measurements were taken in a window containing 2–6 cells. Emission was measured at 535 nm following excitation at 439 and 505 nm. Background fluorescence, measured in an area containing no cells, was subtracted. The ratio of fluorescence intensity was obtained by dividing the emitted fluorescence for excitation at 505 nm by the emitted fluorescence for excitation at 439 nm. To calibrate dye fluorescence for each sample, the ratio of fluorescence was measured at 4–5 pH values using the high KCl-nigericin technique (44Shrode L.D. Klein J.D. Douglas P.B. O'Neill W.C. Putnam R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1968-C1979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 100-mm plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/plate and grown for 24 h. Cells were washed with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline and 5 ml of the appropriate treatment media was added. Following 4–16 h (see figure legends), 5 ml of 2 × fixation buffer (4% glutaraldehyde, 0.2 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2) was added to the plates. Cells were scraped into the media/fix mixture and pelleted. Cell pellets were re-suspended in 1 ml of 1 × fixative and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Fixed cells were washed with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, and maintained in fresh buffer at 4 °C until further processing was done. Samples were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded ethanol and embedded in Poly Bed 812. The samples were cured for 3 days at 60 °C and thin sections were cut. Sections were stained with 5% uranyl acetate followed by Reynolds lead citrate solution and then examined using a Phillips 400 transmission electron microscope. Values are mean ± S.E. In comparing two groups, statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. For multiparameter comparisons, statistical significance was determined by ANOVA, adjusting for multiple comparisons using Fisher's test for significance. A value ofp < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Sup(+) cells, an immortalized cell line derived from mutagenesis of Syrian hamster embryo cells (40Koi M. Barrett J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5992-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), undergo apoptosis in response to low serum conditions (41Preston G.A. Lang J.E. Maronpot R.R. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4214-4223PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study, a decrease in ER calcium was shown to precede apoptosis in sup(+) cells (1Preston G.A. Barrett J.C. Biermann J.A. Murphy E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 537-542PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in ER calcium was, in turn, found to be secondary to a decrease in the refilling pathway of CCE (1Preston G.A. Barrett J.C. Biermann J.A. Murphy E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 537-542PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in testing whether inhibition of CCE per se could induce apoptosis of cells under conditions where apoptosis does not normally occur (in 10% serum). We found a dose-dependent inhibition of CCE in sup(+) cells following treatment with SKF96365 (Fig. 1), an inhibitor of CCE and other calcium channels. As little as 30 μm SKF96365 was able to reduce CCE approximately 30%. Higher doses of SKF96365 decreased CCE even more significantly, from the peak control calcium entry of 1.5 ± 0.9 to 0.15 ± 0.1 μm with 100 μm SKF96365 (Fig. 1). In conjunction with CCE, we also measured ER calcium as the thapsigargin releasable calcium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sup(+) cells treated with SKF96365 exhibited a 50% decrease in ER calcium within 4 h following treatment. In control cells (10% serum) thapsigargin released 116 ± 15 nm ER calcium into the cytosol versus42 ± 11 nm in SKF96365 (100 μm) treated cells. The same doses of SKF96365 which effected CCE were also able to induce apoptosis (Fig. 2). Within 16 h of treatment with 30 μm SKF96365, sup(+) cells grown in 10% serum showed the classic DNA laddering pattern indicative of apoptosis (lane 2). Similar to the dose-dependent inhibition of CCE, higher doses of SKF96365 were able to induce more prominent laddering of sup(+) cells (lanes 3 and4). Since SKF96365 is a non-selective inhibitor of CCE, we further substantiated the relationship between CCE and apoptosis using cell-impermeant BAPTA to chelate extracellular calcium. BAPTA chelates calcium with one to one binding, therefore millimolar concentrations of BAPTA are required to chelate the 1.8 mm calcium concentration present in the treatment media. Thus, lower doses of BAPTA were unable to reduce extracellular calcium beyond the high micromolar range (e.g. 1 mm BAPTA only decreased the calcium concentration to ∼800 μm), and correspondingly were unable to induce apoptosis (Fig.3, lanes 2–5). In contrast, doses of BAPTA which significantly chelated extracellular calcium (5 mm BAPTA reduced the calcium concentration to ∼390 nm and 10 mm BAPTA reduced the calcium concentration to ∼150 nm), were able to induce DNA ladders in sup(+) cells (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 7,for comparison, lane 8 shows low serum-induced apoptosis).Figure 3BAPTA induces apoptosis of sup(+) cells in 10% serum. Sup(+) cells were treated for 16 h with 0.01–10 mm cell-impermeant BAPTA in 10% serum media. A representative agarose gel of extracted DNA is shown. Lane 1, 10% serum control; lane 2, 0.01 mmBAPTA; lane 3, 0.1 mm BAPTA; lane 4,0.5 mm BAPTA; lane 5, 1 mm BAPTA;lane 6, 5 mm BAPTA; lane 7, 10 mm BAPTA; lane 8, low serum. BAPTA concentrations of 5 and 10 mm, which reduced free extracellular calcium concentrations to 390 and 150 nm,respectively, were able to induce laddering of sup(+) cells similar to low serum treatment. Lower concentrations of BAPTA, which did not significantly chelate extracellular calcium (e.g. 1 mm BAPTA only reduced calcium to 800 μm), were not able to cause laddering.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7Bafilomycin inhibits capacitative calcium entry. Sup(+) cells were treated as indicated for 4 h. During the final 30 min of treatment cells were also loaded with 2 μm fura-2.

All three treatment groups (low serum, 10% + 50 nm Baf, and low serum + 50 nm Baf) showed a significant decrease (p < 0.03) in CCE compared with control, untreated cells as assessed by analysis of variance for repeated measurements followed by the Fisher's test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Many hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanism responsible for CCE (for reviews, see Refs. 18Murphy C.T. Poll C.T. Westwick J. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 22Berridge M.J. Biochem.

Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). One model which has been suggested is the control of calcium entry through regulated insertion of CCE channels (38Somasundaram B. Norman J.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 39Somasundaram B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Floto R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26096-26104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this model, signals from a store-depleted ER would “activate” an endomembrane compartment enabling it to fuse with the plasma membrane, inserting more entry channels into the plasma membrane. A prediction of this model would be that inhibiting vesicle movement to and/or fusion with the plasma membrane would inhibit CCE. Intriguingly, in many morphological discussions of cell death, the apoptotic process is associated with accumulation of vesicles within the cell (47Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6724) Google Scholar, 48Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D. J. Pathol. 1984; 142: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar, 49Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 1987: 755-785Google Scholar, 50Munker R. Greither L. Darsow M. Pander S. Wilmanns W. Ann.

Bernstein C. Bernstein H. Leuk. & Lymphoma. 1995; 19: 43-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Similar to many other systems that undergo apoptosis, we found that apoptotic sup(+) cells accumulate vesicles in the cytoplasm. Sup(+) cells maintained in low serum conditions for 16 h show a marked increase in the number of vesicles present per cell as well as an increase in the number of cells with vesicles (compare Fig.4 A (10%, 16 h) to Fig.4 B (low serum, 16 h)). The increase in vesiculation in low serum-treated sup(+) cells occurs early, within 4 h an increase in vesicles is readily apparent (Fig. 4 C), preceding other known morphological markers of apoptosis such as nuclear and cytoplasmic compaction (49Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 1987: 755-785Google Scholar, 51Vollenweider I. Groscurth P. Electron Microsc. Rev. 1991; 4: 249-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that not all apoptotic treatments lead to vesicle accumulation. Whereas low serum treatment can lead to vesicle accumulation (Fig. 4, B and C) and decreased CCE (Ref. 1Preston G.A. Barrett J.C. Biermann J.A. Murphy E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 537-542PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 7), SKF96365 treatment only decreases CCE (Fig. 1) without affecting vesicle accumulation (Fig. 4 D). This suggests that the sequence of events is one in which vesicle accumulation precedes decreased CCE. Thus, pharmacological alteration of CCE (e.g. with SKF96365) would not necessarily require the involvement of vesicles. If vesicle accumulation is involved in the regulation of apoptosis as opposed to a result of apoptosis, then pharmacological inhibition of vesicular trafficking should induce apoptosis.

Cloning of up to 2 kilobase pairs of the newly identified genomic domain and transfection of various constructs driving a reporter gene, in pancreatic islet cell line INS-1, uncovered a strong glucose regulation of the promoter activity of plasmids containing up to nucleotide −868, or more, upstream from the transcriptional start point. This promoter activity displayed threshold-like behavior, with low activity of the promoter below 5 mm glucose, and maximal activation as of 10 mm glucose. This glucose regulation was mapped to a highly palindromic 19-nucleotide region between nt −545 and −527. Indeed, deletion or mutation of this sequence abolished the glucose regulation.

The liver has a central role in handling absorbed nutrients and in the regulation of hepatic glycogen disposability; this requires high density of glucagon receptors in the liver (for review see Refs. 1Pilkis S.J.

The glucagon receptor mRNA has also been detected at variable levels in other tissues such as heart, kidney, adrenal gland, and adipose tissue (3Svoboda M. Tastenoy M. Vertongen P. Robberecht P. Mol.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4108-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The expression of the glucagon receptor mRNA is stimulated by glucose and inhibited by cyclic AMP, both in liver (8Abrahamsen N. Lundgren K. Nishimura E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15853-15857Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and in cultured endocrine cells (9Abrahamsen N. Nishimura E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1572-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consequently, the promoter of the glucagon receptor gene could contain regulatory elements for these factors. It has been recently suggested by Burcelin et al. (10Burcelin R. Mrejen C. Decaux J.F. Hauguel De Mouzon S. Girard J. Charron M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8088-8093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that the glucose regulation of the glucagon receptor mRNA level differs from the glucose regulation of other genes such as Glut2, and might be mediated by triose metabolites, suggesting the existence of new enhancer sequences. To address this question, a prerequisite is the precise knowledge of the complete 5′ mRNA sequence. For the glucagon receptor mRNA, there was an ambiguity; the glucagon receptor cDNA has been first cloned (from rat) simultaneously by us (11Svoboda M. Ciccarelli E. Tastenoy M. Cauvin A. Stiévenart M. Christophe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Svoboda M. Ciccarelli E. Tastenoy M. Robberecht P. Christophe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and by Jelinek et al.(13Jelinek L.J. Lok S. Rosenberg G.B. Smith R.A. Grant F.J. Biggs S. Bensch P.A. Kuijper J.L. Sheppard P.O. Sprecher C.A. O'Hara P.J. Foster D. Walker K.M. Chen L.H.J. McKernan P.A. Kindsvogel W. Science. 1993; 259: 1614-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Our sequence (GenBank accession number L04796) was almost identical to that of Jelinek (GenBank accession number M96674) except for the 5′ end; the first 25 nt1 in our sequence (corresponding to positions −105 to −80 from the ATG codon) differed from the sequence published by Jelinek (13Jelinek L.J. Lok S. Rosenberg G.B. Smith R.A. Grant F.J. Biggs S. Bensch P.A. Kuijper J.L. Sheppard P.O. Sprecher C.A. O'Hara P.J. Foster D. Walker K.M. Chen L.H.J. McKernan P.A. Kindsvogel W. Science. 1993; 259: 1614-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The coding domain of the rat glucagon receptor gene is highly fragmented; it contains 12 introns with uneven splicing maturation (14Maget B. Tastenoy M. Svoboda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that may produce cloning artifacts resulting in the observed differences described for the 5′ sequences. Therefore, we first identified the correct organization of the 5′ end of the rat glucagon receptor mRNA. Thereafter, we cloned a fragment of genomic DNA located upstream from the transcription start point, and identified this fragment as a glucose activable promoter region using reporter gene studies. Finally, we localized a L4-like box sequence as the central motif of the glucose-induced gene stimulation. Rat liver and heart fragments were homogenized in 4 m guanidine isothiocyanate, and total RNA was purified on CsCl gradient (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar); poly(A) RNA was purified on oligo(dT)-cellulose (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed using Superscript II™ (Life Technologies, Inc.). Anchored PCR of the 5′ end was performed after single-strand ligation of phosphorylated oligonucleotide to cDNA using the 5′ RACE kit (CLONTECH). Subcloning of PCR product was carried out by TA ligation to the pCRII plasmid (Invitrogen). Sequencing of plasmids purified on Qiagen™ columns was performed with the Sequenase or Thermosequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp; Amersham). Polymerase chain reaction was performed as indicated in the legend of figures. Analysis of amplified DNA fragments on agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose filters and hybridized to 5′-32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide was, performed as detailed by Sambrook et al. (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Rat genomic DNA, partially digested withSau3AI (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), was cloned in XhoI-digested and partially filled λ-FixII bacteriophage DNA (Stratagene), and packaged as recommended by the manufacturer. The resulting primary genomic library was screened at 40,000 plaque-forming units/145-mm plate. We initially screened the λ-FixII library with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides complementary to nt +147 to +128 and to nt + 772 to +739 of the glucagon receptor CDS. One positive clone (P 10-C) was isolated. First, a 3.5-kb XbaI/PstI hybridizing fragment was subcloned into pUC18. Second, a 1-kbXbaI/XbaI fragment (located upstream from of theXbaI/PstI fragment) was subcloned in pZErO™-1 (Invitrogen). The XbaI/PstI fragment contained a 2.5-kb sequence corresponding to the 5′ end of the coding domain of the glucagon receptor gene (Ref. 14Maget B. Tastenoy M. Svoboda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar; GenBank accession number L31574), and, in addition, a 1-kb sequence upstream from the previously described initiation codon. The 5′ end extended sequence is listed in GenBank under accession number U63021. In a second screening we used 32P-labeled oligonucleotides J.for and S.for (described below). One positive λ-FixII clone (JS 3-A) was isolated, and a 1.3-kb BamHI/BamHI hybridizing fragment was subcloned first in pZErO™-1 (Invitrogen) and then in the BamHI site of pBlCat6 vector (clone B/B). An oligonucleotide probe based on the 5′end of this fragment was used as a probe to subclone a 2-kb PstI/SacI fragment in pBluescript SK+ resulting in clone “P/S.” The two subcloned fragments contain a 130-bp overlap with a unique XbaI site. We ligated a HindIII/XbaI fragment of clone P/S with a XbaI/XbaI fragment of the clone B/B in the pBlCat6 vector digested with HindIII/XbaI. The sequence of this constructed plasmid (called clone P/ctr/B) was deposited in GenBank under accession number U63022. In the first transfection experiments, we used clones B/B and P/ctr/B. These plasmids gave only a low reporter gene activity in transfected cells (see below); these plasmids bear approximately 1 kb of sequence situated downstream from the mRNA start point. This intervening sequence may prevent the efficient transcription of the reporter gene. We therefore prepared shortened plasmids by deletion of the sequence located immediately after the end of the first untranslated exon, using a unique ApaI site. The clone B/B was digested by ApaI and XhoI, blunted and ligated to give clone “pCB.” The clone P/ctr/B was digested by ApaI and NotI, blunted and ligated to give the clone “pCC”. The latter clone contained a XhoI site located 1 kb upstream from its 3′end (ex-ApaI site), and a second XhoI site in the polylinker, so thatXhoI digestion excised a 1-kb insert, which was subcloned inXhoI site of pBlCat6 vector in both its normal and reverse orientation (clones pCX and pCXi). The clone pCC was digested by BamHI, and a 0.5-kb fragment was removed; the plasmid was then recirculated by ligation. The firstBamHI site is in position −287, and the secondBamHI site is in the polylinker of pBlCat6, soBamHI digestion removed from the plasmid pCC, fragment an equivalent to the pCB plasmid insert. The remaining promoter domain (−2 kb to −287) was then excised byHindIII/BamHI and subcloned in theHindIII/BamHI sites of the pBlCat5 plasmid,i.e. upstream from the HSV thymidine kinase basal promoter. The resulting plasmid was called pTkCd. Mutations were introduced using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene according to manufacturer's instruction. The principal is based on Pfuamplification of the whole plasmid and digestion of nonmutated DNA using DpnI digestion. DpnI does not digest unmethylated, Pfu-amplified DNA. We used as forward primer GCACGTGTGACAGTTGCAATCTTTC for the preparation of pTkCd-m1 clone, and CCACACACGGTGGTCGTGTGAGTGCTGCAATCTTTC as forward primer for the preparation of pTkCd-m2 clone. Clone pTkCd-m1 carries a single nucleotide change. Clone pTkCd-m2 contains a double mutation of the two first nucleotides of each palindromic E-box (change of four nucleotides). We used CTTTGCTCCCACACACGGTGCAATCTTTCACCCAGGAGCC as forward primer to produce the pCXΔ clone. This clone is characterized by a 15-nt deletion located between −543 to −529, i.e.deletion of the fragment containing the two E-boxes of the palindromic G-box (L4-like box). Reverse primers were complementary to the above described forward primers. Mutated clones were sequenced as described above. Insulin-secreting cell line INS-1 was kindly provided by Prof. Wollheim (University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerland). These cells were cultured in modified RPMI 1640 as described previously (16Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Cell culture material and media were from Life Technologies, Inc. Transfections were usually performed on cells 4–5 days after seeding in six-well plates, in order to achieve roughly 60% cell confluence. The day before transfection, the usual cell medium was replaced with by RPMI 1640 medium with a low glucose concentration (5 mm instead of 11 mm). The cationic liposome Dosper (Boehringer Mannheim) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. In standard transfections, we used 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA and 10 μl of Dosper reagent/35-mm diameter well. After 5 h, the transfection medium was replaced by RPMI 1640 medium, with variable glucose concentrations. In several experiments, the transfection yield was estimated by cotransfection with 0.5 μg of pcDNA3.1/his/lacZ (Invitrogen). Galactosidase activity was quantified on 2% of the cell extract usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommended procedure. Measurement of galactosidase activity was highly reproducible, with intra-assay variation of less than 25%. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity of transfected cells was assayed by acylation of [14C]chloramphenicol (ICN) using n-butyryl-CoA (Promega) as indicated in the Promega protocol. An aliquot of the cell extract from individual wells was used for CAT assays and TLC analysis. Autoradiographic densities (measure of “volume” of absorption: integrated optical densities of the spot surface) were estimated using “Viber-Lourmat” image analysis apparatus. In control experiments we found a linear correlation between the amount of CAT in the assay and the “volume” of absorption measured in the range of 0–125 milliunits. Activity of our samples from transfected cells never exceeded 100 milliunits of CAT. Analysis of the 5′ end sequence of the glucagon receptor mRNA was obtained by amplification of rat liver and heart cDNA using two forward primers J.for and S.for, based on the conflictual sequences reported in the literature. A forward primer based on an unambiguous sequence in the 5′ end was used as a control. Fig. 1 A shows the amplified products electrophoretic pattern. The amplification specificity was confirmed by Southern blotting, using internal oligodeoxynucleotides as probes (data not shown). The major products were subcloned and sequenced. Obtained sequences, confirmed later by sequencing products of anchored PCR and by sequencing cloned genomic DNA (see below), demonstrated that glucagon receptor mRNAs contain two untranslated exons, and that the second one could be spliced out. We called the first 5′ untranslated exon (described by Jelinek et al.; Ref. 13Jelinek L.J. Lok S. Rosenberg G.B. Smith R.A. Grant F.J. Biggs S. Bensch P.A. Kuijper J.L. Sheppard P.O. Sprecher C.A. O'Hara P.J. Foster D. Walker K.M. Chen L.H.J. McKernan P.A. Kindsvogel W. Science. 1993; 259: 1614-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) UJ, and the second alternatively spliced exon (described by Svoboda et al.; Ref. 11Svoboda M. Ciccarelli E. Tastenoy M. Cauvin A. Stiévenart M. Christophe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) US. These results are illustrated in Fig. 1 B. To identify the mRNA transcription start site, and estimate the relative abundance of these polymorphous glucagon receptor mRNA populations, we performed 5′ end-anchored PCR. We ligated liver and heart single-stranded cDNA to a phosphorylated anchor primer, and then used three different reverse primers to amplify this anchored cDNA. The procedure is detailed in the legend of Fig.2. Hybridization using the internal labeled oligonucleotide probe (R-20) allowed us to visualize a major band with a smear for the liver and two separate bands for the heart (Fig. 2). The same pattern was observed in the three tested conditions. Shorter exposure clearly indicated that most of the DNA amplified from liver had the same mobility as the smaller fragment amplified from the heart. The smaller band corresponded to approximately 350 bp with R147, and about 160 bp with R-20 reverse primer. The size of the larger fragment amplified from the heart was in good agreement with the results expected in the presence of an additional 166-bp unspliced 5′ exon. These results indicated that the average size of the 5′ untranslated end of the glucagon receptor mRNA was approximately 180 bp or 180 + 166 bp. We subcloned the products of the second step of the anchored PCR into the pCRII vector, and hybridized recombinant colonies with 5′-labeled J.for and S.for oligonucleotides. 90% of clones originating from the liver hybridized with “J.for” only, and did not contain the US exon (confirmed by sequencing). In contrast, among the 55 colonies originating from the heart, 21 hybridized with the “J.for” probe only, 31 (representing the longer form comprising the 166-bp US exon) hybridized with both “J.for” and “S.for” probes, and 3 colonies hybridized with “S.for” only and contained truncated US exon sequences. This result suggested that all transcripts originated from a single promoter located upstream UJ exon, rather that from two separate promoters found upstream from each untranslated exon. The reason for a tissue-specific use of the second US exon remains unclear. To identify the transcription start point, we subcloned the products of the second anchored PCR step in the pCRII vector, and sequenced the 5′ end of 30 clones originating from both liver and heart. All the inserts yielded the same sequence, but starting at various points ranging from 73 to 131 nt upstream from the 3′ end of exon UJ (see Fig.3). These sizes were in good agreement with the average size of the 5′ RACE amplified fragments shown in Fig.2. A supplement verification of the 5′ mRNA length was performed by two additional independent anchored PCR. Primers were located on exon UJ, in order to favor the longest 5′ transcripts. In a population of 20 clones, we did not find a sequence exceeding the point indicated in Fig. 3 B by “start exon UJ,” strongly suggesting that we had indeed identified the actual mRNA 5′end. We constructed and screened a bacteriophage λ-FixII rat genomic DNA library. The first genomic clone obtained contained the complete glucagon receptor coding domain, and 1.5-kb sequence upstream from the ATG initiation codon. The genomic DNA sequence upstream from position −79 (GenBank accession number U63021) diverged from both published cDNA 5′ end sequences and represented thus obviously an intron. This sequence showed 83% identity (over 992 nt upstream from the ATG) with the reported putative mouse glucagon receptor gene promoter (GenBank accession number L38612) (17Burcelin R. Li J. Charron M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the second screening, we obtained DNA fragments located up to 5 kb upstream from the initiation codon (GenBank accession number U63022). The genomic organization of the whole glucagon receptor gene deduced from these data is illustrated in Fig. 3 A. The comparison of the rat glucagon receptor genomic sequence with published cDNA sequences confirmed the existence of two exons in the 5′ untranslated domain. Even our longest 5′-cDNA clones sequences were identical to the genomic DNA sequence. These clones indicate the putative transcription start site (Fig. 3 B). The experimentally determined size of 5′ domain of cDNA (Fig. 2) is in good agreement with this position of the start point. The sequence neighboring the putative start site was in relative agreement with the consensus sequence of promoters lacking TATA boxes. The genomic sequence upstream from this putative start site was highly (G + C)-rich and could correspond to the basal gene promoter. Moreover, we found at position −527 to − 545 upstream from the transcription start point, highly palindromic sequence of 19 nucleotides containing a canonical E-box “CACGTG”, followed by three nucleotides “tga” and another palindromic E-box “CAGCTG” (Fig. 3 B). This feature is very similar to the “L4 box” found in pyruvate kinase L or Spot14 promoter, in which it is thought to be the glucose response element (GIRE or ChoRE; see “Discussion”). We call this nucleotide stretch the “G-box”. We subcloned the putative promoter domain of the glucagon receptor gene in the pBlCat6 plasmid as illustrated in Fig. 4 A. For the transfection studies, we deleted all sequences downstream from the first exon (UJ). Transfections were performed in INS-1 cells: a cell line established (16Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Prof. Wollheim. These cells contain the glucagon receptor mRNA and express functional glucagon receptors (18Kieffer T.J. Heller R.S. Unson C.G. Weir G.C. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5119-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Glucose regulated expression of the glucagon receptor in these cells was demonstrated by the adenylyl cyclase stimulation: the activity was higher (225 pmol of cAMP/min/mg of protein; 4.2-fold stimulation) using membranes from cells grown in the presence of 20 mm glucose, then with the membranes from cells grown in the presence of 5 mm glucose (100 pmol of cAMP/min/mg of protein; 2-fold stimulation). An INS-1 subclone that expresses low levels of the glucagon receptor and a RIN cell line that does not express the glucagon receptor were used as controls of transfection specificity (data not shown). We studied the glucagon receptor promoter activity and its regulation by glucose in the INS-1 cells expressing greatly glucagon receptors. We constructed CAT plasmid variants containing various putative promoter sequences. The DNA fragments tested are described in Fig. 4. We observed that the transfection with the short pCB (−236 to +156) plasmid gave the same, relatively large CAT activity in cells grown in medium containing either 5 or 20 mm glucose (Fig.5). In contrast, cells transfected by the longer plasmids pCX (−869 to +156) and pCC (−2 kb to +156) expressed a low CAT activity in the presence of glucose 5 mm and a spectacularly higher CAT activity in the presence of 20 mm glucose (Fig. 5). Transfection realized with plasmid pCX (−869 to +156) and plasmid pCC (−2 kb to +156), gave similar results, suggesting that clone pCX (−869 to +156) contained the DNA fragment responsible for the glucose responsiveness. This enhancer should be located upstream from the plasmid pCB insert sequence (i.e. between position −236 to −869 upstream from the transcription start site). Results obtained with the short pCB plasmid shown that these regulatory elements inhibited gene transcription at low, 5 mm glucose and activated the transcription at high, 20 mm glucose concentrations. The shortened plasmid pCP (−541 to +156) gave a lower activity, with reduced glucose stimulation. The deleted plasmid pCD (pCX deleted between −267 and −550 nt) had a lower, nonregulated activity (Fig.5). These results suggest that the glucose regulatory element is located close to the PmlI site and DraIII restriction sites, including nucleotides −541 to −550. This corresponds indeed to the position of the 19-nt palindromic sequence “G-box” indicated above (Fig. 3 B). We also tested the promoter activity of plasmids bearing inserts in the reversed orientation (Fig. 6). Plasmid pCXi (+156 to −868) possessed a low activity that remained glucose regulated. Plasmid pCBi (+156 to −236) possessed a low activity that was no regulated by glucose (Fig. 6). As the putative glucose enhancer sequence is highly palindromic, it is not surprising that glucose stimulation was also observed in reverse orientation of plasmid pCXii. Absolute activity value of reversed plasmids was lower, which was expected, as in this orientation the normal basal promoter was also in the reverse orientation. This was confirmed by the low activity of the reversed plasmid pCBi containing only the putative basal promoter (i.e. GC-rich domain) (Fig. 6). We removed the basal promoter (insert of the clone pCB) byBamHI digestion of the whole promoter domain (plasmid pCC). We subcloned this genomic fragment (−2 kb to −287) upstream from the HSV thymidine kinase basal promoter in the pBlCat5 plasmid. Cells transfected with this plasmid, called pTkCd, which contains the reporter gene driven by the recombinant glucagon receptor enhancer and the tk basal promoter, displayed much higher activities that pCX plasmid. The pTkCd plasmid retained the same level of sensitivity that the pCX plasmid to glucose activation (Fig.7). Therefore, this plasmid will be used as a model for further studies of the glucose enhancer. We realized a glucose activation dose response curve. Average results are shown in Fig. 8. Most of activity variation was observed between 5 and 10 mm glucose, with about half-maximal activity observed at an average of 7.5 mm glucose. These glucose concentrations are within physiological glycemia range. In addition, the glucose stimulation of the gene transcription suggests a threshold-like behavior. Indeed, analysis of individual results indicates that the majority of experimental points offer a low activity up to 5 mmglucose, and high activity as of 10 mm glucose. Three dose-response experiments were performed with pCX plasmid (pBlCat6 derivative) Fig. 8, and one, with similar relative results, with pTkCd plasmid (pBlCat5 derivative including HSV tk promoter). We used the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit for the preparation of several mutated clones. First, we deleted the G-box from the pCX clone, yielding the pCXΔ clone that lacks a 15-nucleotide domain that includes the two E-boxes. This deletion produced a total suppression of the glucose stimulation of the CAT activity in the transfected cells (Fig. 9 A). In addition, two mutations were introduced in the G-box present in the pTkCd plasmid. In the first clone pTkCd-m1, we mutated the second E-box CAGCTG to CAGTTG. In the second mutated clone pTkCd-m2, we changed CA of the two E-boxes to TG. Transfections of INS-1 cells with the mutated plasmids showed that, whereas the C → T point mutation of pTkCd-m1 did not impair glucose stimulation of the reporter gene expression, the CA → TG mutations of pTkCd-m2 almost totally suppressed glucose activation of the reporter gene. These results demonstrate the key role of the G-box in the glucose activation of the rat glucagon receptor gene expression. We have cloned the 5′ upstream domain of the glucagon receptor gene, we demonstrated that it contains a functional glucose-regulated promoter, and we located its glucose regulatory element. This is the first time that a G protein-coupled receptor gene promoter regulated by glucose has been cloned. The glucagon receptor belongs to the type B G protein-coupled receptor family (GPCRs; see GPCR data base (Ref. 19Horn F. Weare J. Beukers M.W. Horsch S. Bairoch A. Chen W. Edvardsen O. Campagne F. Vriend G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar)). Several genes of this receptor family have been described, and share a similar coding domain, i.e.exon/intron organization pattern (14Maget B. Tastenoy M. Svoboda M.

https://openalex.org/W1991222246,"GerE is a transcription factor produced in the mother cell compartment of sporulating Bacillus subtilis. It is a critical regulator of cot genes encoding proteins that form the spore coat late in development. Most cotgenes, and the gerE gene, are transcribed by ςK RNA polymerase. Previously, it was shown that the GerE protein inhibits transcription in vitro of thesigK gene encoding ςK. Here, we show that GerE binds near the sigK transcriptional start site, to act as a repressor. A sigK-lacZ fusion containing the GerE-binding site in the promoter region was expressed at a 2-fold lower level during sporulation of wild-type cells than gerEmutant cells. Likewise, the level of SigK protein (i.e.pro-ςK and ςK) was lower in sporulating wild-type cells than in a gerE mutant. These results demonstrate that ςK-dependent transcription of gerE initiates a negative feedback loop in which GerE acts as a repressor to limit production of ςK. In addition, GerE directly represses transcription of particularcot genes. We show that GerE binds to two sites that span the −35 region of the cotD promoter. A low level of GerE activated transcription of cotD by ςK RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of GerE repressedcotD transcription. The upstream GerE-binding site was required for activation but not for repression. These results suggest that a rising level of GerE in sporulating cells may first activatecotD transcription from the upstream site then repress transcription as the downstream site becomes occupied. Negative regulation by GerE, in addition to its positive effects on transcription, presumably ensures that ςK and spore coat proteins are synthesized at optimal levels to produce a germination-competent spore.

RNA polymerase transcriptional start site polymerase chain reaction N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine base pair Starvation induces the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis to initiate a series of morphological changes that result in the formation of a dormant spore (1Stragier P. Losick R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 297-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Early in the sporulation process a septum forms that divides the cell into a larger mother cell compartment and a smaller forespore compartment. Each compartment contains a copy of the genome, and different genes are expressed in each compartment. Gene expression drives further morphogenesis, including migration of the septum to engulf the forespore in a double membrane, deposition of cell wall-like material called cortex between the membranes, and synthesis in the mother cell of proteins that assemble on the surface of the forespore to produce a tough shell known as the coat. The developmental process culminates with lysis of the mother cell to release a mature spore. When nutrients become available again, the spore germinates, producing a cell that resumes growth and division. The program regulating transcription of sporulation genes is exceptionally well understood (2Kroos L. Zhang B. Ichikawa H. Yu Y.-T.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; (in press): 31PubMed Google Scholar). It involves the synthesis and activation of four compartment-specific ς subunits of RNA polymerase (RNAP),1 each of which directs the enzyme to transcribe a particular set of genes. ςF and ςG control forespore-specific gene expression. In the mother cell, activation of ςE is followed by the synthesis and activation of ςK. In addition, two small, DNA-binding proteins, SpoIIID and GerE, activate or repress transcription of many mother cell-specific genes (3Zhang J. Ichikawa H. Halberg R. Kroos L. Aronson A.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 5Zhang B. Daniel R. Errington J. Kroos L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 972-975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Halberg R. Kroos L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mother cell transcription factors form a hierarchical regulatory cascade in which the synthesis of each factor depends upon the activity of the prior factor, in the order ςE, SpoIIID, ςK, and finally GerE (7Zheng L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition to positive regulation between one transcription factor and the next in the mother cell cascade, there is evidence of negative regulation as well. ςK RNAP initiates a feedback loop that inhibits transcription of the sigE gene encoding ςE (8Zhang B. Kroos L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6138-6144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since ςE RNAP transcribes thespoIIID gene (9Kunkel B. Kroos L. Poth H. Youngman P. Losick R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Stevens C.M. Errington J. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Tatti K.M. Jones C.H. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7828-7833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), production of SpoIIID is also negatively regulated (8Zhang B. Kroos L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6138-6144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Halberg R. Kroos L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 840-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This facilitates the switch from the early ςE- and SpoIIID-directed pattern of gene expression to the late ςK- and GerE-directed pattern. GerE is not a component of this feedback loop (8Zhang B. Kroos L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6138-6144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, there was reason to believe that GerE might initiate a second feedback loop. GerE was shown previously to inhibit transcription in vitro of thesigK gene encoding ςK (4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Whether GerE inhibits sigK transcription in vivo was in doubt, though, because a sigK-lacZ fusion was not overexpressed in gerE mutant cells (13Kunkel B. Sandman K. Panzer S. Youngman P. Losick R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3513-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have resolved this paradox by mapping a GerE-binding site in the sigKpromoter region. This showed that the sigK-lacZfusion examined previously did not contain the entire GerE-binding site. Here, we demonstrate that GerE represses sigKexpression about 2-fold in vivo, and we discuss the implications of this negative feedback. Overexpression of sigK is not the only defect ingerE mutant cells. Expression of some cot genes encoding spore coat proteins is reduced or absent, whereas expression of other genes is increased. The resulting spores have defective coats and germinate inefficiently (14Moir A. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 1106-1116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, it was shown that purified GerE binds to DNA sequences matching the consensus RWWTRGGY-YY (where R is purine; W is A or T; and Y is pyrimidine) and activates transcription in vitro from the cotB andcotC promoters (4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and from three promoters in thecotVWXYZ cluster (3Zhang J. Ichikawa H. Halberg R. Kroos L. Aronson A.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The position of binding ranges in the different promoters from well upstream of the −35 region to partially overlapping it. Here, we show that GerE binds to the cotDpromoter region at a position typical for activation of transcription, and to a position downstream, which may cause repression of transcription. Our mapping of GerE-binding sites in the cotDand sigK promoters provides the first information about how GerE acts as a transcriptional repressor. DNA fragments labeled at only one end were prepared as follows. For analysis of the sigK promoter region, a HindIII-XbaI fragment of pBK16 (15Kroos L. Kunkel B. Losick R. Science. 1989; 243: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) was labeled at the 3′ ends by the Klenow enzyme fill-in reaction and [α-32P]dCTP or at the 5′ ends by treatment with alkaline phosphatase followed by T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. In both cases, the labeled DNA was digested with PstI, which cleaved off a small fragment containing the labeled HindIII end, so it did not interfere with subsequent DNase I footprinting. The labeled XbaI end is 164 bp downstream of the sigK transcriptional start site (TSS). For analysis of the cotD promoter region, pLRK100 (15Kroos L. Kunkel B. Losick R. Science. 1989; 243: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI, which cleaves 227 bp upstream of thecotD TSS, and labeled either at the 3′ end by the Klenow enzyme fill-in reaction and [α-32P]dATP or at the 5′ end by treatment with alkaline phosphatase followed by T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. In both cases, the labeled DNA was digested with HindIII, which cleaves downstream of the cotD promoter, to produce a 443-bp fragment that was purified by elution from an 8% polyacrylamide gel (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Labeled DNA fragments were incubated with different amounts of GerE gel purified from Escherichia coli engineered to overproduce the protein as described previously (3Zhang J. Ichikawa H. Halberg R. Kroos L. Aronson A.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and then mildly digested with DNase I according to method 2 as described previously (4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), except 3 pmol of probe was used and a 7-fold (w/w) excess of poly(dI-dC) as compared with probe was added as competitor. After DNase I treatment, the partially digested DNAs were electrophoresed in a 7% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea alongside a sequencing ladder generated by subjecting the appropriate end-labeled DNA to the chemical cleavage reactions of Maxam and Gilbert as described previously (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA between −115 and +28 relative to the sigK TSS was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using pBK16 (15Kroos L. Kunkel B. Losick R. Science. 1989; 243: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as the template. The upstream primer was 5′ GGGAATTCGATGAAGAATATTTTTAAC 3′ and the downstream primer was 5′ GCGAAGCTTCCACAAAAGTATGTA 3′.EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites (underlined) were designed into the 5′ ends of the upstream and downstream primers, respectively, to allow directional subcloning of the PCR product intoEcoRI-HindIII-digested pTKlac (17Kenney T.J. Moran C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3282-3290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid pHI16 was linearized by digestion withBsaI and transformed into B. subtilis ZB307, in which marker replacement-type recombination created an SPβ::sigK-lacZspecialized transducing phage as described previously (18Zuber P. Losick R. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2223-2230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A phage lysate was prepared by heat induction and used to transduce B. subtilis SG38 (spo + trpC2) and 522.2 (gerE36 trpC2) (19Errington J. Mandelstam J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 132: 2967-2976PubMed Google Scholar) with selection for resistance to chloramphenicol (5 μg/ml) on LB agar as described previously (20Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1990Google Scholar). Sporulation was induced by nutrient exhaustion in DSM at 37 °C as described previously (20Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1990Google Scholar). Samples (1 ml) were collected at hourly intervals during sporulation, cells were pelleted, and pellets were stored at −70 °C prior to the assay. The specific activity of β-galactosidase was determined by the method of Miller (21Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar), usingo-nitrophenol-β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate. One unit of enzyme hydrolyzes 1 μmol of substrate per min per unit of initial cell absorbance at 595 nm. Cells were induced to sporulate by nutrient exhaustion in DSM at 37 °C as described previously (20Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1990Google Scholar). Samples (1 ml) were collected at hourly intervals during sporulation, and whole-cell extracts were prepared as described previously (22Lu S. Halberg R. Kroos L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9722-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Proteins (5 μg) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-14% Prosieve (FMC BioProducts) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Tris/Tricine electrode buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.1m Tricine, 0.1% SDS) and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Blots were incubated as described previously with polyclonal anti-pro-ςK antibodies that detect both pro-ςK and ςK (22Lu S. Halberg R. Kroos L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9722-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Bio-Rad). Chemiluminescence detection (ECL) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The signal intensities were quantified using a GS 505 Molecular Imager System (Bio-Rad). ςK RNAP was partially purified from gerE mutant cells as described previously (15Kroos L. Kunkel B. Losick R. Science. 1989; 243: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The enzyme was comparable in protein composition and incotD- and sigK-transcribing activities to fraction 24 shown in Fig. 2 of Kroos et al. (15Kroos L. Kunkel B. Losick R. Science. 1989; 243: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Transcription reactions (45 μl) were performed as described previously (24Carter H.L. Moran C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9438-9442Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), except that RNAP was allowed to bind to the DNA template for 10 min at 37 °C before the addition of nucleotides (the labeled nucleotide was [α-32P]CTP). Heparin (6 μg) was added 2 min after the addition of nucleotides to prevent reinitiation. After the reactions were stopped, 20 μl of each reaction mixture was subjected to electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea, and transcripts were detected by autoradiography. The signal intensities were quantified using a Storm 820 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To prepare a DNA template containing the cotD promoter and lacking the upstream GerE-binding site, DNA between −44 and +227 relative to the TSS was amplified by the PCR using pLRK100 (15Kroos L. Kunkel B. Losick R. Science. 1989; 243: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as the template. The upstream primer was 5′ CGGTTTGCATCAGAACATGT3′ (the underlined portion corresponds to the nontranscribed strand of the cotD promoter region), and the downstream primer was 5′ GGAAGCTTGCATGCCTGCA 3′ (the underlined portioncorresponds to a HindIII site downstream of thecotD promoter in pLRK100). Purified GerE was shown previously to strongly inhibit transcription in vitro of the sigK gene by ςK RNAP (4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, expression of asigK-lacZ fusion in vivo was unaffected by agerE mutation (13Kunkel B. Sandman K. Panzer S. Youngman P. Losick R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3513-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The discrepancy between the two results could be explained if the sigK-lacZ fusion did not contain a binding site for GerE that mediates repression. To see if GerE binds specifically in the sigK promoter region and, if so, to determine the position of binding, we performed DNase I footprinting experiments. Fig. 1 shows that GerE protected a stretch of DNA from DNase I digestion that included the TSS ofsigK and extended downstream. The protection spanned positions −4 to +19 on the nontranscribed strand (Fig. 1 A) and positions +1 to +20 on the transcribed strand (Fig. 1 B). Complete protection from DNase I digestion was observed at the lowest concentration of GerE tested, indicating that GerE binds with relatively high affinity to this site as compared with other GerE-binding sites mapped previously (3Zhang J. Ichikawa H. Halberg R. Kroos L. Aronson A.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C shows the sequence of the sigK promoter in the region protected by GerE. Within the protected region are two sequences in inverted orientation that overlap slightly and match the consensus sequence for GerE binding (Fig. 1 D). We conclude that GerE binds to a site in the sigK promoter region that overlaps the TSS and extends downstream. Presumably, GerE binding to this site represses sigK transcription in vitro (4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) by interfering with RNA polymerase binding and/or a subsequent step in initiation. The location of the GerE-binding site provides a plausible explanation for the lack of an effect of agerE mutation on sigK-lacZ expression reported previously (13Kunkel B. Sandman K. Panzer S. Youngman P. Losick R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3513-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sigK portion of the fusion extended only to +4, so it did not contain the entire GerE-binding site. To determine whether GerE affects sigK expression in vivo, we constructed a new sigK-lacZ transcriptional fusion that includes the GerE-binding site. DNA between −115 and +28 relative to the sigK TSS was fused to lacZ, and the fusion was recombined into phage SPβ. The resulting SPβ::sigK-lacZ phage was transduced into wild-type and gerE mutant B. subtilis, creating lysogens. Fig. 2 shows the average β-galactosidase activity during sporulation of three isolates of each type. The average maximum activity was 2-fold higher in gerEmutant cells than in wild-type cells, demonstrating that GerE inhibitssigK expression in vivo. We also compared the level of sigK gene products in developing wild-type and gerE mutant cells. The primary translation product of sigK is pro-ςK, an inactive precursor that is proteolytically processed to active ςK (22Lu S. Halberg R. Kroos L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9722-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We used anti-pro-ςK antibodies to detect both pro-ςK and ςK in extracts of cells subjected to Western blot analysis. Fig.3 shows that the levels of pro-ςK and ςK are higher in gerEmutant cells than in wild-type cells late in sporulation. Quantitation of the combined pro-ςK plus ςK signal for the experiment shown in Fig. 3 and three additional experiments showed that the maximum level of SigK gene products in wild-type cells during sporulation, on average, reached 57% (±6%, 1 S.D.) of the level ingerE mutant cells. In all four experiments, the level of both pro-ςK and ςK was elevated in T7 and T8 samples from the gerEmutant compared with wild type. These results show that GerE normally inhibits the accumulation of pro-ςK and ςKduring the late stages of sporulation. It is likely that GerE represses transcription of the sigK gene, reducing the synthesis of pro-ςK and ςK. This would explain the similar 2-fold decrease of sigK-directed β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2) and pro-ςK plus ςK (Fig.3) in wild-type cells compared with gerE mutant cells. The alternative explanation that GerE in wild-type cells causes increased turnover of pro-ςK and ςK and a similar increase in turnover of β-galactosidase is unlikely because β-galactosidase activity from a sigK-lacZ fusion lacking the GerE-binding site identified in Fig. 1 is similar during sporulation of wild-type and gerE mutant cells (13Kunkel B. Sandman K. Panzer S. Youngman P. Losick R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3513-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as is β-galactosidase activity from lacZ fusions to many other genes. In addition to possible inhibitory effects of GerE on transcription of genes in the ςK regulon (due to the inhibition of ςKaccumulation by GerE), GerE stimulates expression of certain genes in the ςK regulon (3Zhang J. Ichikawa H. Halberg R. Kroos L. Aronson A.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7Zheng L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Expression of acotD-lacZ transcriptional fusion was 7-fold higher in developing wild-type cells than in gerE mutant cells (7Zheng L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It was shown previously that purified GerE stimulates cotDtranscription by ςK RNAP 2–3-fold (4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We discovered that at a higher concentration GerE inhibits cotDtranscription in vitro. Fig. 4shows the result of an in vitro transcription experiment with a mixture of DNA templates containing the cotD orcotC promoter. The cotC promoter was included as an internal control because GerE has been shown to bind to a site centered at −68.5 relative to the TSS and to activate transcription by ςK RNA polymerase (4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Lower levels of GerE stimulatedcotD transcription about 2-fold (based on quantitation of signals in the experiment shown and one additional experiment), as reported previously (4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but higher concentrations of GerE inhibitedcotD transcription. The inhibition was specific tocotD, since cotC transcription was activated at the highest concentration of GerE tested. To understand how GerE both positively and negatively affects cotD transcription, we tested whether GerE binds in the promoter region by performing DNase I footprinting experiments. Fig. 5 shows that GerE protected a stretch of DNA from DNase I digestion that included the −35 region of the cotD promoter and extended upstream. On the nontranscribed strand, the protection spanned positions −39 to −25 relative to the TSS (Fig. 5 A), whereas on the transcribed strand positions −60 to −23 were protected. We could not be certain whether protection extends farther upstream on the nontranscribed strand due to the absence of DNase I cleavage in this region even in the absence of GerE. GerE appears to bind to the cotDpromoter region with lower affinity than to the sigKpromoter region, since a higher concentration of GerE was required to observe protection from DNase I digestion (compare Figs. 1 and 5). Fig.5 C shows the sequence of the cotD promoter in the region protected by GerE. Typically, GerE protects a stretch of about 20 bp from DNase I digestion (3Zhang J. Ichikawa H. Halberg R. Kroos L. Aronson A.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The long region of protection (nearly 40 bp) observed on the transcribed strand in thecotD promoter region suggests that GerE binds to two sites. Within this region is a perfect match (positions −53 to −42) to the consensus sequence for GerE binding (Fig. 5 D). A second match (7 out of 10) to the consensus sequence is present at positions −20 to −31, in inverted orientation with respect to the first match (Fig. 5 D), which probably accounts for GerE binding in this region. We hypothesized that GerE bound at the upstream site in the cotD promoter (i.e. recognizing the perfect match to the consensus centered at −47.5) activates transcription, because GerE binds at a similar position in thecotB (4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and cotVWX (3Zhang J. Ichikawa H. Halberg R. Kroos L. Aronson A.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) promoters and activates transcription. GerE bound at the cotD promoter downstream site (centered at −25.5) might repress transcription, explaining the inhibition of cotD transcription we observed (Fig. 4). To test these ideas, we repeated the in vitro transcription experiments with a cotD DNA template lacking the upstream GerE-binding site. As shown in Fig. 6, GerE failed to activate transcription of this template. However, GerE still repressed transcription of this template, under conditions that permitted GerE to activate cotC transcription. We conclude that GerE binding to the upstream site in the cotD promoter is required to activate transcription. GerE binding to the downstream site probably represses transcription, although we cannot rule out the possibility that GerE binding farther downstream is also necessary and was not detected by DNase I footprinting. Our results strongly support the model that GerE is a repressor ofsigK transcription which lowers the level of pro-ςK and ςK in cells during the late stages of sporulation. The previous finding that GerE inhibitssigK transcription in vitro (4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) can be explained by GerE binding near the TSS (Fig. 1) and acting as a repressor. The previous observation that expression of a sigK-lacZ fusion lacking the GerE-binding site in the promoter region is unaffected by agerE mutation (13Kunkel B. Sandman K. Panzer S. Youngman P. Losick R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3513-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), together with our finding that expression of a sigK-lacZ fusion containing the GerE-binding site is 2-fold lower in wild-type cells than in gerE mutant cells (Fig. 2), demonstrates the importance of the GerE-binding site for sigK regulation in vivo. The lowering ofsigK expression by GerE in wild-type cells appears to result in a comparable decrease in the level of SigK gene products (Fig. 3). The simplest interpretation of these results is that GerE repressessigK transcription, limiting the synthesis of pro-ςK and ςK during sporulation. The negative effect of GerE on the ςK level during sporulation would lower expression of genes for which ςKis the limiting factor for transcription. Four genes in the ςK regulon show a lower level of expression in wild-type cells than in gerE mutant cells. These are cotA(25Sandman K. Kroos L. Cutting S. Youngman P. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 461-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), spoVF (26Daniel R.A. Errington J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), csk22 (27Henriques A.O. Bryan E.M. Beall B.W. Moran C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 389-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cotM(28Henriques A.O. Beall B.W. Moran C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1887-1897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of cotA, there is evidence of a direct effect of GerE on transcription. Purified GerE inhibits cotAtranscription in vitro (4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is unknown how much of the increased cotA expression observed in a gerEmutant (25Sandman K. Kroos L. Cutting S. Youngman P. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 461-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) results from loss of direct inhibition by GerE and how much results from an elevated level of ςK. Also unknown is whether GerE represses spoVF, csk22, orcotM directly, or whether these genes are overexpressed in agerE mutant because GerE fails to repress sigK. It should be possible to answer some of these questions and, more generally, to assess the importance of GerE repression ofsigK during sporulation and germination, by deleting the GerE-binding site in the sigK promoter. The cotD gene, like many other genes in the ςKregulon, is positively regulated by GerE. For several genes, GerE has been shown to bind upstream of the promoter −35 region and stimulate transcription by ςK RNAP in vitro (3Zhang J. Ichikawa H. Halberg R. Kroos L. Aronson A.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). GerE can increase cotD transcription in vitro as shown previously (4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but we discovered that a higher concentration of GerE causes repression (Fig. 4). DNase I footprinting revealed that GerE protects not only DNA upstream of the −35 region in thecotD promoter, but the protection extends downstream through the −35 region (Fig. 5). Binding that extends through the −35 region has not been observed in other promoters activated by GerE (3Zhang J. Ichikawa H. Halberg R. Kroos L. Aronson A.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We reasoned that GerE binding in the cotD −35 region might repress transcription, and we showed that truncation of cotDpromoter DNA at −44 prevented activation, but allowed repression, by GerE (Fig. 6). These in vitro results suggest the model that a rising level of GerE in sporulating cells first activatescotD transcription by binding upstream of the −35 region and then represses transcription by binding to a second site just downstream. It should be straightforward to test the requirement for the upstream GerE-binding site for activation in vivo, by making the appropriate 5′ deletion (e.g. to −44) and measuring expression of a fusion to a reporter gene. However, testing the role of the downstream GerE-binding site in repression in vivo will be more difficult. As noted above, one must be careful to distinguish between direct repressive effects of GerE and indirect effects due to GerE repression of sigK. Fig. 7 illustrates the regulatory interactions between the four mother cell-specific transcription factors (circled) and our model for regulation ofcotD transcription at different times during sporulation. Early in sporulation, ςE and SpoIIID are active in the mother cell (Fig. 7 A). At this time, sigK is transcribed by ςE RNAP, with SpoIIID serving as an essential activator (6Halberg R. Kroos L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Kunkel B. Sandman K. Panzer S. Youngman P. Losick R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3513-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As we have shown for GerE (Figs. 5 and 6), it was shown previously that SpoIIID binds in the −35 region of thecotD promoter and represses transcription in vitro (6Halberg R. Kroos L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 B shows the regulatory interactions in the mother cell slightly later, at about 4 h into the sporulation process, when the primary product of the sigK gene, pro-ςK, is processed to active ςK in response to a signal from the forespore (22Lu S. Halberg R. Kroos L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9722-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29Cutting S. Oke V. Driks A. Losick R. Lu S. Kroos L. Cell. 1990; 62: 239-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). ςK RNAP initiates a negative feedback loop that inhibits transcription of thesigE gene encoding ςE, which in turn lowers expression of spoIIID (8Zhang B. Kroos L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6138-6144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Halberg R. Kroos L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 840-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As the levels of ςE RNAP and SpoIIID fall, cotD transcription would no longer be repressed by SpoIIID. At the same time, ςK RNAP transcribes gerE (4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Cutting S. Panzer S. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and, according to our model, the GerE produced initially activatescotD transcription and represses sigKtranscription. For a period, all four mother cell-specific transcription factors probably affect transcription of sigK, because SpoIIID activates both ςE RNAP and ςK RNAP to transcribe sigK (6Halberg R. Kroos L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Kunkel B. Sandman K. Panzer S. Youngman P. Losick R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3513-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and GerE represses sigK transcription (4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). The positive autoregulatory loop created by ςK RNAP transcription ofsigK is kept in check by two negative feedback loops (Fig.7 B). One inhibits transcription of sigE and therefore inhibits production of ςE and SpoIIID (8Zhang B. Kroos L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6138-6144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other leads to synthesis of GerE, which represses sigKtranscription directly (4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). As the level of GerE rises later in sporulation, GerE may also repress cotD (Fig.7 C). Presumably, the complex regulatory interactions depicted in Fig. 7 ensure that the four transcription factors, as well as structural proteins like CotD under their control, are made at optimal levels for formation of the spore cortex and coat. Our mapping of GerE-binding sites in the sigK andcotD promoters and our in vitro transcription experiments with cotD promoter fragments differing at the 5′ end provide the first insight into how GerE acts as a repressor. In both the sigK and cotD promoters, GerE binds within the region likely to be bound by ςK RNAP, although the footprints of ςK RNAP on these promoters have not yet been determined. The positions of GerE binding in these promoters suggest that GerE may repress transcription by interfering with the initial binding of ςK RNAP or a subsequent step in transcription initiation. It may be possible to distinguish between these possibilities by measuring the ability of ςK RNAP to bind to these promoters in the presence or absence of GerE. In the case of cotD, it is unlikely that GerE inhibits elongation of transcripts or inhibits transcription by any other mechanism that does not depend on sequence-specific DNA binding, because GerE stimulated cotC transcription in the same reaction mixtures in which it inhibited cotD transcription (Figs. 4 and 6). These same in vitro transcription experiments, withcotD promoter fragments differing at the 5′ ends, suggest that at a low GerE concentration, binding to a site upstream of the −35 region activates transcription, and at a higher GerE concentration, binding to a second site just downstream represses transcription. In the DNase I footprint experiment shown in Fig. 5, there is no indication that GerE binds with higher affinity to the upstream site (a perfect match to the GerE binding consensus sequence) than the downstream site (a 7 out of 10 match to the consensus). Although we cannot rule out a slight difference in affinities, another possible explanation is that ςK RNAP competes with GerE for binding to the downstream site but not the upstream site. GerE appeared to bind with higher affinity to the sigKpromoter region than to the cotD promoter region (compare Figs. 1 and 5) or many other GerE-binding sites mapped previously (3Zhang J. Ichikawa H. Halberg R. Kroos L. Aronson A.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,4Zheng L. Halberg R. Roels S. Ichikawa H. Kroos L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Within the region of the sigK promoter protected by GerE from DNase I digestion are two sequences in inverted orientation that overlap by 4 bases and match the consensus sequence for GerE binding perfectly or in 7 out of 10 positions. An identical arrangement of sequences matching the GerE consensus was observed previously just upstream of the −35 region in the cotYZ promoter, where GerE appeared to bind with high affinity and activated transcription (3Zhang J. Ichikawa H. Halberg R. Kroos L. Aronson A.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether more than one molecule of GerE at a time binds the sigK and cotYZ sites. Also unknown is whether GerE is monomeric in solution. GerE is predicted to possess a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif similar to that in several proteins whose three-dimensional structure has been determined (31Holland S.K. Cutting S. Mandelstam J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 2381-2391PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kahn D. Ditta G. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 987-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Some of these well characterized proteins are dimeric and recognize inverted repeats in the DNA-binding sites (33Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). The consensus GerE-binding sequence is not palindromic, so perhaps GerE can bind as a monomer. This does not exclude the possibility of interaction between monomers at sites that exhibit palindromic character, such as thesigK and cotYZ sites. GerE appears to be similar to SpoIIID in terms of its DNA sequence recognition characteristics. The SpoIIID-binding site consensus sequence (WWRRACAR-Y) is of similar length and degeneracy as that recognized by GerE (RWWTRGGY-YY) and also is not palindromic (5Zhang B. Daniel R. Errington J. Kroos L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 972-975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Halberg R. Kroos L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although SpoIIID appears to be monomeric in solution, 2B. Zhang and L. Kroos, unpublished work. many strong SpoIIID-binding sites exhibit a second good match to the consensus in inverted orientation relative to the best match (6Halberg R. Kroos L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis will be required to assess the contribution of each consensus match to binding of GerE and SpoIIID at sites with palindromic character and to determine whether two monomers interact (e.g. bind cooperatively) at these sites. In summary, we have investigated the biochemical basis for negative regulation by the GerE protein. It appears to act like a classical repressor, binding in promoter regions at sites that overlap the position of RNAP binding. GerE repression at the sigKpromoter lowers ςK production during sporulation about 2-fold, potentially regulating the expression of many genes in the ςK regulon. In addition, GerE binds in the promoter regions of certain genes in the ςK regulon and directly represses or activates transcription by ςK RNAP. In the case of cotD, it is likely that GerE binds to a site upstream of the promoter −35 region and first activates transcription, then, as its level rises in sporulating cells, GerE binds to a site slightly farther downstream and represses transcription.

These selectively binding complementary (SBC) agents can invade duplex DNA and hybridize to each strand (Kutyavin, I. V., Rhinehart, R. L., Lukhtanov, E. A., Gorn, V. V., Meyer, R. B., and Gamper, H. B. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 11170–11176). Antisense ODNs with similar properties should be less encumbered by RNA secondary structure. Here we show that SBC ODNs strand invade a hairpin in the mini-exon RNA of Leishmania amazonensis and that the resulting heteroduplexes are substrates for Escherichia coli RNase H. SBC ODNs either with phosphodiester or phosphorothioate backbones form more stable hybrids with RNA than normal base (NB) ODNs. Optimal binding was observed when the entire hairpin sequence was targeted. Translation of L. amazonensis mRNA in a cell-free extract was more efficiently inhibited by SBC ODNs complementary to the mini-exon hairpin than by the corresponding NB ODNs. Nonspecific protein binding in the cell-free extract by phosphorothioate SBC ODNs rendered them ineffective as antisense agents in vitro. SBC phosphorothioate ODNs displayed a modest but significant improvement of leishmanicidal properties compared with NB phosphorothioate ODNs.

Maturation of mRNAs includes a trans-splicing event, which transfers a 39-nucleotide segment of the mini-exon derived pre-RNA (the medRNA)1 to the 5′ end of every message (3Borst P. Annu. Rev.

The trypanosomatid medRNA was proposed to adopt a secondary structure based upon conservation of folding pattern for different RNA (10Bruzik J.P. Van Doren K. Hirsh D. Steitz J.A. Nature. 1988; 335: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recently the Leptomonas collosoma medRNA was shown to switch between two alternate structures (11Lecuyer K. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5301-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Harris K.A. Crothers D.M. Ullu E. RNA. 1995; 1: 351-362PubMed Google Scholar). One form leads to a base pairing pattern conserved for all of the trypanosome medRNA, suggesting critical functional interactions for splicing (11Lecuyer K. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5301-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In L. amazonensis the mini-exon was shown to fold into a structure that interferes with the hybridization of antisense ODNs (13Verspieren P. Loreau N. Thuong N.T. Shire D. Toulmé J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4711-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Pascolo E. Hudrisier D. Sproat B. Thuong N.T. Toulmé J.-J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). RNA intramolecular structures that prevent the formation of oligonucleotide-RNA intermolecular complexes weaken antisense effects. This limitation has prompted the design of oligonucleotides able to overcome the mini-exon structure (for a review, see Ref. 15Toulmé J.J. Le Tinévez R. Brossalina E. Biochimie. 1996; 78: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In a recent report, the L. amazonensis mini-exon sequence was efficiently complexed by an ODN capable of folding back on itself to form a triple strand with the putative hairpin element (16Pascolo E. Toulmé J.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24187-24192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This “double hairpin” complex readily formed at pH 6.0 using a pyrimidine motif for triplexing. However, this oligomer did not show selective inhibitory properties in cell-free translation experiments, probably due to pH conditions that are not appropriate for the formation of a triple helix involving C-G*C+ triplets. Alternatively, the disruption of the secondary structure by oligomers of high affinity can be considered. We have been investigating selectively binding complementary (SBC) ODNs as an alternative for targeting structured nucleic acids (17Kutyavin I.V. Rhinehart R.L. Lukhtanov E.A. Gorn V.V. Meyer R.B. Gamper H.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11170-11176Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Woo J. Meyer R. Gamper H.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2470-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These ODNs are intended to be used as complementary pairs or as a single self-complementary agent. Due to the presence of modified bases, they are unable to form stable hybrids with one another but should hybridize to normal DNA or RNA complements. We have shown that SBC ODNs containing 2-aminoadenine and 2-thiothymine bases can strand invade the end of double-stranded DNA in a process that is favored both kinetically and thermodynamically (17Kutyavin I.V. Rhinehart R.L. Lukhtanov E.A. Gorn V.V. Meyer R.B. Gamper H.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11170-11176Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The A/U-rich hairpin proposed for the L. amazonensis mini-exon sequence presents an ideal target for testing whether SBC ODNs can strand invade an RNA stem loop by hybridizing to every base of the element. In this study we experimentally confirmed the hairpin structure of theL. amazonensis mini-exon sequence and demonstrated that antisense ODNs with SBC character are more effective than normal base (NB) ODNs in addressing this hairpin. Our results show that SBC ODNs form very stable hybrids with the entire hairpin sequence, and that the heteroduplexes are substrates for Escherichia coli RNase H. We demonstrated that SBC ODN-RNA hybrids inhibit translation ofL. amazonensis mRNA in a cell-free extract when RNase H is present. The successful targeting of a simple hairpin by SBC ODNs suggests that other secondary structure features in RNA should also be accessible to these ODNs. Preparation of protected phosphoramidite precursors of 2-thiothymidine and 2-aminoadenosine and synthesis of SBC ODNs using these reagents have been described (17Kutyavin I.V. Rhinehart R.L. Lukhtanov E.A. Gorn V.V. Meyer R.B. Gamper H.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11170-11176Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). NB ODNs with DNA, RNA, or 2′-O-methyl backbones were synthesized by routine procedures using commercially available chemicals. The Beaucage reagent was used to prepare NB and SBC ODNs with a phosphorothioate backbone (19Iyer P.I. Lawrence R.P. Egan W. Regan J.B. Beaucage S.L. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 4693-4698Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). All antisense ODNs contained a 3′-hexanol end group as a consequence of using a modified hexanol primer controlled pore glass support (20Gamper H.B. Reed M.W. Cox T. Virosco J.S. Adams A.D. Gall A.A. Scholler J.K. Meyer Jr., R.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Capillary gel electrophoresis indicated that the SBC ODNs were at least 85% pure, and hydrolysates of SBC ODNs prepared as described previously (17Kutyavin I.V. Rhinehart R.L. Lukhtanov E.A.

Extinction coefficients of ODNs were calculated using a nearest neighbor model (21Cantor C. Warshaw M.M. Shapiro H. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 1059-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar) and employed values of 9,800 m−1 cm−1 for 2-thiothymidine (22Cheong C. Tinoco I. Chollet A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5115-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and 6,800 m−1cm−1 for 2-aminoadenosine (23Connolly B.A. Newman P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4957-4974Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) at 260 nm. The mini-exon RNA of L. amazonensis was prepared by in vitro transcription of pBluescriptIIKS in which the mini-exon sequence was cloned downstream of the T7 promoter, using Ampliscribe T7 transcription kit (Tebu). In the resulting transcript, the original mini-exon sequence was flanked by sequences derived from the vector, both on the 5′ (5′-GGGCGAAUUGGAGCUC) and on the 3′ sides (5′-GAUC). The RNA was purified by electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. 5′-End-labeled mini-exon RNA (100 pmol) was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1 unit of S1 nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim), in a 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 28 mm NaCl and 4.5 mmZnSO4. RNases T1 and V1 (Boehringer Mannheim) digestions were performed for 10 and 20 min, respectively, in 20 mmHEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 140 mm KCl, 20 mm sodium acetate, and 3 mm MgCl2(S buffer). Cleavage by 15 μm methyl propidium-EDTA-Fe(II) complexes was carried out for 10 min at 37 °C in S buffer. RNase T1 digestion under denaturing conditions was achieved for 10 min at 50 °C in 20 mm sodium acetate and 5 m urea. Digestion products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide denaturing gel followed by autoradiography. Complementary ODNs were diluted in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mmMgCl2, and 140 mm KCl to give 2 μm of each ODN. Hybridization was assured by rapid heat-cooling of the samples. A 260 was recorded as a function of temperature in a Lambda 2 (Perkin-Elmer) spectrophotometer equipped with a PTP-6 automatic multicell temperature programmer. Samples were heated at the rate of 0.5 °C/min. Melting temperatures (Tm values) were determined from the derivative maxima. The mini-exon RNA prepared by in vitro transcription as described above was labeled by incorporating [α-32P]ATP (37.5 MBq/mmol). RNA and oligonucleotide were heated separately for 5 min at 65 °C and cooled down on ice. One pmol of RNA was mixed with the desired ODN in 15 μl of 50 mm Tris acetate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm magnesium acetate. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. The samples were then run in the same Tris buffer at 10 V/cm for about 15 h, on a 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. The activity in the bands corresponding to the free and bound RNA species was evaluated by PhosphorImager analysis or by Cerenkov counting. The dissociation constant was taken as the ODN concentration at which 50% of the target RNA was retarded. Total RNA was isolated from L. amazonensispromastigotes by the guanidine chloride method (6Pascolo E. Blonski C. Shire D. Toulmé J.-J. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In vitrotranslation of this RNA (1 μg) was catalyzed by wheat germ extract (25 μl; Promega) or rabbit reticulocyte lysate (35 μl; Promega) in a total volume of 50 μl. Antisense ODN was added to the RNA on ice, immediately before the initiation of translation, and reactions were conducted for 1 h, at 25 °C (wheat germ extract) or 30 °C (rabbit reticulocyte lysate) in the presence of [35S]methionine (37 TBq/mmol; Amersham). Some incubations were supplemented with 2.5 units of E. coli RNase H (Boehringer Mannheim). Reaction aliquots were analyzed for labeled proteins by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid onto Whatman GF/A glass fiber filters and counting in a liquid scintillation counter. Relative levels of protein synthesis were calculated as described previously (13Verspieren P. Loreau N. Thuong N.T. Shire D. Toulmé J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4711-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A synthetic RNA 35-mer was used for RNase H mapping of L. amazonensis mini-exon-ODN complexes. Prior to incubation with RNase H, the oligonucleotide and the RNA were treated as described for electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 5′-End-labeled RNA was then mixed with the desired ODN at a final concentration of 2 and 50 μm, respectively, in a 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The mixture was kept at 4 °C for 15 min prior to incubation with 0–4 units of E. coli RNase H (Promega) for 15 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding one volume of 8m urea. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. Preparation of macrophages and parasites was carried out as described (8Ramazeilles C. Mishra R.K. Moreau S. Pascolo E. Toulmé J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7859-7863Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Leishmania amazonensis (LV79 strain), prepared from infected BALB/c mice, was used to infect adherent macrophages at a multiplicity of 5 parasites/cell, resulting in more than 70% infected cells. This was normalized to 100% for comparison between different experiments. Infected macrophages were incubated at 34 °C with the desired oligonucleotide concentration for 48 h in RPMI/HEPES medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cultures were then washed, fixed in methanol, and stained with Giemsa. Cells were observed by microscopy to determine the level of infection. About 500 macrophages were scored for each oligonucleotide concentration; a cell was identified as infected when it contained at least one recognizable parasite. The mini-exon region is known to fold into secondary structures (11Lecuyer K. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5301-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Harris K.A. Crothers D.M. Ullu E. RNA. 1995; 1: 351-362PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the structure of a 35-nucleotide-long mini-exon sequence in which the four modified nucleotides (24Bangs J.D. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. McCloskey J.A. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9805-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at the 5′ end of the natural sequence were omitted (Figs.1 and 2). Indirect evidence favors the existence of a stable structure in the mini-exon sequence of L. amazonensis. Anomalous electrophoretic mobility of this oligomer as well as low binding efficiency of complementary oligonucleotides have been observed previously (6Pascolo E. Blonski C. Shire D. Toulmé J.-J. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 13Verspieren P. Loreau N. Thuong N.T. Shire D. Toulmé J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4711-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Prior to initiating the targeting of this structure with NB and SBC ODNs, we confirmed its existence by footprinting. The cleavage pattern obtained with nuclease S1, RNases T1 and V1, and methylpropidium-EDTA (MPE) led to the secondary structure shown in Fig.1. Positions 23–26, which are cleaved by S1 nuclease (lane 4), correspond to the apical loop of the imperfect hairpin. Whereas G23 was a cleavage site for RNase T1, no band corresponding to G17 and G29 was observed suggesting a structured region. This was further confirmed by RNase V1 and MPE, which preferentially cleave double-stranded structures. The reduced cleavage observed with RNase V1 compared with MPE in the upper part of the stem might be related to the bulged U20. The double-stranded stem likely extends to the U35-U37/A13-A11 region as indicated both by RNase V1 and MPE sensitivity, whereas both G8 and G39,G40 have a clear single-strandedness character. The structure of the upper part of the stem is in fair agreement with previous models (11Lecuyer K. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5301-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); the differences at the bottom of the stem region are related to the different sequences used.Figure 2Antisense ODNs used to target the mini-exon sequence of L. amazonensis. The mini-exon sequence, with paired bases underlined, is at thetop (39Miller S.I. Landfear S.M. Wirth D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7341-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Four antisense ODNs 15Le-I, 15Le-II, 25Le, and 16Le are aligned below together with DNA (DNA-I/II) and RNA (RNA-I/II) complements to 15Le-I and 15Le-II. 15Le-I, 15Le-II, and 25Le were synthesized with PO and PS backbones and contained adenine and thymine bases (NB) or 2-aminoadenine and 2-thiothymine bases (SBC). 15Le-I and 15Le-II were also synthesized with a 2′-O-methyl backbone and contained uracil in place of thymine. 16Le has been previously used to target the mini-exon sequence (8Ramazeilles C. Mishra R.K. Moreau S. Pascolo E. Toulmé J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7859-7863Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and contained a NB sequence and either a PO or PS backbone. The 3′-hexanol group present on every antisense ODN except 16Le is not shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The mini-exon sequence of L. amazonensis is an attractive target for evaluating SBC ODNs as antisense agents. The high A/U content (77%) of the hairpin and its flanking arms should favor the use of SBC ODNs that contain 2-aminoadenine and 2-thiothymine bases in place of adenine and thymine. These base analogs cannot hydrogen-bond to one another, due to steric clash, but can form good pairs with complementary unmodified bases (17Kutyavin I.V. Rhinehart R.L. Lukhtanov E.A. Gorn V.V. Meyer R.B. Gamper H.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11170-11176Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As a consequence, an SBC ODN complementary to the hairpin element of the mini-exon should be single-stranded and yet capable of strand invading the stem-loop structure. In this case the upper 8-base pair stem of the hairpin would be replaced by 20 base pairs formed between the ODN and the RNA. Moreover, 9 of these new base pairs would be highly stable 2-aminoadenine-uracil doublets with three hydrogen bonds (25Howard F.B. Miles H.T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6723-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To promote annealing, both NB and SBC ODNs were synthesized as 25-mers (25Le; see Fig. 2) with the 5 extra bases complementary to the 5′ arm at the base of the hairpin. SBC ODN pairs were also compared with NB ODN pairs as agents to target the mini-exon hairpin. These 15-mer ODNs were complementary to the 5′ or 3′ half of the hairpin (15Le-I or 15Le-II; see Fig. 2). Annealing was again promoted by making a 5-base-long segment of each ODN complementary to one of the overhangs at the base of the hairpin. Hybridization of both ODNs to the hairpin generated a 30-base pair DNA-RNA hybrid with a nick separating the ODNs. By employing two paired ODNs instead of a single self-complementary ODN, the likelihood of mutual interaction between the NB ODNs was significantly reduced and the potential advantage of the SBC pair accordingly diminished. NB and SBC versions of 25Le or 15Le-I + 15Le-II were synthesized with phosphodiester (PO) or phosphorothioate (PS) backbones. Properties of these ODNs were compared relative to 16Le, a NB 16-mer (Fig. 2) used in a previous study (8Ramazeilles C. Mishra R.K. Moreau S. Pascolo E. Toulmé J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7859-7863Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since the entire sequence of a stable hairpin was being targeted, the various antisense ODNs were prone to hairpin formation as well. Self-association of these ODNs was examined by UV-absorption thermal denaturation. While none of the SBC ODNs gave a melting transition, PO and PS versions of NB 25Le gave melting temperatures (Tm) of 46 and 31 °C, respectively (TableI). The NB combination of 15Le-I + 15Le-II formed a very weak hybrid when both ODNs had a PO backbone (Tm = 13 °C) and no hybrid at all when they possessed a PS backbone. The results obtained with antisense sequences are in fair agreement with the expected pairing properties of the ODNs; NB-containing oligomers give rise to more stable antisense structures than SBC ODNs and are therefore less likely to hybridize with the target sense sequence.Table IStability of hybrids formed by antisense Le ODNs with each other and with complementary DNA or RNA targetsODNs and hybridsT mNB/POaDenotes bases and backbone composition of antisense ODNs.SBC/PONB/PSSBC/PSNB/2′-OMe°C15Le-I + 15 Le-II13—bND, not determined; —, no transition was detected.——ND25Le46—31—ND15Le-I + DNA-I46ND35494615Le-I + RNA-I41ND29576315Le-II + DNA-II485940ND5015Le-II + RNA-II375828ND62a Denotes bases and backbone composition of antisense ODNs.b ND, not determined; —, no transition was detected. Open table in a new tab Absorption thermal denaturation was also used to compare the relative stabilities of hybrids formed by 15Le-I or 15Le-II with complementary DNA or RNA oligomers. Our results show that SBC ODNs with PO or PS backbones form more stable hybrids with DNA and RNA than the analogous NB ODNs (Table I). While the enhanced stability of SBC ODN-DNA hybrids (ΔTm = 11–14 °C) is probably attributable to the additional hydrogen bond present in 2-aminoadenine/thymine base pairs, the even greater stability of SBC ODN-RNA hybrids (ΔTm = 21–28 °C) requires further explanation. One possibility is that SBC ODNs favor the formation of an A-motif duplex with RNA. Indeed, the SBC/PO 15Le-II hybrid with RNA-II is similar in stability to the hybrid formed using an ODN with a 2′-O-methyl backbone, a combination that favors an A-type duplex (Table I). Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis was used to compare hybridization of NB and SBC ODNs to the RNA mini-exon hairpin. Fig. 3 shows representative autoradiographs from which K d values were extracted (Table II). NB 15Le-I and NB 15Le-II were poor binding agents, with the PS analogs worse than the PO analogs. Dissociation constants for 15Le-II were in the high micromolar range: 20 and 150 μm for NB/PO and NB/PS analogs, respectively. SBC versions of the same ODNs were much more effective binding agents. For example, the K d values of hybrids formed by PO or PS versions of SBC 15Le-II were about 50- or 200-fold smaller than the K d values of the corresponding complexes formed by NB 15Le-II ODNs. This agrees fairly well with theTm values obtained with complementary RNA (see above); SBC ODNs were better able to open the hairpin structure of the mini-exon. For comparison we evaluated the binding of a standard 16-mer used in a previous study (8Ramazeilles C. Mishra R.K. Moreau S. Pascolo E. Toulmé J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7859-7863Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); the PO and PS 16Le were characterized byK d of 0.7 and 5 μm, respectively.Table IIEquilibrium dissociation constants for the binding of NB and SBC antisense ODNs to the mini-exon RNA of L. amazonensisODNsK dNB/POSBC/PONB/PSSBC/PSμm15Le-I>>10.3>>20.215Le-II200.41500.815Le-I + 15Le-II40.52500.625Le200.25500.7 Open table in a new tab Binding of both 15Le-I and 15Le-II to RNA created a duplex twice as long as that formed by either ODN alone. The two SBC ODN-RNA hybrids had K d values of about 5 × 10−7m, while the NB ODN-RNA hybrids had K dvalues at least 10-fold higher. This is probably related both to the increased affinity of the SBC oligomers for RNA and to the reduced ability of SBC 15-mers to pair with each other, in comparison to NB ODNs. The partially self-complementary 25Le ODNs provided an opportunity to compare the binding efficiencies of single-stranded SBC ODNs to that of structured NB ODNs. In each instance, the SBC ODN was the most effective binding agent (about 70-fold reduction inK d). Hybrids that contained an SBC 25Le ODN were as stable as hybrids that contained paired SBC 15Le ODNs, indicating a minor contribution of duplex length (25 versus 30 base pairs) and molecularity of the hybridization reaction (bimolecularversus trimolecular). The NB and SBC ODNs with a PO backbone were tested for antisense activity against total mRNA from L. amazonensis in a cell-free translation system catalyzed by wheat germ extract. In this model system, SBC 25Le was the most effective antisense agent (Fig. 4). It elicited half-maximal inhibition at 0.08 μm (the C1/2 value). These parameters compare favorably to those of reference ODN 16Le (which has a PO backbone and contains NB bases), which has a C1/2 of about 1 μm. In repeated tests, NB 25Le failed to significantly inhibit translation (Fig. 4 D). The dramatic difference in functionality between the SBC and NB versions of 25Le reflects the physical binding properties of these two ODNs (Table II). The paired 15Le-I + 15Le-II ODNs were also effective antisense agents, and here again the SBC pair was more potent than the NB pair. C1/2 of 0.5 μm was determined for the SBC ODN pair. When each 15-mer was tested alone for antisense activity, potency was reduced and no advantage of SBC over NB ODNs was detected. None of the anti-mini-exon ODNs interfered with translation of brome mosaic virus RNA (<5% inhibition at 0.5 μm ODN). Conversely, inverted antisense ODNs (both NB and SBC) did not inhibit translation of L. amazonensis RNA (<5% inhibition at 1 μm ODN). Phosphorothioate NB and SBC antisense ODNs did not inhibit translation at concentrations below 0.5 μm (data not shown). Adsorption of these ODNs by proteins in the extract may explain why they failed to elicit an antisense effect. Following incubation with wheat germ extract, the PO SBC 25Le ODN ran identically to an untreated control on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel while the PS ODN ran as a slow moving smear attributable to the association with proteins from the extract (data not shown). Such binding has been reported by others for NB ODNs with a PS backbone (26Brown D.A. Kang S.H. Gryaznov S.M. De Dionisio L. Heidenreich O. Sullivan S. Xu X. Nerenberg M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26801-26805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, upon binding to RNA, these PS sequences formed poorer substrates for RNase H than PO counterparts (see below). Two different mechanisms account for the inhibition of translation by antisense ODNs: RNase H-independent (translation arrest) and RNase H-dependent cleavage of target RNA (27Cazenave C. Loreau N.

To investigate the mechanism by which SBC ODNs inhibit L. amazonensis on RNA translation, we carried out translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, which has a low (if any) class I RNase H activity under translation conditions (29Cazenave C. Frank P. Büsen W. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4 F the effect of SBC 25Le (with a PO backbone) on translation was monitored both in the presence and absence of added E. coli RNase H. The results show that inhibition of protein synthesis in this medium occurs via an RNase H-depende"
https://openalex.org/W2025668858,"We have defined how four elements that regulate expression of the rat skeletal muscle type 1 sodium channel (SkM1) gene cooperate to yield specific expression in differentiated muscle. A basal promoter region containing within it a promoter E-box (-31/-26) is broadly expressed in many cells, including myoblasts and myotubes; mutations within the promoter E-box that disrupt binding of the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors reduce expression in all cell types only slightly. Sequential addition of upstream elements to the wild-type promoter confer increasing specificity of expression in differentiated cells, even though all three upstream elements, including a positive element (-85/-57), a repressor E-box (-90/-85), and upstream repressor sequences (-135/-95), bind ubiquitously expressed transcription factors. Mutations in the promoter E-box that disrupt the binding of the bHLH factors counteract the specificity conferred by addition of the upstream elements, with the greatest interaction observed between the upstream repressor sequences and the promoter E-box. Forced expression of myogenin in myoblasts releases repression exerted by the upstream repressor sequences in conjunction with the wild-type, but not mutant, promoter E-box, and also initiates expression of the endogenous SkM1 protein. Our data suggest that particular myogenic bHLH proteins bound at the promoter E-box control expression of SkM1 by releasing repression exerted by upstream repressor sequences in differentiated muscle cells."

In this study, we analyzed the requirements for growth suppression by β1C. A chimera containing the extracellular/transmembrane domain of the Tac subunit of the human interleukin 2 receptor (gp55) fused to the cytoplasmic domain of β1C (residues 732–805) strongly inhibited growth in mouse 10T1/2 cells even at low expression levels, whereas chimeras containing the β1A, β1B, β1D, β3, and β5 cytoplasmic domains had weak and variable effects.

Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8940) Google Scholar and 2Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). The β1 subunit pairs with α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, α6, α7, α8, α9, and αv to generate 10 different receptors that show distinct binding specificities for extracellular matrix proteins and other cell surface receptors. In addition to their role as adhesion receptors, integrins regulate cellular functions including cytoskeletal organization, cell growth, gene expression, survival, and migration. These effects are dependent on signaling events involving changes in protein phosphorylation, protein interactions, intracellular ion concentrations, and lipid metabolism. Integrin cytoplasmic domains lack intrinsic enzymatic activity but have been shown to activate a variety of signaling pathways including protein kinases (focal adhesion kinase, integrin-linked kinase, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinase), lipid kinases, phospholipases, and small GTP-binding proteins (Ras, Rac, and Cdc 42) and to bind to cytoskeletal proteins including α-actinin, talin, filamin, and paxillin. Four different β1 cytoplasmic domain isoforms have been identified (β1A, β1B, β1C, and β1D), and at least one is expressed in nearly every cell type (3Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol.

Commun. 1996; 4: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As a result, each of the β1 cytoplasmic domains contains a common 26-aa1 membrane proximal sequence and a unique COOH-terminal sequence. The potential significance of these splice variants is highlighted by the fact that many integrin-regulated signals are mediated by the β subunit cytoplasmic domain. For example, the β1A cytoplasmic domain has been shown to interact with the cytoskeletal proteins α-actinin, filamin, and talin, and sequences within the unique β1A domain are required for focal adhesion localization (8Reszka A.A.

Taken together, these observations suggest that alternative splicing within the β1 gene may have profound effects on receptor function. We previously investigated the function of the β1Cisoform in mouse 10T1/2 fibroblasts. We found that expression of β1C induced a potent inhibition of cell cycle progression, leading to arrest in late G1 (16Meredith J.E. Takada Y. Fornaro M. Languino L. Schwartz M.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1570-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). β1C failed to localize to focal adhesions, suggesting that it has altered interactions with cytoskeletal proteins (16Meredith J.E. Takada Y. Fornaro M. Languino L. Schwartz M.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1570-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). β1C also blocked the growth of Chinese hamster ovary cells (17Fornaro M. Zheng D.Q. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24666-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The functions of β1C in vivo are unknown, but β1C expression has been shown to correlate with growth arrest. It is up-regulated in human umbilical endothelial cells in response to treatment with tumor necrosis factor, which blocks the growth of these cells (17Fornaro M. Zheng D.Q. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24666-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and was found in quiescent prostate epithelial cells but was down-regulated in prostate carcinoma, suggesting that it could function as a tumor suppressor (18Fornaro M. Tallini G. Bofetiado C.J.M. Bosari S. Languino L.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 765-773PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we used β1C chimeras to define the sequences necessary and sufficient for regulating growth. We identified a critical 18-aa region and showed that β1C sequences can function apart from the rest of the integrin, even in the absence of membrane targeting. We also found that the β1C-specific domain blocks DNA synthesis in endothelial and prostate carcinoma cells, suggesting that β1C protein may inhibit growthin vivo. Mouse fibroblast C3H 10T1/2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium low glucose (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) and glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). The human prostate epithelial cell line DU145 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose supplemented with glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin, nonessential amino acids (Sigma), and 10% fetal bovine serum. The human endothelial cell line EV304 was grown in endothelial growth media (Clonetics) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. C3H 10T1/2 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) as per the manufacturer's instructions. DU145 and EV304 cells were transiently transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. DNAs for transfection were prepared using Plasmid Maxi Kits (Qiagen). IL2 receptor integrin chimeras were generated by fusing various integrin β subunit cytoplasmic domains to the extracellular/transmembrane domain of the IL2 receptor α subunit (gp55) using the unique membrane proximal HindIII site. Chimeras were expressed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter in pCDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). Cytoplasmic domains and cytoplasmic domain fragments of the integrin β1A, β1C, β1D, and β5 subunits were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the pBJβ1A, pBJβ1C, pCβ1D, and pBJβ5 cDNAs, respectively. The full-length β1B cytoplasmic domain was generated by polymerase chain reaction using overlapping primers and pBJβ1A cDNA. All fragments were subcloned asHindIII/XbaI fragments containing an in-frame NH2-terminal HindIII site and a COOH-terminal stop codon followed by a XbaI site.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The GFP/β1C chimera was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the β1C-specific domain 758–805 containing an in-frame NH2-terminal EcoRI site and a COOH-terminal stop codon followed by a SalI site and subcloned into theEcoRI/SalI sites of the GFP expression vector pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). Polymerase chain reaction primers were purchased from Life Technologies. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The protein numbering for β1Cis based on the mature protein such that the first residue of the β1C-specific domain is 758; other investigators have used a numbering system based on the immature protein such that the β1C-specific domain begins with 778 (17Fornaro M. Zheng D.Q. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24666-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cell growth in transiently transfected cells was measured by labeling cells with bromodeoxyuridine/fluorodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Amersham) for 16 h starting at 32 h after transfection. Labeled cells were then detached with trypsin/EDTA (Life Technologies), washed once with growth media and twice with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS (nuclease- and protease-free; Calbiochem), and then fixed in cold 70% ethanol on ice for 30 min. Cellular DNA was denatured by treating fixed cells with 2n HCL/0.5% Triton for 30 min and stopped by incubating cells in 0.1 m Na2B4O7, pH 8.5. Cells were then washed once with 0.5% Tween 20/1% bovine serum albumin/PBS (TBP). IL2 receptor chimera expression was determined by incubating cells with a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-IL2 receptor antibody (PharMingen), and BrdUrd incorporation was determined by using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (Becton Dickinson). Antibodies were diluted in TBP buffer, and labeling reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Labeled cells were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACScan and CellQuest software. Approximately 100,000 cells were analyzed per construct in each experiment. BrdUrd incorporation was determined for different levels of chimera expression, with expression level gates set such that at least 1,000 cells were included in each gate. BrdUrd incorporation levels were determined, normalized against the IL2R/TL control, and expressed as the percentage of inhibition per mean expression level. Transiently transfected cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA and replated in growth medium on glass coverslips 24 h after transfection. Cell growth was measured by labeling cells with BrdUrd for 5 h starting at 48 h after transfection. Labeled cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde (EM Sciences)/PBS for 15 min at room temperature, extracted with 0.2% Triton/PBS for 10 min, treated with 0.1 unit/μl DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C, and blocked in 10% normal goat serum/PBS (Life Technologies). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 10% normal goat serum/PBS, and labeling reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. In order to measure BrdUrd incorporation in cells expressing IL2 receptor chimeras, cells were probed with an anti-BrdUrd primary antibody (Calbiochem) followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were then blocked with mouse IgG (Sigma) before labeling with a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-IL2 receptor antibody (PharMingen). In order to measure BrdUrd incorporation in cells expressing GFP chimeras, cells were probed with an anti-BrdUrd primary antibody followed by a lissamine rhodamine sulfonyl chloride-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Coverslips were mounted in Immunofluore mounting media (ICN) and examined using a Leitz diaplan fluorescence microscope. Fluorescent images were obtained using a Bio-Rad 1024 MRC Scanning Confocal Microscope. To map the growth regulatory sequences in β1C, we generated a chimera containing the extracellular/transmembrane domain of the 55-kDa Tac subunit of the IL2 receptor fused to the cytoplasmic domain of β1C(IL2R/β1C). Similar chimeras have been used to investigate the signaling of other integrin β subunit cytoplasmic domains, including β1A, β1D, and β3 (19LaFlamme S.E. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J.

These chimeras have been shown to mimic properties of wild type receptors, including focal adhesion localization and the activation of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, but in a ligand-independent manner (21Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. LaFlamme S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15961-15964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse 10T1/2 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with IL2 receptor chimeras containing the β1A, β1B, β1C, and β1D cytoplasmic domains and stained for surface expression. A tail-less construct (TL) that did not contain any integrin sequences was used as a control. As shown in Fig.1, IL2R/β1C(β1C) exhibited a diffuse staining pattern similar to the staining pattern of the tail-less IL2R chimera (TL). This result is consistent with the diffuse staining pattern observed for the full-length receptor (16Meredith J.E. Takada Y. Fornaro M. Languino L. Schwartz M.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1570-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The IL2R/β1B chimera (β1B) also displayed a diffuse staining pattern similar to the wild type β1B receptor (25Balzac F. Belkin A.M. Koteliansky V.E. Balabanov Y.V. Altruda F. Silengo L. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast to the β1Cand β1B chimeras, the β1A and β1D chimeras were localized to focal adhesions, in agreement with previous reports (19LaFlamme S.E. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 20LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.A. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15234-15240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We next tested the effects of the different chimeras on DNA synthesis. Transiently transfected cells were replated on glass coverslips after 24 h and incubated with the thymidine analogue BrdUrd for 5 h starting at 48 h after transfection. Cells were then fixed and double-stained for IL2R expression and BrdUrd incorporation. We have found that high levels of chimera expression induced cell retraction and rounding and inhibited cell adhesion or spreading, 3J. Meredith and M. A. Schwartz, unpublished observations. consistent with previous reports that these chimeras can function as dominant negative inhibitors for endogenous integrin function (20LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.A. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 23Smilenov L. Briesewitz R. Marcantonio E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Chen Y. O'Toole T.E. Shipley T. Forsyth J. LaFlamme S.E. Yamada K.M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18307-18310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the 10T1/2 fibroblasts are anchorage-dependent, effects on cell adhesion would result in nonspecific growth arrest. Therefore, to rule out this type of effect, only morphologically normal cells were scored for nuclear labeling with anti-BrdUrd. As shown in Fig.2, the IL2R/β1C chimera blocked BrdUrd incorporation in >99% of the expressing cells. In contrast, the IL2R/β1A, β1B, and β1D chimeras showed varying but relatively modest effects on BrdUrd labeling. The β1A and β1Bchimeras caused decreases in DNA synthesis, whereas the β1D chimera induced a modest increase compared with the IL2R/TL control (Fig. 2). We also examined chimeras containing the integrin β3 and β5 cytoplasmic domains, both of which localized to focal adhesions.3 As shown in Fig. 2, the β3 chimera induced an increase in cells labeled with BrdUrd, whereas the β5 chimera partially inhibited labeling. These results indicate that only the β1C cytoplasmic domain functions as a potent inhibitor, although the other β subunit cytoplasmic domains have detectable effects on growth. These data also indicate that the β1Ccytoplasmic domain is sufficient to induce cell cycle arrest when separate from the rest of the integrin. To obtain a more quantitative estimate of the dependence of growth inhibition on expression levels, dose-response curves for the β1A and β1Cchimeras were generated. Starting at 30 h after transfection, cells were labeled with BrdUrd for 16 h and then detached, fixed, and stained for both BrdUrd incorporation and IL2R chimera expression. Cells were then assayed by flow cytometry. Using this protocol, the maximum growth inhibition was 45–50%; even cells that were detached and put into suspension at the beginning of the labeling period were inhibited by only 45%. Presumably, this result reflects the fact that a significant fraction of the cells have passed the restriction point and are already committed to or have entered S phase. The correlation between expression level for IL2R and BrdUrd staining is shown in Fig.3. We found that both of the integrin chimeras induced growth inhibition, although at markedly different expression levels. The β1A chimera blocked growth at high expression levels, consistent with the idea that this chimera may function as dominant negative inhibitor for endogenous integrin function. In contrast, the β1C chimera was a distinctly more potent, maximally inhibiting DNA synthesis at a level of expression just above background. The results in Fig. 3 using fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis show significant inhibition of DNA synthesis at high levels of β1A expression, in disagreement with Fig. 2, in which DNA synthesis was only slightly decreased in β1A-expressing cells scored after plating on coverslips. One possible source of this discrepancy is that high expressors might be lost after replating and their influence might be further decreased because rounded cells were not scored. To investigate this question, cells transfected with β1A or β1C were left in the original dish or replated into a fresh tissue culture dish and then detached and analyzed for expression of the transfected integrins. Replating caused a substantial loss of the β1A high expressors from the population, whereas no decrease in β1C-expressing cells was observed.3 This result explains the difference between the two methods and supports the conclusion that growth inhibition by β1A is due to a dominant negative effect on cell adhesion, whereas inhibition by β1C is caused by a distinct mechanism. The β1C cytoplasmic domain (residues 732–805) is composed of a common region (732–757) shared with the other β1splice variants and a unique region (758–805) specific to β1C. Hungerford et al. (27Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) showed that microinjection of a peptide derived from the common β1region can block endogenous integrin function and induce programmed cell death in chicken fibroblasts in serum-free media. As shown in Fig.4, deletion of the common region had no effect on growth inhibition by β1C, indicating that the β1C-specific domain was sufficient. We next asked whether the β1C-specific domain could block growth when expressed as a soluble protein in the absence of membrane targeting. A chimera was generated containing the β1C-specific domain (758–805) fused to the GFP. This chimera blocked growth in 93% of the expressing cells (Fig. 4 B). Thus, growth inhibition by β1C occurs even when expressed as a soluble cytoplasmic protein. In order to further define growth regulatory sequences, we generated a series of IL2R/β1C chimeras containing deletions within the β1C-specific domain (758–805). Deletion of the membrane-proximal 17 aa (Fig. 5, construct 2) had no effect on growth inhibition, whereas the deletion of an additional 8 aa (construct 3) led to a substantial increase in DNA synthesis. Expression of the COOH-terminal 13 aa alone (construct 4) had weak but reproducible growth-inhibitory activity. When we screened deletions from the COOH terminus of the β1C-specific domain, we found that deletion of the COOH-terminal 13 aa failed to increase DNA synthesis (constructs 2–4). This result was surprising, because we had previously reported that the deletion of this COOH-terminal 13 aa region (793–805) abolished growth inhibition by the intact receptor (16Meredith J.E. Takada Y. Fornaro M. Languino L. Schwartz M.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1570-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Deletion of the next 10 residues (Fig. 5 B, construct 5) almost completely eliminated growth inhibition. Taken together, these results identify an 18-aa region, 775–792, that is the major site of the growth-inhibitory activity. The COOH-terminal 13-aa region also has weak activity; curiously, it is required for growth inhibition by the intact receptor but not by the shorter β1C-specific domain expressed as a chimera with the IL2R. This sequence may therefore be important for the proper conformation of the intact receptor but not a shorter peptide. Previous reports suggested that β1C may function as a cell growth regulator: its expression is induced in human umbilical endothelial cells in response to tumor necrosis factor, which causes growth arrest, and β1C is down-regulated during the transition from normal, quiescent prostate epithelium to prostate carcinoma (17Fornaro M. Zheng D.Q. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24666-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Fornaro M. Tallini G. Bofetiado C.J.M. Bosari S. Languino L.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 765-773PubMed Google Scholar). To test the ability of β1C to block growth in these cell types, GFP/β1C was transiently expressed in the human endothelial cell line EV304 and in the transformed prostate epithelial cell line DU145. Expressing cells were labeled with BrdUrd to assay cell cycle progression. As shown in Fig.6, GFP/β1C induced growth arrest in both the EV304 cells and the DU145 cells, blocking BrdUrd labeling by 46.7% and 72.8%, respectively, compared with GFP controls. These results indicate that β1C can block cell growth in human cell lines relevant to its in vivoexpression. We used chimeras of the β1C cytoplasmic domain with both the IL2 receptor and GFP to map growth regulatory sequences in integrin β1C. The data revealed that growth inhibition by β1C occurred at low expression levels and was mediated entirely by the β1C-specific domain. This domain functioned in the absence of the β subunit extracellular, transmembrane, and common cytoplasmic sequences, did not require the α subunit, and was effective in the absence of membrane targeting. Additional deletion mapping showed that the primary activity resided within an 18-aa region (775–792). The β1C cytoplasmic domain also blocked growth when expressed in human endothelial cells and transformed prostate epithelial cells, suggesting that the endogenous protein may function in a similar capacity under physiological conditions. These conclusions are summarized in Fig.7. Other integrins had some effects on cell cycle progression. The β1A chimera decreased DNA synthesis at high levels, consistent with reports that it functions as a dominant negative inhibitor for endogenous integrin function in cell adhesion (20LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.A. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 23Smilenov L. Briesewitz R. Marcantonio E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,26Chen Y. O'Toole T.E. Shipley T. Forsyth J. LaFlamme S.E. Yamada K.M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18307-18310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of β1B also decreased DNA synthesis, consistent with published data indicating that this isoform can function as a dominant negative inhibitor (28Balzac F. Retta S.F. Albini A. Melchiorri A. Koteliansky V.E. Silengo L. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We observed some stimulation of DNA synthesis by β1D, whereas Belkin and Retta (24Belkin A.M. Retta S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15234-15240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported that the β1D chimera blocks cell growth when expressed in C2C12 myoblasts, suggesting that effects of β1D may be cell type-specific. Two previous studies reported the effect of COOH-terminal deletions within the full-length β1C receptor on DNA synthesis (16Meredith J.E. Takada Y. Fornaro M. Languino L. Schwartz M.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1570-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,17Fornaro M. Zheng D.Q. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24666-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We found that the COOH-terminal 13-aa region was required for growth inhibition by the full-length receptor in 10T1/2 cells, whereas, using a different protocol, Fornaro et al. (17Fornaro M. Zheng D.Q. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24666-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported that a receptor lacking this region blocked growth in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The results reported here may help resolve this discrepancy by showing that the last 13 aa are not required for growth inhibition by a shorter IL2 receptor chimera that contains only the β1C-specific sequences. Thus, this region may be required for maintaining proper conformation in some contexts, but it does not appear to be essential for signaling. Our findings and those of Fornaro et al. (17Fornaro M. Zheng D.Q. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24666-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) both indicate that the 775–782 region is critical; however, we found that this region was not sufficient for growth inhibition but also required residues 783–792. By contrast, Fornaro et al. (17Fornaro M. Zheng D.Q. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24666-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) observed growth inhibition in a construct lacking residues COOH-terminal to 782. This difference could be due to the difference in cell type or the distinct protocol used in their studies, in which expressing cells were analyzed after being captured by panning on anti-β1 antibodies. Alternatively, those studies used full-length β1Cconstructs that contained the common, membrane-proximal region. Dominant negative effects leading to growth inhibition could therefore complicate the interpretation of those results. The β1C-specific exon is formed by an Alu sequence in the antisense orientation located between the sixth and seventh exon of the human β1 gene (3Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7116-7120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fornaro M. Languino L.R. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Alu sequences are members of the short interspersed nucleotide elements family of repetitive elements, and approximately 700,000 Alu elements are thought to be present per haploid human genome; thus, an average of more than 1 Alu element is predicted to be present in every gene (30Schmid C.W. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 283-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many genes express Alu-containing sequences, and a few Alu-containing proteins have been reported previously (31Makalowski W. Mitchell G.A. Labuda D. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 188-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The function or significance of these elements is not known. We have mapped the β1C growth inhibitory domain to a region of β1C that overlaps a sequence that is conserved in other Alu-containing proteins including transformation-related protein and neuronal thread protein and alternatively spliced isoforms of neurofibromatosis 2 and c-myb (Fig.7). The function of these proteins and their roles in growth control are not known. In addition to this conserved region, the β1C growth inhibitory domain also contains a TSR sequence that is not found in the other Alu-containing proteins (Fig. 7). The design of cell growth inhibitors is one of the major strategies in the fight against cancer and other human diseases. We have identified a short peptide sequence that is sufficient to induce growth arrest in endothelial cells (EV304), in transformed prostate epithelial cells (DU145), and in the K562 transformed hematopoietic cell line (data not shown) as well as in rodent fibroblast cell lines. These results suggest that the identification of β1C-binding proteins and the characterization of β1C-mediated downstream signaling pathways could aid in the development of novel angiogenesis or tumor growth inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2047439258,"Three-dimensional electron microscopy reconstructions of native, half-transformed, and transformed α2-macroglobulins (α2Ms) labeled with a monoclonal Fab Fab offer new insight into the mechanism of its proteinase entrapment. Each α2M binds four Fabs, two at either end of its dimeric protomers approximately 145 Å apart. In the native structure, the epitopes are near the base of its two chisel-like features, laterally separated by 120 Å, whereas in the methylamine-transformed α2M, the epitopes are at the base of its four arms, laterally separated by 160 Å. Upon thiol ester cleavage, the chisels on the native α2M appear to split with a separation and rotation to give the four arm-like extensions on transformed α2M. Thus, the receptor binding domains previously enclosed within the chisels are exposed. The labeled structures further indicate that the two protomeric strands that constitute the native and transformed molecules are related and reside one on each side of the major axes of these structures. The half-transformed structure shows that the two Fabs at one end of the molecule have an arrangement similar to those on the native α2M, whereas on its transformed end, they have rotated. The rotation is associated with a partial untwisting of the strands and an enlargement of the openings to the cavity. We propose that the enlarged openings permit the entrance of the proteinase. Then cleavage of the remaining bait domains by a second proteinase occurs with its entrance into the cavity. This is followed by a retwisting of the strands to encapsulate the proteinases and expose the receptor binding domains associated with the transformed α2M. Three-dimensional electron microscopy reconstructions of native, half-transformed, and transformed α2-macroglobulins (α2Ms) labeled with a monoclonal Fab Fab offer new insight into the mechanism of its proteinase entrapment. Each α2M binds four Fabs, two at either end of its dimeric protomers approximately 145 Å apart. In the native structure, the epitopes are near the base of its two chisel-like features, laterally separated by 120 Å, whereas in the methylamine-transformed α2M, the epitopes are at the base of its four arms, laterally separated by 160 Å. Upon thiol ester cleavage, the chisels on the native α2M appear to split with a separation and rotation to give the four arm-like extensions on transformed α2M. Thus, the receptor binding domains previously enclosed within the chisels are exposed. The labeled structures further indicate that the two protomeric strands that constitute the native and transformed molecules are related and reside one on each side of the major axes of these structures. The half-transformed structure shows that the two Fabs at one end of the molecule have an arrangement similar to those on the native α2M, whereas on its transformed end, they have rotated. The rotation is associated with a partial untwisting of the strands and an enlargement of the openings to the cavity. We propose that the enlarged openings permit the entrance of the proteinase. Then cleavage of the remaining bait domains by a second proteinase occurs with its entrance into the cavity. This is followed by a retwisting of the strands to encapsulate the proteinases and expose the receptor binding domains associated with the transformed α2M. human α2-macroglobulin native α2M methylamine-transformed α2M half-transformed α2M Fab 50-kDa fragment receptor binding domain Human α2-macroglobulin (α2M1, M r = 720,000) is an essential protein present at a high concentration in the serum (∼2 mg/ml) that has the unusual physiological role of a nonspecific proteinase scavenger (1Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Starkey P.M. Barrett A.J. Barrett A.J. Proteinases in Mammalian Cells and Tissues.

In a presently poorly understood mechanism, native α2M irreversibly traps almost all known endoproteinases by undergoing a structural change that involves a large alteration in its shape. Evolutionarily related proteins performing a similar physiological function, termed α-macroglobulins, are present in all vertebrates and several invertebrates (1Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an impairment in the α2M gene has been implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (4Blacker D. Wilcox M.A. Laird N.M. Rodes L. Horrath S.M. Go R.C.P. Perry R. Watson Jr., B. Bassett S.S. McInnis M.G. Albert M.S. Hyman B.T. Tanzi R.E. Nat. Genet. 1988; 19: 357-360Crossref Scopus (579) Google Scholar). α2M is a glycoprotein assembled from four identical 180-kDa subunits that are disulfide-linked in pairs to form two protomers, which, in turn, are noncovalently associated (1Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each subunit contains an approximately 40-residue-long sequence termed the “bait” region, which displays target sequences for a variety of proteinases (5Sottrup-Jensen L. Sand O. Kristensen L. Fey G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15781-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bait region cleavage by a proteinase in turn causes the activation of a functionally important internal thiol ester bond between Cys949 and Glx952 of the subunit, which rapidly undergoes a nucleophilic attack (1Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of the thiol ester moiety triggers a major shape change, aptly termed the “mousetrap mechanism,” that causes α2M to internally sequester the proteinase, which typically retains its catalytic activity but is inaccessible to its target proteins (6.Barrett, A. J, Starkey, P. M., Munn, E. A., Bayer-Symposium V, Proteinase Inhibitors: Proceedings of the Second International Research Conference, October 16–21, 1973, Fritz, H., 1974, 72, 77, Springer-Verlag, New York.Google Scholar). An attacking proteinase cleaves two of the four bait regions of α2M in rapid succession (1Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α2M can therefore entrap up to two proteinases the size of chymotrypsin (M r = 25,000). Significantly, a direct nucleophilic attack by methylamine on the thiol esters of native α2M results in a structural change similar to cleavage by a proteinase (1Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, thiol ester cleavage has a pivotal role in the shape change that accompanies the entrapment of the proteinase. Transformed α2M obtained by either mechanism exposes receptor binding domains (RBDs) that allow its rapid endocytosis by cell-membrane receptors principally displayed by hepatocytes but also by a variety of other cells (1Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Native and transformed α2Ms display significantly different physico-chemical properties, including migration speeds on nondenaturing gels (8Hall P.K. Roberts R.C. Biochem. J. 1978; 171: 27-38Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and Stokes radii (9Middaugh R. Steadman B.L. Schurtenberger P. Lee D.C. Chlebowski J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1161: 328-332PubMed Google Scholar). Three-dimensional electron microscopy reconstructions have shown that the two forms also exhibit markedly different shapes (10Boisset N. Taveau J.-C.

Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The ambiguity in relating structural features between the native and transformed molecules has therefore led to conflicting models for the structural rearrangement involved in the transformation of α2M (10Boisset N. Taveau J.-C. Pochon F. Lamy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25762-25769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The recently published structure of half-transformed α2M (α2M-HT), which has only two cleaved bait regions and two hydrolyzed thiol esters in its bottom half, has provided an important link in understanding the process leading from native to transformed α2M (13Qazi U. Gettins P.G.W. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8987-8993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have employed cryoelectron microscopy to obtain structures of native α2M (α2M-N), α2M-HT, and α2M-methylamine (α2M-MA) labeled with four monoclonal Fab fragments that bind to a common epitope on all three structural forms of the molecule and permit an assignment of related features. Purification protocols for native, half-transformed, and methylamine-transformed α2Ms have been previously described in Kolodziej et al. (12Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), Qaziet al. (13Qazi U. Gettins P.G.W. Stoops J.K. J. Biol.

Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K J. Struct. Biol. 1992; 109: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), respectively. Monoclonal antibody 6E8 binds to a 55-kDa fragment obtained from a papain digest of transformed α2M that lies principally within the N-terminal half of the 180-kDa α2M monomer (12Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Roche P.A. Strickland D.K. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6715-6721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fab fragments from 6E8 were previously shown to recognize both native and fully transformed α2M with a stoichiometry of approximately 4 mol of Fab bound/mol of α2M (12Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This electron microscopy study has further confirmed the binding of four Fabs to the native, half-transformed, and fully transformed α2Ms. A 6–8 m excess of 6E8 monoclonal Fab was added to the α2M-N, α2M-HT, or α2M-MA (transformed α2M) preparations so that the resulting α2M concentration was 0.1 mg/ml. A 3-μl sample of each Fab-labeled α2M was added to a glow-discharged carbon-coated holey grid for cryoelectron microscopy. After removing the excess sample by blotting with filter paper, the grid was rapidly cooled by immersion in liquid ethane. A Gatan cold-holder was used to maintain the specimens below –170 °C. Images were then acquired with a JEOL JEM 1200 electron microscope operating at 100 kV with an underfocus of ∼1.7 μm and an exposure of ∼9 e/Å2 on Kodak SO 163 film (15Kolodziej S.J. Penczek P.A. Schroeter J.P. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28422-28429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Micrographs were digitized using an Eikonix 1412 scanner with a 12-bit dynamic range and a pixel size of 5.7 Å on the specimen scale. Power spectra from the untilted micrographs were analyzed for astigmatism and drift. Micrographs showing frost, significant astigmatism, or drift were rejected. Representative particles were selected in 64×64-pixel boxes using the SUPRIM software package (16Schroeter J.P. Bretaudiere J.-P. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The α2M-N, α2M-HT, and transformed α2M data sets contained 2567, 3498, and 2900 particle images, respectively. Previously obtained unlabeled reconstructions (15Kolodziej S.J. Penczek P.A. Schroeter J.P. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28422-28429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) from single-particle images using the methylamine tungstate stain and carbon support film (17Stoops J.K. Momany C. Oliver R.M. Schroeter J.P. Bretaudiere J.-P. Hackert M.L. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1991; 18: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were used as initial models for the alignment and refinement,i.e. three-dimensional projection alignment and iterative reconstruction, using the SPIDER software (18Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjaj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar, 19Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In the case of α2M-N and α2M-HT, the particles were initially aligned to isotropic projections from the unlabeled stain models spaced 20° apart (19Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Correspondence analysis, followed by hierarchical ascendent classification (20Bretaudiere J.-P. Tapon-Bretaudiere J. Stoops J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using the SUPRIM software, was then used to identify and remove misaligned particles in each projection direction. The edited particle data sets (1564 particles, α2M-N; 3026 particles, α2M-HT) were then aligned to projections of these reconstructions at 2° intervals and used to obtain reconstructions with resolutions of 41 Å (α2M-N) and 38 Å (α2M-HT) using a Fourier shell correlation criterion of 0.67 (21Unser M. Trus B.L. Stevens A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 23: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). For α2M-HT, a further pass of refinement was carried out with 2-fold symmetry imposed on its major axis. This was done to give equal prominence to all Fabs. The final reconstruction, which was not further symmetrized, had a resolution of 38 Å. The α2M-MA data set was initially examined using a reference-free, K-means clustering algorithm in SPIDER with 50 clusters and 100 iterations (22Penczek P. Zhu J. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1996; 63: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Of these, 41 average cluster images were retained and aligned to a recently obtained, refined α2M-MA stain model. 2U. Qazi, P. G. W. Gettins, D. K. Strickland, and J. K. Stoops, manuscript in preparation. A reconstruction from these averages, which prominently displayed the Fabs, was used to obtain a final refined reconstruction (39-Å resolution) from the entire 2900 particle data set. The reconstructions were corrected for the contrast transfer function of the electron microscope as described previously (23Erickson H.P. Klug A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1971; 261: 105-118Crossref Google Scholar, 24Toyoshima C. Unwin N. Ultramicroscopy. 1988; 25: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25Stoops J.K. Baker T.S. Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Niu X.-D. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24769-24775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bandpass Fermi filtering (26Frank J. Verschoor A. Wagenknecht T. Wu T.T. New Methodologies in Studies of Protein Conformation. Van Nostrand Rhinehold Co. Inc., New York1985: 36-86Google Scholar) was applied to retain information between Fourier space radii of 12 pixels (1/30.4 Å−1; close to the contrast-transfer function cutoff and providing the best match with the unlabeled structures) and 1 pixel (1/364.8 Å−1), with a temperature parameter of 0.01. α2M-N and α2M-MA reconstructions revealed 2-fold symmetry along their major axes, and consequently they were 222-symmetrized for display. The distal ends of the Fabs appeared wedge-shaped in the average images (see Fig. 2) and mushroom-shaped in the surface-rendered structures (data not shown), presumably because their site of attachment is not rigid. In the solid-shaded structures, their external ends were trimmed to give them a rod-like appearance so that their contact with the surface can be more readily discerned. In the galleries of frozen-hydrated images (Fig. 1), four Fab fragments from the monoclonal antibody 6E8 clearly bind to each of the three structural variants of α2M. On most particles, the Fabs can be discerned as rod-shaped protrusions with knob-like extremities (Fig. 1). Typical shapes such as “lip” views of α2M-N (particles a, c, and g) (12Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), “pseudo-lip” views of α2M-HT (particles j and m) (13Qazi U. Gettins P.G.W. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8987-8993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), as well as “H” views of α2M-MA (particlest and u) (11Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8987-8993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, the Fabs do not appear to perturb the α2M molecules (11Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J.

Cryoelectron microscopy was utilized as the imaging technique in the present study because it permits the use of higher protein concentrations in the sample preparation than stain electron microscopy. This assured that the four Fab binding sites are occupied (Fig. 1) (dissociation constants of the α2M-Fab complexes are in the nm range (12Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)). As often observed in the imaging of nonviral proteins in vitreous ice, the α2Ms tended to assume a preferred orientation in relation to the air-water interface (27Kolodziej S.J. Penczek P.A. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Kolodziej S.J. Klueppelberg H.U. Nolasco N. Ehses W. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct.

However, we obtained a sufficient number of off-axis, “rocking” views in all data sets, which permitted the computation of three-dimensional structures with significant spatial information in all directions (27Kolodziej S.J.

Our technique provides high contrast images of well preserved molecules, and the multiple orientations of the particles result in reconstructions with uniform spatial resolution (11Schroeter J.P.

Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) data sets of untilted, frozen-hydrated, single particles of Fab-labeled α2M-N and α2M-HT or the averages representing the data set for α2M-MA, obtained using the reference-free technique of K-means clustering (see “Experimental Procedures” (22Penczek P. Zhu J. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1996; 63: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)). The model-based three-dimensional projection alignment method is a powerful procedure that bypasses technical difficulties encountered in three-dimensional reconstructions from tilted frozen-hydrated specimens. The method of using methylamine tungstate stain reconstructions to align and reconstruct from untilted frozen-hydrated data sets has been previously validated (13Qazi U. Gettins P.G.W. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8987-8993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27Kolodziej S.J. Penczek P.A. Stoops J.K. J. Struct.

Biol. 1998; 123: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the present study further demonstrates its utility in determining structures of the corresponding Fab-labeled molecules. A comparison of the projections of the Fab-labeled three-dimensional structures and the corresponding two-dimensional average images (Fig.2) clearly indicate that the processes of alignment and reconstruction have correctly preserved the location of the Fab labels. The Fabs are somewhat less prominent on the α2M-N structure, probably because of the predominance of lip views in the data set. All three Fab-labeled reconstructions of α2M closely resemble their unlabeled stain analogs that were used as the initial models for three-dimensional alignment, further supporting the reliability of the reconstructions (Fig. 2). The 222-symmetric α2M-N structure presents an overall twisted appearance. In its characteristic lip view, the structure appears as two Z-shaped protein strands that merge at the top and bottom to form regions of high protein density. The strands exhibit a 90° clockwise rotation about their major axis and form the walls of the cavity (Fig. 4 a). The two dense ends of the molecule clearly display a chisel-like appearance as observed in the unlabeled stain structure (Figs. 2 and3). Furthermore, the elbow-shaped bends of the two Z-shaped strands are superficially connected by low density, bridge-like features. Four small (∼20-Å diameter) openings to the interior of the structure are located above and below each of the surface bridges on the front and back of the molecule.Figure 3Views of solid surface renderings of the three-dimensional structures of native, half-transformed and methylamine-transformed α2Ms.The structures are displayed at a reduced threshold to enhance the presentation of the Fabs. The four Fabs are shown inblack.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The end view of α2M-N shows that the Fabs bind on the elbow-like bends of the Z-shaped protein strands 120 Å apart and protrude diagonally outward from either side of the base of the chisel (Fig. 3). A closer examination of the “figure-8” end views shows that the Fabs are arranged in a staggered configuration,i.e. located slightly away from the symmetry planes bisecting the structure along its major axis. On each Z-shaped protomer, the two Fabs are located near the ends of antiparallel-linked subunits and consequently form an angle greater than the 90° rotation exhibited by the strands (Figs. 3 and 4). α2M-HT is a functional intermediate between the native and transformed molecules in which two of the four bait domains and thiol ester moieties have been cleaved by chymotrypsin bound to Sepharose (30Gettins P.G.W.

Its top has a chisel-like shape analogous to α2M-N and is similarly flanked by two Fab labels 120 Å apart on either side, analogous to the native structure. However, the center of the molecule shows an approximately 2-fold widening of the openings to its internal cavity, whereas the superficial, bridge-like features of α2M-N are absent (Fig. 3). The bottom of α2M-HT presents a bulbous, rounded appearance. The two strands that comprise the native molecule appear to have split into four that exhibit little twist (Fig. 4 a). The two Fabs that bind at the bottom appear to be rotated ∼50° with respect to the Fabs at the top of the structure and are located laterally 120 Å from each other as in α2M-N (Fig. 3). α2M-MA forms a more compact, cage-like structure, with four arm-like features that extend, two from each end of the molecule (Fig. 3). As seen in the H and X views, the molecule is formed by two relatively straight strands of protein density that form major connections near the two ends of the structure. The H view exhibits a groove, which appears as a pronounced gap at an increased threshold and separates the body of the structure into two strands of protein density that twist 45° counterclockwise (Fig. 4, a and b). The side X view shows that each strand is broad at the center and tapers at the two ends to form the arm-like extensions (Fig. 3). This structure is similar to the α2M-MA reconstruction reported previously without the Fab labels (11Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Wagenknecht T. Bretaudiere J.-P. Bretaudiere J.T. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K J. Struct. Biol. 1992; 109: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two Fabs are located at each end near the tapered base of its arm-like extremities 160 Å apart, in a noticeably staggered fashion. The Fabs show the same ∼45° rotation exhibited by the two strands (Figs. 3 and 4 a). In the three structures, the epitopes are located near the upper and lower ends of their internal cavities with a vertical separation of ∼145 Å. A variety of hypotheses have been proposed for the structural transformation that links the quite dissimilar structures of the native and transformed α2Ms (10Boisset N. Taveau J.-C. Pochon F. Lamy J.

Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The bases for these proposals have ranged from a correlation of surface features (10Boisset N. Taveau J.-C. Pochon F. Lamy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25762-25769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) to a comparison of the protein density distributions in the two structures (12Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13Qazi U. Gettins P.G.W. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8987-8993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As discussed below, previous immunoelectron microscopy studies of individual stained particles have provided significant structural information for the location of domains in transformed α2M (31Delain E. Pochon F. Barray M. Van Leuven F. Electron Micros. Rev. 1992; 5: 231-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Delain E. Barray M. Tapon-Bretaudiere J. Pochon F. Marynen P. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. Van Leuven F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2981-2989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a structural correspondence was not established with antibody-labeled α2M-N, because the images of stained specimens exhibited variable shapes, making their interpretation questionable. The acidic uranyl salts (pH ∼ 4) used in these studies seemingly perturbed the more labile native molecule. We have shown that a reconstruction obtained from a specimen stained with the neutral pH methylamine tungstate (27Kolodziej S.J. Penczek P.A. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) gives excellent correspondence with that obtained from frozen-hydrated specimens (Fig.2). Our Fab-labeled three-dimensional structures have provided the first definitive structural comparisons of antibody-labeled α2Ms, making it possible to relate the morphological changes upon transformation by methylamine or chymotrypsin. An initial consideration of the locations of the four Fab binding epitopes, near the ends of all three structural forms of α2M, clearly shows that individual 180-kDa subunits are present in an antiparallel or head-to-tail orientation within the two disulfide-linked protomers that noncovalently associate to form the tetrameric α2M. This is a structural validation of the proposal from previous sequencing studies that the two 180-kDa subunits in each protomer are linked antiparallel by two disulfide bonds near their N termini (1Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Jensen P.E.H. Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15863-15869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a previously reported comparison of two-dimensional average images of Fab-labeled α2Ms (12Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A comparison of the three structures of α2M (Fig. 3) indicates that in each case, the top and bottom pairs of Fab epitopes are separated along the major (long) axis by a constant distance of approximately 145 Å. However, the lateral distance between the epitopes in each of these pairs is variable, ranging from 120 Å in the native and half-transformed structures to 160 Å in the transformed molecule (Fig. 5). This indicates that the transformation of α2M, which allows the physical entrapment of a proteinase after the bait domains and thiol ester moieties of α2M have been cleaved, involves a rearrangement of protein density about its major axis to this regard, the “accordion folding” model in which a lateral compression and vertical stretching of the molecular was proposed for this transformation of α2M is inconsistent with the disposition of the Fab labels on the native and transformed structures (10Boisset N. Taveau J.-C. Pochon F. Lamy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25762-25769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our observation agrees with the proposed localization of the two disulfide-linked dimers in the three variants of α2M reported here (12Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,13Qazi U. Gettins P.G.W. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8987-8993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), one on either side of the major axis of the structure, and is supported by studies that showed dimeric variants are incapable of trapping proteinases (34Gettins P.G.W. Hahn K. Crews B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14160-14167Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Slices of α2M and α2M-MA obtained perpendicular to their major axes (Fig.4 a) reveal two twisted strands of high protein density that form major connections near the ends of the molecules thereby leading to the structural division proposed (Fig. 4 b). The Fabs used in the present study bind transformed α2M near the base of the arm-like extensions on the top and bottom of the molecule. Previous immunoelectron microscopy studies with other monoclonal antibodies showed that the RBDs are located near the tips of these arms and allow for the rapid endocytosis of α2M-proteinase complexes (40Stoops J.K. Kolodziej S.J. Qazi U. Nolasco N.J. Gettins P.G.W. Strickland D.K. Microsc. Microanal. 1998; 4: 986-987Crossref Google Scholar, 35Figler N.L. Strickland D.K. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 36Hussaini I.L. Figler Gonias S.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It was further shown that an antibody to the RBD prevented the binding of α2M to its receptor (32Delain E. Barray M. Tapon-Bretaudiere J. Pochon F. Marynen P. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. Van Leuven F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2981-2989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Figler N.L. Strickland D.K. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the antibody did not bind α2M-N, indicating that the RBDs are internally sequestered (35Figler N.L. Strickland D.K. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As the antibody 6E8 used in the present study binds native, half-transformed, and transformed α2Ms, its binding site appears to be distinct from the RBD. The disposition of the epitopes of 6E8 on α2M-N and α2M-MA (Fig. 5) reveals a structural relationship of major significance in the biology of α2M. A comparison of the end views of the native and transformed structures (Fig. 5) shows that the two protomers that merge to form the chisels in α2M-N undergo a separation of 40 Å, along with an opposite 90°-rotation at each end. This results in the emergence of arms and exposure of the RBDs at the two ends of the arm-like features of the transformed structure. It appears that the chisels of α2M-N enclose the RBDs (Fig. 5), and this finding nicely correlates with the inability of the RBD binding antibody (7H11D6) to bind to the native molecule (35Figler N.L. Strickland D.K. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). α2M-HT is a functional intermediate that was obtained by reacting an excess of α2M-N with immobilized chymotrypsin so that bait domain cleavage and thiol ester hydrolysis occurred in only two of its four subunits (30Gettins P.G.W. Crews B.C. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5613-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the top half of α2M-HT, the chisel-shaped feature and the arrangement of the two Fabs closely resemble α2M-N, whereas the bottom half is broad and bulbous, and the two Fabs have rotated ∼45° (Fig. 6). Therefore, we conclude that the bait domain and thiol ester on one subunit in each dimer that may be in close proximity have reacted with chymotrypsin in the bottom portion of the structure. Therefore, the minor axis of α2M-N represents its functional division. The intact subunit in each protomer maintains the shape of the chisel-like feature of the native molecule. This proposal agrees with the antiparallel arrangement of the subunits described above. The untwisting of the strands in α2M-HT (Fig. 6) appears to lead to an approximately 2-fold widening of the openings to the cavity (Fig. 4, cf. α2M-N and HT), making the cavity accessible to proteinase entry. However, the Fabs show that there is no separation of the strands at the ends of the molecule, and the arm-like features of α2M-MA have not formed. Consequently, the RBDs are not exposed (Fig. 3). In an apparent contradiction to this proposal, a binary chymotrypsin α2M complex that may share the cleavage arrangement of α2M-HT (two bait domains and thiol esters cleaved) appears to interact with an anti-RBD antibody (35Figler N.L. Strickland D.K. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 37Strickland D.K. Steiner J.P. Migliorini M. Battey F.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, it was noted (30Gettins P.G.W. Crews B.C. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5613-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Strickland D.K. Steiner J.P. Migliorini M. Battey F.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that thiol ester cleavage is more extensive in the binary complex preparation, and this may have resulted in the IgG binding to some of the α2M molecules seen in immunoelectron microscopy (35Figler N.L. Strickland D.K. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We propose that transformed α2M, which is targeted for endocytosis, requires cleavage of intact thiol esters in bothends of the molecule. Such an arrangement would ensure the ability of α2M-HT to encapsulate a second molecule of proteinase before the RBDs are exposed and the complex is removed from the circulation. Thus, the presence of two intact bait domains and thiol ester moieties in the native half of the intermediate structure imposes constraints on the complete transformation of α2M (13Qazi U. Gettins P.G.W. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8987-8993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this regard, a recent study (38Bowen M.E. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1825-1831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) suggested that the four bait regions are in contact with one another near the center of the structure. It was reported that disulfide cross-links between two dimeric protomers blocked the structural change induced by thiol ester cleavage that, however, occurred upon cleavage of bait domains. The need to cleave bait regions in both halves of the α2M tetramer to enable complete transformation of the molecule shown in this study may, therefore, arise from the need to allow for complete reorganization of the dimer-dimer interface. The entrapment of two proteinases by α2M is known to occur in two steps with a fast reaction occurring between α2M-N and the first targeted proteinase (1Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteinase may enter the cavity through the enlarged openings where the ε-amino group of its lysine moiety is typically cross-linked to the Glx952 of α2M (39Sottrup-Jensen L. Hansen H.F. Pederson H.S. Kristensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17727-17737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thiol esters are therefore analogous to harpoons that tether the proteinase to the interior of the cavity of the α2M and, thus, may have a role in maintaining its irreversible attachment. The intermediate or half-transformed α2M can subsequently undergo further cleavage by a second proteinase at a reduced rate (30Gettins P.G.W. Crews B.C. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5613-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) in the native portion of the structure, resulting in a similar entrapment, followed by a 45° counterclockwise rotation of the strands to encapsulate the proteinases and expose the receptor binding domains (Fig. 5).
