Now, two papers show how such condensates function in actin assembly or in a Ras signaling pathway. In both cases, the condensates form at the plasma membrane and increase the activity of signaling proteins by increasing their membrane dwell times. Case et al. show that the dwell time is dependent on cluster stoichiometry, so that stoichiometry of regulatory proteins can control actin assembly.

Hirose et al. analyzed diploid cardiomyocyte frequency as a proxy for cardiac regenerative potential across 41 vertebrate species (see the Perspective by Marchianò and Murry). They observed an inverse correlation of these cells with thyroid hormone concentrations during the ectotherm-to-endotherm transition. Mice with defects in thyroid hormone signaling retained significant heart regenerative capacity, whereas zebrafish exposed to excessive thyroid hormones exhibit impaired cardiac repair. Loss of heart regenerative ability in mammals may represent a trade-off for increases in metabolism necessary for the development of endothermy. Science , this issue p. 184 ; see also p. 123"
https://openalex.org/W2921364229,"Ecosystems feel war's effects War ravages human lives and landscapes, but nonhuman victims are no less affected. The Mozambican Civil War resulted in the rapid decline of predators in Gorongosa National Park and led to a trophic cascade that shifted prey behaviors and plant communities. Atkins et al. monitored this shift and found that the absence of wild dogs and leopards resulted in a change in habitat use and plant consumption by bushbuck, which are forest-dwelling antelopes. Experiments further showed that changes in prey behavior were reversible when signs of predator activity were introduced, supporting the impact of the predator loss. These results confirm patterns seen elsewhere and go further in providing mechanistic detail about the importance of the “landscape of fear” perceived by prey animals. Science , this issue p. 173"
https://openalex.org/W2920955434,"Crystal structure of the KDEL receptor Eukaryotic cells concentrate chaperones in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These chaperones can be swept along the secretory pathway to the Golgi apparatus, from where they must be returned. For 20 years, cell biologists have known the identity of the KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) receptor responsible for this process, but the molecular basis for its function has remained elusive. Now, Bräuer et al. present crystal structures of the KDEL receptor, in both the apo ER state and KDEL retrieval signal–bound Golgi state. Comparisons of these two states identify the conformational switch that exposes the ER retrieval motif. The authors recapitulated the binding and release cycle of the receptor using purified components, confirming that the receptor is the minimal component required to bind KDEL ligands in the Golgi.

https://openalex.org/W2921699026,"More than just numbers We often frame negative human impacts on animal species in terms of numbers of individuals reduced or numbers of regions from which species are absent. However, human activities are likely affecting species in more complex ways than these figures can capture. Kühl et al. studied behavioral and cultural diversity in our closest relative, the chimpanzee. They found that human-mediated disturbance is reducing these complex traits. Human influence thus goes well beyond simple loss of populations or species, leading to behavioral change even where populations persist. Science , this issue p. 1453"
https://openalex.org/W2919162407,"Akt produces reducing power The protein kinase Akt provides a link from growth factors to the production of metabolic reducing power within the cell. Hoxhaj et al. discovered that Akt directly phosphorylates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide kinase (NADK). Catalytic activity of NADK is normally inhibited by its own amino-terminal domain, and phosphorylation by Akt relieved this inhibition. Active NADK produces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP + ). NADP + in turn is required to produce the reduced form of NADP + (NADPH), which is the primary cofactor for reductive metabolism in the cell. Science , this issue p. 1088"

Hasenfratz et al. measured the oxygen isotope composition and magnesium/calcium ratio in benthic and planktonic foraminifera from the Antarctic in order to reconstruct changes in the rate of transfer of ocean water from the depths to the surface over the past 1.5 million years (see the Perspective by Menviel). The emergence of the 100,000-year cycle coincided with a reduction in deep-water supply and a freshening of the surface ocean. This slowing may have caused more prolonged ice ages by making the Antarctic less responsive to orbitally paced drivers of carbon dioxide release. Science , this issue p. 1080 ; see also p. 1040"
https://openalex.org/W2921663624,"Information on the physicochemical variability in rapeseed oil from different varieties during each refining process is lacking. Our purpose was to investigate the physicochemical properties, micronutrients and oxidative stability of the oil extracted from the five varieties of rapeseeds during their different stages of refining process. Increase in the acid value, peroxide value and p-anisidine value were detected in the refining, while content of tocopherols, sterols, β-carotene and phenols, which are regarded as important nutritional compounds diminished. Moreover, the loss rate of total phytosterols of all oils during neutralization (9.23-7.3%) and deodorization (9.97-8.27%) were higher than that of degumming (3.01-0.87%) and bleaching (2.75-1.18%). Deodorization affected total tocopherols contents the most, followed by bleaching, neutralization and degumming. There was a remarkable reduction in total content of phenol, β-carotene and oxygen radical absorbance of all oils during refining. The accumulated information can be used in looking for the optimum condition to meet the basic requirements for oil and minimize micronutrients losses so as to increase their market value."
https://openalex.org/W2921364925,"Emulsifiers are added to enhance product stability to obtain a satisfactory shelf-life. For this reason, stable emulsions that do not form peroxides nor change the fatty acid composition of food, as well as safe treatments to obtain them, are aspects of utmost importance. High-pressure homogenization is a conventional approach to prepare emulsions because of its high efficiency. In addition, the beneficial effects of ultrasound on the processing efficiency are known. Therefore, the impact of high-pressure homogenization (30 MPa, 50M Pa) or ultrasound power (270 W) on the emulsion stability and emulsifying properties of 5% coconut oil-in-water emulsion were discussed in this study. The complexes (3:7and 4:6, by weight) of propylene glycol alginate and xanthan gum were selected as emulsifier. The apparent viscosity, particle size and distribution, emulsifying properties and ζ-potential of 5% coconut oil-in-water emulsion before and after ultrasound treatment or high-pressure homogenization were investigated and compared. The micro structure of the emulsion was observed under the fluorescence microscope. The experimental results showed that both high-pressure homogenization and ultrasonic treatment effectively reduced the apparent viscosity, average droplet size and narrowed the distribution range of the emulsion, compared with the pre-emulsion. However, aggregation in the emulsion appeared only after being subjected to high-pressure homogenization, while the emulsion made by the ultrasound treatment remained stable during 30 days storage. In conclusion, this study provides valuable information regarding emulsion preparation methods that can be feasible in food and beverage industries, demonstrating a better performance of ultrasound in optimizing and extending food shelf-life in food and beverage industries."
https://openalex.org/W2921965497,"Berberine (BBR) shows promising effects in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by influencing various metabolic aspects. Inhibition of mitochondrial β-oxidation (β-OX) participates in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Silent mating-type information regulation 2 homolog 3 (SIRT3) has been reported to regulate mitochondrial β-OX by deacetylating its substrate, long-chain acyl—coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD). This study aimed to explore whether BBR can promote mitochondrial β-OX and the role of SIRT3 as well as the mechanisms underlying the effects of BBR on hepatic lipid metabolism in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). BBR can significantly improve systematic and hepatic lipid metabolism in HFD-fed mice. Metabolomics analysis revealed that β-OX was inhibited in HFD-induced mice, as indicated by the reduced production of short and medium carbon chain acylcarnitines, the activated form of free fatty acids, via β-OX, which was reversed by BBR intervention. Exploration of the mechanism found that BBR intervention reversed the down-regulation of SIRT3 and decreased the LCAD hyperacetylation level in HFD-fed mice. SIRT3 knockout (KO) mice were used to identify the role of SIRT3 in the BBR's influence of β-OX. The beneficial effects of BBR on systemic and hepatic metabolism were profoundly attenuated in KO mice. Moreover, the promotive effect of BBR on β-OX in HFD-induced mice was partially abolished in KO mice. These results suggested that BBR alleviates HFD-induced inhibition of fatty acid β-OX partly through SIRT3-mediated LCAD deacetylation, which may provide a novel mechanism and support BBR as a promising therapeutic for NAFLD.—Xu, X., Zhu, X.-P., Bai, J.-Y., Xia, P., Li, Y., Lu, Y., Li, X.-Y., Gao, X.

https://openalex.org/W2914409602,"Detecting weak radio-frequency electromagnetic fields plays a crucial role in wide range of fields, from radio astronomy to nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. In quantum mechanics, the ultimate limit of a weak field is a single-photon. Detecting and manipulating single-photons at megahertz frequencies presents a challenge as, even at cryogenic temperatures, thermal fluctuations are significant. Here, we use a gigahertz superconducting qubit to directly observe the quantization of a megahertz radio-frequency electromagnetic field. Using the qubit, we achieve quantum control over thermal photons, cooling to the ground-state and stabilizing photonic Fock states. Releasing the resonator from our control, we directly observe its re-thermalization dynamics with the bath with nanosecond resolution. Extending circuit quantum electrodynamics to a new regime, we enable the exploration of thermodynamics at the quantum scale and allow interfacing quantum circuits with megahertz systems such as spin systems or macroscopic mechanical oscillators."
https://openalex.org/W2920968489,"Introduction Using machine learning techniques, we developed a brief questionnaire to aid neurologists and neuropsychologists in the screening of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Methods With the reduction of the survey size as a goal of this research, feature selection based on information gain was performed to rank the contribution of the 45 items corresponding to patient responses to the specified questions. The most important items were used to build the optimal screening model based on the accuracy, practicality, and interpretability. The diagnostic accuracy for discriminating normal cognition (NC), MCI, very mild dementia (VMD) and dementia was validated in the test group. Results The screening model (NMD-12) was constructed with the 12 items that were ranked the highest in feature selection. The receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) in the test group was 0.94 for discriminating NC vs. MCI, 0.88 for MCI vs. VMD, 0.97 for MCI vs. dementia, and 0.96 for VMD vs. dementia, respectively. Discussion The NMD-12 model has been developed and validated in this study. It provides healthcare professionals with a simple and practical screening tool which accurately differentiates NC, MCI, VMD, and dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2921773708,"Objective A Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that can amass Electronic Health Record (EHR) and other patient data holds promise to provide accurate classification and guide treatment choices. Our objective is to develop the Decision Support System for Making Personalized Assessments and Recommendations Concerning Breast Cancer Patients (DPAC), which is a CDSS learned from data that recommends the optimal treatment decisions based on a patient’s features. Method We developed a Bayesian network architecture called Causal Modeling with Internal Layers (CAMIL), and an algorithm called Treatment Feature Interactions (TFI), which learns from data the interactions needed in a CAMIL model. Using the TFI algorithm, we learned interactions for six treatments from the LSDS-5YDM dataset. We created a CAMIL model using these interactions, resulting in a DPAC which recommends treatments towards preventing 5-year breast cancer metastasis. Results In a 5-fold cross-validation analysis, we compared the probability of being metastasis free in 5 years for patients who made decisions recommended by DPAC to those who did not. These probabilities are (the probability for those making the decisions appears first): chemotherapy (.938, .872); breast/chest wall radiation (.939, .902); nodal field radiation (.940, .784); antihormone (.941, .906); HER2 inhibitors (.934, .880); neadjuvant therapy (.931, .837). In an application of DPAC to the independent METABRIC dataset, the probabilities for chemotherapy were (.845, .788). Discussion Patients who took the advice of DPAC had, as a group, notably better outcomes than those who did not. We conclude that DPAC is effective at amassing and analyzing data towards treatment recommendations. Some of the findings in DPAC are controversial. For example, DPAC says that chemotherapy increases the chances of metastasis for many node negative patients. This controversy shows the importance of developing a conclusive version of DPAC to ensure we provide patients with the best patient-specific treatment recommendations."

https://openalex.org/W2921550909,"This study examined the relationship of weather conditions, together with sex and country of origin, with running performance in the Boston Marathon from 1972 to 2018. A total of 580,990 observations from 382,209 different finishers were analyzed using Generalized Additive Mixed Models. Different groups and subgroups were considered such as all runners, near elite 101:200 finishers, near elite 21:100, annual top ten finishers and annual winners. Weather conditions, over the hours of the event, were average air temperature (°C), total precipitations (mm), wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) (°C), wind speed (km/h), wind direction (head wind, side wind, tail wind) and barometric pressure (hPa). These effects were examined in a multi-variable model, together with: sex, country of origin, calendar year, an interaction term country:sex and a spline smooth term in function of calendar year and sex. The average temperature, when increasing by 1°C, was related to worsened performance (by 00:01:47 h:min:sec for all finishers and by 00:00:20 h:min:sec for annual winners). Also, the pressure and wet-bulb globe temperature, when increasing, were related to worsened performances. Tail wind improved performances of all groups. Increasing precipitation was significantly (p<0.05) related to worsened performances in all groups except annual winners. Increasing wind speed was also related to worsened performances in all finishers and near elite groups. Kenyans and Ethiopians were the fastest nationalities. The sex differences (men faster than women in all groups) were the largest in near elite groups. Our findings contributed to the knowledge of the performance in Boston Marathon across calendar years, considering as main effects weather conditions, country of origin and sex."

https://openalex.org/W2953377853,"Background Anemia, the world’s most common micro-nutrient deficiency disorder, can affect a person at any time and at all stages of life. Though all members of the community may face the problem, children aged 6–23 months are particularly at higher risk. If left untreated, it adversely affects the health, cognitive development, school achievement, and work performance. However, little was investigated among young children in Sub-Saharan countries including Ethiopia. This research aimed to investigate its magnitude and correlates to address the gap and guide design of evidence based intervention. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May -June 2016 in rural districts of Wolaita Zone. Multi-stage sampling technique was applied and 990 mother-child pairs were selected. Socio-demography, health and nutritional characteristics were collected by administering interview questionnaire to mothers/care-givers. Blood samples were taken to diagnose anemia by using HemoCue device, and the status was determined using cut-offs used for children aged 6–59 months. Hemoglobin concentration below 11.0 g/dl was considered anemic. Data were analyzed with Stata V14. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were applied to identify candidates and predictor variables respectively. Statistical significance was determined at p-value < 0.05 at 95% confidence interval. Results The mean hemoglobin level of children was 10.44±1.3g/dl, and 65.7% of them were anemic. Among anemic children, 0.4% were severely anemic (<7.0g/dl), while 28.1% and 37.2% were mildly (10.0–10.9g/dl) and moderately (7.0–9.9g/dl) anemic, respectively. In the multivariable analysis, having maternal age of 35 years and above (AOR = 1.96), being government employee (AOR = 0.29), being merchant (AOR = 0.43) and ‘other’ occupation (AOR = 3.17) were correlated with anemia in children in rural Wolaita. Similarly, receiving anti-helminthic drugs (AOR = 0.39), being female child (AOR = 1.76), consuming poor dietary diversity (AOR = 1.40), and having moderate household food insecurity (AOR = 1.72) were associated with anemia in rural Wolaita. Conclusion A large majority of children in the rural Wolaita were anemic and the need for proven public health interventions such as food diversification, provision of anti-helminthic drugs and ensuring household food security is crucial. In addition, educating women on nutrition and diet diversification, as well as engaging them with alternative sources of income might be interventions in the study area."
https://openalex.org/W2921183888,"Mapping out the magneto-Seebeck coefficient In the Seebeck effect, a temperature difference across a device generates voltage. If the thermal gradient is imposed across a magnetic tunnel junction—with two magnetized layers separated by an insulating tunnel barrier—the magnitude of the generated voltage depends on the relative orientation of the magnetization in the two layers. Transport measurements of this so-called magneto-Seebeck tunneling typically reveal only the signal averaged over the device. Friesen et al. created an atomic-scale version of this experiment by using a scanning tunneling microscope with a spin-polarized tip that they scanned across the surface of a magnetic sample. By heating the tip, they were able to map out the spatial dependence of the spin-resolved Seebeck coefficient. Science , this issue p. 1065"
https://openalex.org/W2921574070,"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of 8-week core training on core endurance and running economy in college athletes. Twenty-one male college athletes were randomly divided into 2 groups: a control group (CON) (n = 10) and a core training group (CT) (n = 11). Both groups maintained their regular training, whereas CT attended 3 extra core training sessions per week for 8 weeks. The participants were assessed before and after the training program using sensory organization test (SOT), sport-specific endurance plank test (SEPT) and 4-stage treadmill incremental running test (TIRT). Compared with the pre-test, significant improvements were observed in post-test SOT (78.8 ± 4.8 vs. 85.3 ± 4.8, p = 0.012) and SEPT (193.5 ± 71.9 s vs. 241.5 ± 98.9 s, p = 0.001) performances only in CT. In the TIRT, the post-test heart rate values were lower than the pre-test values in CT in the first 3 stages. In stage 4, the post-test oxygen consumption (VO2) was lower than that in pre-test in CT (VO2: 52.4 ± 3.5 vs. 50.0 ± 2.9 ml/kg/min, p = 0.019). These results reveal that 8-week core training may improve static balance, core endurance, and running economy in college athletes."
https://openalex.org/W2950860970,"Pyropia yezoensis is an economically important seaweed but its molecular genetics is poorly understood. In the present study, we used a doubled haploid (DH) population that was established in our previous work to construct a genetic linkage map of P. yezoensis and analyze the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of blades. The DH population was genotyped with fluorescent sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers. A chi-square test identified 301 loci with normal segregation (P ≥ 0.01) and 96 loci (24.18%) with low-level skewed segregation (0.001 ≤ P < 0.01). The genetic map was constructed after a total of 92 loci were assembled into three linkage groups (LGs). The map spanned 557.36 cM covering 93.71% of the estimated genome, with a mean interlocus space of 6.23 cM. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (α = 5%) showed a uniform distribution of the markers along each LG. On the genetic map, 10 QTLs associated with five economic traits of blades were detected. One QTL was for length, one for width, two for fresh weight, two for specific growth rate of length and four for specific growth rate of fresh weight. These QTLs could explain 2.29-7.87% of the trait variations, indicating that their effects were all minor. The results may serve as a framework for future marker-assisted breeding in P. yezoensis."

https://openalex.org/W2921596125,"In a recidivism prediction context, there is no consensus on which modeling strategy should be followed for obtaining an optimal prediction model. In previous papers, a range of statistical and machine learning techniques were benchmarked on recidivism data with a binary outcome. However, two important tree ensemble methods, namely gradient boosting and random forests were not extensively evaluated. In this paper, we further explore the modeling potential of these techniques in the binary outcome criminal prediction context. Additionally, we explore the predictive potential of classical statistical and machine learning methods for censored time-to-event data. A range of statistical manually specified statistical and (semi-)automatic machine learning models is fitted on Dutch recidivism data, both for the binary outcome case and censored outcome case. To enhance generalizability of results, the same models are applied to two historical American data sets, the North Carolina prison data. For all datasets, (semi-) automatic modeling in the binary case seems to provide no improvement over an appropriately manually specified traditional statistical model. There is however evidence of slightly improved performance of gradient boosting in survival data. Results on the reconviction data from two sources suggest that both statistical and machine learning should be tried out for obtaining an optimal model. Even if a flexible black-box model does not improve upon the predictions of a manually specified model, it can serve as a test whether important interactions are missing or other misspecification of the model are present and can thus provide more security in the modeling process."
https://openalex.org/W2922362419,"Polymerase γ catalytic subunit (POLG) gene encodes the enzyme responsible for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) synthesis. Mutations affecting POLG are the most prevalent cause of mitochondrial disease because of defective mtDNA replication and lead to a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes characterized by mtDNA deletions or depletion. Enhancing mitochondrial deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) synthesis effectively rescues mtDNA depletion in different models of defective mtDNA maintenance due to dNTP insufficiency. In this study, we studied mtDNA copy number recovery rates following ethidium bromide-forced depletion in quiescent fibroblasts from patients harboring mutations in different domains of POLG. Whereas control cells spontaneously recovered initial mtDNA levels, POLG-deficient cells experienced a more severe depletion and could not repopulate mtDNA. However, activation of deoxyribonucleoside (dN) salvage by supplementation with dNs plus erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (inhibitor of deoxyadenosine degradation) led to increased mitochondrial dNTP pools and promoted mtDNA repopulation in all tested POLG-mutant cells independently of their specific genetic defect. The treatment did not compromise POLG fidelity because no increase in multiple deletions or point mutations was detected. Our study suggests that physiologic dNTP concentration limits the mtDNA replication rate. We thus propose that increasing mitochondrial dNTP availability could be of therapeutic interest for POLG deficiency and other conditions in which mtDNA maintenance is challenged.-Blázquez-Bermejo, C., Carreño-Gago, L., Molina-Granada, D., Aguirre, J., Ramón, J., Torres-Torronteras, J., Cabrera-Pérez, R., Martín, M.

https://openalex.org/W2921291682,"Road development is occurring at an unprecedented rate in important conservation areas in tropical countries with limited understanding of how local people will adjust their livelihood activities in response. We use a discrete choice experiment to explore the effect of road development on respondents ex-ante preferences for changes in livelihood activities—crop and livestock production, hunting and trading bushmeat, and business and wage employment—under different incentives—provision of loans, livestock and crop extension services–in scenarios with reduced travel time to nearest district town in the Greater Serengeti Ecosystem in Tanzania. We test four hypotheses about the effects of roads with opposing implication for conservation. Hypothesis 1 predicts that increased market access will lead to intensification of crop and livestock production activities (achieved through extension services and loans), and Hypothesis 2 that market access will facilitate the development of non-farm Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) providing new livelihood opportunities (e.g. business income and wage employment)–both reducing environmental pressure. Hypotheis 3 on the other hand predicts that improved market access will lead to extensification and expansion of crop and livestock production activities, while Hypotheis 4 suggests that it will encourage exploitation of environmental goods (here in the form of hunting and trading bushmeat and illegal grazing inside protected areas)–both increasing environmental pressure. We find increasing preferences for more cropland and more cattle as travel time to market is reduced but no preference for increased allocation of household members to hunting and trading bushmeat supporting hypothesis 3 while contradicting hypothesis 4. However, second-order effects might support hypothesis 4 as we find aversion towards decreasing effort invested in hunting and trading bushmeat. Preferences for increased cropland and livestock may furthermore interact to increase land use change and illegal grazing inside protected areas. Crop extension services had a negative modifying effect on preferences for more cropland (supporting hypothesis 1) while livestock extension services had a positive modifying effect on preferences for more cattle (contradicting hypothesis 1). Providing loans had a negative modifying effect on preferences for increasing cropland and number of cattle. Marginal rates of substitution suggest that 950,000 TSH borrowed at a 10% interest rate will reduce preferences for more cropland and cattle by 11.8 and 38.4% respectively. Crop extension services reduce preferences for more cropland by 27% whereas livestock extension services increase preferences for more cattle by 104%. Contradicting Hypothesis 2, we found no preference for increasing the number of households members engaged in business and wage employment in response to reduced travel time. Targeted efforts to increase the educational level as well as entrepreneurship skills in the GSE could promote engagement in the labour market and development of business enterprises diverting focus from traditional activities such as farming and livestock production and hence reducing pressure on the ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2921416270,"The relationships of spirituality with human social cognition, as exemplified in autism spectrum and schizophrenia spectrum cognitive variation, remain largely unstudied. We quantified non-clinical levels of autism spectrum and schizotypal spectrum traits (using the Autism Quotient and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief Revised) and dimensions of spirituality (using the Hardt Spirituality Questionnaire) in a large sample of undergraduate students. We tested in particular the hypothesis, based on the diametrical model of autism and psychosis, that autism should be negatively associated, and positive schizotypal traits should be positively associated, with spirituality. Our primary findings were threefold. First, in support of the diametric model, total Spirituality score was significantly negatively correlated with total Autism Quotient score, and significantly positively correlated with Positive Schizotypal traits (the Schizotypal Personality Cognitive-Perceptual subscale), as predicted. Second, these associations were driven mainly by opposite patterns regarding the Search for Meaning Spirituality subscale, which was the only subscale that was significantly negatively associated with autism, and significantly positively associated with Positive Schizotypal traits. Third, Belief in God was positively correlated with Positive Schizotypal traits, but was uncorrelated with autism traits. The opposite findings for Search for Meaning can be interpreted in the contexts of well-supported cognitive models for understanding autism in terms of weak central coherence, and understanding Positive Schizotypal traits in terms of enhanced salience."
https://openalex.org/W2921058497,"Hypomagnesemia (blood Mg2+ concentration <0.7 mM) is a common electrolyte disorder in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but the etiology remains largely unknown. In patients with T2D, reduced blood Mg2+ levels are associated with an increased decline in renal function, independent of glycemic control and hypertension. To study the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon, we investigated the renal effects of hypomagnesemia in high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice. In mice fed a low dietary Mg2+, the HFD resulted in severe hypomagnesemia within 4 wk. Renal or intestinal Mg2+ wasting was not observed after 16 wk on the diets. Despite the absence of urinary or fecal Mg2+ loss, the HFD induced a reduction in the mRNA expression transient receptor potential melastatin type 6 in both the kidney and colon. mRNA expression of distal convoluted tubule (DCT)-specific genes was down-regulated by the LowMg-HFD, indicating atrophy of the DCT. The low dietary Mg2+ resulted in severe HFD-induced proximal tubule phospholipidosis, which was absent in mice on a NormalMg-HFD. This was accompanied by albuminuria, moderate renal damage, and alterations in renal energy metabolism, including enhanced gluconeo-genesis and cholesterol synthesis. In conclusion, this study shows that hypomagnesemia is a consequence of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Moreover, hypomagnesemia induces major structural changes in the diabetic kidney, including proximal tubular phospholipidosis, providing a novel mechanism for the increased renal decline in patients with hypomagnesemic T2D.—Kurstjens, S., Smeets, B., Overmars-Bos, C., Dijkman, H.

This brooding coral endemic to the South Atlantic can be found across a wide range of latitudes and longitudes, including the Mid-Atlantic islands. Even though it occurs primarily in shallower environments, F. gravida is among the few coral species that live in habitats with extreme environmental conditions (high irradiance, temperature, and turbidity) such as very shallow tide pools. In the present study, we show that F. gravida exhibits some degree of flexibility in its symbiotic association with zooxanthellae across its range. F. gravida associates predominantly with Cladocopium C3 (ITS2 type Symbiodinium C3) but also with Symbiodinium A3, Symbiodinium linucheae (ITS2 type A4), Cladocopium C1, Cladocopium C130, and Fugacium F3. Symbiont diversity varied across biogeographic regions (Symbiodinium A3 and S. linucheae were found in the Tropical Eastern Atlantic, Cladocopium C1 in the Mid-Atlantic, and other subtypes in the Southwestern Atlantic) and was affected by local environmental conditions. In addition, Symbiodiniaceae diversity was highest in a southwestern Atlantic oceanic island (Rocas Atoll). Understanding the relationship between corals and their algal symbionts is critical in determining the factors that control the ecological niches of zooxanthellate corals and their symbionts, and identifying host-symbiont pairs that may be more resistant to environmental changes."
https://openalex.org/W2921972765,"A safe and effective adjuvant is necessary to induce reliable protective efficacy of the protein-based vaccines against tuberculosis (TB). Mycobacterial components, such as synthetic cord factor and arabinogalactan, have been used as one of the adjuvant components. Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette- Guérin cell-wall skeleton (BCG-CWS) has been used as an effective immune-stimulator. However, it is not proven whether BCG-CWS can be an effective adjuvant for the subunit protein vaccine of TB. In this study, we demonstrated that the BCG-CWS effectively coupled with Ag85B and enhanced the conjugated Ag85B activity on the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). Ag85B-BCG-CWS-matured DCs induced significant Th1 and Th17 responses when compared to BCG-CWS or Ag85B alone. In addition, significant Ag85B-specific Th1 and Th17 responses were induced in Ag85B-BCG-CWS-immunized mice before infection with M. tuberculosis and maintained after infection. Moreover, Ag85B-BCG-CWS showed significant protective effect comparable to live BCG at 6 weeks after infection and maintained its protective efficacy at 32 weeks post-challenge, whereas live BCG did not. These results suggest that the BCG-CWS may be an effective adjuvant candidate for a protein-based vaccine against TB."

https://openalex.org/W2921290443,"An important segment of the reliability-based optimization problems is to get access to the sensitivity derivatives. However, since the failure probability is not a closed-form function of the input variables, the derivatives are not explicitly computable and rather require a full reliability analysis which is computationally expensive. In this paper, a step-by-step algorithm has been presented to calculate the derivatives of the probability of failure and safety index with respect to the input parameters based on the advanced first-order second-moment (AFOSM) reliability method. The proposed algorithm is then implemented in a spreadsheet using Visual Basic for Application (VBA) programming language. Two geotechnical and structural examples are then presented to examine the program and describe the modeling procedure. The robustness of the proposed method is examined using a Gaussian random perturbation. The capability of the proposed method in the calculation of the sensitivity derivatives of the model uncertainty is explained in a separate section. Finally, the proposed model has been compared to the forward finite difference (FFD) method and the results are validated."
https://openalex.org/W2922176588,"Background Visual outcome is one of the main issues in the treatment of optic pathway glioma in childhood. Although the prognostic factors of low vision have been discussed extensively, no reliable indicators for visual loss exist. Therefore, we aimed to define initial and evolving factors associated with long-term vision loss. Methods We conducted a multicenter historical cohort study of children treated in France with up-front BB-SFOP chemotherapy between 1990 and 2004. Visual acuity performed at the long-term follow-up visit or within 6 months prior was analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the effects of clinical and radiological factors on long-term visual outcome. Findings Of the 180 patients in the cohort, long-term visual acuity data were available for 132 (73.3%) patients (median follow-up: 14.2 years; range: 6.1–25.6). At the last follow-up, 61/132 patients (46.2%) had impaired vision, and 35 of these patients (57.3%) were partially sighted or blind. Multivariate analysis showed that factors associated with a worse prognosis for long-term visual acuity were an age at diagnosis of < 1 year (OR 3.5 [95% CI: 1.1–11.2], p = 0.04), tumor extent (OR 4.7 [95% CI: 1.2–19.9], p = 0.03), intracranial hypertension requiring one or more surgical procedures (OR 5.6 [95% CI: 1.8–18.4], p = 0.003), and the need for additional treatment after initial BB-SFOP chemotherapy (OR 3.5 [95% CI: 1.1–11.9], p = 0.04). NF1 status did not appear as a prognostic factor, but in non-NF1 patients, a decrease in tumor volume with contrast enhancement after BB-SFOP chemotherapy was directly associated with a better visual prognosis (OR 0.8 [95% CI: 0.8–0.9], p = 0.04). Interpretation Our study confirms that a large proportion of children with optic pathway glioma have poor long-term outcomes of visual acuity. These data suggest new prognostic factors for visual acuity, but these results need to be confirmed further by large- and international-scale studies."

Bullying is intentional and goal oriented aggressive behavior in which the perpetrator exploits an imbalance of power to repeatedly dominate the victim. To differentiate bullying from aggressive behavior, assessment must include a valid measure of power imbalance as perceived by the victim. And yet, to date, there remains no agreement as to how to most accurately measure power imbalance among preadolescent children. This qualitative study explored children's (age 9 to 11) understanding of power imbalance through thematic analysis of focus group discussions. Subthemes that emerged as influencing power imbalance include: age of victim, peer valued characteristics, and group membership and position. Subthemes of empathy and peer valued characteristics emerged as protecting against the negative impact of power imbalance."

https://openalex.org/W2921922020,"Background Studies have shown that overnight closed-loop insulin delivery can improve glucose control and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia and hence may improve metabolic outcomes and reduce burden for children with type 1 diabetes and their families. However, research so far has not reported insulin levels while comparing closed-loop to open-loop insulin delivery in children. Therefore, in this study we obtained glucose levels as well as plasma insulin levels in children with type 1 diabetes to evaluate the efficacy of a model—based closed-loop algorithm compared to an open-loop administration. Methods Fifteen children with type 1 diabetes, 6–12 years, participated in this open-label single center study. We used a randomized cross over design in which we compared overnight closed-loop insulin delivery with sensor augmented pump therapy for two nights in both the hospital and at home (i.e., 1 night in-patient stay and at home per treatment condition). Only during the in-patient stay, hourly plasma insulin and blood glucose levels were assessed and are reported in this paper. Results Results of paired sample t-tests revealed that although plasma insulin levels were significantly lower during the closed-loop than in the open-loop (Mean difference 36.51 pmol/l; t(13) = 2.13, p = .03, effect size d = 0.57), blood glucose levels did not vary between conditions (mean difference 0.76 mmol/l; t(13) = 1.24, p = .12, d = 0.37). The administered dose of insulin was significantly lower during the closed-loop compared with the open-loop (mean difference 0.10 UI; t(12) = 2.45, p = .02, d = 0.68). Conclusions Lower insulin doses were delivered in the closed-loop, resulting in lower plasma insulin levels, whereby glucose levels were not affected negatively. This suggests that the closed-loop administration is better targeted and hence could be more effective."
https://openalex.org/W2922083886,"Background The association between chronically elevated cortisol, as measured by hair cortisol concentration (HCC), and dietary intake among children has generally not been explored. Moreover, it is unknown whether there is an association between parental HCC and dietary intake among their children. Objective To examine associations between HCC and dietary intake among children, and to explore the association between parental HCC and dietary intake among their children. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study based on 296 children predisposed to overweight and obesity who participated in the Healthy Start study. Multiple Linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between HCC and total energy intake, macronutrients, fruit and vegetables, added sugar, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), and a diet quality index (DQI). Results Among the children, we found that higher HCC was associated with a lower consumption of dietary fat (β: -0.7 g/day [95% CI: -1.3, -0.0] per 100 pg/mg HCC). We found no statistically significant association between HCC and intake of total energy, protein, carbohydrate, fruit and vegetables, added sugar, SSB or DQI. We found no association between parental HCC and intake of total energy, added sugar, selected food groups or DQI among their children. However, stratified analyses showed that paternal HCC was associated with a borderline significant lower total energy intake and significantly lower protein intake, but only among daughters (adjusted β: -42 kcal/day [95% CI: -85, 0] and -2.6 g/day [95% CI: -4.4, -0.8] per 100 pg/mg HCC, respectively). Conclusion Among children, chronic stress as measured by HCC may be associated with a lower fat consumption, and paternal HCC may be associated with a lower intake of energy and protein among their daughters. However, the associations observed were weak, and any clinical relevance of these findings remains questionable."
https://openalex.org/W2921745280,"We aim to identify physiologic regulators of dopamine (DA) signaling in obesity but previously did not find a compelling relationship with insulin sensitivity measured by oral-minimal model (OMM) and DA subtype 2 and 3 receptor (D2/3R) binding potential (BPND). Reduced disposition index (DI), a β-cell function metric that can also be calculated by OMM, was shown to predict a negative reward behavior that occurs in states of lower endogenous DA. We hypothesized that reduced DI would occur with higher D2/3R BPND, reflecting lower endogenous DA. Participants completed PET scanning, with a displaceable radioligand to measure D2/3R BPND, and a 5-hour oral glucose tolerance test to measure DI by OMM. We studied 26 age-similar females without (n = 8) and with obesity (n = 18) (22 vs 39 kg/m2). Reduced DI predicted increased striatal D2/3R BPND independent of BMI. By accounting for β-cell function, we were able to determine that the state of insulin and glucose metabolism is pertinent to striatal D2/3R BPND in obesity.

https://openalex.org/W2922491232,"Diarrheic diseases account for the annual death of approximately 1.9 million children under the age of 5 years, and it is a major cause of work absenteeism in developed countries. As diarrheagenic bacteria, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) attach to cells in the small intestine, causing local disappearance of microvilli and inducing the formation of actin-rich pedestals that disrupt the intestinal barrier and help EPEC adhere to and infect intestinal cells. Antibiotics and other bioactive compounds can often be found by analyzing traditional medicines. Here a crude aqueous extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa, which typically grows in subtropical and tropical areas and is a popular medicinal tisane in many countries, was analyzed for antibacterial activity against EPEC. In standard microdilution assays, the extract showed a minimum inhibitory concentration of 6.5 mg/ml against EPEC growth. Time-kill kinetics assays demonstrated significant 24 h bactericidal activity at 25 mg/ml. The extract is able to impede pedestal induction. Not only did the extract inhibit preformed pedestals but it prevented pedestal induction as well. Remarkably, it also promoted the formation of EPEC filaments, as observed with other antibiotics. Our results in vitro support the potential of Hibiscus sabdariffa as an antimicrobial agent against EPEC."

https://openalex.org/W2922355714,"A commercial corn ethanol production byproduct (syrup) was used as a bacterial growth medium with the long-term aim to repurpose the resulting microbial biomass as a protein supplement in aquaculture feeds. Anaerobic batch reactors were used to enrich for soil bacteria metabolizing the syrup as the sole nutrient source over an eight-day period with the goal of obtaining pure cultures of facultative organisms from the reactors. Amplification of the V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed using barcoded primers to track the succession of microbes enriched for during growth on the syrup. The resulting PCR products were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq protocols, analyzed via the program QIIME, and the alpha-diversity was calculated. Seven bacterial families were the most prevalent in the bioreactor community after eight days of enrichment: Clostridiaceae, Alicyclobacillaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Burkholderiaceae, Bacillaceae, Veillonellaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae. Pure culture isolates obtained from the reactors, and additional laboratory stock strains, capable of facultative growth, were grown aerobically in microtiter plates with the syrup substrate to monitor growth yield. Reactor isolates of interest were identified at a species level using the full 16S rRNA gene and other biomarkers. Bacillus species, commonly used as probiotics in aquaculture, showed the highest biomass yield of the monocultures examined. Binary combinations of monocultures yielded no apparent synergism between organisms, suggesting competition for nutrients instead of cooperative metabolite conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2921861292,"Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common community-based bacterial infections. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are guided by local resistance rates. Previous research suggests that cultures are overused for uncomplicated cystitis, but practice patterns have not been described in detail. Variations in culturing have implications for the interpretation of antibiotic resistance rates.We used a retrospective cohort study to analyze variations in urine culturing among physicians, controlling for patient and physician characteristics. We identified all outpatient physician visits among adults and children for cystitis in British Columbia between 2005 and 2011 using administrative data and linked these to laboratory data on urine cultures. Using hierarchical generalized linear mixed models we explored variations in urine culture submissions for cystitis (ICD code 595) and the associations with patient and physician characteristics, stratified by patient sex.Urine cultures were associated with 16% of visits for cystitis among females and 9% among males, and 59% of visits overall were associated with antibiotic treatment. Older patients, patients with a recent antibiotic prescription, and long term care residents were significantly less likely to have a culture associated with a cystitis visit, whether male or female. Female physicians and physicians with 16-35 years' experience were more likely to culture, while international medical graduates were less likely-particularly for female visits. Notably, there was substantial unexplained variation among physicians after controlling for physician characteristics: we found a 24-fold variation in the odds of culturing a female UTI between physicians who were otherwise similar.Individual physicians show substantial variation in their propensity to submit cultures for cystitis visits. Reducing such variation and encouraging appropriate levels of culturing would support effective antibiotic use."
https://openalex.org/W2922352574,"To solve the problem of the deadline-constrained task scheduling in the cloud computing system, this paper proposes a deadline-constrained scheduling algorithm for cloud computing based on the driver of dynamic essential path (Deadline-DDEP). According to the changes of the dynamic essential path of each task node in the scheduling process, the dynamic sub-deadline strategy is proposed. The strategy assigns different sub-deadline values to every task node to meet the constraint relations among task nodes and the user's defined deadline. The strategy fully considers the dynamic sub-deadline affected by the dynamic essential path of task node in the scheduling process. The paper proposed the quality assessment of optimization cost strategy to solve the problem of selecting server for each task node. Based on the sub-deadline urgency and the relative execution cost in the scheduling process, the strategy selects the server that not only meets the sub-deadline but also obtains much lower execution cost. In this way, the proposed algorithm will make the task graph complete within its deadline, and minimize its total execution cost. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed algorithm via the simulation experiments using Matlab tools. The experimental results show that, the proposed algorithm produces remarkable performance improvement rate on the total execution cost that ranges between 10.3% and 30.8% under meeting the deadline constraint. In view of the experimental results, the proposed algorithm provides better-quality scheduling solution that is suitable for scientific application task execution in the cloud computing environment than IC-PCP, DCCP and CD-PCP."

https://openalex.org/W2922066812,"Frequent typing and molecular characterization of influenza A (IAV) strains are crucial for the identification of circulating subtypes and for the selection of the subtypes' lineages to be included in the annually prepared vaccine cocktail. We investigated IAV sampled from an underrepresented population from Palestine. 200 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected between February and May of 2015 from Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank suffering from mild to severe symptoms of upper respiratory infections. NPA were screened for the presence of IAV using RT-PCR. Epidemiological data, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene sequences were analyzed in IAV positive samples. 50 samples tested positive for IAV; 48% of which were identified as A(H1N1)pdm09 and 52% as A(H3N2), respectively. Infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 occurred mainly in April, while A(H3N2) infections were mainly detected in March. Most IAV infections in 6-year-olds and below were attributed to subtype A(H3N2), while A(H1N1)pdm09 was responsible for most infections in adults above 18-year-olds. Analyses of HA and NA amino acid sequences revealed numerous substitutions. Thereafter, and based on the HA analysis, the Palestinian A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates fell into clade 6B, while the A(H3N2) isolates fell into clades 3C.2 and 3C.3, respectively. This study is significant in providing the first insight into the epidemiology and genetic properties of IAV circulating in Palestine. In contrast to international reports for the same season, A(H3N2) was not the dominant subtype as in northern hemisphere, nor was A(H1N1)pdm09 as in WHO reports for the Middle East, however genetic properties of Palestinian A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 were in line with global isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2922297551,"Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) is a large double-stranded DNA virus that causes genital sores when spread by sexual contact and is a principal cause of viral encephalitis in newborns and infants. Viral glycoproteins enable virion entry into and spread between cells, making glycoproteins a prime target for vaccine development. A truncated glycoprotein D2 (gD2) vaccine candidate, recently tested in the phase 3 Herpevac Trial for Women, did not prevent HSV-2 infection in initially seronegative women. Some women who became infected experienced multiple recurrences during the trial. The HSV US7, US8, and US9 genes encode glycoprotein I (gI), glycoprotein E (gE), and the US9 type II membrane protein, respectively. These proteins participate in viral spread across cell junctions and facilitate anterograde transport of virion components in neurons, prompting us to investigate whether sequence variants in these genes could be associated with frequent recurrence. The nucleotide sequences and dN/dS ratios of the US7-US9 region from viral isolates of individuals who experienced multiple recurrences were compared with those who had had a single episode of disease. No consistent polymorphism(s) distinguished the recurrent isolates. In frequently recurring isolates, the dN/dS ratio of US7 was low while greater variation (higher dN/dS ratio) occurred in US8, suggesting conserved function of the former during reactivation. Phylogenetic reconstruction of the US7-US9 region revealed eight strongly supported clusters within the 55 U.S. HSV-2 strains sampled, which were preserved in a second global phylogeny. Thus, although we have demonstrated evolutionary diversity in the US7-US9 complex, we found no molecular evidence of sequence variation in US7-US9 that distinguishes isolates from subjects with frequently recurrent episodes of disease."

> “I realized that my tiredness and depression came during the gloomy winter months.” 

Early in my Ph.D., this felt like my near daily routine. I attributed my newfound difficulties to the stress of starting a Ph.D. program and being far from home. But it was odd: Before graduate school, I was an early riser and thought most clearly in the mornings. I couldn't understand why I was suddenly unable to get out of bed. I felt guilty about my lack of focus and frustrated that I was no longer capitalizing on my best working hours.

After 2 years, a light bulb went off in my head. I realized that my tiredness and depression came during the gloomy winter months. That was the clue that pointed me toward a solution.

I had grown up and gone to college in Arizona, where a lack of sunlight was never an issue. My first experience living elsewhere came when I started graduate school in upstate New York, which is notoriously gray during the winters, with low-hanging clouds blanketing the region day in and day out. The prospect of cold and snowy winters was scary, but I was thrilled to have the opportunity to study in a top program in my field.

Once there, I heard people on campus talk—and, unfortunately, joke—about seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a severe form of “winter blues” that's triggered by low light levels. As my health and well-being took a downturn each winter, eventually I realized that SAD might be the cause, and I needed to do something about it.

A website suggested an alarm clock that simulates the sunrise, becoming brighter and brighter as your wake-up time approaches. I decided to give that a try. It turned out to be a lifesaver, helping me get out of bed in the morning on time and feeling rested. That first taste of a successful solution spurred me to visit a doctor, who confirmed my self-diagnosis and suggested a few other things I could try. It was a relief to discover that my condition had a name and that I could take steps to feel better.

Now in the fifth year of my Ph.D., I no longer dread the arrival of winter because I finally have a solid strategy to deal with SAD. I have a much easier time getting up and starting my day if I stick with a regular routine. So, I wake up when my sunrise-simulating alarm clock tells me to—at the same time each day—and soak up a daily dose of artificial rays by basking in front of a full-spectrum light therapy box. And as much as possible, I make the journey home to sunny Arizona for a few weeks during the winter months, although that's not always feasible on my grad student stipend.

Most important, I've learned to be kinder to myself. I've always been a high achiever in all aspects of my life, so it has been difficult to give myself a break when I fall short of my ambitious self-imposed deadlines. The reality is that, despite my best efforts, my winter self still struggles to muster the kind of energy and motivation that propels me during the summer months—and I've come to accept that.

My experience with SAD has also heightened my awareness that I need to prioritize my health in the future, when choosing a place to live long term. I'm still glad I chose to attend the grad school I did, but I don't want to keep paying the psychological cost of living in a gloomy place. I know my need for sunshine will limit potential job options, but it's important for me to find a place that works for both my personal and professional life.

For now, though, I'm celebrating the fact that the days are getting longer, and spring is just around the corner.
