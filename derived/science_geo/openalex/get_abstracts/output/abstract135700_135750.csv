https://openalex.org/W2749679400,"One of the first difficulties in developing monoclonal antibody therapeutics was the recognition that human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response limited the administration of murine antibodies. Creative science has lead to a number of ways to counter the immunogenicity of non-human antibodies, primarily through chimeric, humanized, de-immunized, and most recently, human-sequence therapeutic antibodies. Once therapeutic antibodies of low or no immunogenicity were available, the creativity then turned to engineering both the antigen-binding domains (e.g., affinity maturation, stability) and altering the effector functions (e.g. antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and clearance rate)."
https://openalex.org/W1989969820,"We determined whether resveratrol, a phenolic antioxidant found in grapes and other food products, inhibited phorbol ester (PMA)-mediated induction of COX-2 in human mammary and oral epithelial cells. Treatment of cells with PMA induces COX-2 and causes a marked increase in the production of prostaglandin E2. These effects were inhibited by resveratrol. Resveratrol suppressed PMA-mediated increases in COX-2 mRNA and protein. Nuclear run-offs revealed increased rates of COX-2transcription after treatment with PMA, an effect that was inhibited by resveratrol. PMA caused about a 6-fold increase in COX-2promoter activity, which was suppressed by resveratrol. Transient transfections utilizing COX-2 promoter deletion constructs and COX-2 promoter constructs, in which specific enhancer elements were mutagenized, indicated that the effects of PMA and resveratrol were mediated via a cyclic AMP response element. Resveratrol inhibited PMA-mediated activation of protein kinase C. Overexpressing protein kinase C-α, ERK1, and c-Jun led to 4.7-, 5.1-, and 4-fold increases in COX-2 promoter activity, respectively. These effects also were inhibited by resveratrol. Resveratrol blocked PMA-dependent activation of AP-1-mediated gene expression. In addition to the above effects on gene expression, we found that resveratrol also directly inhibited the activity of COX-2. These data are likely to be important for understanding the anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties of resveratrol.

There are two isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX) 1The abbreviations used are: COXcyclooxygenaseCREcyclic AMP response elementPGE2prostaglandin E2PKCprotein kinase CAP-1activator protein-1PMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. that catalyze the formation of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid. COX-1 is a housekeeping gene that is expressed constitutively (1Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol.

COX-2 is an immediate, early response gene that is highly inducible by mitogenic and inflammatory stimuli (2Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

The differences in the regulation of COX-1 andCOX-2 gene expression reflect differences in the regulatory elements in the 5′-flanking regions of the two genes (5Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y.

Considerable evidence has accumulated to suggest that COX-2 is important for tumorigenesis. For example, COX-2 is up-regulated in transformed cells (6Subbaramaiah K. Telang N. Ramonetti J.T. Araki R.

Carcinogen. 1995; 12: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), whereas levels of COX-1 remain essentially unchanged. A null mutation forCOX-2 markedly reduced the number and size of intestinal tumors in a murine model of familial adenomatous polyposis,i.e. APCΔ716 knockout mice (13Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E.

COX-2 deficiency also protected against the formation of extraintestinal tumors. Thus, COX-2 knockout mice developed approximately 75% fewer chemically induced skin papillomas than control mice (14Tiano H. Chulada P. Spalding J. Lee C. Loftin C. Mahler J. Morham S. Langenbach R. Proc. Am. Assn. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 1727Google Scholar). A selective inhibitor of COX-2 caused nearly complete suppression of azoxymethane-induced colon cancer (15Kawamori T. Rao C.V. Seibert K. Reddy B.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 409-412PubMed Google Scholar). There are several possible mechanisms that could account for the link between COX-2 and cancer.

In combination, these studies suggest that targeted inhibition of COX-2 is a promising approach to prevent cancer. Therefore, chemopreventive strategies have focused on inhibitors of COX enzyme activity. An equally important strategy may be to identify compounds that suppress the expression of COX-2 (25Mestre J.R. Subbaramaiah K. Sacks P.G. Schantz S.P. Tanabe T. Inoue H. Dannenberg A.J.

Resveratrol is a phytoalexin found in grapes and other foods that has anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects (27Jang M. Cai L. Udeani G.O. Slowing K.V. Thomas C.F. Beecher C.W.W. Fong H.H.S.

It inhibits the development of preneoplastic lesions in carcinogen-treated mouse mammary glands, for example, and it blocks tumorigenesis in a two-stage model of skin cancer that was promoted by treatment with phorbol ester (27Jang M. Cai L. Udeani G.O. Slowing K.V. Thomas C.F. Beecher C.W.W. Fong H.H.S. Farnsworth N.R. Kinghorn A.D. Mehta R.G. Moon R.C. Pezzuto J.M. Science. 1997; 275: 218-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (4551) Google Scholar). The anti-inflammatory properties of resveratrol were demonstrated by suppression of carrageenan-induced pedal edema (27Jang M. Cai L. Udeani G.O. Slowing K.V. Thomas C.F. Beecher C.W.W. Fong H.H.S.

Science. 1997; 275: 218-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (4551) Google Scholar), an effect attributed to suppression of PG synthesis via direct, selective inhibition of COX-1. In the current work, we have extended prior observations (27Jang M. Cai L. Udeani G.O. Slowing K.V. Thomas C.F. Beecher C.W.W. Fong H.H.S. Farnsworth N.R. Kinghorn A.D. Mehta R.G. Moon R.C.

Science. 1997; 275: 218-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (4551) Google Scholar) concerning the effects of resveratrol on PG synthesis by determining if resveratrol modulates the expression of theCOX-2 gene. Our data show that resveratrol suppresses the activation of COX-2 gene expression by inhibiting the PKC signal transduction pathway. Contrary to prior results (27Jang M. Cai L. Udeani G.O. Slowing K.V. Thomas C.F. Beecher C.W.W. Fong H.H.S. Farnsworth N.R. Kinghorn A.D. Mehta R.G. Moon R.C. Pezzuto J.M. Science. 1997; 275: 218-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (4551) Google Scholar), we also found that resveratrol directly inhibits the activity of COX-2. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory properties of resveratrol. Minimal essential medium, PKC assay kits, and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies, Inc. Keratinocyte basal and growth media were from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego).

Reagents for the luciferase assay were from Analytical Luminescence (San Diego). The 18 S rRNA cDNA was from Ambion, Inc. Rabbit polyclonal anti-human COX-2 antiserum and goat polyclonal anti-human COX-1 antiserum were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Western blotting detection reagents (ECL) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Plasmid DNA was prepared using a kit from Promega. The 184B5/HER cell line has been described previously (28Zhai Y-F. Beittenmiller H. Wang B. Gould M.N. Oakley C. Esselman W.J. Welsch C.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2272-2278PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in minimal essential-keratinocyte basal media mixed in a ratio of 1:1 (basal medium) containing epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml), transferrin (10 μg/ml), gentamicin (5 μg/ml), and insulin (10 μg/ml) (growth medium). Cells were grown to 60% confluence, trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin, 2 mm EDTA, and plated for experimental use. MSK Leuk1 was established from a dysplastic leukoplakia lesion adjacent to a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue in a 46-year-old nonsmoking female (29Sacks P.G. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 27-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely maintained in keratinocyte growth medium and passaged using 0.125% trypsin, 2 mm EDTA. In all experiments, 184B5/HER and MSK Leuk1 cells were grown in basal medium for 24 h prior to treatment. Treatment with vehicle (0.2% Me2SO), resveratrol, or PMA was always carried out in basal medium. Cellular cytotoxicity was assessed by measurements of cell number, release of lactate dehydrogenase, and the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, which was performed according to the method of Denizot and Lang (30Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4357) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. There was no evidence of toxicity in any of our experiments. 5 × 104 cells/well were plated in 6-well dishes and grown to 60% confluence in growth medium. The cells were then treated as described below. Levels of PGE2 released by the cells were measured by enzyme immunoassay. Rates of production of PGE2were normalized to protein concentrations. The effect of resveratrol, indomethacin, and NS398 on the activity of COX-2 was measured using baculovirus-expressed recombinant human COX-2 enzyme (supplied by J. K. Gierse, Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO) (31Gierse J.K. Hauser S.D. Creely D.P. Koboldt C. Rangwala S.H. Isakson P.C. Seibert K. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The activity of COX-2 was determined in a microliter scale by measuring the synthesis of PGE2. The incubation mixture contained COX-2 protein (0.45 μg), various concentrations of test compounds dissolved in ethanol, 1 mm reduced glutathione, 1 mm epinephrine-hydrogentartrate, and 0.05 mmsodium-EDTA in 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 8.0) (32Wagner H. Wierer M. Bauer R. Planta Med. 1986; 52: 184-187Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by addition of 2.5 μm[3H]arachidonic acid (0.25 μCi), in a final volume of 100 μl, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 10% formic acid. Samples were extracted with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. After centrifugation, the ethyl acetate layer was evaporated under N2 and resuspended in 100 μl of acetonitrile for high pressure liquid chromatography analysis. An aliquot (10 μl) was applied to a reverse-phase column (RCM Nova-pak C18, 8 × 100 mm, Waters Associates, Milford, MA) in conjunction with a C18guard column, and eluted with an acetonitrile-water (30:70 (A), 80:20 (B)) gradient containing 1% (v/v) 0.1 n phosphoric acid. Elution conditions were as follows: gradient from 100% A to 100% B in 18 min, then 100% B for 10 min, with a flow rate of 1 ml/min (32Wagner H. Wierer M. Bauer R. Planta Med. 1986; 52: 184-187Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The separated arachidonic acid and PGE2 were monitored with an on-line radiochemical detector (β-Ram IN/US System Inc., Tempa, FL), and the peaks were identified by cochromatography with unlabeled reference compounds. Cell lysates were prepared by treating cells with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mmTris (pH 8.0), 1% Tween 20, 50 mm diethyldithiocarbamate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were sonicated for 20 s on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to sediment the particulate material. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS/PAGE was performed under reducing conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose sheets as detailed by Towbin et al. (35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane was then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-COX-2 antiserum or a polyclonal anti-COX-1 antiserum. Secondary antibody to IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used. The blots were probed with the ECL Western blot detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cell monolayers using an RNA isolation kit from Qiagen Inc. 10 μg of total cellular RNA per lane were electrophoresed in a formaldehyde-containing 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to nylon-supported membranes. After baking, membranes were prehybridized overnight in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × sodium chloride-sodium phosphate-EDTA buffer (SSPE), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml single-stranded salmon sperm DNA and then hybridized for 12 h at 42 °C with radiolabeled cDNA probes for human COX-2cDNA and 18 S rRNA. After hybridization, membranes were washed twice for 20 min at room temperature in 2 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS, twice for 20 min in the same solution at 55 °C and twice for 20 min in 0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Washed membranes were then subjected to autoradiography. COX-2 and 18 S rRNA probes were labeled with [32P]CTP by random priming. 2.5 × 105 cells were plated in four T150 dishes for each condition. Cells were grown in growth medium until approximately 60% confluent. Nuclei were isolated and stored in liquid nitrogen. For the transcription assay, nuclei (1.0 × 107) were thawed and incubated in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8), 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.3 m KCl) containing 100 μCi of uridine 5′[α-32P]triphosphate and 1 mmunlabeled nucleotides. After 30 min, labeled nascent RNA transcripts were isolated. The human COX-2, c-jun, c-myc, and β-actin cDNAs were immobilized onto nitrocellulose and prehybridized overnight in hybridization buffer. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 24 h using equal cpm/ml of labeled nascent RNA transcripts for each treatment group. The membranes were washed twice with 2 × SSC buffer for 1 h at 55 °C and then treated with 10 mg/ml RNase A in 2 × SSC at 37 °C for 30 min, dried, and autoradiographed. The COX-2 promoter constructs (−1432/+59, −327/+59, −220/+59, −124/+59, −52/+59, ILM, CRM, and CRM-ILM) have been described previously (5Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol.

The ERK1 expression vector was obtained from Dr. Melanie Cobb (Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The c-myc cDNA was a gift from Dr. Charles Sawyer (University of California, Los Angeles). The PKC-α expression vector was provided by Dr. Geoffrey Cooper (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). pSV-βgal was obtained from Promega. 184B5/HER cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 6-well dishes and grown to 50–60% confluence. For each well, 2 μg of plasmid DNA were introduced into cells using 8 μg of LipofectAMINE as per the manufacturer's instructions. After 7 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with basal medium. The activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase were measured in cellular extract as described previously (25Mestre J.R. Subbaramaiah K. Sacks P.G. Schantz S.P. Tanabe T. Inoue H. Dannenberg A.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1081-1085PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of PKC was measured according to directions from Life Technologies, Inc. Briefly, cells were plated in 10-cm dishes at 106 cells/dish and grown to 60% confluence. Cells were then treated with fresh basal medium containing vehicle (0.2% Me2SO), PMA (50 ng/ml), or PMA (50 ng/ml) plus resveratrol (15 μm) for 30 min. Total PKC activity was measured in cell lysates. To determine cytosolic and membrane-bound PKC activity, cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant contains cytosolic PKC; membrane-bound PKC activity is present in the pellet. Subsequently, DEAE-cellulose columns were used to partially purify PKC enzymes. Protein kinase C activity was then measured by incubating partially purified PKC with [γ-32P]ATP (3000–6000 Ci/mmol) and the substrate myelin basic protein for 20 min at room temperature. The activity of PKC is expressed as cpm incorporated/μg protein. Comparisons between groups were made by the Student's t test. A difference between groups ofp < 0.05 was considered significant. The data in Fig.2 A show that resveratrol caused dose-dependent suppression of PGE2synthesis in human mammary epithelial cells. To evaluate whether the inhibition of PG synthesis was because of inhibition of COX-2 or COX-1, we compared the effects of resveratrol and a selective inhibitor of COX-2 (NS398). We note that NS398 decreased the synthesis of PGs to less than 10% of the control level (Fig. 2 B). This means that more than 90% of basal COX activity in mammary epithelial cells was because of the COX-2 isoform; the presence of COX-2 under basal conditions is consistent with its transformed phenotype (6Subbaramaiah K.

Oakley C. Esselman W.J. Welsch C.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2272-2278PubMed Google Scholar). As resveratrol (30 μm) caused approximately a 70% decrease in basal production of PGE2 (Fig. 2 A), our data show that the predominant inhibitory effect of resveratrol on synthesis of PGs was via inhibition of the COX-2 isoform of cyclooxygenase. A second experiment was conducted to confirm that resveratrol directly inhibited COX-2 enzyme activity (Fig. 3). Phorbol esters are potent inducers of COX-2 (25Mestre J.R. Subbaramaiah K. Sacks P.G. Schantz S.P. Tanabe T. Inoue H. Dannenberg A.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1081-1085PubMed Google Scholar), so we also examined the effect of resveratrol on the synthesis of PGs by cells in which COX-2 was induced by PMA. In this experiment, mammary epithelial cells were treated with vehicle or PMA for 4.5 h. Fresh medium containing either resveratrol or NS398 was then added. 30 min later, synthesis of PGE2 was measured. Resveratrol caused concentration-dependent suppression of PMA-stimulated synthesis of PGE2 with complete inhibition at 30 μm resveratrol (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig.3 B, 0.1 μm NS398 was required to completely suppress PMA-mediated induction of PG synthesis. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that levels of COX-2 protein did not decrease during treatment with resveratrol or NS398 (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that resveratrol inhibited COX-2 activity. To further evaluate the effects of resveratrol on COX-2 activity, we utilized baculovirus-expressed human recombinant COX-2 in a cell-free assay. Resveratrol caused dose-dependent inhibition of PGE2 synthesis (Fig. 4). As expected from the findings in cell culture (Figs. 2 and 3), resveratrol (IC50 value, 32.2 μm) was a less potent inhibitor of COX-2 activity than the synthetic inhibitors NS398 (IC50 value, 3.2 μm) and indomethacin (IC50 value, 1.9 μm). We also investigated the possibility that resveratrol inhibited PMA-mediated induction of PG synthesis by suppressing the induction of COX-2. In these experiments, cells were cotreated for 4.5 h with PMA and the indicated concentrations of resveratrol. The medium then was replaced, and the synthesis of PGs was measured in the absence of resveratrol over the next 30 min. PMA in this setting caused about a 2-fold increase in synthesis of PGE2. This effect was suppressed by resveratrol in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). To confirm that these effects of resveratrol were not unique to mammary epithelial cells, we also determined whether resveratrol inhibited PMA-mediated induction of PG synthesis in a premalignant, oral leukoplakia cell line. Treatment of these cells with PMA led to a 2-fold increase in PG synthesis. This effect was inhibited completely by 20 μm resveratrol (data not shown). To determine whether the above effects on production of PGE2 could be related to differences in levels of COX, Western blotting of cell lysate protein was carried out. Fig.6 A shows that PMA induced COX-2 in human mammary epithelial cells. Cotreatment with resveratrol caused a dose-dependent decrease in PMA-mediated induction of COX-2; the maximal drug effect was observed at 15–20 μm. Neither PMA nor resveratrol altered amounts of COX-1 (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the effects of resveratrol on PGE2 synthesis mediated by PMA (Fig. 5) were greater than the degree of suppression of amounts of COX-2 protein induced by PMA (Fig. 6 A). For example, 5 μm resveratrol decreased PG synthesis to levels detected in uninduced cells while only partially blocking PMA-mediated induction of COX-2 protein. This finding is consistent with the idea that resveratrol inhibited PMA-mediated induction of PG synthesis both by suppressing levels of COX-2 protein and by direct inhibition of COX-2 activity. The down-regulation of COX-2 expression by resveratrol was not limited to mammary cells but was also demonstrable in oral epithelial cells (Fig.6 B). To further elucidate the mechanism responsible for the changes in amounts of COX-2 protein, we determined steady-state levels of COX-2 mRNA by Northern blotting. Treatment with PMA resulted in a marked increase in levels of COX-2 mRNA, an effect that was suppressed by resveratrol in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.7). Differences in levels of mRNA could reflect altered rates of transcription or changes in mRNA stability. Nuclear run-offs were performed to distinguish between these possibilities. As shown in Fig. 8, we detected higher rates of synthesis of nascent COX-2 mRNA after treatment with PMA, consistent with the differences observed by Northern blotting. This effect was suppressed by resveratrol. We also investigated whether resveratrol suppressed PMA-mediated induction of c-jun (Fig. 8 B) and c-myc (Fig.8 C) transcription. Resveratrol caused a marked decrease in the activation of c-jun expression. In contrast, resveratrol did not significantly inhibit PMA-mediated induction of c-myc transcription. To further investigate the importance of PMA and resveratrol in modulating the expression of COX-2, transient transfections were performed using a human COX-2 promoter-luciferase construct. Treatment with PMA increased COX-2 promoter activity about 6-fold. Resveratrol caused dose-dependent inhibition of PMA-mediated induction of COX-2 promoter activity (Fig. 9). We next attempted to define the region of the COX-2 promoter that responded to PMA and resveratrol. This was accomplished using a series of humanCOX-2 promoter deletion constructs. As shown in Fig.10 A, both PMA-mediated increases in COX-2 promoter activity and inhibition of promoter activity by resveratrol were detected with allCOX-2 promoter constructs except the −52/+59 construct. A CRE is present between nucleotides −59 and −53, suggesting that this element may be responsible for mediating the effects of PMA and resveratrol. To test this notion, transient transfections were performed utilizing COX-2 promoter constructs in which specific enhancer elements including the CRE were mutagenized. As shown in Fig. 10 B, mutagenizing the CRE site had several effects, including a decrease in basal promoter activity and a loss of responsiveness to both PMA and resveratrol. By contrast, mutagenizing the NF-IL6 site had little effect on COX-2 promoter function.Figure 10Localization of region of COX-2 promoter that mediates the effects of phorbol ester and resveratrol.

A large repertoire of functional antibodies with similar properties was produced by appending short variable complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) onto the two antibody germ line segments most frequently found in human antibodies. With this strategy we concentrated sequence diversity in regions of the antibody structure that are centrally located in the antigen binding site, while leaving residues in more peripheral positions available for further mutagenesis aimed at improving the affinity of the selected antibodies.In addition, the library was tested by selecting antibodies against six biologically relevant antigens. Using only 0.3 μg of antigen eluted from a two-dimensional gel spot, we isolated binders specific for the ED-B domain of fibronectin, a marker of angiogenesis. These antibodies recognize the native antigen with affinities in the 107–108m−1 range, and perform well in immunosorbent assays, in two-dimensional Western blotting and in immunohistochemistry. The affinity of one anti-ED-B antibody was improved by 27-fold by combinatorially mutating six strategically selected residues in the heavy chain variable domain. A further 28-fold affinity improvement could be achieved by mutating residues 32 and 50 of the light chain. The resulting antibody, L19, bound to the ED-B domain of fibronectin with very high affinity (Kd = 54 pm), as determined by real-time interaction analysis with surface plasmon resonance detection, band shift analysis, and by competition experiments with electrochemiluminescent detection.

As the era of intensive gene discovery approaches its conclusion, major efforts are under way to develop systematic means for the discovery of gene function and regulation. Advanced technologies in this field will be particularly useful if they operate at the level of the genes' functional products: the proteins. The efficient description of the protein phenotype in complex biological samples may allow unraveling of the protein composition of cells and tissues and analysis of diseases (as well as the effects of drugs and other xenobiotics) in terms of changes in protein composition (1Weinstein J.N.

The potential of two-dimensional PAGE would be extended if good quality affinity reagents (e.g. antibodies) could be produced against individual spots from gels. Such reagents could provide the structural information that is typically lost during treatment of biological samples needed for electrophoresis (total protein preparations are often obtained by lysing and homogenizing cells or tissues). The production of antibodies against gel spots would for example allow the microscopic analysis of the proteins in structurally intact samples (e.g. by immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry) and the development of immunometric assays for the rapid quantitation of proteins in different specimens.

As a consequence, microgram quantities of individual antigens are available in practice for antibody production. This poses stringent requirements on the quality of antibody phage display library and on the selection strategy. We have therefore aimed at producing a large functional antibody library, that could reliably yield good quality antibodies against relevant biological markers. Because for several biological applications high-affinity binders are needed, the phage library should be constructed in a way that allows the facile affinity maturation of antibodies of interest. We have also aimed at developing a selection methodology that could work with minute amounts of antigen, such as proteins eluted from two-dimensional gel spots. We describe the production of a robust antibody phage library (>300 million clones), constructed using principles of protein design. We successfully selected antibodies against six biologically relevant proteins, including the ED-B domain of fibronectin, a marker of angiogenesis (16Carnemolla B. Neri D. Castellani P. Leprini A.

These antibodies performed well in biochemical applications such as immunosorbent assays, two-dimensional Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Thanks to the modular design of the antibody library, one anti-ED-B antibody could easily be affinity-matured, yielding a binder with dissociation constant in the picomolar range (Kd = 54 pm). The antibody library was cloned using single VH (DP47; Ref. 19Tomlinson I.M. Walter G. Marks J.D. Llewelyn M.B. Winter G. J. Mol.

Recombinant 7B89 was used instead of ED-B because it is easier to blot (16Carnemolla B. Neri D. Castellani P. Leprini A. Neri G. Pini A. Winter G. Zardi L. Int. J.

Biochem. 1988; 173: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), followed by protein transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane and immunodetection. The membrane was blocked with 2% MPBS for 2 h at room temperature. E1 anti-ED-B culture supernatant (see “Preparation of scFv Fragments”) diluted 4:1 in 10% MPBS was then added (1.5-h incubation at room temperature). The membrane was washed twice for 5 min with 2% MPBS PBST and PBS only, then incubated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2; Kodak) in 2% MPBS (0.5 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgGs (Jackon ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) in 2% MPBS (1:20,000 dilution). After washing as above, detection was obtained by ECL enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, Amersham, United Kingdom). Biotinylated ED-B was run in two-dimensional PAGE, omitting dithioerythritol from the loading buffer, and eluted by fragmenting the gel piece and soaking in PBS overnight. Eluted protein was separated from the gel by centrifugation with a Millipore Ultrafree 0.45-μm microcentrifuge fil-tration device (Millipore, Yonezawa, Japan). The resulting solution was analyzed by gel electrophoresis to confirm protein purity after recovery and to quantitate ED-B concentration against standards at known concentration. Protein recovery using this methodology was approximately 50%. The gene of scFv(E1) was PCR-amplified with primers LMB1bis and DP47CDR1for (see Table I for primer sequences) to introduce random mutations at positions 31–33 in the CDR1 of the VH (for numbering, see Refs. 28Chothia C.

The remaining fragment of the scFv gene, covering the 3′-portion of the VH gene, the peptide linker, and the VL gene, was amplified with primers DP47CDR2back and JforNot (94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min). The three resulting PCR products were gel-purified and assembled by PCR (21Clackson T. Hoogenboom H.R. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. Nature. 1991; 352: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar) with primers LMB1bis and JforNot (94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min). The resulting single PCR product was purified from the PCR mix, double-digested with NotI/NcoI, and ligated intoNotI/NcoI-digested pDN332 vector. Approximately 9 μg of vector and 3 μg of insert were used in the ligation mix, which was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, resuspended in 50 μl of sterile water, and electroporated in electrocompetent TG1 E. coli cells. The resulting affinity maturation library contained 4 × 108 clones. Antibody-phage particles, produced as described (9Nissim A. Hoogenboom H.R. Tomlinson I.M. Flynn G. Midgley C. Lane D. Winter G.

The selected phages were used for a second round of panning performed with biotinylated ED-B, followed by capture with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway; see previous paragraph). After selection, approximately 25% of the clones were positive in soluble ELISA. From the candidates positive in ELISA, we further identified the one (H10; Tables II and III) with lowest koff by BIAcore analysis (29Jönsson U. Fägerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R.

https://openalex.org/W2007513694,"The role of Rho GTPase and its downstream targets Rho kinase and myosin light chain phosphatase in thrombin-induced endothelial cell contraction was investigated. The specific Rho inactivator C3-transferase from Clostridium botulinum as well as microinjection of the isolated Rho-binding domain of Rho kinase or active myosin light chain phosphatase abolished thrombin-stimulated endothelial cell contraction. Conversely, microinjection of constitutively active V14Rho, constitutively active catalytic domain of Rho kinase, or treatment with the phosphatase inhibitor tautomycin caused contraction. These data are consistent with the notion that thrombin activates Rho/Rho kinase to inactivate myosin light chain phosphatase in endothelial cells. In fact, we demonstrate that thrombin transiently inactivated myosin light chain phosphatase, and this correlated with a peak in myosin light chain phosphorylation. C3-transferase abolished the decrease in myosin light chain phosphatase activity as well as the subsequent increase in myosin light chain phosphorylation and cell contraction. These data suggest that thrombin activates the Rho/Rho kinase pathway to inactivate myosin light chain phosphatase as part of a signaling network that controls myosin light chain phosphorylation/contraction in human endothelial cells.

These data suggest that thrombin activates the Rho/Rho kinase pathway to inactivate myosin light chain phosphatase as part of a signaling network that controls myosin light chain phosphorylation/contraction in human endothelial cells. A variety of pathological conditions including the early stages of atherosclerosis, acute inflammation, and anaphylactic shock are associated with increased vascular permeability (1Ross R. Glomset J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1976; 295 (420–425): 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar, 2Saadi S. Platt J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thrombin generated under these pathological conditions induces endothelial cell contraction and increases vascular permeability through activation of a specific receptor that is coupled via heterotrimeric G-proteins of the Gq family to phospholipase Cβ that cleaves phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to yield inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate3mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular stores and thus increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration (3Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J.

Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation induces a conformational change in MLC that enables actin-myosin interaction and activates the Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin (6Sellers J.R. Pato M.D. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13137-13142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides MLC kinases, myosin-associated MLC phosphatase (PP1M) also seems to play a major role in the control of MLC phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in endothelial cells. This is demonstrated by the finding that pharmacological inhibitors of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) increased MLC phosphorylation and cell contraction (7Verin A.D. Patterson C.E. Day M.A. Garcia J.G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269 (L108): L199Google Scholar), whereas microinjection of active PP1 decreased MLC phosphorylation and disturbed actin/myosin interaction (8Fernandez A. Brautigan D.L. Mumby M. Lamb N.J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). PP1 is composed of three components, a 37–38-kDa catalytic subunit, a 130-kDa regulatory subunit, and a 20-kDa subunit (9Alessi D. MacDougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J.

ROKα/Rho kinase consists of multiple domains including a catalytic domain at the amino terminus, a coiled coil domain including the Rho binding domain (RBD), and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain (34Ishizaki T.

Microinjection of isolated Rho kinase domains into fibroblasts or HeLa cells indicated that Rho kinase is the target protein by which Rho forms stress fiber and focal adhesions (36Leung T. Chen X.Q.

Consistent with the involvement of Rho kinase in contractile events, overexpression of constitutively active V14Rho in fibroblasts caused phosphorylation of the MBS, inactivation of myosin phosphatase, and an increase in MLC phosphorylation (12Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that thrombin uses the Rho/Rho kinase pathway to inactivate PP1M in human endothelial cells. Inactivation of PP1M seems to be coordinated with activation of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent MLCK to maximally increase MLC phosphorylation in the early phase of thrombin-induced endothelial cell contraction. The inhibitors okadaic acid, KT5926, and tautomycin were from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany); all other materials not specifically indicated were from Sigma. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained and cultured as described previously (24Kishi K. Sasaki T. Kuroda S. Itoh T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells harvested from umbilical cords were plated onto collagen-coated (24 h, 100 μg/ml collagen G; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) plastic culture flasks and cultured in endothelial growth medium (Promo Cell, Heidelberg, Germany), containing endothelial cell growth supplement/heparin and 10% fetal calf serum. For all experiments, cells were plated at a density of 2 × 104cells/cm2 and grown to confluency for 10 days. Confluent monolayers were stimulated for the indicated time periods with α-thrombin from human plasma (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). Horseradish peroxidase diffusion through HUVEC monolayers was determined as described previously with some modifications (38Lampugnani M.G. Resnati M. Dejana E. Marchisio P.C. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated (2 × 104 cells/cm2) on collagen-coated polyethylene terephtalate cell culture inserts (3-μm pore size, Becton Dickinson), which were set into 24-well Falcon companion TC plates (Becton Dickinson). HUVEC were cultured for 10 days with medium changes every 2 days. For thrombin stimulation, medium was replaced with 500 μl of culture medium containing thrombin. For controls, thrombin was omitted, but otherwise cells were treated identically. After 15 min of stimulation, 500 μl of medium was filled into the lower compartment, and the medium in the upper compartment was replaced with fresh medium containing horseradish peroxidase (0.34 mg/ml, IV-A type, 44,000 Mr; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). After 1 min, 60 μl of medium was collected from the lower compartment and mixed with 860 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mmGuaiacol) and 100 μl of freshly made H2O2solution (0.6 mm in H2O). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature, and absorbance was measured at 470 nm. For fluorescence staining, HUVEC were plated (2 × 104 cells/cm2) on Eppendorf Cellocate glass coverslips (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) coated with 100 μg/ml collagen G (24 h) and grown to confluency for 10 days. To label F-actin, cells were fixed for 10 min with 3.7% formaldehyde solution in PBS containing 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+, permeabilized for 5 min in cold acetone (−20 °C), and air dried. Coverslips were then incubated for 20 min with rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes; 1/20 in PBS) and mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) containing 0.2%p-phenylenediamine (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) as anti-fading agent. All steps were performed at room temperature with three washes in PBS/2% BSA between antibody incubations. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Leica RDM 3 microscope, and microphotographs were recorded on Kodak T-Max 400 film. Recombinant C3-transferase and V14 RhoA and RBD were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described (21Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar, 39Dillon S.T. Feig L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were cleaved by thrombin. Thrombin was removed by incubation for 2 h with benzamidine beads, and the released proteins were concentrated and dialyzed against microinjection buffer (see below). Purity and complete removal of thrombin was checked by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Extracellular application of V14Rho even at amounts exceeding the microinjected volume by 9 orders of magnitude (10−15 versus 10−6 liters) did not produce any thrombin-like effect, excluding thrombin contamination of recombinant protein. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using BSA as a standard. As tested by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, protein preparations showed essentially only one band. Rho kinase was expressed in SF9 cells as described previously (37Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Microinjection was performed using an Eppendorf Transjector 5246 and an Eppendorf Micromanipulator 5171. Cells were plated and cultured on Cellocate coverslips (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) as described above. V14Rho, recombinant catalytic domain of Rho kinase, RBD from Rho kinase, and C3-transferase were diluted with microinjection buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) and injected at a concentration of 0.4 μg/μl (V14Rho), 0.64 μg/μl (RBD), and 0.025 μg/μl (C3-transferase) into the cytoplasm of HUVEC. The microinjected volume was about 1–3 × 10−15 liters per cell. PP1 catalytic subunit (α-isoform; Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) was diluted with phosphatase buffer (100 mm K+ glutamate, 39 mmK+ citrate, pH 7.3) and was injected at a concentration of 200 units/ml. Control injections carried out with microinjection or phosphatase buffer, respectively, did not produce any significant effect on cell morphology or actin organization. After injection, cells were returned to the incubator for 30 min. Injected cells were identified by labeling a coinjected marker protein (5 mg/ml rat IgG) with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and by relocation on the Cellocate coverslips using the microgrid. For each experiment, about 100 cells were injected and examined by fluorescence microscopy. MLC phosphorylation was analyzed by urea PAGE separation of the mono- and diphosphorylated forms as described in detail elsewhere (40Daniel J.L. Sellers J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 83-85Google Scholar). HUVEC were stimulated with thrombin as indicated, and reaction was terminated by immediate addition of 1.5 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Cells were scraped and then centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 × g. Supernatants were discarded, and pellets were washed with ddH20 to remove trichloroacetic acid and resolved in 1.5 ml of sample buffer (6.7 m urea, 20 mm Tris, 22 mm glycine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 9.0). Samples (75 μg per lane) were applied to urea gel electrophoresis (top gel 3.5% acrylamide, bottom gel 10% acrylamide) and run at 9 mA for approximately 45 min until the marker dye had come out of the bottom gel. The gels were stained for 1 h with 0.05% Coomassie Brilliant Blue 250, 10% acetic acid, 30% methanol, 60% H2O. The stoichiometry of MLC phosphorylation (mol phosphate/mol MLC) was determined by densitometric analysis of the wet gels, using a Sharp XL-325 densitometer and Pharmacia Image Master software, and calculated using the formula P1 + 2xP2/P0 + P1 + P2. Cytosolic [Ca2+]i was measured as described previously (41Kruse H.J. Negrescu E.V. Weber P.C. Siess W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 202: 1651-1656Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips were loaded for 30 min at 37 °C with fura-2 AM (2.5 μm; Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) and resuspended in HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.4 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4). Ca2+-dependent fluorescence was measured using a double excitation spectrofluorimeter (AMKO Light Technology, Tornesch, Germany) with the emission wavelength set at 510 nm and the emission wavelength rapidly alternating between 340 and 380 nm. [Ca2+]i was quantified applying the equation [Ca2+]i =Kd(R −Rmin)/(Rmax −R) × (Sf2/Sb2). Myosin-enriched fractions of HUVEC were prepared as described previously (7Verin A.D. Patterson C.E. Day M.A. Garcia J.G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269 (L108): L199Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVEC were plated on collagen-coated 100-mm plates (Falcon) and cultivated for 10 days. Monolayers were washed two times with ice-cold PBS (Sigma), and 200 μl of homogenization buffer containing 50 mm Tris-aminomethane, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 28 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, pefabloc, and aprotinin as protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each) were added to the cells. Plates were immediately cooled down to −80 °C, scraped with a rubber policeman, and homogenized by passing the suspension several times through a syringe. Homogenates were then treated with high salt buffer (0.6 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml of each) leupeptin, pepstatin, and pefabloc for 1 h at 4 °C and subsequently centrifuged at 4500 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted 10-fold with assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 28 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resolved in 10 μl of high salt buffer. This myosin-enriched cell fraction contains only PP1 and essentially no PP2 activity (7Verin A.D. Patterson C.E. Day M.A. Garcia J.G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269 (L108): L199Google Scholar). To inhibit residual PP2 activity, the myosin-enriched cell fractions were supplemented with okadaic acid (1 nm) to completely inhibit PP2 (IC50 0.1 nm), whereas PP1 is only affected at concentrations 100-fold higher (IC50 10 nm). For measuring myosin-associated phosphatase activity in myosin-enriched cell fractions, we used the protein phosphatase assay system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. This assay system is based on the method described by Cohen et al. (42Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphorylase b (0.1 mm ) was in vitro phosphorylated by phosphorylase kinase (0.1 mg/ml) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (5 mCi/ml) in phosphorylation buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 16.7 mm MgCl2, 1.67 mm ATP, 0.83 mm CaCl2, 133 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at 30 °C. Reaction was stopped with 90% ammonium persulfate solution (4 °C). Reaction tube was then kept on ice for 1 h and subsequently centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting protein pellet was resuspended with ammonium persulfate solution (45% saturated). The protein pellet was washed four times in this way. Protein solution was then concentrated to a final concentration of 3 mg/ml using Amicon Centricon-30 concentrators. Phosphatase activities of myosin-enriched cell fractions were then quantified by measuring release of radioactivity from [32P]phosphorylase a in the presence of myosin-enriched cell fractions. For this purpose, myosin-enriched fractions were diluted with 30 μl of assay buffer (50 mmTris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 28 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6.25 mm caffeine, pH 7.0) and mixed with 20 μl of radioactive phosphatase substrate. Reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30 °C and stopped with ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were then incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 3 min. The radioactivity released in the supernatant was measured using a Wallack 1410 liquid scintillation counter. To prove that phosphorylase b dephosphorylation in fact measures MLC-phosphatase, we also used smooth muscle32P-MLC as a substrate (7Verin A.D. Patterson C.E. Day M.A. Garcia J.G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269 (L108): L199Google Scholar, 9Alessi D. MacDougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). MLC (0.8 mg/ml) was phosphorylated for 1 h at room temperature with MLCK (50 μg/ml) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml calmodulin, 0.35 m NaCl, 50 μm[32P]ATP, passed through 2 × 1-ml spin columns with Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), equilibrated with assay buffer, and dialyzed for 18 h at 4 °C with 2 × 5 liters of assay buffer. The PP1 and MBS load in myosin-enriched cell fractions was tested by Western blot analysis. Briefly, myosin-enriched cell fractions were dissolved in Laemmli buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin) and applied to SDS, 10% PAGE. Proteins were then blotted onto polyvinylene difluoride membranes for 1 h at 80 V. Membranes were blocked with 10% low-fat milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline. PP1 was detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-PP1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or rabbit polyclonal anti-MBS antibody (12Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar), both diluted 1/1000 in Tris-buffered saline, and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany), diluted 1/4000 in Tris-buffered saline, developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham), and then exposed to hyperfilm ECL (Amersham). Triton X-100 solubility of catenins was assayed as described elsewhere (43Rabiet M.J. Plantier J.L. Rival Y. Genoux Y. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) Briefly, Triton X-100 soluble and insoluble cell fractions were analyzed be Western blots using anti-β-catenin (American Research Products, Belmont, MA) or anti-plakoglobin (clone PG5.1; American Research Products, Belmont, MA) monoclonal antibodies. To test whether Rho is involved in endothelial cell contraction, we measured the thrombin-stimulated increase of transendothelial horseradish peroxidase diffusion in the absence and presence of the specific Rho inactivator C3-transferase from C. botulinum (45Aktories K. Weller U. Chantwal G.S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 46Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig.1 demonstrate that confluent monolayers of HUVEC show a low transendothelial diffusion of horseradish peroxidase. Stimulation with thrombin (0.1–1 unit) dose dependently increased horseradish peroxidase permeability up to 10-fold. The thrombin-induced increase in permeability could almost completely be abolished by pretreatment of the cells with C3-transferase (24 h, 5 μg/ml). To confirm that the underlying mechanism for this C3-transferase effect was inhibition of cell contraction, we performed actin staining. As can be seen in Fig.2 a, actin is mainly concentrated in a dense peripheral band along cell-cell contacts in intact endothelial monolayers. When stimulated with thrombin, cells contracted, expressed actin fibers, and formed numerous intercellular gaps (Fig. 2 b). In cells pretreated with C3-transferase, these thrombin effects were abolished, and cells remained flat and spread out (Fig. 2 c). The actin band at cell-cell contacts was thinned out by the C3 treatment but remained essentially intact. These results suggest that activation of Rho is a key mechanism in thrombin-induced endothelial cell contraction/increase of endothelial permeability. The Rho subtype involved likely is RhoA because we recently found that RhoA is by far the predominant substrate of C3-transferase in HUVEC and is ADP-ribosylated to about 70–80% under the conditions employed (27Aepfelbacher M. Essler M. Huber E. Sugai M. Weber P.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1623-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, microinjection of constitutively active V14RhoA produced cell contraction and stress fiber formation similar to thrombin (Fig. 2 f).Figure 2Thrombin-induced endothelial cell contraction is mediated by Rho, Rho kinase, and PP1. HUVEC were not stimulated (a), stimulated with thrombin (1 unit/ml; 15 min) (b), pretreated with C3-transferase (24 h, 5 μg/ml), and then stimulated with thrombin (c), microinjected (asterisks) with Rho binding domain of Rho kinase and then stimulated with thrombin (d), microinjected (asterisks) with PP1 catalytic subunit and then stimulated with thrombin (e), microinjected (arrow) with V14RhoA (f) or recombinant Rho kinase (arrows, g).

To enable a physical distinction between autophagosomes and amphisomes, the latter were selectively density-shifted in sucrose gradients following fusion with AOM-gold-loaded endosomes (endosomes made dense by asialoorosomucoid-conjugated gold particles, endocytosed by isolated rat hepatocytes prior to subcellular fractionation). Whereas amphisomes, by this criterion, accounted for only a minor fraction of the AVs in control hepatocytes, treatment of the cells with leupeptin (an inhibitor of lysosomal protein degradation) caused an accumulation of amphisomes to about one-half of the AV population. A quantitative electron microscopic study confirmed that leupeptin induced a severalfold increase in the number of hepatocytic amphisomes (recognized by their gold particle contents; otherwise, their ultrastructure was quite similar to autophagosomes). Leupeptin caused, furthermore, a selective retention of endocytosed AOM-gold in the amphisomes at the expense of the lysosomes, consistent with an inhibition of amphisome-lysosome fusion. The electron micrographs suggested that autophagosomes could undergo multiple independent fusions, with multivesicular (late) endosomes to form amphisomes and with small lysosomes to form large autolysosomes. A biochemical comparison between autophagosomes and amphisomes, purified by a novel procedure, showed that the amphisomes were enriched in early endosome markers (the asialoglycoprotein receptor and the early endosome-associated protein 1) as well as in a late endosome marker (the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor). Amphisomes would thus seem to be capable of receiving inputs both from early and late endosomes.

Autophagy is a mechanism by which cells sequester and degrade parts of their own cytoplasm, including organelles (for a review, see Ref. 1Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia. 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Autophagy is basically a nonselective, bulk process; a number of cytosolic enzymes with widely different half-lives have been shown to be autophagically sequestered at identical rates (2Kopitz J. Kisen G.Ø. Gordon P.B. Bohley P. Seglen P.O. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, a selective organelle autophagy can apparently take place during the regression of hypertrophied organelles like the peroxisomes (3Luiken J.J.F.P. Van den Berg M. Heikoop J.C. Meijer A.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and, possibly, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (4Bolender R.P. Weibel E.R. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 746-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the first recognizable autophagic step, single or multiple membrane cisternae with a distinct osmiophilic morphology (5Reunanen H. Punnonen E.-L. Hirsimäki P.

The phagophores, which form the autophagosome wall, may ultimately be derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (10Arstila A.U. Trump B.F. Am. J.

Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 258: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have indicated that autophagosomes can fuse with endosomes to form prelysosomal autophagic/endocytic vacuoles called amphisomes (17Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 18Høyvik H. Gordon P.B. Berg T.O. Strømhaug P.E. Seglen P.O. J.

(Autophagosomes, amphisomes, and lysosomes engaged in autophagy are often referred to collectively as autophagic vacuoles (AVs) 1The abbreviations used are: AVautophagic vacuole3MA3-methyladenine (6-amino-3-methylpurine)ASGPRasialoglycoprotein receptorLDHlactate dehydrogenaseLgp120lysosomal glycoprotein 120 (a lysosomal membrane protein)MPRcation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptorTBSTris-buffered salineTCtyramine-cellobioseAOMasialoorosomucoidGPNglycyl-l-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide. ). The amphisomes are apparently acidic (20Strømhaug P.E. Seglen P.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), probably due to the activity of a proton pump contributed by the endosomal fusion partner. Morphologically, hepatocytic amphisomes can be recognized as “intermediate” autophagic vacuoles (AVi/d) (i.e.autophagosome-like vacuoles containing endocytic markers like endocytosed gold or albumin-gold; acidic, yet lacking lysosomal enzymes or lysosomal membrane proteins like the glycoprotein Lgp120 (9Fengsrud M.

Amphisome formation has also been demonstrated in nonhepatic cells and tissues (22Tooze J. Hollinshead M. Ludwig T. Howell K. Hoflack B. Kern H. J.

There is good evidence that some of the autophagosomes may fuse directly with lysosomes (6Pfeifer U. Glaumann H. Ballard F.J. Lysosomes: Their Role in Protein Breakdown.

Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 15-24PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that autophagic delivery to the lysosomes may occur exclusively by autophagosome-lysosome fusion, i.e. without amphisome formation (24Lawrence B.P. Brown W.J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 515-526PubMed Google Scholar, 25Yokota S. Himeno M. Kato K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 15-24PubMed Google Scholar), but a recent morphometric study concluded that hepatocytic endosomes were 5–6 times more likely to enter the amphisome pathway than to fuse directly with lysosomes (21Liou W. Geuze H.J. Geelen M.J.H. Slot J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Differences in experimental approach, organelle markers, and organelle definitions make it difficult to resolve discrepant conclusions regarding the relative roles of the amphisomal and the direct autophagosomal pathway to the lysosome. Active lysosomes can be distinguished from the double- or multiple-membrane-enclosed autophagosomes by having only a single delimiting membrane, but amphisomes have not yet been unequivocally characterized in morphological terms. We therefore initiated the present study, using colloidal gold particles conjugated to asialoorosomucoid (AOM) both as an ultrastructural marker and as a density perturbant. AOM-gold is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis in isolated rat hepatocytes, and by means of different gold particle sizes and different loading times, a differential staining of lysosomes and prelysosomal endocytic vacuoles (which would include the amphisomes) can be obtained (26Holen I.

In addition, the high density of the gold particles would be expected to change the behavior of gold-laden endocytic vacuoles in density gradients, as has been shown in other cell types (28Futter C.E. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 685-694PubMed Google Scholar). By this approach, we have been able to identify the amphisomes both as a structural entities in sucrose density gradients and as distinct vacuoles in electron micrographs.

AOM-gold,i.e. AOM conjugated to colloidal gold particles (3- or 10-nm diameter), was prepared according to established procedures (31Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 87-93PubMed Google Scholar, 32Roth J. Bendayan M. Orci L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1978; 26: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Colloidal gold was made by mixing, at 60 °C, 160 ml of 0.0125% gold chloride and 40 ml of tannic acid (0.125 or 0.0045%, for preparation of 3- and 10-nm gold particles, respectively) buffered with 0.2% trinatrium citrate dihydrate, keeping the mixture at 60 °C until a stable wine-red color had developed (instantly with 3-nm gold; 1 h with 10-nm gold). The volume was then reduced to one-half by boiling/evaporation (yielding, for 10-nm particles, a 520-nm absorbance of approximately 1.6, corresponding to 1.3·1013 gold particles/ml), and AOM or 125I-TC-AOM was thoroughly mixed into the suspension (10 min at room temperature) at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Bovine serum albumin (0.01%) was added as a stabilizer, and the AOM-coated gold particles were sedimented (45 min at 47,000 × g for 10-nm particles; 2 h at 47,000 × g for 3-nm particles) with a 95% recovery of gold and a 70% recovery of AOM, corresponding to about 3 molecules of AOM/gold particle. The pellet was resuspended with 0.9% NaCl to 1 ml and a 520-nm absorbance of 150–200 (AOM, 600–800 μg/ml, or 14–18 μm) and dialyzed against 0.9% NaCl overnight. Uptake of 125I-TC-AOM or 10-nm 125I-TC-AOM-gold was measured at “concentrations” of up to 200–400 nmAOM (520-nm absorbance of 2–4), referring to either free or gold-bound AOM. After incubation, cells were washed three times at 0 °C in 10% sucrose, and radioactivity in the cell pellets was measured by γ-counting. Intracellular AOM or AOM-gold “concentrations” were calculated on the basis of the measured wet mass of cell pellets, assuming the intracellular fluid volume to be 50% of the wet mass (33Gordon P.B. Høyvik H. Seglen P.O. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For density shift experiments, high concentrations of AOM-gold were used (520-nm absorbance of about 20, i.e. about 2 μm AOM). After incubation, the hepatocytes in each tube were washed twice in 10% (w/v) sucrose and finally suspended in 0.5 ml of 10% sucrose. Four samples were pooled and subjected to electrodisruption by a single high voltage pulse (34Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 142: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The resulting preparation is referred to as the disruptate. The disruptate was diluted with an equal volume of buffered sucrose (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.3) and homogenized by 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with a tightly fitting pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged for 2 min at 4,000 rpm (2,000 ×g) in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor and washed once (resuspended in 4 ml of buffered sucrose and recentrifuged), and the combined postnuclear fractions were layered on top of a 25-ml metrizamide density cushion (8% (w/v) metrizamide, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5; adjusted to 300 mosm with sucrose) and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was removed by aspiration; the pellet (large granule fraction) was resuspended in 2 ml of buffered sucrose and homogenized (5 strokes); and 1.5 ml was layered on the top of a linear sucrose gradient. The sucrose gradients were prepared by mixing 63 and 15% sucrose solutions (5.5 ml of each) using a Biocomp Gradient Master (Nycomed Pharma A/S). The gradients were centrifuged at 285,000 ×g in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 4 °C for 105 min. The gradients were then divided into 20 0.67-ml fractions by upward displacement with Maxidens fluid (Nycomed Pharma A/S). The densities of the fractions were calculated from the refractive indices. Homogenizations and centrifugations were carried out at 0–4 °C. We have recently developed methods for the purification of hepatocytic autophagosomes and lysosomes, described in detail elsewhere. 2P. E. Strømhaug, T. O. Berg, M. Fengsrud, and P. O. Seglen, submitted for publication. In the present study, certain modifications were introduced in order to enrich the autophagosome preparation with respect to amphisomes. Hepatocyte homogenates were prepared in buffered sucrose as described above. For purification of autophagosomes (with only 5% amphisome contamination), homogenates from vinblastine-treated cells (hepatocytes incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with 50 μm vinblastine) were incubated with 0.5 mm glycyl-l-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN) and 0.33% Me2SO (GPN solvent) for 6 min at 37 °C to disrupt the lysosomes (35Berg T.O. Strømhaug P.E. Berg T. Seglen P.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For preparation of an approximately 50:50 mixture of amphisomes and autophagosomes, homogenates were prepared from leupeptin-treated cells (3 h at 37 °C with 0.3 mm leupeptin), and the GPN step was omitted (the enlarged lysosomes disappeared anyway, mostly in the nuclear fraction). For preparation of lysosomes, homogenates were prepared from cells in which autophagy had been blocked by incubation for 3 h at 37 °C with 10 mm 3-methyladenine (3MA); moreover, the GPN step was omitted. In either case, the homogenate was cooled to 4 °C, and further purification was performed at this temperature. The nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation for 2 min at 4,000 rpm (2,000 ×g) and washed once, and 14 ml of the combined postnuclear supernatants were placed on top of a discontinuous (two-step), isotonic Nycodenz gradient, containing 9.5% Nycodenz (in buffered sucrose diluted to isotonicity) in the 17-ml upper layer and 22.5% Nycodenz in the 7-ml bottom layer. After centrifugation for 1 h at 28,000 rpm (141,000 × g) in a Beckman SW28 rotor to remove mitochondria and peroxisomes, the vacuole-enriched interface band between the Nycodenz layers (5 ml) was diluted with an equal volume of buffered sucrose and layered on top of a Percoll two-step gradient (21 ml of 33% Percoll in buffered sucrose in the upper layer; 7 ml of 22.5% Nycodenz in buffered sucrose in the lower layer) and centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 rpm (72,000 × g) to remove the endoplasmic reticulum. The autophagic vacuoles were recovered as a 5-ml fraction from the lower part of the Percoll gradient (near the Nycodenz interface) and diluted with 3.5 ml of isotonic 60% iodixanol, overlaid with 1.5 ml of 30% iodixanol and 2.5 ml of buffered sucrose, and centrifuged for 30 min in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 20,000 rpm (71,000 × g) to sediment the Percoll particles. The purified vacuoles (autophagosomes, autophagosomes plus amphisomes, or lysosomes, depending on the pretreatment of the cells or the homogenate) floated to the iodixanol/sucrose interface, where they could be recovered for morphological or biochemical analysis. Acid-soluble and acid-insoluble 125I radioactivity was measured by γ-counting of gradient fractions after precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid (27Holen I. Strømhaug P.E. Gordon P.B. Fengsrud M. Berg T.O. Seglen P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12823-12831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Acid phosphatase (β-glycerophosphatase) was determined according to Ames (36Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3031) Google Scholar), and LDH was determined according to Bergmeyer (37Bergmeyer H.U. Berndt E. Methoden der enzymatischen Analyse. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim1974Google Scholar), using a Technicon RA-1000 autoanalyzer for both assays. In some particularly important experiments, the gradient resolution of LDH was improved by subtracting, from each fraction, the background of nonautophagocytosed LDH, measured in separate gradients as enzyme activity resistant to treatment of the cells with 10 mm of the autophagy inhibitor 3MA (19Gordon P.B. Høyvik H. Seglen P.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Autophagic activity was measured in intact cells as the sequestration of cytosolic LDH into the sedimentable cell fraction (“cell corpses”) following electrodisruption and expressed as a percentage of the total cell-associated LDH (2Kopitz J. Kisen G.Ø. Gordon P.B. Bohley P. Seglen P.O. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of protein from the various organelle fractions (whole cell homogenates, lysosomes, autophagosomes, amphisomes + autophagosomes) or from a “residual fraction” prepared as autophagosomes, but from cells incubated with 3MA and homogenates treated with GPN (and applied as an autophagosome-equivalent volume rather than as an equivalent amount of protein), were subjected to one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using the mini-Protean equipment from Bio-Rad. The residual fraction was essentially devoid of autophagosomes, amphisomes, or lysosomes, thus serving to define the background of contamination by endoplasmic reticulum, endosomes, etc. in the organelle fractions. The separated proteins were transferred onto Nitropure nitrocellulose supports (Micron Separations Inc., West Borough, MA) using a Bio-Rad Semidry Transblot apparatus. The blots were blocked overnight in 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 25 mm Tris, 0.8% NaCl, pH 7.4) and then incubated at room temperature for 2 h with primary antibody and for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (both in TBS with 2% dried milk). After each step, the blots were washed three times in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20. The antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence, using the SuperSignal peroxidase substrate (Pierce) and Kodak X-Omat LS films (Eastman Kodak Co.). The films were digitalized with a model 300A laser densitometer from Molecular Dynamics Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA). One ml of 3-nm AOM-gold suspension (absorbance value of 1.8 at 520 nm after 100-fold dilution) was injected intravenously into rats 24 h before cell isolation to prelabel hepatocytic lysosomes. To label vacuoles of the endocytic-lysosomal pathway in isolated hepatocytes, the cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with a low concentration of 10-nm AOM-gold (final absorbance of 2.0 at 520 nm, i.e.110 of the concentration used for density shifting). The cells were washed once in washing buffer (30Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar), fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m cacodylate buffer overnight at 4 °C, and postfixed for 60 min in 1% OsO4 reduced with 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide, followed by en bloc staining with 1.5% uranylacetate. After serial dehydration in ethanol and propylene oxide, specimens were embedded in Epon and then sectioned and poststained with 0.2% lead citrate. Sections were examined in a Phillips CM10 electron microscope at 60 kV. For quantitation of organelle numbers and gold contents, three blocks from each treatment group within each experiment were sectioned, and 2–4 cell profiles (with a nucleus) were examined on each grid. The number of endocytic and autophagic vacuoles per cell profile was counted in the microscope at × 13,500 magnification. For measurements of organelle diameters and volume fractions, 10 random micrographs for each treatment group were taken from four separate experiments (i.e. a total of 40 micrographs/treatment) and magnified to × 34,500, and the relative cytoplasmic volume fraction occupied by each type of organelle was determined morphometrically using a double lattice. Organelle profile diameters were generally recorded as the average of the shortest and longest diameter, except for small endocytic tubules and vesicles, where the smallest diameter was used. AOM-coated 10-nm gold particles (AOM-gold), used in the present experiments both as an ultrastructural vacuole marker and as a perturbant of vacuole density, were taken up into isolated hepatocytes by a saturable process, like free AOM (Fig.1 A). The uptake of radiolabeled AOM-gold was competed out by unlabeled AOM with the same efficiency as was radiolabeled, free AOM (Fig. 1 B), indicating that AOM-gold at the concentrations used (200–400 nm AOM) was taken up virtually exclusively by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The higher uptake efficiency of gold-bound AOM relative to free AOM in Fig. 1 A probably relates to the fact that each gold particle carries about three molecules of AOM, which may be internalized by a single receptor engagement, as opposed to only one molecule of free AOM per receptor engagement. Isolated rat hepatocytes were incubated at 37 °C under conditions of maximal autophagy (amino acid-free medium), with 125I-TC-AOM (200,000 dpm; 10 μg of protein/ml) included as a marker of endocytic-lysosomal vacuoles (26Holen I.

Fengsrud M. Berg T.O. Seglen P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12823-12831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To shift the density of these vacuoles, colloidal 10-nm AOM-gold was added, replacing unlabeled AOM so as to leave the uptake of125I-TC-AOM unaltered. After 3 h of endocytosis in the absence of AOM-gold, virtually all of the 125I-TC-AOM banded in a sucrose density gradient as a single peak at 1.19 g/ml, mostly in acid-soluble (i.e. degraded) form (Fig.2 A), at the same position as the lysosomal marker enzyme, acid phosphatase (Fig. 2 B). When 10-nm AOM-gold was endocytosed along with the125I-TC-AOM, nearly all of the acid-soluble and acid-insoluble radioactivity, as well as most of the acid phosphatase, sedimented to the bottom of the gradient tube (>1.20 g/ml), indicating that the lysosomes had become extensively density-shifted by fusion with AOM-gold-loaded endosomes. Prelysosomal autophagic vacuoles (autophagosomes and amphisomes) can be recognized in density gradients by their contents of 3MA-sensitive,i.e. autophagocytosed, LDH (35Berg T.O. Strømhaug P.E. Berg T. Seglen P.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which becomes degraded once these vacuoles fuse with lysosomes (2Kopitz J. Kisen G.Ø. Gordon P.B. Bohley P. Seglen P.O. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2 C, the peak of 3MA-sensitive LDH at 1.14 g/ml was only slightly shifted toward higher densities by endocytosed AOM-gold. This would suggest that in control cells, autophagocytosed LDH resides largely in autophagosomes rather than in amphisomes. Since so little prelysosomal LDH could be detected in control cells, an attempt was made to induce prelysosomal autophagic vacuole accumulation by incubating the cells with various inhibitors of late stages in the autophagic-lysosomal pathway (18Høyvik H.

We studied whether ezrin is associated with intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, -2, and -3. In transfected cells, ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 colocalized with ezrin in microvillar projections, whereas an ICAM-1 construct attached to cell membrane via a glycophosphatidylinositol anchor was uniformly distributed on the cell surface. An interaction of ICAM-2 and ezrin was seen by affinity precipitation, microtiter binding assay, coimmunoprecipitation, and surface plasmon resonance methods. The calculatedKD value was 3.3 × 10−7m. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) induced an interaction of ezrin and ICAM-1 and enhanced the interaction of ezrin and ICAM-2, but ICAM-3 did not bind ezrin even in the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2. PtdIns(4,5)P2 was shown to bind to cytoplasmic tails of ICAM-1 and ICAM-2, which are the first adhesion proteins demonstrated to interact with PtdIns(4,5)P2. The results indicate an interaction of ezrin with ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 and suggest a regulatory role of phosphoinositide signaling pathways in regulation of ICAM-ezrin interaction.

We have shown that ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 interact with the cytoskeletal protein α-actinin (25Carpén O. Pallai P. Staunton D.E. Springer T.A. J.

Moreover, ezrin is involved in regulation of the subcellular distribution and adhesive function of ICAM-2 (27Helander T.S. Carpen O. Turunen O. Kovanen P.E. Vaheri A. Timonen T. Nature. 1996; 382: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), but the biochemical basis of this interaction is unclear. Here, we have studied whether ezrin is directly associated with ICAM-1, ICAM-2, or ICAM-3. As PtdIns(4,5)P2 regulates cytoskeletal assembly and linkage to plasma membrane via interactions with many actin-binding proteins (28Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 29Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), we also studied how PtdIns(4,5)P2 affects these interactions.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we report that the cytoplasmic domain of ICAM-2 interacts with ezrin. The interaction is highly facilitated by PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 induces an interaction between ezrin and ICAM-1 but not ICAM-3. An association was first suggested by transfection studies, which showed a close codistribution of wild-type ICAM-1 or ICAM-2 and endogenous or cotransfected ezrin in adherent cells, and ICAM-2 and ezrin in thymoma cells (27Helander T.S.

An engineered ICAM-1 molecule linked to the membrane by a glycophospholipid anchor showed a diffuse staining pattern without microvillar colocalization, indicating the requirement of an intact intracellular domain of ICAM-1 for the specific surface distribution and codistribution with ezrin.A direct interaction of purified ezrin and ICAM-2 was detected with several different methods (Sepharose bead affinity precipitation, microtiter binding assay, coimmunoprecipitation, and surface plasmon resonance). The apparent dissociation constant of 3.3 × 10−7m is in line with the affinities of other membrane protein-cytoskeleton interactions. For instance, α-actinin was reported to bind to β1-integrin cytoplasmic domain peptide with KD of 1.6 × 10−8m (42Otey C.A. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) and protein 4.1 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 with KD value on the order of 10−7m (43Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Tokimitsu R. Krauss S.W. Kawashima M. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30322-30328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas moesin binding to CD44 was too weak for quantitation at physiological ionic strength (13Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar).In contrast to ICAM-2, only a very weak binding of ezrin to ICAM-1 was seen in the microtiter and coimmunoprecipitation assays in the absence of PtdIns(4,5)P2. When placental lysate was passed through ICAM-1 peptide column, ezrin was one of the few proteins that were retained. The lysate apparently contained PtdIns(4,5)P2. With all different methods used, the interaction of ICAM-1 or -2 and ezrin was either induced or highly enhanced by PtdIns(4,5)P2. This is in analogy with the interaction between ezrin and the transmembrane adhesion protein CD44 (13Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The microtiter and SPR assays with phospholipid vesicles consisting of a neutral carrier lipid PC mixed with a small portion of PtdIns(4,5)P2, resembling the natural composition of cellular membranes, showed that the binding is not just an aggregation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 micelles to the peptides, but a specific effect. Another cytoskeleton-associated protein, vinculin, is regulated by PtdIns(4,5)P2 (39Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 44Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 45Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), but compared with ezrin the phosphoinositide binding fragment of vinculin did not show significant binding to ICAM peptide surfaces pretreated with PtdIns(4,5)P2. This result further emphasizes the specificity of ezrin binding to ICAM peptides in the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2.ICAM-3 did not bind ezrin even in the presence of added phospholipids. When T-cells produce cellular uropods in response to cytokines and cAMP, ICAM-3 is redistributed to the uropod region together with myosin, not with the actin-based cytoskeleton (46Campanero M.R. Sánchez-Mateos P. del Pozo M.A. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 47del Pozo M.A. Sánchez-Mateos P. Nieto M. Sánchez-Madrid F. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1409-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Moesin has been shown to interact with ICAM-3 in polarized T-cells, and stimulation of T-cells redistributed ICAM-3 and moesin, but not ezrin to the formed uropods (48Serrador J.M. Alonso-Lebrero J.L. del Pozo M.A. Furthmayr H. Schwartz-Albiez R. Calvo J. Lozano F. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1409-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In these cells, the expression level of ICAM-1 is low. It is possible that ICAM adhesion molecules and ERM proteins, with partly overlapping and redundant functions, display variable combinations in different physiological and cellular environments. In the present study, we have not analyzed whether other ERM family members interact with ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 in a fashion similar to ezrin. Considering the high sequence homology and a similar binding ability to CD44 (13Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), it is likely that radixin and moesin can also associate with ICAM-1 and -2.The SPR measurements demonstrated that PtdIns(4,5)P2interacts with the cytoplasmic tails of ICAM-1 and ICAM-2. Previously, a variety of cytoplasmic polypeptides, particularly actin-binding proteins, have been shown to bind PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 is an important modulator of the actin-containing cytoskeleton (28Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 29Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). However, ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 are the first adhesion proteins reported to interact with PtdIns(4,5)P2. The consensus binding sequences for PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding are (K/R)XXXXKX(K/R)(K/R) or KXXXKXKK (49Yu F.-X. Sun H.-Q. Janmey P. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although other binding sequences exist. The binding of phosphoinositides is not simply electrostatic, but also secondary structure and hydrophobic segments are thought to be important (49Yu F.-X. Sun H.-Q. Janmey P. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4825-4831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Janmey P.A. Lamb J. Allen P.G. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11818-11823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Lu P.-J. Chen C.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 466-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains of ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 contain both basic and hydrophobic residues resembling the described PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding sites, and in particular the juxtamembrane sequence of ICAM-1 is highly homologous with the PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding consensus motif. ICAM-3 did not bind PtdIns(4,5)P2 in SPR measurements, and its amino acid sequence also differs from the typical PtdIns(4,5)P2binding site pattern. The differences in sequences suggest that the cytoplasmic interactions of ICAM-3 are possibly not regulated the same way as the interactions of ICAM-1 and -2.Phosphoinositides promote conformational changes of the peptides to which they are bound (52Lu P.-J. Chen C.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 466-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 53Xian W. Vegners R. Janmey P. Braunlin W.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2695-2702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and may increase or stabilize the formation of higher form oligomers, as suggested in the dimerization of the protein kinase Akt (54Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). PtdIns(4,5)P2 is implicated in adhesion; it is needed for focal adhesion formation (45Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and the levels of PtdIns(4,5)P2 are increased by integrin clustering, which activates cytoskeleton-associated PtdInsP kinase locally within focal adhesion complex (55McNamee H.P. Liley H.G. Ingber D.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that increased phophoinositide levels caused by preadhesion signaling or by initial adhesion would modulate the adhesive functions and intracellular interactions of ICAM-1 and ICAM-2, maybe by changing the conformation of the short cytoplasmic tails or by oligomerization of the molecules. Alternatively, local accumulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane could lead to bridging of ICAMs and ezrin.PtdIns(4,5)P2 acts as a precursor for the secondary messenger molecules inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol and is one of the substrates of PI 3-kinase, but also has independent signaling properties. It can interact with a number of actin-binding proteins and thereby regulate actin polymerization (28Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Ezrin and other ERM proteins are effector molecules of the Rho signaling pathway (56Mackay D.J.G. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), which controls actin filament and focal adhesion assembly. Rho regulates also phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (57Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rho could activate ezrin through the controlled synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Our studies together with the results from the binding of CD44 (13Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) indicate a role for PtdIns(4,5)P2 in controlling the ability of ezrin to bind transmembrane proteins. The amino-terminal domain of ezrin has an exceptionally high affinity to the carboxyl-terminal part, and in an inactive conformation apparently masks the actin binding domain by intra- or intermolecular association (10Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 58Gary R. Bretscher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10846-10850Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The mechanism of ezrin activation is unknown but is speculated to involve phosphorylation or dimerization/oligomerization of the molecule (59Berryman M. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 60Bretscher A. Gary R. Berryman M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16830-16837Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding site is contained in the NH2-terminal half of ezrin (12Niggli V. Andreoli C. Roy C. Mangeat P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding could be an alternative or additional mechanism to modulate the conformation of ezrin through uncovering binding sites for F-actin and other interacting molecules. This type of regulation has been reported for vinculin, in which PtdIns(4,5)P2 dissociates an intramolecular head-to-tail joining (44Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) rendering the masked talin and actin binding sites accessible, and exposing a phosphorylation site for protein kinase C (39Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 45Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Our coimmunoprecipitation results support the concept that the binding site for transmembrane proteins is in the amino-terminal part of ezrin. The finding that PtdIns(4,5)P2 enhances ICAM-2 binding also to the NH2-terminal fragment of ezrin shows a complex role for PtdIns(4,5)P2, possibly modulating ICAM-2 activity in addition to ezrin regulation.Ezrin is a prominent constituent of microvilli and other cellular protrusions and the leading edge. It is located at cell membrane regions that primarily come into contact with other cells. Thus ezrin, as well as other ERM-members, serve as ideal cytoplasmic binding partners for adhesion molecules. The ability of ezrin to redistribute ICAM-2 (27Helander T.S. Carpen O. Turunen O. Kovanen P.E. Vaheri A. Timonen T. Nature. 1996; 382: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and probably also ICAM-1, to microvilli or concentrated patches on uropod-like structures increases the accessibility of these molecules and could also increase their avidity by clustering (Fig.7). Concentration of ICAMs would benefit the cells during conjugation between lymphoid cells and their target cells, and during migration of lymphocytes through endothelium to tissues. An interaction between ezrin and ICAMs also facilitates post-binding events, as demonstrated by experiments in which relocalization of ICAM-2 to the uropod region after transfection of ezrin rendered target cells susceptible for NK cell killing (27Helander T.S. Carpen O. Turunen O. Kovanen P.E. Vaheri A. Timonen T. Nature. 1996; 382: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism may be involved in killing of viral infected cells, when ezrin redistributes from the cytoplasm into newly formed microvilli (61Pakkanen R. von Bonsdorff C.-H. Turunen O. Wahlström T. Vaheri A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 435-443PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that PtdIns(4,5)P2 can be sequestered into lateral domains in the membrane upon binding to specific proteins (62Glaser M. Wanaski S. Buser C.A. Boguslavsky V. Rashidzada W. Morris A. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S.F. Runnels L.W. Prestwich G.D. Chen J. Aderem A. Ahn J. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26187-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that the interplay of all three components, ezrin, ICAM-1 or ICAM-2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2, is regulated by their local distribution. In this manner, the versatile interactions between adhesion molecules and the cytoskeleton could be linked to the signals that cells obtain from their environment and from inside the cell.Note Added in ProofWhile this article was under review, another paper describing an interaction between ICAM-2 and ezrin was published (63Yonemura S. Hirao M. Doi Y. Takahashi N. Kondo T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar).

It is localized subcellularly underneath the plasma membrane in microvilli, at the leading edge and at sites of cell-cell contacts (3Bretscher A. J.

The protein consists of an NH2-terminal domain with sequence similarity to the protein 4.1 superfamily, an α-helical region, and an actin-binding COOH terminus (6Turunen O. Winqvist R. Pakkanen R.

Cell. 1995; 6: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal and NH2-terminal domains self-associate by head-to-tail joining. The F-actin binding domain is masked in the native ezrin molecule, possibly by the amino-terminal domain (10Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), which enables regulatory control of ezrin's cytoskeletal associations. Ezrin can directly bind the cell surface glycoprotein CD44 (11Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal part of ezrin binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) (12Niggli V. Andreoli C. Roy C. Mangeat P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and PtdIns(4,5)P2 enhances the interaction between ezrin and CD44, possibly through the regulation by the small GTP-binding protein Rho (13Hirao M.

Intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) mediate leukocyte and endothelial binding to β2-integrins (CD11/18). ICAM-1 is widely expressed at low levels (14Dustin M.L. Rothlein R. Bhan A.K.

This study, using 14C-labeled de novo purine and pyrimidine synthesis precursors, proves conclusively that the prime target in proliferating human T-lymphocytes is pyrimidine biosynthesis at the level of dihydroorotic-acid dehydrogenase. Leflunomide (25 and 50 μm), like Brequinar (0.5 and 1 μm), a demonstrated dihydroorotic-acid dehydrogenase inhibitor, was cytostatic, not cytotoxic, with proliferation being halted in the G1 phase. Both drugs restricted the normal 4–8-fold mitogen-induced expansion of pyrimidine pools over 72 h to concentrations found in nonstimulated T-cells and [14C]bicarbonate incorporation into UTP, ATP, and GTP. Uridine (50 μm) restored expansion of all pools, but [14C]bicarbonate incorporation into ATP and GTP only, not UTP. [14C]Hypoxanthine salvage was also restricted, indicating that purine salvage pathways are compromised likewise by both inhibitors. [14C]Glycine studies confirmed that restriction of de novo purine synthesis occurred secondary to inhibition of proliferation since this was reversed by uridine rescue, except at 100 μm Leflunomide. 100 μm Leflunomide markedly depleted ATP and GTP pools also, which would have serious consequences for ATP-dependent enzymes essential to the immune response, thereby explaining non-pyrimidine-related effects reported for Leflunomide at 100 μm and above.

This belief has been reinforced by studies demonstrating inhibition of pyrimidine synthesis by LFM with accumulation of dihydroorotic acid (DHOA) in human T-lymphoblastoid lines (7Cherwinski H.M.

McCarley D. Schatzman R. Devens B. Ransom J.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 460-468PubMed Google Scholar). In support of inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis, both LFM and BQR (using either purified enzyme or lysed cell preparations in vitro) have been shown to be noncompetitive inhibitors of DHODH and to occupy the same site on the enzyme (10Peters G.J. Schwartsmann G. Nadal J.C. Laurensse E. Groeningen C.J.V. Vijgh W.J.F.V.D. Pinedo H.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4644-4649PubMed Google Scholar, 12Simon P. Townsend R. Harris R. Jones E. Jaffee B.

Biochem. 1996; 240: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The fact that the antiproliferative effect of LFM in mouse lymphocytes, human lymphoblastoid cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro was reversed completely by uridine, but not guanosine, was considered evidence that the drug inhibited pyrimidine, but not purine, metabolism (6Cherwinski H.M. Byars N. Ballaron G. Nakano G. Young J. Ransom J. Inflammation Res. 1995; 44: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7Cherwinski H.M. Cohn R. Cheung P. Webster D. Xu Y. Caulfield J. Young J. Nakano G. Ransom J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells have also confirmed LFM to be inhibitory at concentrations well within the IC50 range (6Cherwinski H.M. Byars N. Ballaron G. Nakano G. Young J. Ransom J. Inflammation Res. 1995; 44: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, supporters of the tyrosine kinase inhibition model have criticized these findings as being anin vitro phenomenon. Pyrimidine nucleotide pools were not reduced by LFM in vivo in splenic lymph node cells of MRL/MpJ-lpr/lpr mice, despite amelioration of lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease (24Xu X. Blinder L. Shen J. Gong H. Finnegan A. Williams J.W. Chong A.S.-F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 167-174PubMed Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the many conflicting reports relating to LFM could lie in the use of rodents that are not appropriate models for the study of purine or pyrimidine metabolism in human lymphocytes (30Simmonds H.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 877-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The IC50 for rat DHODH with LFM is in the nanomolar range, whereas that in mouse or human lymphocytes is in the low micromolar range, as indicated above (29Knecht W. Bergjohann U. Gonski S. Kirschbaum B. Löffler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A similar variation in potency between human and rodent DHODHs has been established for BQR (29Knecht W. Bergjohann U. Gonski S. Kirschbaum B. Löffler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The sizes of the ribonucleotide pools, as well as their routes of synthesis and salvage, also differ among human T-lymphocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and lymphoblastic cell lines (30Simmonds H.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 877-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 31Fairbanks L. Bofill M. Rückemann K. Simmonds H.A. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 167-174PubMed Google Scholar) have used the argument that children with hereditary orotic aciduria present with anemia and not immunodeficiency to support their hypothesis that inhibition of pyrimidine biosynthesis is not important in the immunosuppressive action of LFM. However, this could equally be explained by genetic heterogeneity (34Webster D.R. Becroft D.M.O. Suttle D.P. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1995: 1725-1768Google Scholar). Severely affected children genetically deficient in the bifunctional enzyme UMP synthase, which catalyzes the last two steps of de novopyrimidine synthesis (Fig. 1), do present with immunodeficiency as well as the more common form of presentation, refractory megaloblastic anemia and orotic aciduria (34Webster D.R.

Moreover, the above contention is based on studies in rodents (15Chong A.S.-F. Rezai K. Gebel H. Finnegan A. Foster P. Xu X. Williams J.

More important, although human erythrocytes cannot salvage uridine, they actively scavenge orotic acid, which they recycle and excrete as uridine for use by other tissues and cells such as T-lymphocytes (30Simmonds H.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 877-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this study, we have addressed the above problems relating toin vitro studies and species differences, using model systems recently developed by us that demonstrated the particular importance of pyrimidine ribonucleotide availability to T-lymphocytes from healthy humans proliferating in response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation (31Fairbanks L.

We have used the same sensitive HPLC techniques coupled with in-line radiodetection to follow changes in ribonucleotide pools in stimulated human T-lymphocytes incubated with LFM. The studies have included parallel experiments with BQR, a known pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor at the level of DHODH (9Peters G.J. Sharma E. Laurensse E. Pinedo H.M. Invest. New Drugs. 1987; 253B: 375-381Google Scholar, 10Peters G.J. Schwartsmann G. Nadal J.C. Laurensse E. Groeningen C.J.V. Vijgh W.J.F.V.D. Pinedo H.M.

The experiments presented have enabled us to demonstrate conclusively that LFM exerts its immunomodulatory effect by inhibiting the fourth enzyme of de novo pyrimidine synthesis in human T-lymphocytes. PHA, trichloroacetic acid, all chemicals and standards for HPLC (analar or Aristar grade), and RPMI 1640 medium without bicarbonate were purchased from Sigma (Poole, United Kingdom). [14C]Bicarbonate (54 mCi/mmol) was from Amersham Life Science Ltd. (Little Chalfont, UK) [8-14C]Hypoxanthine (1.07 mm, 49.6 Ci/mol) and [2-14C]uridine (0.89 mm, 56 Ci/mol) were purchased from Sigma. [U-14C]Glycine (0.47 mm, 106 Ci/mol) was purchased from ICN Biochemicals Ltd. (Thame, UK). RPMI 1640 medium, Hanks' balanced salt solution, heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin (10,000 units/ml)/streptomycin (10,000 μg/ml), and 24-well plates were all obtained from Life Technologies (Paisley, Scotland). The mouse monoclonal anti-CD16 antibodies were supplied by Immunotech of Coulter Electronics (Luton, UK), Dynabeads coated with goat anti-mouse antibodies by Dynal Ltd., mouse monoclonal anti-glycophorin A antibodies by Dako Ltd., and Ficoll-Paque by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Culture supernatant was generated from an anti-HLA-DR hybridoma (clone L243; mouse IgG2a). Brequinar and A77 1726 (the active metabolite of Leflunomide) were synthesized by Hoechst Marion Roussel (Wiesbaden, Germany). Heparinized peripheral venous blood from healthy volunteers or “buffy coat” obtained from the North London Blood Transfusion Service was diluted in RPMI 1640 medium and centrifuged over a Ficoll-Paque gradient using standard conditions. The mononuclear cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) were harvested, washed, and resuspended in complete medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated, dialyzed fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from buffy coats were stored overnight (<12 h) at 4 °C. T-lymphocytes were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by monocyte, B-lymphocyte, natural killer cell, and reticulocyte depletion as follows. Cell pellets were incubated with antibodies (25 μl of anti-HLA-DR, 1–2 μg of anti-glycophorin A, and 0.2–0.5 μg of anti-CD16 per 106target cells) at 4 °C for 30 min, washed, and incubated with Dynabeads (4:1 beads/target cells). The coated cells were depleted using a magnetic particle concentrator, and the purified T-lymphocytes were washed and resuspended in 10 ml of full medium. The purity of the preparation was >96% T-cells. Experiments were carried out using both extremely pure T-cells or pure T-cells supplemented with 2–3% peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a source of antigen-presenting cells. Cells were cultured in full medium at 1–1.3 × 106 cells/well (24-well plate) in full medium alone (control group) or containing inhibitors to a final volume of 0.9 ml. After 30 min, 0.1 ml of 50 μg/ml PHA was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator for 0, 24, 48, or 72 h. Control nonstimulated cells were incubated for 72 h in the absence of PHA. After 72 h, the number of viable cells in the cultures was always >85%. Pilot studies were carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of BQR and LFM ranging from 100 nmol to 100 μm for BQR and from 1 to 100 μm for LFM. At 24-h intervals, cells were removed from the wells into sterile 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and spun at 1000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was discarded, and 100 μl of fresh medium plus inhibitors were added, together with the appropriate radiolabeled substrate. [14C]Bicarbonate was used at a final concentration of 1.1 mm, with the cells being incubated in tightly capped vials in bicarbonate-deficient RPMI 1640 medium. [14C]Glycine was used at a final concentration of 90 μm, and [14C]hypoxanthine and [14C]uridine at a final concentration 50 μm each. After incubation at 37 oC for 2 h, reactions were stopped by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min, and the cell pellet and supernatant medium were processed as described below. Medium was removed and deproteinized with 25 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid. T-cells were washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution and centrifuged at 1000 × g, and the cell pellet was disrupted with 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Both medium and cell extracts were then centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 × g, and trichloroacetic acid in the supernatants was removed by back-extraction with water-saturated diethyl ether to pH 5. Extracts were frozen at −20 °C if not analyzed immediately by HPLC. The cell pellets were dissolved in 0.1m NaOH and counted in a scintillation counter. Protein in the pellet was estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (45Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Waters Trimodular system incorporating in-line photodiode array and radiodetection was used for the separation and quantification of ribonucleotides as described (31Fairbanks L. Bofill M.

Although there have been many studies that suggest the importance of cPLA2 in the generation of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, the most convincing data have come from studies using mice that are genetically deficient in cPLA2 (13Uozumi N.

The relationship of the enzymes responsible for these activities to the known PLA2 enzymes will be clear only upon sequence determination.Our initial efforts to identify additional PLA2enzymes failed using low stringency cross-hybridization techniques with cPLA2-α sequences. 2R.

A search of the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base was quite successful, and two independent cPLA2-α related gene fragments were identified. Subsequent sequence analysis of the full-length clones revealed two novel homologs of cPLA2-α, designated cPLA2-β and cPLA2-γ. The characterization of cPLA2-β will be described elsewhere. 3C.

Here, we report the sequence and characterization of a novel 60.9-kDa calcium-independent, membrane-associated cPLA2,cPLA2-γ.DISCUSSIONWe have identified a novel 60.9-kDa calcium-independent phospholipase A2, which we termed cPLA2-γ. cPLA2-γ contains 28.7% overall sequence identity with cPLA2-α and was identified by searching the EST data base for related proteins.A common motif found in many lipases is the consensus sequence, GXSXG, which is essential for enzymatic activity (9Derewenda Z.

Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). cPLA2-γ contains the sequence GVS82GS, which is similar but slightly different from the consensus. However, this sequence aligns with the sequence in cPLA2-α, and the change from glycine to serine also occurs in the corresponding region of cPLA2-α, GLS228GS (7Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G.

Mutation of serine-228 and aspartate-549 was shown to abolish cPLA2-α activity, consistent with their role in the putative catalytic triad (7Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V.

Catalytic triads of lipases and serine proteases also frequently contain critical histidines; however, mutation of these residues in the catalytic domain of cPLA2-α had no affect on activity (8Pickard R.

Surprisingly, mutation of arginine-200, in what is thought to be the novel catalytic triad of cPLA2-α, abrogated cPLA2-α activity (8Pickard R. Chiou X. Strifler B. DeFelippis M. Hyslop P. Tebbe A. Yee Y. Reynolds L. Dennis E. Kramer R. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19225-19231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These amino acids may serve as a catalytic triad, providing the active site for hydrolysis, or it is possible that the arginine may function in another but unknown critical role, such as in transition state stabilization (8Pickard R. Chiou X. Strifler B. DeFelippis M. Hyslop P. Tebbe A. Yee Y. Reynolds L. Dennis E. Kramer R. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19225-19231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have also shown that serine, aspartate, and arginine are conserved in cPLA2-γ, providing further evidence that these amino acids are important and may indeed be part of a novel catalytic triad.cPLA2-α is regulated by at least two post-translational mechanisms: 1) calcium-induced membrane association through its CaLB domain and 2) phosphorylation of serine-505 by a MAP kinase (6Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Schievella A. Regier M. Smith W. Lin L.-L.

Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation site and the CaLB domain of cPLA2-α are not conserved in the sequence of cPLA2-γ, suggesting a different regulatory mechanism. Interestingly, cPLA2-γ contains a potential prenylation motif at its C terminus and a putative signal for myristoylation at its N terminus. Initial studies have failed to indicate that the myristoylation site is utilized, whereas the prenylation site is indeed utilized. The isoprenoid precursor [3H]mevalonolactone is readily incorporated into cPLA2-γ expressed in COS cells. We do not know, however, if the modifying isoprenoid is a farnesyl or a geranylgeranyl. Generally, in the consensus sequence CAAX, when the C-terminal (X) amino acid is a methionine, serine, glutamine, or alanine, this signals that the lipid will be farnesyl (27Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), whereas a leucine signals that the modifying lipid is a geranylgeranyl. However, there is also a motif XXCC, CXC, or CCXX found on the Rab family of proteins that modifies the two cysteines with geranylgeranyl (31Shen F. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3692-3698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because both of these motifs match the cPLA2-γ sequence (−CCLA), we do not know which of these isoprenoids is modifying the protein.One of the most striking differences between cPLA2-α and -γ is the lack of a lipid binding CaLB domain in cPLA2-γ. The presence of lipidation motifs suggests that these regions may function as the CaLB domain in cPLA2-α, localizing the enzyme to the membrane and being critical for activity. However, in a preliminary study, cPLA2-γ mutant protein that disrupts the possible N- and C-terminal lipid modification sites did not affect its activity in a phopholipid vesicle assay. 4K. Underwood, unpublished data. Moreover, this mutant protein fails to alter its association with the membrane fraction. However, it remains possible that lipid modification may be important in the subcellular localization of cPLA2-γ and/or its ability to associate with other proteins. Interestingly, Ras shows increased affinity toward other proteins when it is prenylated compared with its nonprenylated form, and it has been shown that oncogenic forms of Ras need to be modified to transform cells (29Zhang F. Casey P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that lipid modifications may play a role in regulating the activity of cPLA2-γ in the cells.cPLA2-γ will hydrolyze fatty acids at the sn-1 and sn-2 position of phosphatidylcholine. This suggests that cPLA2-γ contains PLA1 and PLA2activity. The evidence that cPLA2-γ contains PLA2 activity is also confirmed by its ability to cleave 1-O-hexadecyl-2-arachindonyl-phosphatidylcholine. However, we do not know whether the sn-1 cleavage is PLA1activity or if it is cleavage of the lysophospholipid. The kinetics of the reactions suggest that it is PLA1 activity, as the hydrolysis of sn-1 would show a time-dependent lag as compared with sn-2 hydrolysis if sequential cleavage were taking place, unless cleavage of sn-1 from lysophospholipid occurs rapidly. Taken together, all of these data provide evidence that cPLA2-γ is an enzyme with PLA2 activity and a probable PLA1 activity.cPLA2-γ prefers arachidonic acid to palmitic acid in thesn-2 position of phosphatidylcholine. However, this preference is modest in comparison to the strong preference that cPLA2-α displays for arachidonic acid, 3.5-foldversus 24.5-fold, respectively. The substrate specificity of cPLA2-γ should be considered cautiously, however, because of the artificial nature of the substrate presentation. The selectivity of the enzyme using a natural membrane as a substrate may be a more relevant method to determine the preferred physiological substrate for this enzyme.The preferred substrate for an enzyme provides a clue to its physiological role, as can its distribution within tissues. cPLA2-γ is highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle. The calcium independence of this enzyme may be important for its high expression in muscle, where contractions cause large fluxes in calcium concentrations. Therefore, it may be necessary in this environment to regulate a phospholipase in a calcium-independent manner, such as phosphorylation. As previously stated, cPLA2-α activity is also regulated by MAP kinase phosphorylation of serine-505. This serine is not conserved in the sequence of cPLA2-γ; however, there are several potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, which may be utilized to regulate the enzyme.cPLA2-γ may be highly expressed in these muscles because heart and skeletal muscle encounter physical stress upon increased load. It may be necessary to regulate the remodeling of the phospholipid bilayer when cells undergo stress. This speculation is substantiated by the reports of several calcium-independent phospholipases expressed in heart (17Hazen S. Stuppy R. Gross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10622-10630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hazen S. Ford D. Gross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5629-5633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19McHowat J. Creer M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1972-H1980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hazen et al. (18Hazen S. Ford D. Gross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5629-5633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and McHowat and Creer (19McHowat J. Creer M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1972-H1980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have identified membrane-bound, calcium-independent PLA2 activity that prefers the myocardia-abundant lipid, plasmologen, as a substrate. They have shown increased hydrolysis of plasmologen under hypoxic conditions, such as in ischemia. It is believed that in ischemia, a PLA2activity leads to the accumulation of lysophospholipids and subsequent injury to the heart tissue because of disruptions of the membrane. As the PLA2 activity of this myocardial membrane-bound enzyme was shown to increase under hypoxic conditions, it was suggested that this calcium-independent PLA2 is physiologically involved in ischemia (18Hazen S. Ford D. Gross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5629-5633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because cPLA2-γ is abundantly expressed in heart, and its properties (including calcium independence and membrane localization) are similar to that reported in heart muscle, it may be that cPLA2-γ is involved in ischemia-induced injury to heart muscle.In summary, we have described the molecular cloning and initial characterization of a novel 60.9-kDa membrane-associated, calcium-independent PLA2, cPLA2-γ. This enzyme shares identity with cPLA2-α and contains the potential critical amino acids for the catalytic site but is missing the key elements that regulate the activity of cPLA2-α. This suggests that the mechanisms of regulation for cPLA2-γ will be different from that of cPLA2-α and quite possibly employs the use of the lipid modification. Defining the mechanisms of regulation and the physiological substrate of cPLA2-γ should shed some light on the physiological role of this newly identified PLA2.

There are two classes of DNA glycosylases with distinct substrate specificities: the monofunctional simple glycosylase and the glycosylase with associated AP lyase activity. All oxidized base lesions are removed from DNA by DNA glycosylase/AP lyases, which not only catalyze removal of the base lesion but also cause strand cleavage via β-elimination. The Escherichia coliendonuclease III (Nth) recognizes a wide range of oxidized pyrimidine derivatives, including ring-saturated and ring-fragmented derivatives such as thymine glycol (Tg), 5-hydroxycytosine, 5,6-dihydrouracil (DHU), and urea (1Friedberg E.C.

On the other hand, oxidized purine lesions are also repaired by DNA glycosylase/AP lyases,i.e. Mut M (Fpg) of E. coli or OGG of eukaryotes (yeast and mammals), which do not share extensive sequence similarity. Furthermore, unlike these enzymes, the 23.4-kDa E. coli Nth contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster (9Cunningham R.P. Asahara H. Bank J.F. Scholes C.P. Salerno J.C. Surerus K. Münck E. McCracken J. Peisach J.

Although the primary steps of the BER pathway are common to all organisms, the repair pathway in eukaryotes appears to be quite complex. For example, the mammalian cells appear to have at least two distinct BER pathways (19Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J.

Although they appear to be homologs ofE. coli Nth, eukaryotic enzymes, in particular hNTH, need to be characterized thoroughly because of many critical differences between the bacterial and eukaryotic BER. For example, the repair of Tg, presumably mediated by hNTH1, involves XPG protein, a component of the nucleotide excision repair pathway, which plays an unidentified structural role (22Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies on the cloning of hNTH1 have recently been published by other laboratories (7Hilbert T.P. Chaung W. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol.

In this report, we have described characterization of the hNTH1 protein including a direct identification of the catalytic residue. To isolate hNTH1 cDNA, a human bone marrow cDNA library was screened using a mouse cDNA of the Nth homolog2 under low stringency conditions described previously (23Seki S. Hatsushika M. Watanabe S. Akiyama K. Nagao K. Tsutsui K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). One positive clone was obtained from 1 × 106 independent plaques. The cDNA was subcloned into pUC19 (designated as phNTH1), and the sequence was determined. The DNA sequence encoding amino acids 1–304 of the open reading frame was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (20 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) from the phNTH1 plasmid using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the following primers: Pmet1 (5′-CTT GGA TCC ATG ACC GCC TTG AGC GCG AGG-3′) and Pter (5′-CTC GAA TTC AGA GAC CCT GGG CGG CCG G-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the pGEX-2T plasmid at BamHI/EcoRI sites. The recombinant plasmid was designated pGEX-hNTHmet1 and confirmed the original DNA sequence. E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS carrying pGEX-hNTHmet1 was grown at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6. The culture was cooled to 28 °C and, after the addition of IPTG to 0.1 mm, was grown at 28 °C for 4 h, prior to chilling to 0 °C. All subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. After the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, they were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.02% Triton X-100) and then sonicated (6 × 30 s) on ice at full power using a Braun-Sonic U. After centrifugation of the cell lysate (30 min at 15,000 ×g), the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (5 ml) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing with buffer A, the GST fusion protein was eluted with buffer A containing 15 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma). The fractions that were a yellowish brown color were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100, and 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The GST-hNTH1 fusion protein was then digested with thrombin (0.28 units/mg fusion protein; Novagen) at 4 °C for 16 h to cleave the GST adduct. After the reaction was stopped with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), the digest was passed through a glutathione-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) containing 300 mmNaCl, to remove GST and undigested fusion protein. The hNTH1 in the pooled flow-through fraction was then fractionated on an SP-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column with a linear gradient from 300 to 600 mm NaCl in buffer C. The fractions with the yellowish brown color were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The full-length hNTH1 was eluted from the column later than the truncated hNTH1; these were dialyzed separately versus buffer D (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.005% Triton X-100, and 50% glycerol) and stored at −20 °C. A DHU-containing 55-mer oligonucleotide (DHU-55) with the sequence 5′-ATT ATG CTG AGT GAT ATC CCT CTG GCC TTC GAA CCC XAC CTC AAC CTC TGC CCA C-3′ (whereX represents DHU) was a gift from Dr. P. Doetsch (Emory University). A uracil (U)-containing 13-mer oligonucleotide (U-13) (5′-GCA CAG UCA GCC G-3′) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. A uracil-containing 50-mer (U-50) with the sequence 5′-TCG AGG ATC CTG AGC TCG AGT CGA CGU TCG CGA ATT CTG CGG ATC CAA GC-3′ and its complementary strand were synthesized by the NIEHS Center Core Lab at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The oligonucleotides were gel-purified and labeled either at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, or at the 3′-end with Klenow DNA polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP as described previously (24Hazra T.K.

An oligonucleotide with a reduced AP site was prepared from a uracil-containing oligonucleotide by treatment with uracil DNA glycosylase and NaBH4. Briefly, uracil-containing DNA (50 pmol) was incubated with 2 units of uracil DNA glycosylase (Life Technologies) in 14 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1m NaBH4 at 37 °C for 30 min. After extraction with phenol/chloroform and desalting by gel filtration the DNA was lyophilized by vacuum centrifugation. End-labeled oligonucleotide substrates were incubated with appropriate amounts of the hNTH1 at 37 °C for 5 min in a reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. After the reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 0.1% SDS, the DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol-precipitated along with 20 μg of glycogen (Boehringer Mannheim). The precipitate was dissolved in 10 μl of loading solution (96% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol), heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and then loaded onto a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel in 7 m urea and TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA). Radioactivity in the incised oligonucleotide was quantified by exposing the gel to a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Another assay for DNA glycosylase/AP lyase, based on the rate of conversion of damaged form I DNA to form II, was also carried out using the Tg-containing pBluescript II SK(−), which was prepared by treating of the DNA with 0.04% OsO4 at 70 °C for 8 min (26Melamede R.J. Hatahet Z. Kow Y.W. Ide H. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 250 ng of damaged plasmid DNA, and an appropriate amount of the enzyme. After incubation for 5 min at 37 °C, 2.2 μl of stopping solution (40% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 1% SDS) was added, and the samples were electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gels in TBE buffer. The intensities of the bands of form I and form II DNA were quantitated from an image of the gel captured using an Eagle Eye II video system and attached software (Stratagene). The average number of nicks (or Tg) per molecule was calculated by assuming a Poisson distribution of Tg formation in the plasmid (27Kuhnlein U. Penhoet E.E. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBluescript II SK(−) DNA was labeled with [methyl-3H]thymidine 5′-triphosphate by the random priming method and treated with 0.4% OsO4 at 85 °C for 10 min. A reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 300 ng of OsO4-treated DNA (36,000 cpm) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with different concentrations of purified proteins. After incubation, 30 μl of stopping solution (0.5 m sodium acetate and 0.67 mg/ml of calf thymus DNA) and 125 μl of cold ethanol were added. The DNA was precipitated at −80 °C and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 15 min, and the ethanol-soluble radioactive material was measured in supernatant by scintillation counting. The DNA-trapping reaction was performed in a 10-μl mixture containing appropriate amounts of hNTH1 and substrate duplex oligonucleotide, 50 μm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCNBH3 (Aldrich). After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the samples were boiled for 3 min in standard SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated by electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gel was dried on DE81 paper (Whatman) and analyzed by autoradiography. Relative trapping efficiencies were determined by PhosphorImager analysis. Each sample (10 μl) contained 10 nm32P-labeled probe DNA, 4 mm GST-hNTH1 fusion protein, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 75 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). The sample was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min prior to loading onto a 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 × TBE. The gels were run at 4 °C for 3 h, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. To make AP site-containing DNA, a 32P-labeled U-13 oligonucleotide duplex (42 nmol) was incubated with 175 units of uracil DNA glycosylase in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mmEDTA. After the reaction at 37 °C for 30 min, hNTH1 (about 60 nmol) was allowed to react with the AP site-containing DNA in the presence of 50 mm NaCNBH3 at 37 °C for 2 h. After the reaction mixture was loaded onto a 5-ml Econo-Pac Q cartridge (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), it was washed with equilibration buffer, and the trapped protein-DNA complex was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The fractions were assayed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining for the presence of the complex. The fractions from 0.15 to 0.25 m NaCl containing the complex (12 nmol) were pooled and dialyzed versus 50 mm NH4HCO3. After boiling for 5 min, the complex was hydrolyzed with a combination of 20 μg of endoproteinase Glu-C and 20 μg of trypsin (Promega, sequence grade) at 37 °C for 24 h, and the treatment was repeated for an additional 48 h. The digest was lyophilized in a Speed Vac, dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and applied to a Vydac C18 (300-Å pore, 5-mm diameter) reversed-phase HPLC column (1 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 15% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 80 ml/min with a gradient (35 min) of 15–40% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The mutants K212Q and K212R were generated using Stratagene's Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit. For this purpose, hNTH1 from pGEX-hNTHmet1 was cloned into the pBluescript vector between theBamHI and EcoRI sites. The primer used to mutate the ScaI site in the Ampr gene of the vector was 5′-CTG GTG AGT ATT CAA CCA AGT-3′. The mutagenic primers were 5′-G GTG GCG CTG CCC GGG GTT GGG CCTCAG ATG GCA CAC CTG G-3′ for K212Q, and 5′-G GTG GCG CTG CCC GGG GTT GGG CCT AGG ATG GCA CAC CTG G-3′ for K212R, where the mismatches are underlined. The entire hNTH1 amino acid coding region was sequenced to ensure the presence of only the desired mutation. Antibody was prepared by immunizing rabbits with purified hNTH1 protein (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio) and then affinity-purified by binding to hNTH1-GST protein coupled to NHS-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blot analysis was carried out with the affinity-purified antibody (1:250) and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit second antibody (1:2000; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) technique (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In an indirect immunofluorescence assay, HeLa S3 cells cultured on microscope coverslips were fixed in acetone/methanol (1:1), treated with 50 mmNH4Cl for 10 min, and then permeabilized by a 3-min incubation in 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were preincubated with human serum for 30 min, washed in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-BT), and finally exposed to affinity-purified hNTH1 antibody (1:100) for 30 min at 37 °C. After a 30-min wash with PBS-BT, fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit second antibody (Organon Teknika bv, Boxtel, Netherlands) was applied for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed in PBS-BT for 30 min, mounted on a microscope slide in 50% glycerol in PBS, and photographed for fluorescence in a Zeiss UV microscope. Proteins were quantitated by the dye-binding method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Measurement of pI by isoelectric focusing and the determination of the extinction coefficient of hNTH1 were carried out as described previously (29Roy R. Brooks C. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15131-15140Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Automated NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed in the UTMB Protein Chemistry Laboratory, using a Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems Procise protein/peptide sequencer. DNase I footprinting was performed essentially as described previously (25Roy R. Biswas T. Hazra T.K. Roy G. Grabowski D.T. Izumi T. Srinivasan G. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The sequence of the hNTH1 cDNA independently cloned and used in this study is identical to the published sequence of Hilbert et al. (7Hilbert T.P. Chaung W. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6733-6740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), except that our clone has two additional nucleotides at the 5′-end. The sequence of another hNTH1 cDNA cloned by Aspinwall et al. (8Aspinwall R. Rothwell D.G. Roldan-Arjona T. Anselmino C. Ward C.J. Cheadle J.P. Sampson J.R. Lindahl T. Harris P.C. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) is different from ours by three nucleotide substitutions within the coding region, as well as a 33-nucleotide addition at the 5′-end. The number of amino acid residues of hNTH1 cited here is based on our sequence and that of Hilbertet al. (7Hilbert T.P. Chaung W. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6733-6740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence encoding amino acids (1–304) of the hNTH1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the resulting product was inserted into a pGEX-2T vector to overexpress the full-length hNTH1 fused to the C terminus of the GST protein. SDS-PAGE of the proteins from bacteria induced or uninduced by IPTG indicated that the 60-kDa protein was overexpressed from the plasmid (data not shown); this molecular mass agreed well with the expected size (59.8 kDa) of the GST-hNTH1 fusion protein. We used proteinase-deficient E. coli to overexpress the enzyme. The majority of the fusion protein was expressed in the soluble form by incubating the cells at 28 °C after the addition of IPTG and was readily purified by affinity chromatography (Fig. 1 A). The GST-hNTH1 fusion protein was subsequently cleaved by thrombin to isolate the wild-type hNTH1. We observed two polypeptides of 36 and 34 kDa on SDS-PAGE in the thrombin digest in addition to the 26-kDa band (GST), indicating that thrombin cleaved at two sites in the fusion protein (Fig. 1 B). NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing of product b showed that the protein was hNTH1 with two additional amino-terminal amino acids (Gly-Ser) derived from the vector. The NH2-terminal sequence analysis of bandc indicated that this band was a truncated form of hNTH1 lacking 22 residues at the NH2 terminus. The conditions for thrombin digestion were optimized for maximum generation of the full-length protein. After removal of uncleaved protein and GST by chromatography on a glutathione affinity column, two hNTH1 polypeptides with different sizes were finally separated from each other by SP Sepharose chromatography, and each was judged to be apparently homogeneous by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 C, lanes 5 and 6). Some physicochemical properties of the full-length hNTH1 protein are summarized in Table I. The values of pI and EM280 nm determined experimentally are in excellent agreement with the calculated values. The GST-hNTH1 fusion protein and the purified full-length and truncated hNTH1 proteins are all yellowish brown and have an absorption maximum at 410 nm (data not shown).Table IPhysicochemical properties of recombinant hNTH1Molecular mass Observed (SDS-PAGE)36,000 Predicted33,548Isoelectric point (pI) Isoelectric focusing∼10 Predicted10.2Molar extinction coefficient (EM280 nm) Experimental5.0 × 104 CalculatedaThe value was calculated from amino acid sequence data by the equation of Gill and von Hippel (40).4.8 × 104 E. coli NthaThe value was calculated from amino acid sequence data by the equation of Gill and von Hippel (40).1.9 × 104410/280 nm absorbance ratio hNTH1 in this study0.23 hNTH1 of Aspinwall et al. bData from Aspinwall et al.

We report here the cloning of a dehydrogenase, retSDR1, that belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily and localizes predominantly in cone photoreceptors. retSDR1 expressed in insect cells displayed substrate specificities of the photoreceptor all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase. Homology modeling of retSDR1 using the carbonyl reductase structure as a scaffold predicted a classical Rossmann fold for the nucleotide binding, and an N-terminal extension that could facilitate binding of the enzyme to the cell membranes. The presence of retSDR1 in a subset of inner retinal neurons and in other tissues suggests that the enzyme may also be involved in retinol metabolism outside of photoreceptors. The reduction of all-trans-retinal in photoreceptor outer segments is the first step in the regeneration of bleached visual pigments.

The presence of retSDR1 in a subset of inner retinal neurons and in other tissues suggests that the enzyme may also be involved in retinol metabolism outside of photoreceptors. Vitamin A and its metabolites are active participants in a number of important physiological processes (see Fig. 1). All-trans-retinol is the precursor of other naturally occurring retinoids and appears to be indispensable in reproduction (1Davis J.T. Ong D.E. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All-trans-retinal is an intermediate in the production of all-trans- and perhaps 9-cis-retinoic acids, which act as hormones, affecting important biological processes such as morphogenesis and differentiation through their interaction with ligand-gated transcription factors (2Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). In most tissues, retinals do not accumulate in high concentrations, perhaps because of their chemical reactivity and potential toxicity. However, the visual system is unique in that its function is based on retinals and as a consequence, they accumulate in extraordinarily high concentrations, up to 3 mm in the outer segment of photoreceptor cells (3Dowling J.E. The Retina: An Approachable Part of the Brain. Harvard University Press, Cambridge1987Google Scholar). 11-cis-Retinal is the chromophore for all known visual pigments; however, this isomer is not found in other tissues in significant amounts. Thus, metabolism of 11-cis-retinal and its photoproduct all-trans-retinal, in particular, are of prime importance in the visual system. In the retina, light isomerizes 11-cis-retinal, activates rhodopsin, and initiates the process of phototransduction by which the visual sensation is produced. The product of photoisomerization, all-trans-retinal, enters into a series of reactions that regenerate the 11-cis-configuration and the native visual pigment. At any given level of illumination, a steady state is established in which the visual pigment photoisomerization rate is equal to and opposed by the rate of visual pigment regeneration (4Alpern M. J. Physiol. 1971; 217: 447-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 5Alpern M. Maaseidvaag F. Ohba N. Vision Res. 1971; 11: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, phototransduction and regeneration reactions are irrevocably linked in a cyclical process called the visual cycle (6Wald G. Science. 1968; 162: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The regeneration reactions begin with the NADPH-dependent reduction of all-trans-retinal. The enzyme catalyzing this reaction, all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase (RDH), 1The abbreviations used are: RDHall-trans-retinol dehydrogenaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyESTexpressed sequence tagRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobaseROSrod outer segmentHSDhydroxysteroid dehydrogenaseRPEretinal pigment epitheliumOSouter segmentSDRshort-chain dehydrogenase/reductaseMES(2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid. plays an important role in photoreceptor physiology that is only beginning to be understood. RDH catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction of the visual cycle in rodent rod photoreceptors (7Saari J.C. Garwin G.G. Van Hooser J.P. Palczewski K. Vision Res. 1998; 44: 17-23Google Scholar) and plays an important role in phototransduction as the final step in the quenching of photoactivated rhodopsin (8Hofmann K.P. Pulvermüller A. Buczylko J.

Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activity of RDH controls the level of all-trans-retinal in the retina. This retinoid is responsible, in part, for setting the level of sensitivity of the visual system (10Palczewski K. Jager S. Buczylko J. Crouch R.K. Bredberg D.L. Hofmann K.P. Asson-Batres M.A. Saari J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13741-13750Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and may play a role in retinal pathology. All-trans-retinal has been shown to be a constituent of the major fluorescent component of lipofuscin (Fig.1), a pigment that accumulates in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) during aging and in pathological conditions (12Polans A.

Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 547-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar); however, the molecular details of the visual cycle remain poorly characterized. The amino acid sequence is known for only one enzyme of the cycle, 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (13Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The remaining reactions have been characterized only as enzymatic activities in membrane preparations (14Saari J.C. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S.

In the present study, we report the molecular cloning of a cDNA expressing a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (retSDR1), and demonstrate that this enzyme is highly abundant in cone outer segments. Expression of retSDR1 in other cells of the retina, and in other tissues, suggests that it may be involved more generally in retinoid metabolism. The molecular characterization of retSDR1 will open the way for further studies of this visual cycle enzyme, and of its potential role in retinal cone dystrophies. All-trans retinal was obtained from Sigma, [3H]NaBH4 was from NEN Life Science Products, and 11-cis-retinal was a gift from the National Eye Institute. Retinoids were purified by HPLC (16Saari J.C. Bredberg L. Garwin G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13329-13333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A search of the EST data base with primer FH28 (5′-GGCCTGGTCAACAATGCTGG-3′) was performed in the GenBank data base with FASTA from the GCG package. Amino acid sequence alignments were generated with PILEUP. Total RNA was isolated from human retinal tissue, obtained from the Lions Eye Bank at the University of Washington, using the Ultraspec RNA Isolation system (Biotecx, Inc.) and reverse transcribed with oligo(dT) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed to amplify the 3′-end of the selected EST cDNA using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) and the Expand high fidelity PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim). 3′-RACE was primed with an internal gene-specific primer (FH42: 5′-ATGGCGTGGAAACGGCTGGG-3′) and the Marathon adaptor primer (AP1) (CLONTECH). Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and amplified for 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 4 min. A secondary PCR reaction was carried out using the AP2 Marathon adapter primer and a nested gene-specific primer (FH41: 5′-CGGNGGCGGGAGAGGNATCGGG-3′) as described above. The 5′-end of the selected EST cDNA was amplified from a human retina cDNA library with primers FH43 (5′-TCCAAGAACTGGCCCAGGGTGTTG-3′, a gene-specific primer) and λgt10S. After heating at 95 °C for 5 min, the reactions were cycled 5 times through 94 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 4 min; 5 times through 94 °C for 30 s, 70 °C for 4 min; and 30 times through 94 °C for 5 s, 68 °C for 4 min. Two amplification products for each PCR were cloned into pCRTM2.1 vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen) and sequenced by dyedeoxy-terminator sequencing (ABI-Prism, Perkin-Elmer). Total RNA was isolated from bovine retinas using the Ultraspec RNA isolation system (Biotecx, Inc.). cDNA used in the PCR was prepared by reverse transcription with oligo(dT) from 20 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl reaction (Life Technologies, Inc.). 5′-RACE PCR was carried out using 0.5 μl of cDNA and the Expand high fidelity PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim) with a gene-specific primer FH43 (5′-TCCAAGAACTGGCCCAGGGTGTTG-3′) and the Marathon adaptor primer (AP1) (CLONTECH). Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and amplified for 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 4 min and for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 4 min. A secondary PCR amplification was carried out using the AP2 Marathon adapter primer and primer FH43, for 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min; 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 70 °C for 3 min; and 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 3 min. 3′-RACE was performed with primers FH42 (5′-ATGGCGTGGAAACGGCTGGG-3′) and the Marathon adaptor primer (AP1) (CLONTECH) followed by a secondary PCR amplification carried out using the AP2 Marathon adapter primer and a nested gene-specific primer FH41 (5′-CGGNGGCGGGAGAGGNATCGGG-3′) using the same PCR conditions described for 5′-RACE. Two amplification products for each PCR were cloned in pCRTM2.1 vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen) and sequenced by dyedeoxy-terminator sequencing (ABI-Prism, Perkin-Elmer). The mouse cDNA sequence was amplified from a λZAPII both oligo(dT)- and random-primed mouse retinal cDNA library (obtained from Dr. W. Baehr, University of Utah) in two overlapping fragments. The 5′-end was amplified with primers FH59 (5′-TCATCGTCACTGTCCATCAAGCTT-3′, gene-specific primer) and FH100 (5′-TTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCG-3′, covering T7 primer) for 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min; for 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 70 °C for 3 min; and for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 3 min. A secondary nested PCR amplification was carried out with primers FH100 and FH40 (5′-CACGGCGGCATTGTTCACCAG-3′) for 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min and for 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. The 3′end was amplified with primers FH100 and FH54 (5′-TCGGGACTTGTCGCGGGAGTCA-3′, gene-specific primer) for 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min; for 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 70 °C for 3 min; and for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 3 min. A secondary PCR amplification was performed with primers FH100 and FH58 (5′-ATCGGACGCCACCTCGCTCGGG-3′, nested gene-specific primer) for 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. Two amplification products for each PCR were sequenced by dyedeoxy-terminator sequencing (ABI-Prism, Perkin-Elmer) after subcloning into pCRTM 2.1 vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen). Bovine retina poly(A)+RNA was purified from total RNA using the mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.66 m formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes. Hybridization with a 1.2-kb bovine dehydrogenase cDNA 32P-labeled with the Megaprime DNA labeling systems (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed in 40% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 1 m NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 25 μg/ml herring sperm DNA and washed in 0.1× SSC at 58 °C. A human multiple tissue Northern blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from various human tissue (CLONTECH) was hybridized with the dehydrogenase or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 32P-labeled cDNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The full-length 1.4-kb human retSDR1 cDNA was generated by cloning the 5′ and 3′ ends using the NarI restriction site present in the overlapping region. The coding sequence for retSDR1 was amplified from this plasmid by PCR with primers FH48 (5′-CATATGGCGTGGAAACGGCTGGGC-3′), which placed a NdeI restriction site on the ATG, and FH49 (5′-CTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTGTCCGCCCTTTGAAAGTGTT-3′), which placed a 6-His tag at the 3′-end and using a denaturing temperature of 94 °C for 30 s, and an annealing and extension temperature of 68 °C for 2.5 min. The purified fragment was cloned into pCRTM 2.1 vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen). The insert was transferred as a NdeI-BamHI fragment into NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-3b (Novagen) and expressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS after induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Proteins insoluble in bacteria were purified on Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions following the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of all constructs presented in this study were verified by DNA sequencing. The coding sequence for retSDR1 was amplified from the retSDR1 plasmid by PCR with primers FH48 (5′-CATATGGCGTGGAAACGGCTGGGC-3′), which placed a NdeI restriction site on the ATG, and FH50 (5′-CTATGTCCGCCCTTTGAAAGTGTT-3′) using a denaturing temperature of 94 °C for 30 s, and an annealing and extension temperature of 68 °C for 2.5 min. The purified fragment was cloned into pCRTM 2.1 vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen), designated pFR415. A fragmentXbaI-HindIII from pFR415 covering the human retSDR1 coding sequence was cloned between the XbaI and HindIII sites of pFastBac1 expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). The expression cassette was then transferred into the baculovirus shuttle vector (bacmid) by transposition. Sf9 insect cells were transfected with the recombinant bacmid using cationic liposome-mediated transfection (CellFECTIN reagent, Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The coding sequence for 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase was amplified from bovine retina cDNA by PCR with primers FH51 (5′-CATATGTGGCTGCCTCTGCTGCTG-3′), which placed a NdeI restriction site on the ATG, and FH52 (5′-TTAGTAGACTGTCTGGGCAGG-3′) for 32 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2.5 min and cloned into pCRTM 2.1 vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen) (designated pFR425) and then transferred into insect cells following the same procedure as for human retSDR1. For the expression of recombinant proteins, cells cultured at 27 °C in Sf-900 II SFM (Life Technologies, Inc.) were harvested by centrifugation at 1200 ×g, 72–96 h after infection. Variable expression and activity levels were observed between different preparations. The reasons for these differences were not investigated. An ATG and NdeI restriction site were introduced upstream of the amino acid 36 of retSDR1 by PCR on pFR415 plasmid with primers FH64 (5′-CATATGCTGTCGCGGGAGAACGTCC-3′) and FH50 (5′-CTATGTCCGCCCTTTGAAAGTGTT-3′) through 32 cycles using a denaturing temperature of 94 °C for 30 s and an annealing and extension temperature of 68 °C for 2.5 min. The purified fragment was cloned into pCRTM 2.1 vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen) and sequenced by dyedeoxy-terminator sequencing (ABI-Prism, Perkin-Elmer) and then transferred into insect cells following the same procedure as for the full-length retSDR1. RDH activity was measured by following the transfer of 3H from [3H]NADPH to all-trans-retinal (reduction) (17Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Garwin G.G. Buczylko J. Wheeler T. Palczewski K. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). [3H]NADPH was synthesized by chemical reduction of NADP (Sigma) with [3H]NaBH4 (18Chaykin S. Chakraverty K. King L. Watson J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 124: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and purified on a Nucleosil NB 10 column (Macherey-Nagel) (17Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Garwin G.G. Buczylko J. Wheeler T. Palczewski K. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells were homogenized in water containing 2 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mmNADP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Cell membranes were washed in the same solution, pelleted by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in 5 times the volume of the pellet. The reaction mixture contained 10 mm MES, pH 5.5, 14.2 μm[3H]NADPH (83,000 dpm/nmol, both pro-4S and pro-4R isomers), and membranes from insect cells (2.5–3.0 mg/ml protein), in a final volume of 60 μl. All-trans-retinal or 11-cis-retinal in ethanol was added at a concentration of 10 μm (final concentration of ethanol <1%, v/v). Reactions were quenched with 400 μl of methanol, 50 μl of 10 mm NH2OH, pH 7.0, 50 μl of 0.1 m NaCl and extracted with 500 μl of petroleum ether. Radioactivity was determined in 250 μl of the organic phase. [3H]Pro-4S-NADPH was prepared from NADP and [2-3H,3-3H]glutamic acid (DuPont) in the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase (Sigma) as described previously (19Nakajima N. Nakamura K. Esaki N. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 106: 515-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). NADPH was purified on Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a salt gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in 10 mm(1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane), pH 7.5, during 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. NADPH was eluted at ∼250 mm NaCl. Steroid dehydrogenase assays were performed using membranes from insect cells infected with a virus carrying the retSDR1 construct or a control helper virus (bacmid transposed with pFASTBACD). The following steroids were purchased from Sigma: estrone (1,3,5[10]-estratrien-3-ol-17-one), β-estradiol (1,3,5[10]-estratriene-3,17β-diol), 4-androstene-3,17-dione, testosterone (4-androsten-17β-ol-3-one), 11-dehydrocorticosterone (4-pregnen-21-ol-3,11,20-trione), corticosterone (4-pregnene-11β,21-diol-3,20-dione), 5α-androstane-3,17-dione, androsterone (5α-androstan-3α-ol-17-one), 5α-androstane-17β-ol-3-one, and 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (dihydroandrosterone). The steroids were dissolved in ethanol (15–50 mm stock solutions). The reduction of steroids was carried out in 25 mm MES, pH 5.5, containing 1 mg/ml membrane proteins, 20 μm pro-4S-[3H]NADPH and 0.5 mm steroids for 10 min at 30 °C. Steroids were extracted with 10-fold excess (volume) of dichloromethane. As a positive control, the reduction of 4-androstene-3,17-dione to testosterone by liver microsome was used. The product was identified by thin layer chromatography (40Chai X. Boerman M.H.E.M. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3900-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Liver microsomes were prepared from fresh bovine liver by flotation in 45% sucrose, similar to the preparation of rod outer segments. BALB/c mice were immunized with his-tagged human retSDR1 expressed in E. coli retSDR1. A hybridoma cell line producing specific antibodies was prepared by fusion of BALB/c mouse myeloma cells with spleen cells from the immunized mouse according to the procedure described by Harlow and Lane (20Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 139-243Google Scholar). Supernatants from culture of the hydridomas were screened by immunocytochemistry and by immunoblotting. Subsequent cloning yielded mAb A11, which was an IgG1. The epitope recognized by mAb A11 has not been characterized in detail; however, it must be present in the C-terminal half of the protein because mAb A11 recognized a truncated protein comprising amino acid residues 169–303 (data not shown). An anti-11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated using a peptide whose sequence (SKFLGLEAFSDSLRRDV) encompassed the catalytic region of the enzyme. The peptide was coupled to a carrier protein and used for immunization as described previously (21Otto-Bruc A. Fariss R.N. Haeseleer F. Huang J. Buczylko J. Surgucheva I. Baehr W. Milam A, H. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4727-4732Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Anti-retSDR1 and anti-11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase reacted specifically with the dehydrogenase used for immunization. Samples of bovine, monkey and human retina were processed with sense and antisense digoxygenin-labeled riboprobes as described previously (21Otto-Bruc A. Fariss R.N. Haeseleer F. Huang J. Buczylko J. Surgucheva I. Baehr W. Milam A, H. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4727-4732Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The anterior segments of bovine, monkey, and human eyes were removed and the eye cups immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.13 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 6 h. For immunoperoxidase staining, the whole mount retinal sections were processed as described by Milam et al. (22Milam A.H. Possin D.E. Huang J. Fariss R.N. Flannery J.G. Saari J.C. Vis. Neurosci. 1997; 14: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy, agarose-embedded retinal sections (100 μm) were processed as described previously (22Milam A.H.

A 1.5-kb cDNA probe covering human retSDR1 was labeled with biotin-11-dUTP by nick translation (Life Technologies, Inc.). Metaphase chromosome preparations from lymphocytes of a human male were obtained using 75 mm KCl as a hypotonic buffer and methanol:acetic acid (3:1, v/v) as fixative. The hybridization was carried out as described previously by Edelhoff et al. (24Edelhoff S. Ayer D.E. Zervos A.S. Steingrimsson E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Eiseman R.N. Brent R. Disteche C.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 665-668PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were detected using a detection system from Vector Laboratories. After incubation with goat anti-biotin antibody, the slides were rinsed in modified 2× SSC (2× SSC, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.15% bovine serum albumin). A second incubation with fluorescein-labeled anti-goat IgG and a rinse in modified 2× SSC followed. The chromosomes were banded using Hoechst 33258-actinomycin D staining and counterstained with propidium iodide. The chromosomes and hybridization signals were visualized by fluorescence microscopy, using a dual band pass filter (Omega). The model of retinol retSDR1 was constructed using the two crystal structures of ternary complexes of short-chain dehydrogenases with NADP and substrates. The structure of residues 35–286 is based on that of mouse carbonyl reductase, which has 26% sequence identity and 34% similarity (26Breton R. Housset D. Mazza C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure. 1996; 15: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Inserts (1, 4, 3, 1, 1, and 1 amino acids) and omissions (1 amino acid) were modeled using the Biopolymer (Tripos) and Chain (Baylor University) software. The conformation of the inserted loops was modeled to resemble that of the human 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD), which has 26% sequence identity and 33% similarity (26Breton R. Housset D. Mazza C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure. 1996; 15: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The C-terminal part of retSDR1, residues 287–302, was modeled based on the fold of 17β-HSD. The model was allowed to relax from possible steric overlaps of the side chains and then was optimized by energy minimization using the Biopolymer software. The model of retinol was constructed using the coordinates of retinoic acid available in the Cambridge Structural Database. The retinol molecule was positioned in the active site of retSDR1 so that its oxygen atom corresponded to the oxygen atom of the propanol present in the structure of carbonyl reductase and the ligand position was optimized with the docking option of the Biopolymer software. The enzymatic properties of retinol dehydrogenase in ROS extracts, such as molecular weight, sensitivity to thiol-reactive reagents, and solubility, suggested that the enzyme was likely to be a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. A DNA sequence (∼40 base pairs) (see “Experimental Procedures”) corresponding to a conserved domain among retinol dehydrogenases was used to search for homology in an expressed sequence tag (EST) data base. One EST obtained from a human retinal cDNA library (W22782 generated by J. Macke, P. Smallwood, and J. Nathans) was similar to 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase, and its translation product had amino acid sequence motifs conserved in the SDR superfamily (27Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). PCR with primers designed from this EST sequence amplified a product of 250 base pairs, which provided a probe to identify the putative retSDR1 cDNA among RACE products. Overlapping cDNA 5′ and 3′ ends obtained by RACE were combined to construct a 1.4-kb human cDNA. This full-length cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding a basic protein (pI = 9.07) of 302 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 33,520 Da (Fig. 2A). The first ATG (55–57 nucleotides) matched the Kozak consensus sequence for translation initiation (28Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Bovine and mouse cDNAs were cloned following the same strategy, and sequences are shown in Fig. 2A. The amino acid sequences of human, bovine and mouse retSDR1s are 94–98% identical (Table I). This high homology is absent in the 5′- and 3′- untranslated regions of bovine, human, and mouse retSDR1 (data not shown).Table ISequence comparison of retSDR1 with selected SDRsSDRAmino acid similarityAmino acid identity%%hretSDR1100100bretSDR198.798.3mretSDR19694.4RODHI39.129RODHII34.325.7RODHIII34.325CRAD33.926.411cisRDH37.627.69cisRDH39.429BDH3221.811βHSD131.724.1MLCR3425.817βHSD130.825PGDH33.720.3The comparison was made using amino acid sequences obtained in this study and deposited in the GenBank (see Fig 2 B for definitions of abbreviations and accession numbers) using the GAP program from the GCG package.

The gap creation and gap extension penalties were set on 6 and 4, respectively. The retSDR1 sequence contains all the motifs present in the SDR superfamily of enzymes including the invariant YXXXK motif (amino acids 188–192), the catalytic Ser-175, the highly conserved Ser before Ly-192 residue, the highly conserved nucleotide binding motif TGXXXGXG (44–51), and the conserved Gly, Asp, Gly, Leu, Asn, Ala, Asn, Gly, Ile, Leu, Val, and Pro at sequence positions 62, 96, 115, 120, 123, 124, 147, 168, 170, 202, 212, and 219, respectively. The presence of RTEK at positions 71–74 is consistent with the specificity of this enzyme for NADPH (29Tsigelny I. Baker M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). retSDR1s are related to other SDRs, including those with retinol dehydrogenase activity, as shown in a dendrogram (Fig. 2 B). Tissue distribution of retSDR1 mRNA was assessed by Northern blot analysis of several human tissues and bovine retina. A transcript of ∼1.8 kb is present in placenta, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, and retina but was not detected in brain. The size of the human retSDR1 detected by blotting is similar to that of the partial (perhaps lacking fragments of untranslated regions) isolated cDNAs (1.401 for human, 1.478 for mouse, and 1.460 for bovine retSDR1). A transcript of smaller size (∼1.4 kb) was observed in heart and skeletal muscle (Fig.3). This transcript could arise from tissue-specific polyadenylation of the retSDR1 mRNA or splicing of the retSDR1 pre-mRNA, because a similar hybridization pattern was observed with the probe derived from the 3′-untranslated region of retSDR1 (data not shown). The presence of the retSDR1 mRNA, and not a cross-reacting transcript, in other tissues was also supported by a homology search of EST data bases, which revealed sequences identical to retSDR1 in several m"
https://openalex.org/W2063741440,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are Gram-negative bacterial pathogens that infect human mucosal epithelia. Type IV pilus-mediated adherence of these bacteria is a crucial early event for establishment of infection. In this work, we show that the type IV pili transduce a signal into the eucaryotic host cell. Purified adherent pili, but not pili from a low binding mutant, trigger an increase in the cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) in target epithelial cells, a signal known to control many cellular responses. The [Ca2+]i increase was blocked by antibodies against CD46, a putative pilus receptor, suggesting a role for this protein in signal transduction. Pilus-mediated attachment was inhibited by depletion of host cell intracellular Ca2+ stores but not by removal of extracellular Ca2+. Further, kinase inhibition studies showed that pilus-mediated adherence is dependent on casein kinase II. In summary, these data reveal a novel function of the type IV pili, namely induction of signal transduction pathways in host cells."

By using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) type I epithelial cells as a model, we tested the hypothesis that cAMP stimulates Cl− secretion by stimulating CFTR Cl− channel trafficking from an intracellular pool to the apical plasma membrane. To this end, we generated a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CFTR expression vector in which GFP was linked to the N terminus of CFTR. GFP did not alter CFTR function in whole cell patch-clamp or planar lipid bilayer experiments. In stably transfected MDCK type I cells, GFP-CFTR localization was substratum-dependent. In cells grown on glass coverslips, GFP-CFTR was polarized to the basolateral membrane, whereas in cells grown on permeable supports, GFP-CFTR was polarized to the apical membrane. Quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy and surface biotinylation experiments demonstrated that cAMP did not stimulate detectable GFP-CFTR translocation from an intracellular pool to the apical membrane or regulate GFP-CFTR endocytosis. Disruption of the microtubular cytoskeleton with colchicine did not affect cAMP-stimulated Cl− secretion or GFP-CFTR expression in the apical membrane.

Stimulation of CFTR-mediated Cl− secretion by cAMP has been reported to occur by the following two mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive: first, cAMP stimulates protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation and activation of CFTR Cl− channels resident in the plasma membrane (5Cheng S.H.

To begin to understand the trafficking of CFTR, we constructed a jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CFTR expression vector in which GFP was ligated to the N terminus of wild-type CFTR, and we used GFP fluorescence to localize CFTR in living and fixed cells. GFP, a 27-kDa protein from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria, has emerged as an in vivo reporter protein for studying complex biological processes such as organelle dynamics and protein trafficking (18Gerdes H.-H.

By using quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy, cell-surface biotinylation, and short circuit current (Isc) analyses, we demonstrate that the predominant mechanism by which cAMP stimulates GFP-CFTR-mediated Cl−secretion is by activating channels resident in the apical membrane and not by stimulating insertion of channels into the apical membrane or inhibiting retrieval of channels from the apical membrane. To construct the pGFP-CFTR mammalian expression vector, human CFTR cDNA was excised from pBluescript II SK− (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with AvaI, treated with Klenow fragment to fill-in sticky ends, and ligated into SmaI-digested and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase-treated pS65T-GFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). To maximize GFP fluorescence, S65TGFP cDNA was exchanged for enhanced GFP cDNA using AgeI/KpnI. Enhanced GFP is codon-optimized for expression in mammalian systems and exhibits 6-fold greater levels of fluorescence than S65T-GFP (21Zhang G. Gurtu V. Kain S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis of the GFP-CFTR junction confirmed the intended reading frame. Proceeding from the N to the C terminus, the resultant fusion protein consists of GFP, a linker sequence of 23 amino acids, and CFTR. Based on the predicted transmembrane topology of CFTR (4Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.-L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C.

A. 1998; 95: 2674-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was used to compare the function of GFP-CFTR to CFTR in whole cell patch-clamp experiments. To examine the effect of GFP on CFTR function in planar lipid bilayer experiments, GFP-CFTR was subcloned from pGFP-CFTR into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using NheI andEcoRV (to generate pcDNA3.1 GFP-CFTR). Similarly, CFTR was subcloned from pGFP-CFTR into pcDNA3.1 using Asp718 and XhoI (to generate pcDNA3.1 CFTR). These vectors allow synthesis of cRNA for expression in Xenopusoocytes. MDCK type I cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (pass number 54, CCL-34, Rockville, MD) and grown on tissue culture-treated polystyrene flasks in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown in 5% CO2-balanced air at 37 °C. When confluent, cells were subcultured by trypsinization (0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution; Life Technologies, Inc.). For short circuit current and confocal microscopic experiments, cells were seeded at 50,000–75,000 cells/0.33 cm2, and for surface biotinylation experiments, cells were seeded at 200,000/4.5 cm2 on permeable Transwell filter bottom cups (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Cells were fed daily and used 5–7 days after seeding. Because GFP fluorescence is temperature-sensitive (23Kaether C. Gerdes H.-H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Lim C.R. Kimata Y. Oka M. Nomaguchi K. Kohno K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we grew all cells used for experiments at 33 °C to maximize GFP signal intensity. In preliminary experiments, we observed that culturing cells at reduced temperature did not affect cell growth or viability and did not alter GFP-CFTR localization compared with cells cultured at 37 °C. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, which do not express detectable levels of endogenous CFTR Cl− channels (25Anderson M.P. Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 251: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), were use in whole cell patch-clamp experiments to examine whether GFP affected CFTR Cl− channel function. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 0.2% fungizone (Biofluids, Rockville, MD). Cells were seeded at 30–50% confluency prior to transfection in 35-mm tissue culture dishes coated with 1:20 diluted Vitrogen 100 (purified bovine dermal collagen; Collagen Corp., Fremont, CA). NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.) as per the manufacturer's instructions using 1 μg of pGFP-CFTR or pCFTR with 1 μg of pGFP (Green Lantern plasmid; Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1 μg pRL-CMV luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The GFP plasmid was used to identify green fluorescent cells, which were likely co-transfected with the CFTR constructs, using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted fluorescence microscope intrinsic to the patch-clamp system. The luciferase plasmid was used to assess relative transfection efficiency; all transfectants displayed equivalent levels of luciferase activity. Transfected cells were transferred to 33 °C for 2–3 days before patch-clamp recording. To generate MDCK cells stably transfected with pGFP-CFTR, we first optimized transient transfection efficiency with the PerFect Lipid Transfection Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (26Moyer B.D. Stanton B.A. Expressions. 1997; 4 (Invitrogen company newsletter): 6Google Scholar). A T75 flask of MDCK cells was transfected with pGFP-CFTR plasmid. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were selected with 300 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and fed every 4–5 days for 2 weeks in complete media containing G418. Surviving cell colonies were trypsinized, and single cells with bright GFP fluorescence were sorted into individual wells of 96-well plates using a FACStar PLUS flow cytometer (Becton Dickenson, San Jose, CA). GFP fluorescence was excited using the 488 nm line from an argon laser and collected with a 530/30 nm band pass filter. Clones were expanded and screened for GFP fluorescence by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Similar experimental results were found in MDCK C7 cells (generous gift of Dr. Hans Oberleithner) (27Gekle M. Wunsch S. Oberleithner H. Silbernag S. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 428: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) stably transfected with GFP-CFTR. Following establishment of cell lines, G418 was reduced to 150 μg/ml and was removed 3–4 days prior to experimentation. MDCK stable transfectants were treated with 5 mm sodiumn-butyrate (Sigma) for 15–18 h prior to experimentation to increase GFP-CFTR expression levels. Sodium butyrate was removed 2 h prior to experimentation. Whole cell patch-clamp recording of GFP-positive cells was performed as described previously in detail (22Schwiebert E.M. Morales M.M.

Only 50% of pGFP-CFTR and pCFTR transfectants expressing visible levels of GFP fluorescence responded to cAMP treatment with an increase in Cl− conductance. Non-responding cells, which were probably transfected with pGFP but not pGFP-CFTR or pCFTR, exhibited currents similar to non- or mock-transfected cells, and were excluded from data analysis. Single channel properties of GFP-CFTR and CFTR Cl−channels were studied in planar lipid bilayers. Stage V–VIXenopus oocytes were harvested and injected with 5 ng of CFTR cRNA, 5 ng of GFP-CFTR cRNA, or 50 nl of water as described previously (30Goldin A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; : 266-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were prepared 48 h postinjection following the method of Pérez et al. (31Pérez G. Lagrutta A. Adelman J.P. Toro L. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thirty to forty oocytes in each group were washed and homogenized in high K+/sucrose medium containing the following protease inhibitors: aprotinin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μm), and DNase I (2 μg/ml). Oocyte membranes were isolated by discontinuous sucrose gradient density centrifugation and resuspended in 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mmMOPS (pH 6.8). Membrane vesicles were separated into 50-μl fractions and stored at −80 °C until use. Planar lipid bilayers were made from a phospholipid solution containing a 1:1 mixture of diphytanoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine/diphytanoyl-phosphatidylserine (inn-octane; final phospholipid concentration of 25 mg/ml). Membrane vesicles were applied with a fire-polished glass rod to one side (trans) of a preformed bilayer bathed with symmetrical 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS-Tris (pH 7.4). Acquisition and analysis of single channel recordings were performed as described (32Jovov B. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Sorscher E.J. Dedman J.R. Kaetzel M.A. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

Channel activity was recorded in the presence of 1.85 ng/ml protein kinase A catalytic subunit (gift of Dr. Gail Johnson, University of Alabama) and 100 μm ATP. Short circuit current (Isc) was measured across MDCK monolayers as described previously (34Kizer N.L. Lewis B. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F347-F355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all experiments, amiloride (10−5m) was present in the apical bath solution to inhibit electrogenic Na+ absorption. Under these conditions, cAMP-stimulated Isc across monolayers of MDCK cells is referable to Cl− secretion. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all steps were performed at room temperature in Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 9 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 7.1)), and antibody incubations were for 1 h. Cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized with ice-cold 100% MeOH for 10 min and washed with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 0.1% BSA (PBS-TB). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 8% BSA for 30 min, and cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-Na/K-ATPase monoclonal antibody (IgG1) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS-TB and incubated with 1:100 goat anti-mouse Texas Red secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 3 h. Cells were washed in PBS-TB and mounted in 90% glycerol, 10% PBS containing 10 mg/ml n-propyl gallate (Sigma) to retard fading. Cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized in 100% acetone for 2 min at −20 °C and incubated in 10 μg/ml anti-ZO-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Zymed, So. San Francisco) in 1% BSA. Cells were washed, incubated with 1:100 goat anti-rabbit Texas Red secondary antibody (Molecular Probes), and mounted as above. Cells were immunostained essentially as described previously (2Denning G.M. Ostedgaard L.S. Cheng S.H. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) using 10–40 μg/ml anti-CFTR R domain (IgG1) or anti-CFTR C-terminal (IgG2a) monoclonal antibodies (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). Biotinylated monolayers were fixed in 3.0% paraformaldehyde for 30 min on ice and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 2% BSA. Biotinylated proteins were detected with 50 μg/ml Texas Red-avidin (Pierce) in 1% BSA for 30 min, washed, and mounted as above. Control experiments in which cells were stained with nonspecific antibody of the appropriate isotype (for monoclonal antibodies), non-immune serum (for polyclonal antibodies), and/or secondary antibody only demonstrated the specificity of observed signals. MDCK cells grown on permeable supports were fixed in 3.0% paraformaldehyde in Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Monolayers were excised with a razor blade, cut into thin strips, embedded in Tissue-Tek (Miles, Ellhart, IN), and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled liquid propane. Sections 5–7 μm in thickness were cut with a cryostat and examined by confocal microscopy. Images were acquired using a Zeiss (Thornwood, NY) Axioskop microscope equipped with a laser scanning confocal unit (model MRC-1024, Bio-Rad), a 15-milliwatt krypton-argon laser, and a × 63 Plan Apochromat/1.4 NA or × 40 Plan Neofluor/1.3 NA oil immersion objective. GFP fluorescence was excited using the 488-nm laser line and collected using a standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set (530 ± 30 nm). Fluorescence associated with Texas Red-labeled secondary antibodies and propidium iodide was simultaneously excited using the 568-nm laser line and collected using a standard Texas Red filter set (605 ± 32 nm). Three-dimensional reconstructions were rendered using LaserSharp version 2.1A (Bio-Rad) software. Acquired images were imported into National Institutes of Health Image version 1.57 software (Bethesda, MD) for quantitation and into Adobe Photoshop version 3.0 for image processing and printing. For live cell microscopy, cells were mounted in a temperature-controlled, flow-through perfusion chamber (RC21-B Chamber, Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) at 37 °C in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mmMgCl2 to maintain cell adherence, 25 mm HEPES to buffer pH changes, and 5.5 mm glucose as an energy source. During image acquisition, solution was not perfused over cells to minimize drift in the z-dimension. For quantitative confocal microscopy, all images from the samez series were collected using the same values for laser power, photomultiplier gain, iris, and black level. Typically, three scans were Kalman averaged per z section and 10 zsections were collected at 1.0-μm increments beginning at the apical membrane and ending at the basal membrane. Care was taken to ensure that pixel saturation was less than 10% and that signal intensities were in the linear range of photomultiplier tube sensitivity. Biotinylation of apical cell-surface glycoproteins was performed as described by Lisanti et al. (35Lisanti M.P. Le Bivic A. Sargiacomo M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To examine GFP-CFTR endocytosis and recycling, cells were incubated at 37 °C between sodium periodate and biotin-LC-hydrazide treatments as described by Prince et al. (8Prince L.S. Workman Jr., R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Following biotinylation, monolayers were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 and containing the Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim)), scraped from filters, and spun at 14,000 × g for 4 min to pellet insoluble material. Less than 1% of GFP-CFTR remained in the insoluble pellet as determined by Western blotting. Aliquots of cell lysates were removed for SDS-PAGE analysis, and the remainder of the supernatants were brought to a volume of 900 μl with lysis buffer and precipitated with 100 μl of a 50% slurry of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. Beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation for 30 s at 14,000 × g and washed three times with lysis buffer. Biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (0.24m Tris-HCl (pH 8.9), 16% glycerol, 0.008% bromphenol blue, 5.6% SDS, and 80 mm dithiothreitol). Cell lysates (30–40 μg protein) were digested with endoglycosidase H (Endo H, 1500 units) or peptideN-glycosidase F (PNGase F, 1500 units) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 1 h at room temperature following the manufacturer's instructions, with the exception that lysates were not denatured prior to digestion. Denaturation induced GFP-CFTR aggregation and protein failed to enter separating gels. Cell lysates and biotinylated proteins were separated on 4–15% Tris-HCl gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.02% Tween 20 and incubated with either GFP (1:1000) (CLONTECH) or CFTR C-terminal (1:1000) monoclonal antibodies followed by anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000–1:10,000; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and digitally scanned with a Silverscan III flatbed scanner (LaCie, Hillsboro, OR). Densitometric analysis of band intensities was performed with public domain NIH Image version 1.57 software. Differences between means were compared by either paired or unpaired two-tailed Student's t test as appropriate using Instat statistical software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance is ascribed forp < 0.05. 8-(4-Chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (CPT-cAMP, monosodium salt) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim and Sigma. 8-Bromo-cAMP, isobutylmethylxanthine, forskolin, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS), glybenclamide, colchicine, lumicolchicine, and propidium iodide were purchased from Sigma. Diphenylamine carboxylic acid (DPC) was purchased from Fluka (Milwaukee, WI) and Sigma. Because CFTR Cl− channel function is necessary for normal CFTR trafficking (8Prince L.S. Workman Jr., R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we performed experiments to examine whether fusion of GFP to the N terminus of CFTR affected function as a cAMP-activated Cl− channel. To this end, we performed whole cell patch-clamp experiments on transiently transfected NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, which express no detectable endogenous CFTR Cl− channels (25Anderson M.P. Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 251: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, cAMP-activated Cl−currents were similar in cells expressing GFP-CFTR and CFTR (with no GFP tag). Currents were not sensitive to DIDS but were inhibited by glybenclamide, consistent with established CFTR pharmacology (10Morris R.G. Tousson A. Benos D.J. Schafer J.A. Am. J.

Irr accumulated only under iron limitation, and turned over rapidly upon an increase in iron availability. A separate role for Irr in controlling the cellular iron level was inferred based on a deficiency in high affinity iron transport activity in the irr strain, and suggests that regulation of the heme pathway is coordinated with iron homeostasis. A high level of protoporphyrin accumulation is not a normal consequence of nutritional iron deprivation, thus a mechanism for iron-dependent control of heme biosynthesis may be present in other organisms.

Iron must be acquired exogenously and may be a limiting nutrient, thus a prima facie argument can be made for the coordination of the heme pathway with the cellular iron level to prevent protoporphyrin synthesis from exceeding iron availability. This problem has been partially addressed in mammalian erythroid cells, where the iron-regulatory proteins (reviewed in Refs. 14Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, it has not been established that this mechanism is sufficient to regulate the heme pathway as a whole or that it prevents excess protoporphyrin synthesis under iron limitation. Similarly, little is known about regulation of the heme pathway by iron in prokaryotes, and this is addressed in the present study. Bradyrhizobium japonicum is a good system for studying heme biosynthesis because its ability to live either as a free-living cell or as a nitrogen-fixing endosymbiont of soybean necessitates the expression and regulation of diverse systems for respiratory metabolism (18Sangwan I. O'Brian M.R. Science. 1991; 251: 1220-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2471-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of B. japonicum hemA and hemB, the genes encoding ALA synthase and ALA dehydratase, respectively, are positively affected by iron (20Page K.M. Connolly E.L. Guerinot M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1535-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Chauhan S. Titus D.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5516-5520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). hemB is particularly responsive, with mRNA and protein levels varying over 80-fold as a function of the iron concentration in which the cells are grown (21Chauhan S. Titus D.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5516-5520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that loss of function of a new gene called irruncouples heme biosynthesis from iron availability, thereby demonstrating that the pathway as a whole is regulated by iron, and providing insight into the mechanism of control. Furthermore, this regulation is integrated with iron homeostasis. B. japonicum LO and I110 were the parent strains used in the present work. Both strains were analyzed because strain I110 is the most commonly used strain, but strain LO can be mutagenized with Tn5 with higher efficiency. Strain LODTM5 is a mutant derivative of strain LO that contains a transposon Tn5 within the irr gene. Strain I110ek4 is a hemH mutant constructed as described previously (22Frustaci J.M. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4223-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The B. japonicum strains were routinely grown at 29 °C in GSY medium (23Frustaci J.M. Sangwan I. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The medium was supplemented with kanamycin and streptomycin at 100 and 50 μg/ml for solid and liquid cultures, respectively, for strain LODTM5. Strain I110ek4 was grown with kanamycin and 15 μm hemin to fulfill its heme auxotrophy. Escherichia coli strains DH5α or XL1-Blue were used for propagation of plasmids and were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Strain LO was mutagenized with Tn5 as described previously (22Frustaci J.M. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4223-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Colonies were screened for those that fluoresced under ultraviolet light on plates containing low iron medium. One protoporphyrin-accumulating strain was cultured, and theEcoRI restriction fragment containing the Tn5 and flanking genomic DNA was isolated and reintroduced into the strain LO genome by homologous recombination to construct LODTM5. The position of Tn5 in the genome of strain LODTM5 was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Precautions were taken to avoid exposure of strain LODTM5 to light in order to prevent the formation of light-dependent reactive oxygen species catalyzed by protoporphyrin. The fluorescent compound produced by the mutant strains was purified and identified as protoporphyrin as described elsewhere (22Frustaci J.M. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4223-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Smith K.M. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier Scientific, Amsterdam1975Google Scholar). Genomic DNA flanking the Tn5 was used as a hybridization probe to isolate a 13-kb HindIII fragment from the wild type genome, and a 3.4-kb EcoRI fragment subclone contained the region mutated in strain LODTM5. The EcoRI fragment and subclones ligated into the broad host range plasmid pLAFR3 were tested for complementation. Although strain LODTM5 grew on plates, introduction of pLAFR3 alone into the mutant yielded pinpoint colonies that could not be cultured in liquid medium. Although unexplained, it is possible that the mutant could not bear the burden of replication of the 22-kb plasmid. Thus, we were able to use growth as a criterion for complementation as well as colony fluorescence. The nucleotide sequence of both strands of a SmaI-SacI fragment corresponding the mutated locus of strain LODTM5 was determined, which contained a 492-bp open reading frame. The exact location of Tn5 in the mutant was determined by sequencing of a portion of the mutated fragment in the region of the transposon. The medium used for culturing cells under iron limitation was a modified GSY medium in which 0.5 g/liter yeast extract (Difco) is used instead of 1 g/liter, and no exogenous iron source was added. The actual iron concentration of the medium was 0.3 μm as determined with a Perkin-Elmer model 1100B atomic absorption spectrometer. Cells grew well in this medium to A540 of 0.6, but mutant strain LODTM5 grew more slowly than the parent strain at higher cell densities. Cells were grown to A540 of 0.4–0.6 for all experiments except for protoporphyrin accumulation experiments, in which cells were grown to A540 of 0.8. For RNA and protein analysis of hemB, hemH, andirr, the cells were grown in medium with no added iron as the iron-limited condition or 6 μm FeCl3 as the iron replete condition. For the metal-dependent protoporphyrin accumulation experiments, FeCl3 was added to the final concentration indicated, and other metals were added as the chloride salt to a final concentration of 11 μm. Total RNA was prepared from cultured cells grown to mid-log phase as described previously (10Chauhan S. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3706-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Steady state levels of irr, hemB, or hemH mRNA were analyzed by an RNase protection assay as described previously (10Chauhan S. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3706-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Chauhan S. Titus D.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5516-5520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using antisense RNA probes to the respective genes. The effect of iron on the rate of irr mRNA synthesis was determined by transcriptional runoff analysis essentially as described previously (10Chauhan S. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3706-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of ALA dehydratase or Irr in whole cells or cell extracts was detected by immunoblot analysis of 10% or 15% SDS-PAGE gels using antibodies raised against the respective protein. Anti-ALA dehydratase antibodies were prepared as described previously (25Chauhan S. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19823-19827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A modified irrgene was constructed by a polymerase chain reaction such that anNdeI restriction site was introduced at the second methionine codon of the open reading frame and cloned into pET3c for overexpression in E. coli Bl21(DE3)(pLysS). The 5′ primer used to modify the sequence was 5′-AACCATATGCTCCAGTC-3′. The M13 reverse primer complementary to pUC19 vector in which the B. japonicum DNA was cloned was used as the 3′ polymerase chain reaction primer. Antibodies were raised against the Irr protein derivative purified from inclusion bodies using a protocol described previously (26Frustaci J.M. Sangwan I. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7387-7393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For Irr turnover experiments, 1 liter of cells was grown to mid-log phase in low iron medium and then separated into two 500-ml cultures. To one culture, 6 μm FeCl3was added at time 0, and for the control an equivalent volume of buffer with no iron was added. Incubation with shaking was continued, and 25-ml samples were removed at various times after iron addition for immunoblot analysis. Autoradiograms were quantified using a Bio-Rad model GS-700 imaging densitometer in the transmittance mode and the Molecular Analyst software package, version 1.4.1. Ferrochelatase activity was measured as the formation of mesoheme by cell extracts from ferrous iron and mesoporphyrin as described previously (22Frustaci J.M. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4223-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protoporphyrinogen oxidase activity was measured in membrane preparations as the oxidation of protoporphyrinogen to protoporphyrin as described previously (22Frustaci J.M. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4223-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A unit of activity is defined as the nanomoles of product formed/h/mg of protein. Cells were grown to mid-log phase in low or high iron media, centrifuged, washed twice, and resuspended in uptake buffer to an A540 of 0.4. Uptake buffer contained 0.2 m MOPS, 20 mm citrate, and 2% (w/v) glucose, pH 6.8. 30 ml of cells were placed into a 125-ml flask and preincubated at 30 °C with shaking. At time 0,59FeCl3 was added to a final concentration of 0.05 μm (1.8 μCi). 1-ml aliquots (∼125 μg of protein) were removed at various times and added to 3 ml of quench buffer precooled on ice. The quench buffer contained 0.1 mTris, 0.1 m succinate, and 10 mm EDTA, pH 6.0. The quenched cells were collected on 0.45-μm filters presoaked in quench buffer containing 40 μm Fe-EDTA, and then counted on a LKB γ-counter. To search for mutants deregulated in iron control of heme biosynthesis, we screened a population of Tn5-induced mutants for colonies that accumulated protoporphyrin, as discerned by fluorescence under ultraviolet light. B. japonicum mutant strain LODTM5 displayed that phenotype, and the fluorescent species was purified and identified as protoporphyrin IX by the peaks of the absorption spectra of the neutral methyl ester derivative (Fig.1 A) and the free acid, and by thin layer chromatography (data not shown). No other porphyrins were detected. Protoporphyrin is the immediate precursor of protoheme (Fig.1 B), and thus the mutant was altered in some aspect of heme metabolism. In principle, protoporphyrin accumulation could be due to defects in the heme synthesis enzymes ferrochelatase or protoporphyrinogen oxidase. However, those enzyme activities were not defective in extracts of the mutant (data not shown), andhemH mRNA encoding ferrochelatase was expressed (see below). Furthermore, strain LODTM5 was not a heme auxotroph. The results show that the primary defect in strain LODTM5 is not a lesion in a structural gene of the heme biosynthetic pathway. To determine whether the mutant phenotype was iron-dependent, cells were grown in media with varying concentrations of the metal. An inverse relationship was found between the quantity of protoporphyrin produced by the mutant and the iron concentration in which the cells were grown, with the highest amount found in cells grown in media with no exogenous iron added, and none detected at high iron concentrations (Fig. 1 C). Protoporphyrin was not detected in cells of parent strain LO under any iron condition tested. When this experiment was repeated withhemH strain I110ek4, which accumulates protoporphyrin due to a defect in ferrochelatase (22Frustaci J.M. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4223-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no decrease in the protoporphyrin level with increasing iron was observed (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the diminution observed in strain LODTM5 was not due to the nonenzymatic chelation of iron into protoporphyrin, but rather it was specific to that mutant. The effects were also metal-specific, as seen by the failure of copper, zinc, nickel, manganese, or molybdenum to abolish protoporphyrin accumulation by strain LODTM5 (Fig. 1 D). Thus, the aberration in heme metabolism was linked to iron availability, and the mutant phenotype is manifest under iron depleted conditions. The genetic locus mutated in strain LODTM5 was namedirr (iron responseregulator) based on these observations, and on those described below. The accumulation of protoporphyrin by strain LODTM5 in the absence of a heme deficiency strongly indicated an abnormally high synthesis of protoporphyrin by the heme pathway in iron-limited cells. We determined previously that hemB, the gene encoding the heme biosynthesis enzyme ALA dehydratase is regulated by iron at the mRNA level in B. japonicum wild type strain I110 and that accumulation is low in iron-limited cells (21Chauhan S. Titus D.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5516-5520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By RNase protection and immunoblot analyses, respectively, we examined the effects of iron on hemB mRNA and protein in wild type strains I110 and LO, and in irr strain LODTM5. As observed previously, hemB mRNA and protein were very low in wild type cells grown in media with no added iron, and were elevated significantly in cells grown in iron-replete medium (Fig.2). However, mRNA and protein levels were high in strain LODTM5 even in cells grown in low iron medium, showing the loss of normal iron-dependent regulation of the gene in the mutant. Under low iron conditions, the mutant accumulated approximately 50-fold more ALA dehydratase and over 150-fold morehemB mRNA than was found in parent strain LO. This high expression of hemB by the mutant was consistent with the protoporphyrin accumulation phenotype and indicates an elevated heme pathway. Ferrochelatase catalyzes a step of the pathway subsequent to protoporphyrin formation, and therefore a regulatory system that coordinates protoporphyrin synthesis with iron availability is unlikely to control hemH, the gene encoding ferrochelatase. Consistent with this rationale, accumulation of hemHmRNA was not iron-dependent in the wild type strains, nor was its expression altered in strain LODTM5 (Fig. 2). Collectively, the results argue in favor of a role for irr in mediating iron control of hemB, and of the pathway as a whole, and support the conclusion that protoporphyrin synthesis exceeds iron bioavailability in iron-limited cells of mutant strain LODTM5. To elucidate the genetic basis of the mutation in strain LODTM5, wild type DNA corresponding to that which was mutated in the irr strain was isolated using cloned DNA flanking the Tn5 as a hybridization probe. A 3.4-kbEcoRI fragment and subclones (Fig.3 A) were tested for complementation of strain LODTM5 on the broad host range plasmid pLAFR3 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The smallest complementing clone tested was a 0.7-kb SmaI/BglII fragment containing a 492-bp open reading frame encoding a protein 163 amino acids in length (Fig. 3 A). The Tn5 was inserted into the 5′ portion of the irr gene (Fig. 3 A). Expression of the irr gene region was analyzed by measuring RNA and protein accumulation in irr + strains LO and I110 and in the mutant (Fig. 4). RNase protection analysis showed that irr accumulated in wild type strains LO and I110, but not in mutant strain LODTM5 (Fig.4 B). In addition, no mRNA corresponding to the genomic region immediately downstream of irr was detected in any strain, indicating that irr does not have another gene downstream of it encoded on the same transcript. Immunoblot analysis of whole cell protein of the wild type strains and of irrstrain LODTM5 using anti-Irr antibodies showed that the wild type strains grown in low iron medium expressed an ∼18-kDa protein that was absent in the mutant (Fig. 4 C). The results show that strain LODTM5 carries a loss of function mutation in the irrgene, and that its phenotype is due to a lesion in that gene, and not to a polar effect of the Tn5 mutagen. In addition, the transposon was inserted close to the 5′ end of the gene, thus it was important to establish that the mutation did not activate a truncated derivative of irr or a downstream gene. Finally, the data show that irr is a protein-encoding gene, and that Irr is involved in the negative regulation of hemB and of the heme biosynthetic pathway.Figure 4The irr gene is iron-regulated in wild type cells and is not expressed in mutant strain LODTM5. A, the genomic region containing the irr gene is marked by the restriction sites MluI (M),SalI (S), BglII (Bg),BamHI (B), and SacI (Sc). The triangle denotes the site of Tn5 insertion.

B, RNase protection analysis of the irr gene, the downstream (ds) and hemH mRNA in cells of parent strains I110 and LO and mutant strain LODTM5. The irr and downstream mRNAs were analyzed using antisense probes as shown in panel A. hemH was analyzed using an antisense probe as described previously (21Chauhan S. Titus D.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5516-5520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in medium with no added iron (−) or with 6 μm FeCl3 (+). 2 μg of total RNA from cells grown in iron-limited medium were analyzed per reaction. C, immunoblot analysis of Irr protein in strains LO, I110 and LODTM5 grown in low (−) or high (+) iron media as described in panel B. 50 μg of protein were loaded onto each lane of a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed with anti-Irr antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A data base search of protein blocks (27Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Genomics. 1994; 19: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) suggests that Irr belongs to the GntR family of bacterial transcriptional regulators (28Reizer A. Deutscher J. Saier M.H. Reizer J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) based on homology to helix-turn-helix motif regions of members of that family (Fig. 3 B). Homology searches of individual proteins revealed that Irr shares the highest homology to the Fur protein fromPseudomonas aeruginosa (29% identity), a transcriptional regulator found in many Gram-negative bacteria involved in iron transport and other aspects of iron metabolism (29Braun V. Hantke V. Winkelmann G. Handbook of Microbial Iron Chelates. CRC Press, Boca Raton1991: 107-138Google Scholar). Bacterial Fur must be bound by iron to function (30de Lorenzo V. Wee S. Herrero M. Neilands J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2624-2630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and consequently, it is active only under iron-replete conditions. In contrast, the phenotype of theB. japonicum irr strain indicates that it is active under iron limitation, and data (presented below) show that Irr is not detected in cells grown in iron-rich medium. Thus, Irr and Fur cannot have the same activity and therefore are not equivalent proteins. In addition, we recently isolated a B. japonicum fur gene homolog by functional complementation of and E. colimutant. 2I. Hamza and M. R. O'Brian, GenBankTM accession no. AF052295. A B. japonicum fur strain expresses ALA dehydratase normally and does not accumulate protoporphyrin under any growth condition (data not shown). Consistent with those observations, protoporphyrin was undetectable inE. coli fur strain H1780 (31Hantke K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 210: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) grown in low or high iron media (data not shown). The results indicate that irr is a novel gene. Strain LODTM5 displayed a mutant phenotype only under iron limitation, suggesting that Irr function is restricted to those cells. Thus, it is likely that iron either modulates the activity of constitutively expressed Irr protein, or that the metal regulates expression of irr in some way. This problem was addressed by measuring irrmRNA and protein in cells grown in high or low iron media (Fig. 4). Immunoblot analysis showed that Irr accumulated in wild type cells grown in low iron medium, but was undetectable in those from iron-replete medium (Fig. 4 C). This pattern was consistent with the mutant phenotypes (see Figs. 1 and 2 and below) and shows that Irr is present and active only in iron-limited cells. Unlike protein expression, however, RNase protection analysis showed that iron had only a moderate negative effect on irr mRNA levels, with a substantial quantity found even in iron replete cells (Fig.4 B). This 3-fold difference was consistent with transcriptional run-off assays demonstrating that the rate ofirr mRNA synthesis was 4-fold greater in iron-limited cells compared with those grown in iron-rich medium (data not shown). The discrepancy between irr mRNA and protein strongly indicates post-transcriptional control of the irr gene by iron in additional to transcriptional regulation. Addition of iron to cells grown under iron deprivation results in the rapid induction of hemB mRNA (21Chauhan S. Titus D.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5516-5520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus B. japonicum responds quickly to a change in iron availability. If the assertion that Irr mediates negative control of hemBexpression by iron is correct, then we expect a rapid loss of Irr activity upon an increase in iron availability. To address this, we monitored Irr levels in response to iron. The addition of 6 μm FeCl3 iron to cells grown in low iron medium resulted in the rapid loss of Irr protein that was observed by 5 min after addition of the metal, and almost no protein remaining after 30 min (Fig. 5). This disappearance reflects a very high turnover rate for a bacterial protein (32Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mosteller R.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16529-16535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) regulatory proteins with short half-lives are specifically targeted for proteolysis under the appropriate conditions, and the observations for Irr strongly suggest a specific mechanism for its degradation. We postulate that this post-transcriptional control permits a fast response to an increase in iron availability, and that it can account for the discrepancy betweenirr mRNA and protein in iron replete cells. Iron is an essential nutrient involved in many biologic functions, but is also toxic in high concentrations. A regulatory mechanism that couples protoporphyrin synthesis with iron levels should also integrate systems necessary for iron homeostasis. Therefore, we examined the effects of iron availability on high affinity iron uptake activity in parent strain LO and mutant strain LODTM5. Wild type cells grown in iron-replete medium lacked iron transport activity using 0.05 μm59Fe (as ferric citrate) as a tracer, but uptake was induced in cells grown in low iron medium (Fig.6 A). This is a common response by bacteria to efficiently scavenge the metal when it is limiting. However, this activity was severely diminished in mutant strain LODTM5 (Fig. 6 B), indicating that iron transport is under positive control in B. japonicum by a mechanism that involves Irr. In addition, it is plausible that the iron uptake defect in strain LODTM5 resulted in an iron deficiency that contributed to the protoporphyrin accumulation phenotype. Because iron limitation repressedhemB in wild type cells (Fig. 3) (21Chauhan S. Titus D.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5516-5520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the high expression of the gene in strain LODTM5 cannot be an indirect consequence of the iron transport defect, which should render the cell iron-deficient. We showed previously that hemB is expressed in iron-replete cells of a heme-defective strain (21Chauhan S. Titus D.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5516-5520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), therefore the elevatedhemB level in the irr mutant is not an indirect result of a heme deficiency created by iron limitation. The present findings suggest that Irr has dual activities to positively affect iron transport and negatively regulate hemB, and that the control of heme biosynthesis is coordinated with iron homeostasis. In the present study, we provide evidence for coordination of a bacterial heme biosynthetic pathway with iron availability by a regulatory mechanism involving the newly described protein Irr. Irr accumulates in response to iron limitation by iron-dependent regulation of the irr gene to attenuate the heme pathway, thereby preventing protoporphyrin synthesis from exceeding iron availability. The phenotype of the irrmutant is important because it demonstrates that copious protoporphyrin accumulation is a consequence of uncoupling the heme pathway as a whole from iron availability, and that it can result from a single genetic lesion. Because this phenotype is not normally observed in cells, it is reasonable to extrapolate from the present work that iron control of heme biosynthesis is a general regulatory phenomenon found in other organisms. Humans with iron deficiency anemia show a 5-fold increase in blood protoporphyrin, reaching approximately 2 × 10−4 mol/mol of heme (38Garrett S. Worwood M. Acta Haematol. 1994; 91: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This elevated level is modest by comparison with the B. japonicum irr mutant, which accumulates approximately 15 mol of protoporphyrin/mol of heme under iron limitation (by recalculation of the data in Fig. 1 D). Thus, iron may regulate the heme pathway in erythrocytes to prevent severe porphyrin accumulation under iron deficiency. In bacteria, numerous genes have been recently identified that encode proteins that, like Irr, have low but significant homology to Fur, but are distinct from bona fide fur genes in those organisms (GenBankTM accession nos. Z82044, D84432, D90909, U76538,P32692, U58365, and U25731). Most of those genes were identified by whole genome sequencing and their functions are unknown. However,fur-like genes of Vibrio cholerae (39Camilli A. Mekalanos J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) andP. aeruginosa (40Wang J. Mushegian A. Lory S. Jin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10434-10439Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) were shown to be expressed, and theP. aeruginosa mutant does not have afur-defective phenotype. From this, it is pertinent to ask whether bacteria other than B. japonicum contain Irr homologs that mediate iron control of heme synthesis. The defective iron uptake activity in mutant strain LODTM5 indicates a link between control of the heme pathway and iron homeostasis. The proposed roles for Irr are physiologically sensible because it allows the cell to maximize accessibility to exogenous iron when the metal is limiting as well as attenuate the heme biosynthetic pathway. By analogy, the iron regulatory proteins in mammalian erythroid cells regulate iron transport and a heme biosynthesis gene enzyme (reviewed in Refs. 14Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar and 15Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 174-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and it will be important to determine whether that control is sufficient to modulate synthesis by the pathway as a whole. Furthermore, the identification of regulators of iron homeostasis such as bacterial Fur (29Braun V. Hantke V. Winkelmann G. Handbook of Microbial Iron Chelates. CRC Press, Boca Raton1991: 107-138Google Scholar) and Aft1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (41Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) may provide the tools necessary to assess the relationship between iron transport and heme biosynthesis in those organisms.

These results identify PP1 as the first tau binding protein and suggest that tau is a novel PP1-targeting subunit.

The assembly and functions of MTs are dependent on their interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (1Schoenfeld T.A. Obar R.A. Int. Rev.

Specifically, MAPs including MAP1, MAP2, and tau have been found to control MT dynamics and stability and to contribute to neuronal cell functions in the nervous system (6Matus A. Annu. Rev.

Although the mechanisms by which MT function is regulated are not completely understood, phosphorylation of MAPs has been shown to regulate their interactions with MTs (1Schoenfeld T.A. Obar R.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 151: 67-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Hirokawa N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 3Mandelkow E.M.

In general, increased phosphorylation of MAPs reduces the affinity of the MAPs for MTs (11Brion J.P. Guilleminot J. Couchie D. Flament-Durand J. Nunez J.

Protein kinases that phosphorylate MAPs have been intensely studied (19Fellous A. Kubelka M. Thibier C. Taieb F. Haccard O. Jessus C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 651-659PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sano M. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1263-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Berling B. Wille H. Roll B. Mandelkow E.M. Graner C. Mandelkow E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 120-130PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, much less is known about the protein phosphatases involved. However, several lines of evidence suggest that protein phosphatases may be rate-limiting enzymes in the regulation of MAP-MT interactions. In our previous study, phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid (OA) and calyculin-A (CL-A) were found to induce the complete loss of stable MTs without significantly affecting the level of dynamic MTs in interphase cells (22Gurland G. Gundersen G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8827-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The dose response curves of OA and CL-A in this study suggest that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is involved in maintaining stable MTs. Treatment of interphase sea urchin egg extracts with OA induces mitotic-like MT dynamics by eliminating the rescue phase of MT dynamics (23Gliksman N.R. Parsons S.F. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119 (1226): 1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Incubation of mouse oocytes with OA leads to lengthening of mitotic spindles, disorganization of the metaphase plate, and phosphorylation of proteins associated with MTs (24de Pennart H. Verlhac M. Cibert C. Maria A.S. Maro B. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results imply that protein phosphatases are necessary for dephosphorylation of MAPs, resulting in increased MT assembly and stability in vivo. However, the identity of the protein phosphatases involved, their specific in vivo substrates, and how are they regulated in response to internal and external cues are still unknown. PP1 is one of the four major serine/threonine phosphatases found in eukaryotic cells. It plays important roles in diverse cellular activities, such as carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, calcium transport, gating of ionic channels, muscle contraction, nuclear organization, protein synthesis, mitosis, and meiosis (25Bollen M. Stalmas W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 26Shenoliker S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 27Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21435-21438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). The fact that numerous and diverse substrates are dephosphorylated by this single enzyme in various subcellular localizations suggests the existence of mechanisms to determine and regulate phosphatase specificity and activity. Emerging evidence has supported a general mechanism whereby PP1 is directed to various substrates by specific targeting subunits that also modulate the enzymatic activity of PP1 toward its substrates (29Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Thus, for a particular cellular event regulated by PP1, it is essential to identify the targeting subunit that directs PP1 to protein substrates involved in the event. Several protein kinases and one phosphatase have been found to associate with MTs (30Sontag E. Numbhakdi-Craig V. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 31Rubino H.M. Dammerman M. Shafit-Zagardo B. Erlichman J.

In all known cases, the kinases were found to associate with MTs through MAPs. MAP2 was found to bind both the regulatory subunit of Type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase and MAP kinase to MTs (31Rubino H.M. Dammerman M. Shafit-Zagardo B. Erlichman J. Neuron. 1989; 3: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Morishima-Kawashima M. Kosik K.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and MAP4 was found to bind cyclin B, which may direct Cdc2 kinase to MTs (33Ookata K. Hisanaga S. Bulinski J.C. Murofushi H. Aizawa H. Itoh T.J. Hotani H. Okumura E. Tachibana K. Kishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 849-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This suggests that regulatory enzymes associated with MTs may use members of the MAP family to mediate their association. This may be a general mechanism that also applies to MT-associated phosphatases, although the mechanism of their association has not been elucidated. In this study, we report that there is a PP1 activity that remains tightly associated with MTs during their biochemical isolation from brain tissue. We provide evidence that this association is mediated by a MT-targeting protein. Using biochemical assays, we show that the MAP tau is predominantly responsible for binding PP1 to MTs. Our results suggest that tau is a novel PP1-targeting subunit and raise the possibility that phosphatases and kinases use different MAPs to associate with MTs. Okadaic acid and CL-A were from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Taxol was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemical Branch of the Division of Cancer Treatment, NCI. All tissue culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc. Sepharose CL-6B, blue dextran, and catalase were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [γ-32P]ATP (3000–6000 Ci/mmol, 5–10 mCi/ml) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The ECL solution was from Pierce. Unless specified otherwise, all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. A peptide antibody against PP1 was generated by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide CDLQSMEQIRRIM (residues 180–191 of PP1c with an additional Cys residue at the N terminus for coupling) corresponding to a region conserved among all PP1 isoforms. Rabbit antisera were produced by Pocono Rabbit Farms (Canadensis, PA) by immunizing rabbits with the peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate (50 μg peptide/injection) (35Yoshitake S. Yamada Y. Ishikawa E. Masseyeff R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 101: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A peptide antibody against PP2A was generated as described previously (36Brautigan D.L. Chen J. Thompson P. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1993; 7: 43-60Google Scholar). Tau antibody T46, which reacts with all tau isoforms (37Trojanowski J.Q. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), was a generous gift from Dr. J. Q. Trojanowski (University of Pennsylvania). MTs were prepared from calf brains by 3–4 cycles of warm assembly/cold disassembly as described (38Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). MAPs and tubulin were prepared from thrice-cycled MT pellets by DEAE Sephadex A-50 frozen chromatography (38Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. All steps were performed at 4 °C. A Sepharose CL-6B column (0.9 × 90 cm) was equilibrated in PEM buffer (100 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) (low salt) or PEM buffer containing 2m NaCl (high salt). Blue dextran and catalase were used to calibrate the column. For low salt conditions, PP1c or MAPs were applied to the column and eluted with PEM buffer at 0.2 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. For high salt conditions, PP1c or MAPs were incubated in PEM containing 2 m NaCl overnight at 4 °C and then applied to the column and eluted with PEM containing 2m NaCl. Fractions from the high salt column were dialyzed in PEM buffer overnight using a microdialysis system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Protein concentrations of the column fractions were estimated by A280. Phosphorylase b was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described (39Gratecos D. Detwiler T.C. Hurd S. Fisher E.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4812-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (40Brautigan D.L. Shriner C.L. Gruppuso P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4295-4302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatase assays were performed as described (40Brautigan D.L. Shriner C.L. Gruppuso P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4295-4302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 0.5 mm MnCl was included in the assay buffer. A PEM buffer blank was run in parallel, and the background was subtracted from each sample. One unit of activity is equal to one nmol of phosphate released per min. The inhibitor profile of the MT-associated protein phosphatase was determined by adding inhibitors to the reaction mixture before adding the [32P]phosphorylase a substrate. For experiments with the heat stable inhibitor I2, samples were preincubated for 15 min at 30 °C prior to adding the substrate. I2 was purified as described previously (41Gruppuso P.A. Johnson G.L. Constantinides M. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4288-4294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit skeletal muscle PP1c used for comparison in these experiments was purified to homogeneity as described earlier (42DeGuzman A. Lee E.Y.C. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All procedures were performed at room temperature. Samples were first centrifuged at 50,000 ×g for 15 min at room temperature to remove aggregates. MTs were prepared by polymerizing DEAE-purified tubulin with 20 μm taxol as described (43Vallee R.B. Collins C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated with taxol-MTs in PEM buffer for 20 min followed by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants and pellets were recovered, and phosphatase activity was measured. In control experiments, PEM buffer was used instead of MTs to assess nonspecific sedimentation. Fractions from the Sepharose CL-6B column eluted with 2 m NaCl were dialyzed and assayed for their ability to bind recombinant PP1cα to taxol-MTs. Purified recombinant PP1cα was a generous gift of Dr. E. Y. C. Lee (New York Medical School, Valhala, NY) and was prepared as described previously (44Zhang Z. Bai G. Deans-Zirattu S. Browner M.F. Lee E.Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1484-1490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant PP1c (0.13 μg) was incubated with ∼2 μg of protein from each fraction for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were preclarified before incubation as described above. Taxol-MTs (20 μg) were then added to the mixture and incubated for 20 min. Supernatants and pellets were prepared by centrifugation (50,000 ×g for 10 min) and then assayed for phosphatase activity. The pellets were solubilized in PEM buffer before assay. To measure the activation of PP1c activity by column fractions, PP1c was incubated for 10 min with each column fraction that was used in the MT targeting assay and then assayed directly for phosphatase activity. The activity of PP1c alone was used as a base line to calculate the magnitude of activation by each column fraction. The phosphatase activity in each MT pellet in the targeting assay was then normalized by the level of activation in the absence of MTs. Protein samples were run on 4–14% SDS-PAGE and, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blots were stained by Ponceau Red. The blot was blocked with NET buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton, 2.5 g/liter gelatin) containing 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for > 1 h. For blot overlays with PP1c, the membrane was incubated with 1.8 μg/ml of recombinant PP1c in NET buffer for 2 h at room temperature followed by extensive washing with NET buffer. The membrane was then incubated with rabbit PP1 peptide antibody (at 1:2000 dilution) in NET buffer for ∼2 h. The blot was washed and incubated in goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Cappel, Organon Teknik Co.) at 1:20,000 dilution in NET buffer followed by detection with ECL solution. For Western blot analysis, blots were blocked with NET buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the primary antibodies indicated under “Results.” Blots were then developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL. Sf9 cells were infected by recombinant tau baculovirus (provided by Dr. T. Frappier) as described (45Knops J. Kosik K.S. Lee G. Pardee J.D. Cohen G.L. McConlogue L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). After 2 days of infection, the cells were collected, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing proteinase inhibitors chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin (each at 0.1 mg/ml) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mm), resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin), and then sonicated. NaCl and β-mercaptoethanol were added to the cell extract at final concentrations of 0.4 m and 10 mm, respectively. The mixture was then boiled for 5 min and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant containing heat stable tau was dialyzed in PEM buffer and stored at −80 °C. The sample was > 90% tau as judged by quantitative SDS-PAGE. To identify protein phosphatases that might be involved in regulating MT stability, preparations of MTs purified from calf brain homogenates were obtained by cycles of warm assembly and cold disassembly using the standard protocol (38Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). After three or four cycles, the preparation yielded about 80% assembly competent tubulin and 20% presumptive MAPs. Using [32P]phosphorylase, a standard substrate for both PP1 and PP2A, we detected a phosphatase activity that co-assembled with MTs throughout four cycles of MT polymerization/depolymerization (TableI). Approximately 5% of the total soluble phosphatase activity in brain extracts cosedimented with MTs during the first cycle. With additional cycles, about half of this activity was lost (compare activity in P1 with that of P2–P4), presumably because of the loss of phosphatases loosely associated with MTs or with contaminants that were removed in subsequent cycles. Nonetheless, 1–2% of the total extract activity cycled with MTs to constant stoichiometry from the second to fourth cycles. The phosphatase activity was also detected in DEAE-purified MAP fractions and could be dissociated quantitatively from MTs by 0.3 msalt treatment, which is a characteristic of conventional MAPs (data not shown).Table IAssociation of protein phosphatase activity with MTs during assembly/disassembly cyclesSampleProteinPhosphatase ActivityConcentrationTotalYieldActivityTotalYieldmg/mlmg%unit/mgunit%HSS10.778508.3100542541100P110.017598.922.821285P29.28519.16.10.95aConstant specific activity in P2–P4.4931.16P38.393824.490.89aConstant specific activity in P2–P4.3400.8P48.32305.13.590.87aConstant specific activity in P2–P4.2660.6Following preparation of a brain extract (HSS), MTs were cycled four times between an assembled polymeric state and a disassembled soluble state. P1–P4 are sequential MT pellets that were resolubilized prior to assay. Protein concentration in each fraction was measured, and total protein was from one preparation using six calf brains. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were assayed for phosphatase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One unit of activity is equal to 1 nmol of phosphate released per min. Similar results were observed in three separate preparations.a Constant specific activity in P2–P4. Open table in a new tab Following preparation of a brain extract (HSS), MTs were cycled four times between an assembled polymeric state and a disassembled soluble state. P1–P4 are sequential MT pellets that were resolubilized prior to assay. Protein concentration in each fraction was measured, and total protein was from one preparation using six calf brains. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were assayed for phosphatase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One unit of activity is equal to 1 nmol of phosphate released per min. Similar results were observed in three separate preparations. To determine whether PP1 or PP2A were present in the cycled MT preparations and hence might be responsible for the phosphatase activity, we probed Western blots of the fractions from the MT assembly/disassembly cycles using peptide-specific antibodies to either PP1 or PP2A. As shown in Fig.1 A, a single band of ∼37 kDa, which comigrated with bacterially expressed recombinant PP1c, was detected in MT pellet fractions (P1–P4) probed by PP1 antibody. The levels of PP1 judged by the immunoreactive bands in the last three pellet fractions (P2–P4) were similar, which is consistent with the constant stoichiometry of phosphatase activity associated with MTs (Table I). Accordingly, there is little detectable PP1 in supernatant fractions in the last two cycles (S3 and S4). PP1 was also detected in the MAP fraction purified by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography of MT proteins cycled three times (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, PP2A was detected in the first MT pellet fraction but in decreasing amounts in subsequent MT pellets so that by the third or fourth cycle, no PP2A was detected in MT pellets (Fig. 1 B). No significant amount of PP2A was detected in the DEAE-purified MAP fraction (Fig. 1 B). Also, no substantial phosphatase activity was detected in purified MAPs when p-nitrophenyl phosphate, a preferred substrate for PP2A but a much less sensitive substrate for PP1 (46Li H.C. Hsiao K.J. Sampathkumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3368-3374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used to assay phosphatase activity (data not shown). No increase of activity was observed when the PP2B activator Ca2+ was included in the phosphatase assay (data not shown) (26Shenoliker S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). These results suggest that PP1, but not PP2A or PP2B, may be responsible for the phosphorylase phosphatase activity that coassembles with MTs to constant stoichiometry. To demonstrate that the MT-associated phosphatase is indeed PP1, the inhibitor profile of phosphatase activity in the fourth cycle MT pellet (P4) was characterized. OA inhibits phosphatases at different concentrations with an IC50 value of 0.1–1 nmfor PP2A, ∼50 nm for PP1, and >1 μm for PP2B and PP2C (48Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, the dose response curve of the MT-associated phosphatase to OA was nearly identical to that measured for PP1c purified from skeletal muscle with an IC50 of about 50–60 nm (49Ishihara H Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Karaki H. Ozaki H. Kato Y. Fusetani N. Watabe S. Hashimoto K. Uemura D. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Similarly, the dose response curve of the MT-associated phosphatase in P4 toward CL-A closely resembled that of PP1c with an IC50 of ∼10 nm (Fig. 2 B) (49Ishihara H Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Karaki H. Ozaki H. Kato Y. Fusetani N. Watabe S. Hashimoto K. Uemura D. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). The greater sensitivity of the MT-associated phosphatase to CL-A compared with OA, is a characteristic of PP1 but not PP2A phosphatases (49Ishihara H Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Karaki H. Ozaki H. Kato Y. Fusetani N. Watabe S. Hashimoto K. Uemura D. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Moreover, both PP1c and the MT-associated phosphatase were inhibited by heparin and protamine, two specific inhibitors of PP1 but activators for PP2A (50Pelech S. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Most definitively, I2, a specific and diagnostic protein inhibitor of PP1, inhibited the activities of both the MT-associated phosphatase and PP1c to >90% (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, the above results clearly indicate that the protein phosphatase that tightly associates with MTs through multiple cycles of assembly/disassembly is exclusively a PP1-type protein phosphatase. We therefore named it PP1MT. To test whether PP1MT binds directly to MTs or indirectly through another protein, the MT binding abilities of PP1MT in a crude MAP fraction and purified, recombinant PP1c were compared in a MT cosedimentation assay. Recombinant PP1c alone did not cosediment with MTs, whereas PP1MT nearly quantitatively cosedimented with MTs (TableII). Neither PP1MT nor PP1c sedimented by themselves. This result suggests that unlike PP1MT, PP1c cannot directly bind to MTs.Table IIMT binding of PP1MT and PP1cProtein phosphatase activitySupernatantPelletunits%units%PP1c8.2960.34PP1c + MT8.5970.33MAPs8950.45MAPs + MT2.1246.576MAPs were eluted from brain MT preparation by 0.3 m NaCl.

https://openalex.org/W1985841114,"We studied arachidonic acid metabolism and the expression of cyclooxygenase (Cox) and 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) in the human colorectal carcinoma cell line, Caco-2, which undergo apoptosis and cell differentiation in the presence of sodium butyrate (NaBT). Caco-2 cells expressed very low levels of Cox-1 but highly expressed Cox-2. NaBT treatment shifted the arachidonic acid metabolites by cell lysates from prostaglandins to 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, indicating the presence of a 15-LO. Linoleic acid, an excellent substrate for 15-LO, was metabolized poorly by the Caco-2 cells, but NaBT treatment shifted metabolism to 15-LO metabolite, 13(S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid. Caco-2 cells expressed a 15-LO but only after treatment with NaBT, as determined by Northern blotting. Immunoblotting with anti-human 15-LO antibody detected a 72-kDa band in NaBT-treated Caco-2 cells. Expression of 15-LO mRNA was dependent on the duration of NaBT treatment, with the highest expression observed between 10 and 24 h. Results from expression and metabolism studies with arachidonic and linoleic acid cells indicated Cox-2 was responsible for the lipid metabolism in control cells, whereas 15-LO was the major enzyme responsible after NaBT induction of apoptosis and cell differentiation. The 15-LO in Caco-2 cells was characterized as human reticulocyte 15-LO by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme analysis. The expression of 15-LO and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid or 13(S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid formation correlates with cell differentiation or apoptosis in Caco-2 cells induced by NaBT. The addition of nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, significantly increased NaBT-induced apoptosis, whereas the addition of indomethacin did not alter NaBT-induced apoptosis in the Caco-2 cells. However, indomethacin treatment decreased the expression of Cox-2 in NaBT-treated cells and significantly increased the expression of 15-LO during NaBT treatment. These studies suggest a role for 15-LO, in addition to Cox-2, in modulating NaBT-induced apoptosis and cell differentiation in human colorectal carcinoma cells.

These studies suggest a role for 15-LO, in addition to Cox-2, in modulating NaBT-induced apoptosis and cell differentiation in human colorectal carcinoma cells. The first genetic alteration in the multistep process that leads to the development of colon carcinogenesis seems to be the loss ofAPC gene function. Investigations of APC function and its mutations have provided important clues in understanding colon cancer (1Prescott S.M. White R.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). One of the important changes that results from the loss of the APC gene function is the overexpression of prostaglandin H synthase-2 (cyclooxygenase-2, Cox-2), 1The abbreviations used are: CoxcyclooxygenaseNaBTsodium butyrateHETEhydroxyeicosatetraenoic acidLOlipoxygenaseHODEhydroxyoctadecadienoic acidRT-PCRreverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionRIErat intestinal epithelialHpODEhydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acidFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPGprostaglandinPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorkbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)NDGAnordihydroguaiaretic acid. an inducible enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. The link betweenAPC, Cox-2, and polyp formation was firmly established in studies using APC (Apc Δ716) and Cox-2 knockout mice (2Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar). Mice carrying the APC mutation overexpress Cox-2 and develop intestinal polyps. When bred to mice with the disrupted Cox-2 gene, the offspring, homozygously deficient for Cox-2, had significantly less polyps than the mice with wild-type Cox-2. These results confirmed Cox-2 as a modulator afterAPC mutations in colon carcinogenesis and represent a key enzyme in tumor development. The elevated expression of Cox-2 was shown not only in polyps of Apc Δ716 andMin mice (3Williams C.S. Luongo C. Radhika A. Zhang T. Lamps L.W. Nanney L.B. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N.

These findings provide an explanation for epidemiological, clinical, animal, and experimental studies which indicate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit Cox-2, prevent colorectal cancer. cyclooxygenase sodium butyrate hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid lipoxygenase hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rat intestinal epithelial hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid fetal bovine serum phosphate-buffered saline high pressure liquid chromatography prostaglandin peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor kilobase(s) base pair(s) nordihydroguaiaretic acid. One possible explanation for the role of Cox-2 in colon carcinogenesis was obtained from studies with rat intestinal epithelial (RIE) cells engineered to overexpress Cox-2 (7Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). The overexpression of Cox-2 in RIE cells results in a resistance to sodium butyrate (NaBT) or adhesion-induced apoptosis. However, mechanisms that clearly explain how Cox-2 alters or inhibits apoptosis have not been determined. The addition of prostaglandins to cells in culture does not seem to alter cell proliferation and/or apoptosis (8Hanif R. Pittas A. Feng Y. Koutsos M.I. Qiao L. Staiano-Coico L. Shiff S.I. Rigas B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), and other investigations indicate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug agents may act by a prostaglandin-independent pathway (9Piazza G.A. Rahm A.K. Finn T.S. Fryer B.H. Li H. Stoumen A.L. Pamukcu R. Ahnen D.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2452-2459PubMed Google Scholar). The metabolites of arachidonic acid formed by Cox-2 are considered an important contributor, but we cannot ignore the possible involvement of linoleic acid metabolites, as it is also a substrate for Cox-2 (10Soberman R.J. Harper T.W. Betteridge D. Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4508-4515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, arachidonic acid and linoleic acid metabolites formed by the enzymatic activity of lipoxygenases may also need to be considered. Our laboratory has shown that both Cox-2 and 15-lipoxygenase (LO) metabolites of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid alter growth factor signaling pathways (11Glasgow W.C. Hill E.M. Mcgown S.R. Tomer K.B. Eling T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1042-1048PubMed Google Scholar, 12Glasgow W.C. Hui R. Everhart A.L. Jayawickreme S.P. Angerman-Stewart J. Han B-B. Eling T.E. J. Biol.

For example, 13(S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE)/13(S)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (HpODE) is formed from linoleic acid in response to epidermal growth factor and contributes to epidermal growth factor-dependent mitogenesis in Syrian hamster fibroblast cells (13Glasgow W.C. Afshari C.A. Barrett J.C. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10771-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 13(S)-HpODE augmented the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway by attenuation of receptor dephosphorylation (12Glasgow W.C. Hui R. Everhart A.L. Jayawickreme S.P.

Furthermore, 15-LO metabolites of linoleic acid, 13(S)-HpODE inhibits starvation-induced apoptosis. 2W. C. Glasgow, A. L. Everhart, and Eling, T. E., unpublished observation. Furthermore, Tanget al. (14Tang D.G. Chen Y.Q. Honn K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5241-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) showed that lipoxygenase metabolites, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and 15-HETE, inhibit apoptosis in rat W256 cells. They suggest a role for 12-LO as an inhibitor of apoptosis (15Tang D.G. Honn K.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a potential involvement of lipoxygenases in the apoptotic process. We have examined arachidonic acid and linoleic acid metabolism in the human colorectal cell line, Caco-2, which undergoes cell differentiation and apoptosis in the presence of NaBT (16Hague A. Manning A.M. Hanlon K.A. Huschtscha L.I. Hart D. Paraskeva C. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The metabolite profile was dramatically shifted from Cox-2 metabolites to 15-LO-derived metabolites by the NaBT treatment. The NaBT induced a 15-LO that was characterized as the reticulocyte 15-LO previously characterized from human bronchial epithelium (17Sigal E. Grunberger D. Highland E. Gross C. Dixon R.A.F. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5113-5120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show the first evidence that a 15-LO is clearly induced in colorectal carcinoma cells. Moreover, the 15-LO may act to modulate NaBT-induced apoptosis and cell differentiation in these cells. The human colorectal carcinoma cell line Caco-2 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Caco-2 was grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium, 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.). The media for cells contained gentamicin (1 mg/100 ml, Life Technologies, Inc.). FBS was from Summit, and NaBT was obtained from Sigma. For treating cells with NaBT, cells were cultured in the appropriate media containing serum on 150 cm2 round dishes until nearly confluent. The medium was removed and replaced with FBS medium containing either the solvent or 5 mm NaBT. The NaBT was solibilized by PBS and used. Cells were then harvested at the times stated in the figure legends. The floating cells and the cells attached to the dish were collected separately and sedimented. Washed cell pellets were resuspended in cell lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% Triton X-100) and incubated. RNase A (0.5 mg/ml) and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) were added, respectively, and incubated for 2 h. DNA was precipitated by ethanol, and 3 μg or 1 × 106 cell numbers of water-diluted sample was run on a 2% agarose gel. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and DNA was visualized by UV transilluminater. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured using the p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) as substrate. The standard assay mixture consisted of 0.5 ml of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol buffer (1.5 mol/liter) (Sigma), 2 mg of substrate, and 100 μl of sonicated protein in a final volume of 1.1 ml. After 15 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 10 ml of 0.05 n NaOH, and the absorbance of the color due to the formation of p-nitrophenol was measured spectrophotometrically at 410 nm. Enzyme activity was expressed in Sigma Unit/0.1 mg protein. The calibration was performed by usingp-nitrophenol standard solution (Sigma). Total RNA from the attached cell was extracted by using TRI Reagent (Sigma) according to the procedure by Chomczynski (18Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 532-537PubMed Google Scholar). RNA samples (30 μg per lane) were separated by electrophoresis in a formaldehyde-1% agarose gel. The RNA was transferred in 10 × SCC by capillary action onto nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and UV-cross-linked with a Stratalinker UV light source (Stratagene). Human 15-LO, Cox-1 and Cox-2 (Oxford Biomedical Research), and human glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (CLONTECH) cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Prime-It-II random prime kit (Stratagene). After hybridization and washes, the blots were then exposed to x-ray film (Amersham) for autoradiography. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in protein lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were sonicated four times for 20 s at 50% power for a total protein preparation. Protein content was quantified by the bicinchronic acid method using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Aliquots of the protein preparation were boiled in protein sampling buffer (9% SDS, 15% glycerol, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 6% β-mercaptoethanol) and separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto Hybond-enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). Blots were blocked with 10% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and washed. The blots were then incubated in 1% milk in TBS-T with an anti-appropriate specific antibody. CheY-human 15-LO antibody (Ref. 17Sigal E. Grunberger D. Highland E. Gross C. Dixon R.A.F. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5113-5120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, provided by Dr. Sigal) and PG27G (Oxford Biomedical Research) antibody were used as the 15-LO and Cox-2 antibodies, respectively. After washing, blots were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham). After reacting it by chemiluminescence (the Amersham ECL system), bands were detected after exposure to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham). Caco-2 cells cultured in 150-cm2 dishes at each condition were washed with PBS twice. Cells were scraped and collected in 1 ml of the lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 8.0), 1 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were sonicated four times for 20 s at 50% power by the sonic dismembrator for a total protein preparation. Then, protein content was quantified, and 0.8 mg of total cell lysate was used. The sonicates were then diluted with 1 ml of the reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmCaCl2) (2 ml total) and incubated [3H]arachidonic acid (3 μCi, 25 μm) (DuPont NEN) for 30 min or [14C]linoleic acid (3 μCi, 25 μm) (DuPont NEN) for 15 min at 37 °C. Fatty acid compounds were extracted from the incubation buffer by acidification to pH 3.5 with acetic acid and applied to a C18-PrepSep solid phase extraction column (Waters) pretreated with methanol. The samples were then washed with acidified water, eluted with methanol, evaporated to dryness, and reconstituted with high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) solvent. Reverse-phase HPLC analysis was performed using an Ultrasphere ODS column (5 μm; 4.6 × 250 mm; Beckman). The solvent system consisted of a methanol/water gradient at flow rate of 1.1 ml/min as described previously (19Henke D.C. Kouzan S. Eling T.E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Radioactivity was monitored using a Flow Scintillation Analyzer (Packard) with EcoLume (ICN Biochemicals) as the liquid scintillation mixture. To separate 9-HODE and 13-HODE, straight-phase HPLC was used. The straight-phase HPLC used a Waters μPorasil column (10 μm; 3.9 × 300 mm) with a flow rate of 2 ml/min and eluted with hexane:diethylether:acetic acid (1000:200:1) for 60 min. UV analysis was performed by monitoring absorbance at 235 nm with a Waters 990 photodioarray detector. Authentic standards of 9(R)-HODE, 13(S)-HODE, 15(S)-HETE, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and prostaglandin F2α were obtained from Cayman Chemical and used. First-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated using 1 μg of total RNA as template. Oligo(dT)18 primer (20 pmol) was used to prime a standard reverse-transcription (RT) reaction. AdvantageTMRT-for-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit was purchased fromCLONTECH and used for this cDNA synthesis. As a control for possible contamination of genomic DNA, the same RNA was also prepared to react without reverse transcriptase. The reaction solution was diluted to a final volume of 100 μl by DEPC-treated water, and the 5 μl was used as PCR. PCR mixture consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 2.0 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Pharmacia), and 0.4 μmeach of the following primers: P1, 5′-GAGTTGACTTTGAGGTTTCGC-3′; P2, 5′-GCCACGTCTGTCTTATAGTGG-3′; P3, 5′-CCCTGTGGATGAGCGATTTC-3′; and P4, 5′-AAGTGTCCCCTCAGAAGATG-3′ in a total volume of 50 μl. Thermocycling was performed according to the following profile: 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, repeated 35 times followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. cDNA fragments generated by RT-PCR using P1 and P2 primers were digested withPstI or HindIII (Boehinger Mannheim). Analysis of the fragments was performed on a 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and then photographed. To inhibit the activity of 15-LO in Caco-2 cells treated with NaBT, NDGA (Sigma), a inhibitor of lipoxygenase, was added in addition to NaBT. Before assessing the effect of attenuating the 15-LO on NaBT-induced apoptosis, the optimal concentration of NDGA for inhibiting 15-LO without affecting Cox activity was determined by studying arachidonic acid metabolism. The procedure for metabolism study and HPLC analysis were described above. As described previously, the floating Caco-2 cells were apoptotic, and thus the population of cells floating can be used as a measure of apoptosis. Cells were cultured on 6-well dishes (10 cm2) in FBS containing medium until subconfluent. Then, the media were replaced by the following four conditions: serum-containing medium (FBS), 5 mm of NaBT in FBS, NDGA (10 μm) in FBS, and NDGA (10 μm) containing 5 mm NaBT in FBS. NDGA was added to the medium every 24 h. NDGA was dissolved in ethanol, and the final concentration of ethanol in medium was less than 0.01%. The numbers of attached and floating cells were respectively counted with a hemocytometer in each condition at every 24 h until 96 h. Five dishes were performed in each condition. The ratio of the numbers of floating cells per total cells was calculated as the indicator of apoptosis. Also, the attached cells and the floating cells were harvested, and genomic DNA was prepared and assayed for the fragmentation of DNA. To inhibit the Cox activity of Caco-2 cells, indomethacin (Sigma) was added to the cells during NaBT treatment. Cells were suspended and cultured on 6-well dishes (10 cm2) until subconfluent. Then, the media were replaced with media containing FBS under the following conditions: control, 5 mm NaBT, indomethacin (1 μm), and 5 mm NaBT and indomethacin (1 μm). Indomethacin was administered at every 12 h. The numbers of attached and floating cells were counted with a hemocytometer in each condition at every 24 h until 96 h. Cells were also lysed at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment for immunoblot analysis. During culture of colorectal cell lines, some cells detach from the dish and float in the medium. Evidence indicates the floating cells have undergone apoptosis (20Shaw P. Bovey R. Tardy S. Sahli R. Sordat B. Costa J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4495-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). NaBT is reported to induce apoptosis and cell differentiation in various human colorectal carcinoma cells in culture (16Hague A.

Kumar R. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) including Caco-2 cells. In our experiments, we observed, microscopically, Caco-2 cells floating in the media with increasing time of treatment with NaBT. Two procedures were performed to evaluate the cell status during treatment with NaBT of Caco-2 cells. Fragmentation of DNA, an index of apoptosis, was determined by an examination of DNA ladder formation in the floating and attached cells. Cell differentiation was measured by alkaline phosphatase activity. The characteristic apoptotic DNA ladders were detected in the floating cells after treatment with NaBT at 72 and 96 h as shown in Fig. 1 A, and we could not clearly observe DNA ladders in the attached cells. Thus, NaBT induced apoptosis in the Caco-2 cell characterized by the detachment of cells from the dishes and the presence of cells floating in the media. These observations and conclusions are consistent with the previous reports (16Hague A. Manning A.M. Hanlon K.A. Huschtscha L.I. Hart D. Paraskeva C. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 21Augeron C. Laboissse C.L. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 3961-3969PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hague A. Elder D.J.E. Hicks D.J. Paraskeva C.

The alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of cell differentiation (24Matsumoto H. Erickson R.H. Gum J.R. Yoshioka M. Gum E. Kim Y. Gastroenterology. 1990; 98: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), was clearly increased in the attached cells by the NaBT treatment (Fig. 1 B). At 24 h, FBS-treated cells showed means 8.7 ± 1.4 S.E. units/0.1 mg protein, and NaBT-treated cells showed 16.2 ± 2.8 S.E. units/0.1 mg protein. The difference of alkaline phosphatase activity was clearer at 48 h between FBS and NaBT-conditioned cells, 10.4 ± 0.8 S.E. units/0.1 mg protein and 133.6 ± 13.4 S.E. units/0.1 mg protein, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase activity was increased with increasing time of exposure to NaBT, indicating an increase in cell differentiation. Thus, NaBT induced both cell differentiation and apoptosis in Caco-2 cells. The expression of Cox-l, Cox-2, and 15-LO was determined during NaBT-induced apoptosis and cell differentiation. RNA was prepared from both attached and floating cells. However, because the floating cells had undergone apoptosis, RNA was degraded; thus, expression could only be determined in intact attached cells. Total RNA (30 μg) was prepared from FBS-cultured cells as the normal culture condition and from cells cultured with 5 mm NaBT for 72 h. The results for the expression of three oxygenases by Northern analysis are shown in Fig. 2. Little or no expression of Cox-1 and 15-LO was observed, but high expression of Cox-2 was detected, which is in agreement with a previous report by Kutcheraet al. (6Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. White R.L. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4816-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). NaBT treatment did not increase Cox-1 expression. In Caco-2 cells, NaBT down-regulated the expression of Cox-2 also seen in Fig. 2. Treatment of the cells with NaBT resulted in the expression of a 15-LO. Although we investigated the expression of 15-LO in the other four different colorectal carcinoma cell lines, the expression of 15-LO was not observed in any cells cultured in FBS (data not shown). The RNA obtained from normal human tracheobronchial epithelial cells treated with retinoic acid was used as positive control for expression of 15-LO (25Hill E. Eling T. Nettesheim P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Northern and immunoblot analysis was used to evaluate the time course for Cox-2 and 15-LO expression during NaBT induction of apoptosis and cell differentiation. RNAs were extracted and assessed from cells attached to the dish at 11 points of time during treatment. Surviving cells, cells treated with NaBT for 96 h then fed for about 7 days until confluent with FBS containing media, were included. NaBT-treated cells continued to express Cox-2 with a decreasing level of expression observed from 10 h to 48 h of exposure (Fig. 3 A). No expression of 15-LO at the earliest times of NaBT treatment was observed, but at 6 h a band of 2.7 kb, which hybridized to the human 15-LO probe, was detected. The 15-LO expression increased until 96 h. However, the surviving cells, which were again cultured in serum after 96 h of NaBT treatment, showed no expression of 15-LO. The cultured cells under identical conditions except for NaBT showed Cox-2 expression but no expression of 15-LO at all times (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis was used to confirm the expression of Cox-2 and 15-LO in control and NaBT-treated cells (Fig. 3 B). Protein expression could only be determined in attached cells; the protein was degraded in the apoptotic floating cells. Cox-2 protein was detected in the FBS-cultured cells at all time points examined, and the surviving cells also expressed similar amounts of Cox-2. Furthermore, Cox-2 expression was decreased by NaBT induction, a result that is consistent with the Northern data. We did not observe any protein that reacts to the human 15-LO antibody in the cells grown in FBS. In contrast, treatment with NaBT increased the expression of 15-LO protein. We began to detect expression of 15-LO between 6 and 14 h after treatment with NaBT. After 24–48 h, significant expression of 15-LO was observed. Taken together, these results support the conclusion for the expression of 15-LO during NaBT-induced cell differentiation and apoptosis in Caco-2 cells. To study arachidonic acid metabolism, NaBT-treated cells and FBS-cultured cells were sonicated, and proteins were estimated. The lysates, 0.8 mg of protein, were then incubated with exogenous [3H]arachidonic acid (3 μCi; 25 μm) for 30 min. Reverse-phase HPLC analysis of the extracts is shown in Fig.4. For FBS-treated cells, PGE2 (retention time 20∼23 min) and prostaglandin F2α (retention time 23∼29 min) were the major metabolites, and HETE (retention time 72∼78 min) was the minor metabolite (Fig. 4 A). The formation of the metabolites was inhibited by indomethacin (5 μm), indicating metabolism by Cox-2 activity (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, NaBT-treated cells showed a significant increase in the formation of 15-HETE (retention time 73∼76 min) and moderate formation of PGE2 (Fig.4 C). Moreover, the formation of the PGE2 was inhibited by 5 μm of indomethacin, but the formation of 15-HETE peak was not inhibited (Fig. 4 D), indicating metabolism by both Cox-2 and 15-LO, respectively. The 15-HETE metabolite also coeluted with standard on reverse-phase HPLC and had a UV absorption at 234 nm (data not shown). These results confirm the expression of an active 15-LO and expression of the level of transcription and translation. Linoleic acid is an excellent substrate for the human reticulocyte 15-LO (10Soberman R.J. Harper T.W. Betteridge D. Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. J. Biol.

(i) The pharmacological profile for CaR agonist-induced inhibition of PTH secretion is essentially identical to that for the cloned CaR (1Brown E.M. Pollak M. Seidman C.E. Seidman C.E. Chu Y.W.

(ii) Inactivating CaR mutations in the heterozygous and homozygous states causes mild and severe increases in PTH secretion, respectively, in the hypercalcemic disorders, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (1Brown E.M.

(iii) Hyperplastic and adenomatous parathyroid glands frequently exhibit an increased set-point for PTH secretion (the level of Ca2+o half-maximally inhibiting hormonal release). CaR immunostaining in parathyroid adenomas and in hyperplastic parathyroid glands from patients with severe uremic hyperparathyroidism is reduced relative to that in normal parathyroid glands (10Gogusev J.

(iv) The CaR agonist, R-568, effectively inhibits PTH secretion and reduces Ca2+o in hyperparathyroid patients (12Fox J. Petty B.A. Nemeth E.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8 (abstr.): S181Google Scholar). (v) The loss of high Ca2+o-evoked inhibition of PTH secretion in cultured bovine parathyroid cells correlates closely with the concomitant decreases in CaR mRNA and protein expression (13Mithal A.

The CaR couples to several signal transduction pathways. In parathyroid cells, the activated CaR stimulates phospholipase C with subsequent increases of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, 1,2-sn-diacyl-glycerol, and the cytosolic calcium concentration (Ca2+i) (2Brown E.M. Bilezikian J.P. Levine M.A. Marcus R. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 15-54Google Scholar, 3Brown E.M. Physiol.

High Ca2+o-elicited phospholipase C stimulation involves a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein, probably Gq/11, both of which are expressed in bovine parathyroid (15Varrault A. Rodriguez-Pena M.S. Goldsmith P.K. Mithal A. Brown E.M. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4390-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two other phospholipases, phospholipases A2 and D, are also CaR-activated (14Kifor O. Diaz R. Butters R. Brown E.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, the CaR controls multiple signaling pathways (1Brown E.M. Pollak M. Seidman C.E. Seidman C.E. Chu Y.W. Riccardi D Hebert S.C. N. Engl. J.

The signal transduction pathway(s) underlying CaR-mediated inhibition of PTH secretion has not been well characterized. Inhibition of PTH release correlates with rises in Ca2+i, a known stimulator of secretion in other cells. Changes in Ca2+i, cAMP, and arachidonic acid metabolites have been invoked in CaR-mediated inhibition of PTH secretion (1Brown E.M. Pollak M. Seidman C.E. Seidman C.E. Chu Y.W. Riccardi D Hebert S.C.

Res. 1997; 12: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar); however, their relative importance has not been well established. Parathyroid chief cells contain alkaline phosphatase (AP) within their apicolateral domains (16Wild P. Schraner E.M.

We now show that parathyroid cells express caveolin at high concentrations and that the CaR colocalizes with caveolin in caveolin-enriched membrane fractions. These domains are also enriched in GPI-anchored AP and contain several signaling proteins (Gq/11, eNOS, as well as PKCα, δ, and ζ). Moreover, high Ca2+o increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin and of caveolin-enriched fractions. Thus, our results suggest that CaR-mediated signal recognition and transduction in parathyroid cells, potentially including the poorly understood inverse control of PTH secretion by Ca2+o, take place in caveolin-enriched plasma membrane domains. Anti-PKCδ antibody, Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors were from Boehringer Mannheim. The Renaissance kit was purchased from DuPont-NEN. Anti-PKCα, -γ, and -ζ antibodies and a kit containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt (BCIP) and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) were from Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal and polyclonal anti-caveolin, anti-eNOS, and anti-PKCα and -ζ antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-Gαq/11 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Armen H. Tashjian, Jr. (Harvard School of Public Health, Boston MA). CaR-specific antisera were raised in rabbits against peptides based on the CaR sequence (antiserum 4637 (FF7) to amino acids 345–359 and antiserum 4641 to amino acids 215–237) of the bovine parathyroid CaR. Both were generous gifts of NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT). Octyl glucoside and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Sigma). Dispersed bovine parathyroid cells were prepared by collagenase and DNase digestion as previously described (42Brown E.M. Hurwitz S. Aurbach G.D. Endocrinology. 1976; 99: 1582-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Cells were used immediately as acutely dispersed cells or were cultured overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 medium with penicillin and streptomycin. Cell culture medium was then aspirated, and the cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mmCa2+o, 0.5 mmMg2+o, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (“standard medium”) and subsequently incubated with varying levels of Ca2+o in standard medium as described below. Frozen sections of bovine parathyroid gland (5-μm thickness) were air dried and fixed for 5 min with freshly prepared 2% formaldehyde in PBS. After treatment with an endogenous peroxidase inhibitor (DAKO Corp., Carpenteria, CA), the slides were blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Immunostaining was performed by sequential application of primary antibody (e.g. mouse anti-caveolin-1) and secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG) in blocking solution and then use of the DAKO AEC substrate system as described before (11Kifor O.

Alkaline phosphatase activity was demonstrated by direct staining of the slides with the NBT/BCIP kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Photomicrographs were taken with 10× and 100× objectives. Bovine parathyroid gland CEMF were isolated using two OptiPrep density gradients as described by Smart et al. (26Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The glands (7–8 μg total protein) (26Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C.

We first isolated plasma membranes (PM) by Percoll gradient fractionation. After removal of nuclei and cell debris by low speed centrifugation, the postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was layered onto 30% Percoll and sedimented at 84,000 × g for 30 min. The alkaline phosphatase-positive plasma membrane fraction was then disrupted by sonication. Caveolar membrane was separated from the remainder of the plasma membrane using two OptiPrep density gradients. The sonicated plasma membrane fractions were suspended in 23% OptiPrep and applied below a 20–10% OptiPrep gradient (OptiPrep 1) and sedimented at 52,000 × g for 90 min (26Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). After determining alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity and protein content, each sample from the first OptiPrep gradient was concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and analyzed by Western blot analysis as described below, or the top six AP-positive fractions were pooled and applied to a discontinuous flotation gradient (OptiPrep 2) to concentrate the caveolar membranes (26Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed as before (11Kifor O.

Briefly, proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) according to Laemmli (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) or on linear 5–12% SDS gradient gels. The separated proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell), incubated with blocking solution (PBS with 0.25% Triton X-100 and 5% dry milk or 3% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated for 1–3 h with primary and subsequently secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution, and finally developed with the Renaissance ECL system as described by the manufacturer. Protein concentrations were measured using the Micro BCA protein reagent kit (Pierce) or the Bio-Rad DC assay (11Kifor O. Moore F.D. Wang P. Goldstein M. Vassilev P. Kifor I. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M.

Parathyroid cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, protease inhibitors (as described above), and the following detergents: 60 mm octyl glucoside, 1% Triton X-100 (28Chun M.

The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and precleared with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia) for 30 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of protein (150 μg of total cell lysate) were incubated with 5–10 μg of monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal antibodies for 1 h, followed by addition of anti-mouse IgG for 30 min (if monoclonal antibody was used). Protein A-Sepharose beads were then added for a further 1 h at 4 °C. Bound immune complexes were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and detergents. The pellet was eluted by boiling for 5 min with 2 × Laemmli sample buffer (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Supernatant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as above, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibody. 2 μl of each fraction from the OptiPrep gradient were spotted on nitrocellulose filter and developed using the AP substrate kit (NBT/BCIP). After development, the reaction was stopped by washing the filter with distilled water. Frozen sections of bovine parathyroid glands stained for alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig.1, A and C) show abundant punctate deposition of the insoluble reaction product solely on the surface of parathyroid chief cells, with little or no AP activity on endothelial cells (Fig. 1 A). To determine if caveolin is present in parathyroid cells, we initially performed immunohistochemical analyses of bovine parathyroid glands. Fig. 1,B and D show the localization of caveolin-1 immunoreactivity on the plasma membrane of parathyroid chief cells and endothelial cells. Punctate staining for caveolin-1 was clearly observed on the cell surface at higher magnification. There was no staining after replacement of the first antibody with an equivalent dilution of mouse IgG (data not shown). To determine whether the CaR is present in CEMF, bovine parathyroid glands were homogenized and fractionated using"

These SDKs were previously shown to phosphorylate endogenous 14-3-3 proteins (Megidish, T., White, T., Takio, K., Titani, K., Igarashi, Y., and Hakomori, S. (1995) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 216, 739–747). We have now partially purified one SDK, termed SDK1, from cytosol of mouse Balb/c 3T3(A31) fibroblasts. SDK1 is a serine kinase with molecular mass 50–60 kDa that is strongly activated byN,N′-dimethylsphingosine and sphingosine, but not by ceramide, sphingosine 1-phosphate, or other sphingo-, phospho-, or glycerolipids tested. Its activity is inhibited by the protein kinase C activator phosphatidylserine. Activity of SDK1 is clearly distinct from other types of serine kinases tested, including casein kinase II, the α and ζ isoforms of protein kinase C, extracellular signal-regulated mitogene-activated protein kinase 1 (Erk-1), Erk-2, and Raf-1. SDK1 specifically phosphorylates certain isoforms of 14-3-3 (η, β, ζ) but not others (ς, τ). The phosphorylation site was identified as Ser* in the sequence Arg-Arg-Ser-Ser*-Trp-Arg in 14-3-3 β. The ς and τ isoforms of 14-3-3 lack serine at this position, potentially explaining their lack of phosphorylation by SDK1. Interestingly, the phosphorylation site is located on the dimer interface of 14-3-3. Phosphorylation of this site by SDK1 was studied in 14-3-3 mutants. Mutation of a lysine residue, located 9 amino acids N-terminal to the phosphorylation site, abolished 14-3-3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate an association between an SDK and 14-3-3 in situ. Exogenous N,N′-dimethylsphingosine stimulates 14-3-3 phosphorylation in Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts, suggesting that SDK1 may phosphorylate 14-3-3 in situ. These data support a biological role of SDK1 activation and consequent phosphorylation of specific 14-3-3 isoforms that regulate signal transduction. In view of the three-dimensional structure of 14-3-3, it is likely that phosphorylation by SDK1 would alter dimerization of 14-3-3, and/or induce conformational changes that alter 14-3-3 association with other kinases involved in signal transduction.

Sph has been suggested as a second messenger, since its low level is increased upon stimulation of cells. Agonists such as platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factor, cause activation of ceramidase, an enzyme that converts ceramide to Sph and fatty acids, resulting in an increase in Sph levels (2Spiegel S.

Phorbol ester treatment of HL60 cells causes a 3-fold increase in Sph levels detected by chemical method (14Ohta H. Sweeney E.A. Masamune A. Yatomi Y. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar). DMS is generated from Sph by an enzyme present in mouse brain (15Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 1411-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and mass spectrometric analysis indicated that DMS is a minor component relative to Sph in HL60 cell extract; these findings suggest a physiological significance for both Sph and DMS (16Mano N. Oda Y. Yamada K. Asakawa N. Katayama K. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).

Sph also induces prominent phosphorylation of multiple endogenous proteins with molecular mass 18–165 kDa in Jurkat cell extracts, suggesting the existence of multiple substrates for Sph-activated kinases (20Pushkareva M.Yu. Khan W.A. Alessenko A.V. Sahyoun N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15246-15251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar phosphorylation of multiple proteins occurs in the presence of Sph or DMS in both cytosolic and membrane extracts of mouse Balb/c 3T3(A31) fibroblasts (21Megidish T. White T. Takio K. Titani K. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is not stimulated by other lipids indicating existence of specific protein kinases highly activated by Sph or DMS, but not by ceramide, sphingosine 1-phosphate (Sph-1-P), or various other sphingolipids, phospholipids, and glycerolipids. Protein kinases activated by Sph and DMS are termed “sphingosine-dependent protein kinases” (SDKs). However, the number, identities, and substrates of these SDKs are unclear. Using amino acid sequencing, we have identified several cellular proteins that are phosphorylated in vitro by SDKs including the 14-3-3 isoforms β, ζ, and τ (21Megidish T. White T. Takio K. Titani K. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins comprise a family with a remarkable evolutionary conservation extending to lower eukaryotes and plants. There are seven distinct mammalian isoforms (β, γ, ε, ζ, η, τ, and ς). 14-3-3 isoforms appear to modulate a large variety of functional proteins and enzymes, including lipid-activated kinases (22Hunter T.

Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins are thought to function as adaptor proteins that allow interaction between signaling proteins that do not associate directly with each other (25Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The association of 14-3-3 with different kinases in cytosol and membrane may contribute to kinases activation during intracellular signaling (28Morrison D. Science. 1994; 266: 56-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 29Xing H. Kornfeld K. Muslin A.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factor induce association of 14-3-3 with the death agonist BAD, preventing its interaction with the membrane bound death agonist, BCL-XL, and contributing to cell survival (30Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar). These agonists also increase Sph level, suggesting a link between 14-3-3 and Sph signaling. The diverse effects of Sph and its derivatives on cell cycle progression, cell death, and mitogenesis, and the similarity between Sph biological effects and 14-3-3 protein functions, suggest that SDKs mediate the biological role of Sph through 14-3-3 phosphorylation. Here we report purification of one type of cytosolic SDK (SDK1) which phosphorylates only certain isoforms (β, η, and ζ) but not other isoforms (ς and τ) of 14-3-3, or other proteins known to be substrates of other SDKs. We also identified the site at which SDK1 phosphorylates 14-3-3. Although the physiological significance of 14-3-3 phosphorylation is unknown, there is an interesting possibility that activation of SDK1 and consequent phosphorylation of 14-3-3, in combination with an increase in the intracellular levels of Sph or DMS, promotes or inhibits 14-3-3 dimerization, through which 14-3-3 activity is regulated. d-erythro-Sph (31Radunz H.-E.

T-Mat film (used for most experiments) and Bio-Max film (used for identification of phosphorylation site) were from Kodak (Tukwila, WA). Polyclonal Abs PAN specific to all 14-3-3 isoforms (catalog number sc-629), 14-3-3 ζ (catalog number sc-1019), 14-3-3 τ (catalog number 732), extracellular signal-regulated mitogene-activated protein kinase (Erk-1), and Erk-2 Abs were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Raf-1 Ab was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Ab to CKII was a generous gift from Dr. E. Krebs (University of Washington). Calreticulin was a generous gift from Dr. A. Helenius (Yale University). Confluent fibroblasts treated with TPA under serum-free conditions were used for purification of SDK1 from cytosolic extracts, since intracellular Sph level was increased while PKC activity was reduced under these growth conditions (33Rodriguez-Pena A. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 34Lavie Y. Blusztajn J.K. Liscovitch M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mouse Balb/c 3T3(A31) cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air, at 37 °C. Number of passages was limited to five. Cells (5 × 105) were plated on 150-mm dishes, cultured for 6–8 days until confluence, washed 3 × with serum-free DMEM, incubated in the same medium for 3 h and then in DMEM containing 200 nm TPA in 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide for 3–4 h. Next, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+, harvested, and kept frozen at −80 °C until utilized for enzyme purification. All purification procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C, and buffers used were filtered through membrane and degassed under vacuum immediately prior to column chromatography. The following buffer systems were used. Buffer A consisted of 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.5), 1 mm EDTA. Buffer B was Buffer A plus 10 mm DTT, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml AEBSF. Buffer C was Buffer A plus 10 mm DTT, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 m KCl. Buffer D consisted of Buffer A with pH adjusted to 5.8–6.0, plus 10 mm DTT, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.2%n-octyl-β-glucoside. Buffer E was Buffer D with pH adjusted to 7.5 and Buffer F consisted of Buffer E plus 100 mm NaCl. Aliquots of packed frozen cells (2.5 ml, 100 mg) were thawed on ice and suspended in 45 ml of homogenizing buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 12 mmsodium fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mg/ml AEBSF, and 5% glycerol. Homogenization was performed by 40 strokes in an ice-cooled, tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × gfor 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. The supernatant (cytosol) was subjected to further purification of SDK1, and activity was tested as described under “Standard SDK1 Activity Assay.” 45 ml of cytosolic fraction was mixed with 2.5 ml of 10% Triton X-100, agitated at 4 °C for 1 h, and immediately loaded on a Q-Sepharose column (1 × 10.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with Buffer B and washed with 4 volumes of Buffer B. In order to separate SDK1 activity from other kinases, proteins were then eluted by a combination of stepwise changes and linear gradient changes of NaCl concentration (0 to 1.0m), as indicated by a dotted line in Fig.1 A. The linear gradients were from 0 to 0.2 mNaCl for 15 min, 0.2–0.35 m for 85 min, constant at 0.35m for 33 min, 0.35–1 m for 24 min, and finally constant at 1 m for 18 min. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 1.5-ml fractions were collected and subjected to standard SDK1 assay. Fractions containing SDK1 activity were pooled and dialyzed 4–6 h against 4 liters of Buffer A containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. A phenyl-Sepharose column was pre-equilibrated with Buffer C. KCl (final concentration 1 m) was added to the pooled fractions showing SDK1 activity at step 2 (after Q-Sepharose column chromatography). The pooled fractions were loaded on the phenyl-Sepharose column in Buffer C and washed with 4 column volumes of Buffer C. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min by decreasing KCl. The concentration was decreased from 1 to 0.5m for 20 min, maintained at 0.5 m for 14 min, decreased from 0.5 to 0 m for 56 min (Fig. 1 C), and 1-ml fractions were collected. Flow-through (FT) (unbound) fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 4 liters of Buffer A containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol for at least 6 h. Dialyzed FT and bound phenyl-Sepharose fractions (diluted 4 times in buffer D) were passed separately through Mono-S column. SDK1 activity from both pools was eluted in FT fraction, and minimal SDK1 activity was bound to Mono-S. Mono-S FT fractions of both pools were subjected to Mono-Q ion-exchange chromatography. A Mono-Q (HR 5/5) column was equilibrated with buffer E, and proteins were loaded at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 6 ml of buffer E. In order to separate SDK1 activity from major PKC activity, elution was performed by applying a combined stepwise and linear gradient of NaCl (0 to 1.0 m) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min as indicated by the dotted line in Fig.1 D. The linear gradients were from 0 to 0.2 mNaCl for 10 min, constant at 0.2 m for 10 min, from 0.2 to 0.35 m for 30 min, constant at 0.35 m for 20 min, from 0.35 to 1 m for 10 min, and finally constant at 1m for 10 min. Fractions (0.65 ml) were collected, and active fractions were pooled. Data obtained from the phenyl-Sepharose-bound pool is shown in Fig. 1 D. A similar pattern was obtained from the phenyl-Sepharose-unbound pool (data not shown). In order to estimate the Mr of SDK1, a sample (0.5 ml) obtained from a Mono-Q column of phenyl-Sepharose-unbound pool was analyzed by gel filtration. The Sephacryl S-200 column (1 × 30 cm; total column volume 22.5 ml) was equilibrated with Buffer F. The sample was loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 3 min and eluted at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Standard SDK1 assay was performed, except that reactions were for 30 min in the presence of 1 μm ATP (1.4 × 105 cpm/pmol). Gel filtration protein standards β-amylase (200 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochromec (12.4 kDa) were fractionated immediately after SDK1 fractionation, and the Mr of SDK1 was estimated (Fig. 1 E). Sph and DMS both activate SDK1; however, DMS was used for detection of SDK1 activity during purification since it cannot be metabolized to either ceramide or Sph-1-P. SDK1 activity during purification was estimated by standard assay utilizing 0.1 μg of 14-3-3 β and 100 μm DMS in 0.5% octyl-β-glucoside. SDK1 activity required Mg2+ with optimal concentration of 15 mm (Mn was ineffective), and decreased as ionic strength increased. An IC50 of 150 mm NaCl was defined at purification steps 2 and 3. The total reaction volume of the standard assay system was 30 μl, i.e. 20 μl of substrate/kinase/sphingolipid mixture and 10 μl of ATP solution. The mixture contained 5- or 10-μl kinase fractions eluted from column chromatography (containing 5.0–0.02 μg of protein), 3 μl of 14-3-3 (1 μg of 14-3-3 in 50 mm Tris), 3 μl of 30 mm DTT, 6 or 1 μl of 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5), and 3 μl of DMS (1 mm DMS in 5% octyl-β-glucoside) or vehicle (5% octyl-β-glucoside) alone. The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 μl of ATP solution consisting of 75 μm ATP, 45 mm magnesium acetate, and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of 10 μl of 4 × concentrated Laemmli's SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating at 100 °C for 10 min. Phosphorylation reactions were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (0.1%) in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid, destained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography for 1–24 h. Control assays were made using reaction without DMS, 14-3-3 substrate, or kinase. The 28-kDa band was excised and the amount of 32P incorporated into the 14-3-3 (28 kDa) substrate was determined by scintillation counting. SDK1 activity was calculated from the amount of32P incorporated into the substrate, taking into account the specific activity of the radioisotope and reaction time. Values obtained from gel without phosphorylated protein (blank) were subtracted from each determination. The substrate specificity of SDK1 toward 14-3-3 isoforms, 14-3-3 mutants, and other SDK substrates (PDI, calreticulin) were tested in the presence of 120 nm protein. Other lipids and vehicles were used as indicated in the figure legends. Kinetics of SDK1 activity were determined as explained in the Fig. 5, A and B. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation was estimated in order to determine how many moles of phosphate are incorporated in 1 mol of 14-3-3. The phosphorylation reactions were scaled up from 30 to 150 μl and assayed as above, except that 50 μl of purified SDK1, 2 μg of 14-3-3 ζ, and 500 μm ATP with specific activity of 7000 cpm/pmol were incubated for 4 h. To prevent depletion of the reaction components, 40 μl of mixture containing the same proportion of SDK1, DMS, DTT, and ATP as above was added after the first 2 h. The Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent PKC activities present in cytosolic extract (5 μg) or fractions yielded from column chromatography (5 μl) were assayed by a modification of the method described previously (35Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10039-10043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a PKC assay kit (Amersham), that utilizes PKC-specific substrate (synthetic peptide MBP4–14) which is phosphorylated with the labeled phosphate group from [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were performed in the presence of kinase fraction and substrate, and in the presence or absence of kinase cofactors Ca2+ and PS/TPA. Samples (5 μl) were incubated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 90 μm peptide, 3 mm DTT, 1 mmCaCl2, l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (PS) dispersed in 0.3% Triton X-100 (8 mol % of Triton X-100), 2 μg/ml TPA, 15 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 μm ATP (containing 0.2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) at 30 °C. After a 10-min reaction at 30 °C, radiolabeled peptide was separated from unincorporated32P by binding to affinity phosphocellulose paper. Degree of phosphorylation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Enzyme activity was calculated from the amount of 32P incorporated into the peptide, taking into account radioisotope specific activity and reaction time. CKII activity present in cytosolic extract (5 μl) or fractions yielded from column chromatography was assayed by a modification of the method described previously (36Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Piening C. Sommercorn J. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7638-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a CKII assay kit (Amersham) with CKII specific substrate, a synthetic peptide. Samples (5 μl) were incubated in the presence of 250 μm peptide and 150 mm NaCl in 16 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), and reactions were initiated by addition of a mixture of 200 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 10 mm HEPES pH 7.5. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, radiolabeled peptide was separated from unincorporated 32P by binding to affinity phosphocellulose paper. The peptide KNVVGARRSSWRVITT was synthesized by the Fmoc/PyBop method in 15 μmol scale utilizing a Shimadzu PSSM-8 synthesizer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). Generated peptides were purified by preparative reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column (20 × 250 mm, Nakarai Tesque, Japan) at a flow rate of 10 ml/min, with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0 to 60% for 45 min) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, utilizing a Gilson auto-LC system (France). Purity and authenticity of the peptide was checked by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (ESI voltage −4.3 kV, scan rangem/z 500–3000/3 s) utilizing a triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer combined with ESI model bTSQ-700 (Thermo Quest Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Molecular ion m/z 1830 was detected together with additional sodium ion. This work was performed by Kimie Murayama and Tsutomu Fujimura, Central Laboratory of Medical Sciences, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Japan. One μg of 14-3-3 β was phosphorylated by SDK1 as described under “Standard SDK1 Activity Assay,” except that the specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP was 6.6 × 105cpm/pmol. Reactions were continued for 90 min, and the products were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to NC"

Specific binding and transcytosis were demonstrated for serotypes A and B in intestinal cells. Using serotype A as an example, the rate of transcytosis by T-84 cells was determined in both apical to basolateral (11.34 fmol/h/cm2) as well as basolateral to apical (8.98 fmol/h/cm2) directions, and by Caco-2 cells in the apical to basolateral (8.42 fmol/h/cm2) direction. Serotype A retained intact di-chain structure during transit through T-84 or Caco-2 cells, and when released on the basolateral side was toxicin vivo to mice and in vitro on mouse phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparations. Serotype C and tetanus toxin did not bind effectively to T-84 cells, nor were they efficiently transcytosed (8–10% of serotype A). MDCK cells did not bind or efficiently transcytose (0.32 fmol/h/cm2) botulinum toxin. Further characterization demonstrated that the rate of transcytosis for serotype A in T-84 cells was increased 66% when vesicle sorting was disrupted by 5 μm brefeldin A, decreased 42% when microtubules were disrupted by 10 μm nocodazole, and decreased 74% at 18 °C. Drugs that antagonize toxin action at the nerve terminal, such as bafilomycin A1 (which prevents acidification of endosomes) and methylamine HCl (which neutralizes acidification of endosomes), produced only a modest inhibitory effect on the rate of transcytosis (17–22%). These results may provide an explanation for the mechanism by which botulinum toxin escapes the human gastrointestinal tract, and they may also explain why specific serotypes cause human disease and others do not.

Thus, most cases of intoxication are due to ingestion of food contaminated with preformed toxin or ingestion of food contaminated with bacteria that can produce toxin in the gut. In either case, BoNT escapes the gastrointestinal system to reach the general circulation (lymph and blood). Toxin in the blood is then distributed to peripheral cholinergic nerve endings, which are the target cells for toxin action. botulinum neurotoxin serotype A human colon adenocarcinoma Madin-Darby canine kidney human colon carcinoma. There is now a substantial literature describing the cellular, subcellular, and even molecular aspects of toxin action on cholinergic cells (5Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Mol.

Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 195: 257-274PubMed Google Scholar). This literature derives from a model that envisions the toxin proceeding through three major steps (2, 10Simpson L.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1980; 212: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar, 11Simpson L.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1981; 33: 155-188PubMed Google Scholar, 12Simpson L.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

During the first step, the toxin binds to receptors that are highly localized in the junctional region of cholinergic cells. The toxin molecule, which is composed of a heavy chain (Mr ∼100,000) and a light chain (Mr ∼50,000) linked by a disulfide bond, is thought to rely on the carboxyl terminus of the heavy chain to associate with cells. During the second step, the toxin is productively internalized by vulnerable cells. This process is actually a sequence of two events: 1) penetration of the plasma membrane by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and 2) penetration of the endosome membrane by pH-induced translocation. Although there is much that remains to be determined about productive internalization, there is suggestive evidence that the amino terminus of the heavy chain plays an important role in this process. During the third and final step in toxin action, the light chain that reaches the cytosol acts as a zinc-dependent endoprotease to cleave polypeptides that are essential for exocytosis (6Jahn R. Hanson P.I. Otto H. Ahnert H.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Rossetto O. Deloye F. Poulain B. Pellizzari R. Schiavo G.

Immunol. 1995; 195: 257-274PubMed Google Scholar). Blockade of exocytosis leads to the failure of neuromuscular transmission that is characteristic of botulism. In contrast to our knowledge of events at the nerve ending, very little is known about the cellular and subcellular events that account for the ability of the toxin to cross membranes in the gastrointestinal system (14Lamanna C. Hillowalla R.A. Alling C.C. J. Infect. Dis. 1967; 117: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Sugii S. Ohishi I. Sakaguchi G. Infect. Immun. 1977; 17: 491-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bonventre P.F. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1979; 1: 663-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Those data that are available suggest that the mouth is the least effective site of absorption, the stomach is intermediate, and the intestine is the most effective site of absorption. There are no studies that actually demonstrate a mechanism for botulinum toxin penetration of gut cells. However, there is one self-evident matter that can be deduced. The series of steps that underlie toxin movement at the level of individual gut cells cannot be identical to the steps that underlie toxin movement in individual nerve cells. If BoNT were to enter and remain inside cells in the gastrointestinal system, this would prevent it from reaching peripheral cholinergic nerve endings. Thus, there must be fundamental differences that distinguish toxin movement across gastrointestinal membranes and movement across neuronal membranes. There are two broad categories of toxin transport that could account for movement from the gastrointestinal system to the general circulation. As proposed by Bonventre (16Bonventre P.F. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1979; 1: 663-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), transport could involve a specific, receptor-mediated mechanism or a nonspecific mechanism. In the present study, work has been done to test the hypothesis that BoNT crosses the gut wall by the process of specific binding and transcytosis. According to this hypothesis, there should be little or no pH-induced translocation of toxin molecules across intracellular membranes. Instead, this hypothesis requires that toxin bound on the lumenal side of cells must be delivered to the serosal side of cells, and furthermore the transcytosed toxin must be in a conformation that can act upon cholinergic nerves. This hypothesis has been tested by studying the binding, movement, and residual toxicity of BoNT type A (BoNT/A) added to a human epithelial cell line of gut origin (T-84). The resulting data provide the first insights into the cellular and subcellular events that account for toxin movement from the gastrointestinal system to the general circulation.

Swiss-Webster mice (female, 20–25 g), which were purchased from Ace Animals (Boyertown, PA), were housed in an American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited animal colony and allowed unrestricted access to food and water. All procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. T-84 cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 g/liter d-glucose) and Ham's F-12 nutrient medium supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 8 μg/ml ampicillin, and 15 mm Hepes. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 6% CO2. T-84 cells were fed every 3 days and passaged (1:2) when 95% confluent, approximately every 6 days. Passages 55 through 76 were used for experiments described in this report. Caco-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/liter d-glucose) supplemented with 15% newborn calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 15 mm Hepes. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 6% CO2. Caco-2 cells were fed every 2 days and passaged (1:2 split ratio) when 95% confluent, approximately every 6 days. Passages 20 through 29 were used for experiments described in this report. MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/liter d-glucose) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 25 mm Hepes. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 6% CO2. MDCK cells were fed every 3 days and passaged (1:5) when 95% confluent, approximately every 3 days. Passages 56 through 75 were used for experiments described in this report. To control for membrane integrity and to estimate diffusion between cells, the rate of passage of [3H]inulin from the upper to the lower reservoir was determined essentially as described previously (20Madara J.L. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). According to this procedure, the medium in both reservoirs contained unlabeled 1 mm inulin. The assay was initiated by addition of [3H]inulin to the upper reservoir. Rates for inulin flux from the upper to the lower wells were determined for 2, 6, or 20 h. To control for nonspecific effects that might be caused by prolonged incubation of cells with toxin, inulin flux experiments were repeated on cultures that had been preincubated with 1 × 10−8m BoNT/A for 18 h. As an additional control for membrane integrity, each transwell was checked for leakage at the end of each experiment. For this purpose, medium was added to the upper chamber but not the lower chamber. The Transwell® apparatus was returned to the incubator at 37 °C, and evidence of fluid accumulation in the lower reservoir was monitored for 6 h. Leakage seldom occurred (<5% of wells); when there was leakage, the data from these wells were not included in the final analysis. BoNT/A, B, and C, and tetanus toxin, as well as toxin-associated proteins such as the hemagglutinins, were iodinated using 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent (NEN Life Science Products) essentially according to manufacturer's instructions. The reaction time was reduced in order to diminish the loss of toxicity of the resulting product. The toxins were labeled to an average specific activity of 500 Ci/mmol with a residual toxicity of greater than 90% (21Simpson L.L. Coffield J.A. Bakry N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 267: 720-727PubMed Google Scholar, 22Simpson L.L. Coffield J.A. Bakry N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 1994; 269: 256-262PubMed Google Scholar, 23Coffield J.A. Bakry N. Zhang R.D. Carlson J.

Pure neurotoxin (250 μg) in borate buffer (pH 7.8, 200 μl) was added to dried, iodinated ester and reacted on ice for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 50 μl of 1m glycine in borate buffer for 5 min. The total reaction mixture (250 μl) and rinse (250 μl) were loaded onto a Sepahadex G-25 column that was preequilibrated with filtration buffer (150 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% gelatin, pH 7.4). The labeled toxin was eluted with filtration buffer, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. An aliquot (5 μl) of each fraction was assayed for radioactivity. The labeled toxin peak, which eluted at void volume, was pooled and stored at 3 °C. Toxin concentration in the pooled fraction was determined spectrophotometrically at 278 nm using the following relationship, 1.63A278 = 1 mg/ml (18DasGupta B.R. Sathyamoorthy V. Toxicon. 1984; 22: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A portion of this sample was counted in a γ-counter to ascertain the number of counts (disintegrations/min) present. Sample concentration and associated counts were used to calculate specific activity. Cells were grown, differentiated, and induced to polarize as described above. Cells were rinsed three times and then incubated in mammalian Ringers solution with 10 mmHEPES and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. The cells were slowly (∼2 h) cooled to 3 °C. The buffer in the upper well was replaced with cold buffer (3 °C) containing 125I-BoNT, with or without a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled toxin. The cells were incubated at 3 °C for 3 h to allow sufficient time to reach equilibrium, after which cells and membranes were washed 3 times with Hanks' balanced salt soluiton plus 10 mm HEPES with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Membranes were then cut out of the Transwell® holders and placed in a γ-counter. At least three replicates per condition were included. For assay of botulinum neurotoxin transcytosis, cells were grown in Transwell® porous bottom dishes on polycarbonate membranes with a 0.4 μm pore size. The growth area within each insert was 1 cm2. Prior to being seeded with cells, the Transwells were coated with 10 μg/cm2 rat tail collagen type I. Briefly, rat tail collagen stock solution (6.7 mg/ml) was prepared in sterile 1% acetic acid and stored at 3 °C. The stock solution was diluted in acidified 60% ethyl alcohol, as needed, and 150 μl containing 10 μg of diluted collagen were added to each well. The coated wells were allowed to dry at room temperature overnight (18 h). After drying, the wells were sterilized under UV light for 1 h, followed by a preincubation with cell culture medium (30 min). The preincubation medium was removed immediately prior to addition of cells and fresh medium. Cells (T-84, Caco-2 or MDCK) were plated at confluent density (∼1.5 × 105 cells) into the Transwells with 0.5 ml of medium in the upper chamber and 1.0 ml in the lower chamber. In these experiments, medium in the upper chamber bathed the apical (or mucosal) surface of cells, and medium in the lower chamber bathed the basolateral (or serosal) surface of cells. Culture medium was changed every 2 days. The cultures were allowed to differentiate for a minimum of 10 days before assay of transcytosis. The formation of tight junctions was experimentally confirmed by measuring the rate of [3H]inulin movement from the upper chamber into the lower chamber (see above). Experiments were performed on cultures that were between 10 and 15 days old. The transcytosis assay was initiated by adding 1 × 10−8m125I-labeled botulinum neurotoxin either to the upper or lower chamber. Transport of radiolabeled toxin was monitored in two ways. Initially, the entire contents of the lower chamber were aspirated and placed on ice. Five μl of a 20 mg/ml stock of bovine serum albumin was added per ml of sample as a carrier (final concentration of 100 μg/ml) followed by trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10%. Proteins in the samples were precipitated on ice overnight. The precipitates were washed three times with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the radioactivity of pellets was measured in a γ-counter. Nonspecific counts were estimated by performing identical experiments at 10 °C. Subsequently, transport was monitored by collecting all of the medium from the appropriate chamber. An aliquot (0.5 ml) from each sample was filtered through a Sephadex G-25 column, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The amount of radioactivity in the fractions was determined in a γ-counter. Labeled toxin eluted at void volume, and the radioactivity contained in the void volume fractions was summed to determine the total amount of toxin present. Of the two methods, the latter was preferable due to better reproducibility among replicates. A minimum of two replicates per condition was included in each experiment. Cell fractions for assay of intracellular toxin were prepared by standard methods. Briefly, BoNT/A (1 × 10−8m) was added to the upper reservoir at 37 °C for 1 h. The wells were subsequently cooled to 18 °C over a 45-min time period, after which the cells were washed five times (upper and lower surface) with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ or Mg2+. Cells were trypsinized at 37 °C for 10 min, washed once with medium, then twice with homogenization buffer (255 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (5 μm antipain, 1 μmaprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin A, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Harvested cells were homogenized at 3 °C (on ice) in a glass-Teflon homogenizer (2 × 20 strokes). The homogenate was fractionated using an SS-34 rotor in a Sorvall RC5B centrifuge (Sorvall, Inc., Newtown, CT.). Homogenates were spun at 1000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant (S-1) was recentrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The second supernatant (S-2) was used for determination of cytosolic toxin. Samples for autoradiographic analysis were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), using reducing or non-reducing conditions. Gels were fixed for 30 min in destaining buffer, dried on blotter paper, and exposed to film (HyperfilmTM MP, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The toxicity of transcytosed BoNT/A that was collected from the lower reservoir was bioassayed either by intraperitoneal injection into mice or by addition to mouse phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparations. For the in vivo bioassay, transcytosed toxin or native toxin was administered in a 100-μl aliquot of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, per animal. Animals were checked for survival over the 12-h duration of the experiment. For the in vitro bioassay, tissues were excised and suspended in physiological buffer that was aerated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and maintained at 35 °C. The physiological solution had the following composition (millimolar): NaCl, 137; KCl, 5; CaCl2, 1.8; MgSO4, 1.0; NaHCO3, 24; NaH2PO4, 1.0;d-glucose, 11; and gelatin, 0.01%. Phrenic nerves were stimulated continuously (1.0 Hz; 0.1–0.3-ms duration), and muscle twitch was recorded. Toxin-induced paralysis was measured as a 50% reduction in muscle twitch response to neurogenic stimulation. For both in vivo and in vitro bioassays, it was necessary to quantify the amount of toxin that was recovered and tested. This was done in two ways. First, the aliquot to be tested was submitted to gel filtration chromatography to isolate the toxin peak. The specific activity of the starting material added to the upper chamber of the Transwell® apparatus was calculated immediately after iodination (see “Iodination”). The number of counts in the purified fraction from the aliquot taken from the lower chamber and the specific activity were used to calculate the amount of toxin. Second, the actual rates of transcytosis as determined in this study (e.g.Table I) were used to calculate the amount of the toxin in the aliquots that were tested.Table ICharacterization of 125 I-BoNT/A transcytosis in polarized epithelial cell culturesCell lineConditionsTranscytosisPercent of controlpfmol/h/cm2%T-8437 °C(A→B)11.29 ± 0.3010037 °C(B→A)8.98 ± 0.2080<0.00118 °C(A→B)2.26 ± 0.4620<0.001Caco-237 °C(A→B)8.42 ± 0.4975<0.001MDCK37 °C(A→B)0.32 ± 0.072.8<0.001Transcytosis was assayed in T-84, Caco-2, or MDCK cell cultures.

The equality of variances was tested using the F test. Subsequentlyp values were calculated using either a two-samplet test for independent samples with equal variances or a two-sample t test for independent samples with unequal variances (Cochran's method). Experiments were done both to confirm the formation of tight junctions in cell cultures and to assess the rate of movement of molecules across these tight junctions. For this purpose, [3H]inulin flux was measured over periods of 2–20 h. The average values obtained in three experiments indicated that the rate of [3H]inulin flux from the apical to the serosal side of T-84 cells typically fell within the range of 0.01- 0.07 nmol/h/cm2. The rates were slightly lower for Caco-2 and MDCK cultures. These rates compare favorably with those reported by others (20Madara J.L. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and they are a strong indication that tight junctions had been formed and molecular diffusion was hindered. Identical experiments were done on cultures that had been pretreated with 1 × 10−8m BoNT/A for 18 h. Exposure to toxin did not alter inulin flux in either T-84 or MDCK cultures. Several serotypes of botulinum toxin and tetanus toxin were iodinated, and the ability of these ligands to bind to intact cells was measured. As shown in Fig.1, there was substantial and nearly equivalent binding of serotypes A (19.44 ± 2.35 fmol/cm2) and B (18.33 fmol/cm2) to T-84 cells. In contrast, the binding of serotype C (0.22 fmol/cm2) and tetanus toxin (0.47 fmol/cm2) was negligible. A more limited series of experiments was done with MDCK cells, in which binding of only serotype A was studied. Interestingly, there was no evidence of significant high affinity toxin binding (0.02 fmol/cm2) to these cells (Fig. 1, inset). Experiments were done to test the ability of differentiated, polarized T-84 epithelial cells to transcytose botulinum neurotoxin types A, B, and C, as well as tetanus toxin. Similar experiments were done on MDCK cells, which have the ability to differentiate, polarize, and transcytose, but which have not been implicated in clostridial toxin action. Fig.2, which illustrates data obtained for iodinated, homogeneous serotype A, clearly shows that T-84 cells are capable of uptake, transcytosis, and release of toxin. In contrast, MDCK cells did not transcytose serotype A at a significant rate. T-84 cells were also assessed for their ability to transcytose other serotypes of botulinum toxin and tetanus toxin. Interestingly, the cells showed a substantial ability to discriminate among the toxins. Botulinum toxin type B was efficiently transcytosed (83% of A; n = 5), whereas neither serotype C nor tetanus toxin (8–10% of A) was efficiently transcytosed. Data presented thus far indicate that T-84 cells transcytose BoNT/A. The experiments illustrated in Fig.3 show that increases in toxin concentration were associated with increases in transcytosis in T-84 cells. The rates of apical → basolateral transcytosis increased 600-fold from 0.262 fmol/cm2/h at 10−10m to 168.50 fmol/cm2/h at 10−7m toxin. Conversely, the fractional amount of toxin added to the top well (Fig. 3, numbers in parentheses) that was transported across cells decreased 2-fold from 12% at 10−10m to 6% at 10−7m in T-84 cultures. When equivalent experiments were done on MDCK cells, there was much less indication of a dose-dependent capacity for transcytosis. Data presented thus far demonstrate that polarized human epithelial cells transcytose certain clostridial toxins. Therefore, serotype A was selected as a prototype, and further work was done to establish rate constants. In addition, an effort was made to compare apical → basolateral transcytosis with basolateral → apical transcytosis. The data on rate constants are presented in TableI. T-84 cells were shown to transcytose iodinated BoNT/A at a rate of 11.29 fmol/h/cm2 when toxin was added to the upper reservoir. Transcytosis from the basolateral surface to the apical surface was less efficient (8.98 fmol/h/cm2). Cooling cultures to 18 °C reduced the rate of transcytosis to 2.26 fmol/h/cm2 (apical → basolateral). As shown in Table I, transcytosis of BoNT/A in Caco-2 cells (apical → basolateral) was less than that observed in T-84 cells, but still substantial. In contrast, transcytosis of the toxin by MDCK cells was negligible. Several drugs and procedures were used to further characterize the process of toxin movement across cells. Each drug and procedure was selected on the basis that previous studies have shown them to increase or decrease transcytosis (25Hunziker W. Male P. Mellman I.

https://openalex.org/W1977560777,"The question of whether significant levels of a semiquinone can be generated in the Qo site of thebc1 complex under conditions of oxidant-induced reduction is relevant to the mechanism of bifurcation of electron transfer in this site. It has already been reported that beef heart submitochondrial particles under such conditions exhibit an EPR-detectable semiquinone, which is distinct from Q⨪i and which was attributed to a semiquinone in the Qo site (de Vries, S., Albracht, S. P. J., Berden, J. A., and Slater, E. C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11996–11998). However, we show here that this signal, which can be generated to a level of around 0.1 perbc1 monomer, is insensitive to the Qo site inhibitors myxothiazol, E-β-methoxyacrylate-stilbene, and stigmatellin, indicating that it does not arise from a Q⨪o species. Based on sensitivities to inhibitors of other Q sites, up to 60% of the signal may arise from semiquinones of complexes I and II. We further show that the iron-sulfur center remains EPR silent under oxidant-induced reduction conditions. Overall, the results indicate that, under conditions of oxidant-induced reduction, the Qo site is occupied primarily by quinol with the iron-sulfur center oxidized, or, possibly, by an antiferromagnetically coupled semiquinone/reduced iron-sulfur center pair, which are EPR silent. This is discussed in relation to proposed mechanisms of quinol oxidation in the Qo site, and we describe a minimal intermediate-controlled bifurcation model based on rate constants by which bifurcated electron transfer at the Qo site might occur.

This is discussed in relation to proposed mechanisms of quinol oxidation in the Qo site, and we describe a minimal intermediate-controlled bifurcation model based on rate constants by which bifurcated electron transfer at the Qo site might occur. The Q-cycle (1Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) adequately describes the general mechanism of electron and proton transfers within the cytochromebc1 complex. Quinol is oxidized and quinone reduced at two separate sites, the Qo and Qisites, 1The abbreviations used are: QiQo sites, the quinone reduction/proton Input and quinol oxidation/proton Output sites of thebc1 complex, respectivelyBALBritish Anti-Lewisite, 2,3-dimercaptoethanolhemes bH and bLthe high and low potential hemes of cytochrome b, also termed b-562 andb-566 from their reduced α-band maximum, respectivelyMOAE-β-methoxyacrylate. respectively. The oxidation of quinol at the Qo site entails an obligatory bifurcation of the two electrons. The first electron from the quinol is transferred to the iron-sulfur center and then to cytochromec1. The electron on the semiquinone product is transferred to heme bL and from there proceeds to the Qi site via hemebH. Qo sites, the quinone reduction/proton Input and quinol oxidation/proton Output sites of thebc1 complex, respectively British Anti-Lewisite, 2,3-dimercaptoethanol the high and low potential hemes of cytochrome b, also termed b-562 andb-566 from their reduced α-band maximum, respectively E-β-methoxyacrylate. This bifurcation is an integral part of the efficient coupling mechanism and seems to be obligatory; although the redox potential of the second electron transfer is much lower than that of the first, donation of both electrons to the iron-sulfur center cannot occur at a significant rate. This is most clearly illustrated under conditions where turnover is inhibited by antimycin A, a compound that binds at the Qi site (2Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 301: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Two turnovers of the Qo site result in reduction of both hemes b. In this state, further full oxidation of quinol at the Qo site becomes extremely slow, resulting in the well known strong inhibition by antimycin A of the quinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity. The chemical basis for obligatory bifurcation of electron flow was not addressed explicitly in the original Q-cycle proposal. However, it should be stressed that, in principle, the basis could lie simply in the fact that the first reaction step of oxidation of quinol (QH2) to semiquinone (Q⨪) is thermodynamically very unfavorable. Hence, the first electron transfer cannot occur at a high net rate unless the unstable semiquinone product is removed rapidly by a second reaction, in this case reduction of ferric hemebL. More formally, the overall net rate constantk for the sequential reaction (Eq. 1, ignoring protonation changes for simplicity of treatment) is related to the microscopic rate constants by k = k1 k2/(k−1+ k2). QH2FeSbL↔k−1k1Q⨪FeS−bL→k2QFeS−bL−Equation 1 Hence if k2 ≫k-1, which is the situation that we assume for the reaction above, then the overall rate constant, k, approaches k1. However, if the reaction involves a second electron transfer to the iron-sulfur center, which is oxidized with a rate constant of k3, as would be the case for the rate in the antimycin-inhibited state (Eq. 2), then the overall rate constant, k, is instead given by k =k1 k3/(k-1 +k3). overall rate constantk3∣¯∣QH2FeSbL↔k−1k1Q⋅FeS−bL→[Q⋅FeSbL]→QFeS−bLIf k3 ≪ k -1, as we propose to be the case, then in the limit k becomes equal to k1 k3/k-1, and kis diminished by the ratiok-1/k3. In this case, there would be no build up of semiquinone, and quinol oxidation at the Qo site would be inhibited. Control by this simple intermediate-controlled bifurcation mechanism relies upon the exergonicity of the first step of quinol oxidation to semiquinone, a feature inherent in the original formulations (1Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 3Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). A more quantitative assessment of this instability was made by Crofts and Wang (4Crofts A.R. Wang Z. Photosynth. Res. 1989; 22: 69-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), who considered the formation of semiquinone to be the rate-controlling step. However, Brandt (5Brandt U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) has challenged the tenet that the semiquinone formation is rate-controlling, suggesting instead a reaction controlled by the exergonic deprotonation of quinol to its anionic, active form and with semiquinone “more or less stabilized by the active site” (6Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Several further complications have arisen when considering the detailed chemistry of the Qo site, and the recent advances in structure determination of the bc1 complex (7Xia D. Yu C.-A. Hoeon K. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar,8Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar) have refocused interest on these questions. Ding et al.(9) have raised the possibility that two quinone molecules may be required to be bound simultaneously at the Qo site for activity, arranged in a linear edge-to-edge or a stacked arrangement. This feature was included by Brandt (5Brandt U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) in his deprotonation-controlled mechanism, in which catalysis proceeds via a quinhydrone-like intermediate. Brandt and von Jagow (10Brandt U. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) also considered the possibility that bifurcation might require a protein conformational catalytic switch at the Qo site, in which the active reductant bound in the Qo site alternatively contacts the iron-sulfur center and the heme bL. This switch was first thought to be controlled by the redox state of the iron-sulfur center (10Brandt U. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but control by the heme bL to hemebH electron transfer was also suggested (11Brandt U. Haase U. Schägger H. von Jagow G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19958-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recent crystal structures of the bc1 complex have highlighted the possibility that the iron-sulfur center itself might have conformational flexibility as its headgroup has two quite different orientations in the two determined structures (7Xia D. Yu C.-A. Hoeon K. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 8Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar), raising the possibility of long range mobility of the iron-sulfur center during the catalytic cycle. This possibility has been included by Brandt (6Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in his most recent model of Qo site function as the basis for the catalytic switch and, hence, as the basis for the mechanism of bifurcation itself. Another distinct possibility for the Qo site bifurcation has been suggested by Link (12Link T.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), based on the observation that binding of the Qo site inhibitor stigmatellin dramatically raises the midpoint potential of the Rieske center. If the semiquinone formed in the catalytic reaction were to mimic this effect, as suggested, then oxidation of the iron-sulfur center by cytochromec1 could not proceed until the semiquinone, which would be tightly bound to the iron-sulfur center, had reduced heme bL. In this scheme, the semiquinone intermediate is extremely stable, and the reaction rate is controlled by quinol deprotonation, as in the Brandt model (5Brandt U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Despite considerable advances in understanding of structure and function of the bc complexes, these questions of Qo site chemistry have remained unresolved. The initial quinol binding site is likely to involve residues on cytochromeb and residues(s) (possibly a histidine ligand to an iron (13Ding H. Robertson D.E. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3144-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar)) on the iron-sulfur center. However, the exact location of the site remains unresolved, as do the possibilities of two quinone sites or of two sequential binding orientations for a single quinone (8Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). A critical point that can shed some light concerns the degree to which the Qo site can become loaded with a semiquinone under antimycin-inhibited conditions and in the presence of substrates. It is well known that both hemes b are reduced and cytochromec1 is oxidized in this condition of oxidant-induced reduction (14Lee I.Y. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 283: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 15Wikström M.K.F. Berden J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 283: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), as would be expected in all of the above models. However, a bifurcation mechanism based simply on an unstable semiquinone would predict quinol in the Qo site and an oxidized iron-sulfur center, whereas some other models would predict otherwise. This question of the redox poise of components in this condition was addressed using EPR by de Vries et al. (16de Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11996-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a semiquinone signal was found that was sensitive to BAL (an inactivator of the iron-sulfur center (17Slater E.C. de Vries S. Nature. 1980; 288: 717-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) and which was hence ascribed to a semiquinone in the Qo site. Because of the renewed interest in this question, we have further investigated the redox states of quinone bound in the Qo site and of the iron-sulfur center under conditions of oxidant-induced reduction. The results are discussed in terms of the possible mechanisms outlined above. Keilin-Hartree particles from beef heart were prepared as described (18Hartzell C.R. Beinert H. van Gelder B.F. King T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 54-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and were stored at 77 K until required. Protein concentrations were determined using a modified Biuret method, where 0.5 mm H2O2 and 0.5% sodium cholate are added during sample preparation (18Hartzell C.R. Beinert H. van Gelder B.F. King T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 54-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The concentration ofbc1 complex in the preparation was estimated from the succinate-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized difference spectrum using an extinction coefficient at 562 minus 575 nm of Δε = 28.5 mm−1 cm−1(10Brandt U. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Optical spectra and multi-wavelength kinetics were monitored at room temperature in the same sample using a single-beam instrument built in house. Continuous wave EPR spectra were recorded on a Jeol RE1X spectrometer fitted with an Oxford Instruments cryostat. Conditions of measurement are given in the figure legends. Spin intensities were quantitated by double integration and calibration with a known sample of photo-oxidized P700 in photosystem I particles from spinach, prepared using Triton X-100 as described previously (19Williams-Smith D.L. Heathcote P. Sihra C.K. Evans M.C.W. Biochem. J. 1978; 170: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The concentration of P700 was determined optically from an ascorbate-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized difference spectrum using an extinction coefficient of 64 mm−1 cm−1 at 703 nm. P700+ was generated by illuminating the sample in the EPR tube for 60 s and freezing in liquid nitrogen under illumination. Inhibitors were added from ethanolic stock solutions, with final ethanol concentrations not exceeding 1% (v/v). Rolliniastatin-1 was a kind gift from Dr. Degli Esposti (Monash University, Australia). Semiquinone in the Qo site can be expected to accumulate maximally when the Qi site is inhibited (e.g. by antimycin A) in the presence of substrates. It is well documented that this leads to an inhibited state in which both hemes b are reduced and cytochromec1 is oxidized (15Wikström M.K.F. Berden J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 283: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A room temperature optical experiment illustrating this behavior is shown in Fig.1. In the absence of antimycin A (panel A), addition of 5 mm succinate under aerobic conditions leads to a steady-state turnover with low levels of reduced hemes b and c1/cfollowed, on anaerobiosis, by a sharp absorbance increase due to essentially full reduction of all hemes. In contrast, in the presence of antimycin A (panel B), addition of succinate induces substantial reduction of the b-type hemes in the aerobic state, whereas cytochrome c1/c remain oxidized. This inhibited state is stable for several minutes, even at the higher protein concentration used for the EPR samples described below, hence allowing samples to reach a steady state and be frozen for EPR measurements. The difference spectrum of the sample under steady-state antimycin A-inhibited conditions versus the “as prepared” state (not shown) shows a single peak at 564 nm, indicating that both heme b-562 and heme b-566 contribute to the signal. Full reduction of the system with dithionite gives a further absorbance increase at 562 minus 580 nm (panel B). However, this additional change is caused by contaminating hemoglobin in the samples that, on anaerobiosis, undergoes an oxyferrous to ferrous transition resulting in the extra absorbance increase at 562 minus 580 nm induced by dithionite addition inpanel B. This interpretation was confirmed by recording a dithionite-reduced minus succinate-reduced difference spectrum (not shown), which was characteristic of the deoxyhemoglobin minus oxyhemoglobin difference spectrum and which agreed with the amount of contaminating hemoglobin quantitated from carbon monoxide binding spectra. Hence, we conclude that both b-type hemes were fully reduced in the aerobic steady state in the presence of antimycin A, as required for this investigation. As can be estimated from trace A, the succinate-sustained turnover of the bc1 complex is comparatively low, around 10 s−1 under these high pH conditions. The experiments were also repeated under identical conditions, but with 5 mmNADH as substrate instead of succinate. In this case, the uninhibited turnover number of the cytochrome bc1 complex was around 100 s−1. However, the antimycin-inhibited aerobic steady state of cytochromes was identical to the succinate condition (not shown). As expected, when Qo site antagonists such as myxothiazol or stigmatellin are added in addition to antimycin A in the above experiments, reduction of the b-type hemes does not occur in the aerobic steady state (not shown). The antimycin A-inhibited conditions described above were used to set up EPR samples. The only difference was an increased concentration of Keilin-Hartree particles required for the EPR measurements. Even at these concentrations, at least 1 min was available to establish and freeze an aerobic steady-state condition, and it was not deemed necessary to work at 0 °C with short (2 s) incubation times as described (16de Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11996-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The magnitude of the EPR signal of oxidized heme a of cytochrome oxidase near g = 3 (cf. Ref. 20Rich P.R. Moody A.J. Gräber P. Milazzo G. Bioelectrochemistry: Principles and Practice. Birkhäuser Verlag AG, Basel1997: 419-456Google Scholar) was used to confirm that samples remained in the aerobic state. Samples thus prepared do indeed give rise to an EPR signal of 10 G linewidth at g = 2.0048 (cf. g = 2.006 and 8.3 G linewidth in Ref. 16de Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11996-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which can be attributed to a semiquinone (Fig.2 A). At a spin concentration of 1.6 ± 0.1 μm in a sample 16 μm inbc1, the occupancy is comparable with the value of 0.12 given by de Vries et al. (16de Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11996-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signal can also be generated using NADH as electron donor, although at about 20% lower occupancy than with succinate (TableI).Table IEffect of inhibitors of complexes I, II, and III on the so-called Q⨪o EPR signalExperimental conditionsSignal%Succinate (5 mm)/antimycin A (20 μm)100 + Myxothiazol (16 μm)93–105 + Stigmatellin (20 μm)102 + MOA-stilbene (16 μm)106 + Rotenone (15 μm), rolliniastatin I (9 μm)75–86 + Stigmatellin (20 μm), rotenone (15 μm), rolliniastatin I (9 μm)90NADH (5 mm)/antimycin A (20 μm)82 + Myxothiazol (16 μm)104 + Carboxin (20 μm) or TTFA (0.25 mm)63–64 + Stigmatellin (20 μm), TTFA (0.25 mm)61Ascorbate-reduced (10 mm)47–53Conditions of sample preparation and EPR measurements were as in Fig.2. Signal sizes were determined by double integration. Open table in a new tab Conditions of sample preparation and EPR measurements were as in Fig.2. Signal sizes were determined by double integration. To obtain for comparison an internal standard of semiquinone bound in the Qi site, Keilin-Hartree particles were redox-poised with succinate/fumarate at alkaline pH under aerobic conditions in the presence of cyanide. A maximum occupancy of about 0.5 Q⨪i per bc1 is reached at a succinate:fumarate ratio of 1:20 (pH 8.5) when hemebH is about 75% reduced (21Rich P.R. Jeal A.E. Madgwick S.A. Moody A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, these conditions give rise to a semiquinone signal of 4.95 μm spin in a sample approximately 15–16 μmin bc1. The signal at g = 2.0048 (Fig.2 C) has a linewidth of 10 G (cf. g = 2.005 and 10 G linewidth in Ref. 16de Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11996-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is sensitive to antimycin A (Fig.2 D). The semiquinone signal generated under conditions of oxidant-induced reduction is distinct from Q⨪i in that it saturates at higher microwave powers (Fig.3 A). Values forP1/2 can be estimated to be 117 μW for Q⨪i and 287 μW for the second species, at 45 K. These values are comparable with those reported previously (16de Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11996-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of 105 and 276 μW, respectively, at 50 K. The pH dependence of the semiquinone signal induced under conditions of oxidant-induced reduction is given in Fig. 3 B. It shows a decrease of signal intensity by a factor of 2 at low pH with an apparent pK near 7.7, again similar to the properties of the semiquinone signal described by de Vries et al. (16de Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11996-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has been attributed to a semiquinone in the Qo site. In the previous study (16de Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11996-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the disruption of the iron-sulfur center by treatment with BAL abolished the semiquinone ascribed to Q⨪o. In the present experiments, we have used myxothiazol, MOA-stilbene, and stigmatellin to test sensitivity of the signal to Qo site inhibitors. From Fig. 2 B and Table I, it can be seen that these compounds do not affect the semiquinone signal. Yet, in an analogous optical experiment similar to that shown in Fig. 1, oxidant-induced reduction of the b-type hemes was abolished in the presence of the above inhibitors (not shown). When NADH was used as electron donor, addition of myxothiazol even leads to an increase in signal size (Table I). With succinate as electron donor in the presence of antimycin A, a combination of the complex I inhibitors rotenone and rolliniastatin-1 gave a signal loss of 10–20% (Table I). Similarly, with NADH as electron donor (in the presence of antimycin A), addition of the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors carboxin or 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA) led to a 40% decrease of the semiquinone signal. A semiquinone signal about half the size of that of Fig. 2 A could also be seen in an ascorbate reduced sample in the absence of antimycin A. This was of unknown origin and may in part arise from the ascorbate itself. Overall, from these data we conclude that the signal of Fig. 2 A cannot be attributed to a Q⨪o species and instead arises from species in complexes I and II and other unknown sources. The same EPR samples used to monitor the semiquinone radical under conditions of oxidant-induced reduction were subsequently used to determine the redox state of the iron-sulfur center. In a control sample reduced with ascorbate in the presence of cyanide, the iron-sulfur center was essentially fully reduced, resulting in a characteristic signal with gy = 1.90 and gx = 1.79 (Fig. 4 D). In contrast, under conditions of oxidant-induced reduction, only a very small signal of the iron-sulfur center could be seen (Fig. 4 A). Further addition of myxothiazol (Fig. 4 B) or MOA-stilbene (not shown) abolished all residual EPR signal attributable to reduced iron-sulfur center. A special case was encountered when stigmatellin was added as a Qo site inhibitor. This compound raises the midpoint potential of the Rieske center by about 250 mV to nearly 600 mV (22von Jagow G. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), resulting in a reduced iron-sulfur center signal with g values characteristically shifted (Fig. 4 C, cf. Ref.23von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). de Vries et al. first reported (16de Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11996-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) a semiquinone species in beef heart submitochondrial particles, which can be generated under conditions of oxidant-induced reduction of the cytochrome bc1 complex and which was assigned at the time to a Q⨪o species, partly on the basis of its sensitivity to BAL, a known effector of the iron-sulfur center (17Slater E.C. de Vries S. Nature. 1980; 288: 717-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This possibility of a Q⨪o species has gained importance in the light of the crystal structure information and the recent ideas on the bifurcation mechanism, and these have prompted us to reinvestigate the question further. The availability of newer specific Qo site inhibitors and the use of room temperature conditions to establish steady-state conditions have aided this task. On the basis of stoichiometry relative to the amount of bc1 complex, pH dependence of amplitude, and power saturation behavior relative to that of Q⨪i, we may conclude that the signal shown in Fig.2 A is equivalent to that described previously (16de Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11996-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the lack of significant effects of any of the Qo site inhibitors myxothiazol, MOA-stilbene, or stigmatellin argues compellingly against this species being located in the Qosite. Previously, it had been shown (16de Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11996-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the signal can be abolished by aerobic treatment with BAL, a reaction known to disrupt the iron-sulfur center (17Slater E.C. de Vries S. Nature. 1980; 288: 717-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, this treatment requires extreme conditions and may well also have secondary effects on submitochondrial particles, accounting for the difference of effect in comparison with the more specific compounds that we have used. Effects of inhibitors of complexes I and II suggest that at least part of the signal may arise from semiquinones in other complexes. de Vries et al. (16de Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11996-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) noted that the signal was still observed in such cross-inhibitor experiments, but the absence of quantitative data does not allow direct comparison. The power saturation behavior of the signal in Fig.2 A confirms that it is equivalent to that described in Ref. 16de Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11996-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. It is unlike that of the semiquinone signals associated with succinate dehydrogenase, which are not saturated until ≥100 mW (24Miki T. Yu L. Yu C.-A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and this is consistent with the indications from inhibitor sensitivities that it arises from a mixture of species. The reduced form of the iron-sulfur center has a characteristic and strong EPR signal (25Rieske J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 456: 195-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, only a very small signal attributable to reduced iron-sulfur center could be detected under conditions of oxidant-induced reduction, a result most simply interpreted as indicating that it is mostly in the oxidized state. Any small reduced fraction is most likely due to some residual electron transfer. Complete oxidation of the iron-sulfur center occurs when myxothiazol is added as a second inhibitor in addition to antimycin A (although without affecting the semiquinone signal). It might also be noted that the ubiquinone pool (Em8 of +30 mV) will tend to reach equilibrium with the succinate/fumarate couple (Em8 of −35mV (26Clark W.M. Oxidation-Reduction Potentials of Organic Systems. Bailliere, Tindall, and Cox, London1960Google Scholar)) in the antimycin-inhibited aerobic condition. Because no more than 10% of the succinate could have been oxidized to fumarate, we may conclude that the ubiquinone pool is practically fully reduced under these conditions. The simplest conclusion from our data is that the oxidant-induced reduction steady state is characterized by a quinol, rather than a semiquinone, in the Qo site and an oxidized state of the iron-sulfur center. Hence, quinol oxidation does not occur because the net formation of semiquinone by the first step does not occur to any significant extent rather than because there is a barrier to the reaction between semiquinone and oxidized iron-sulfur center. This situation is as expected in the simple intermediate-controlled bifurcation model described in the Introduction, in which a very rapid second reaction is required to allow significant net reaction through the unstable intermediate. However, as outlined in the Introduction, other models for the obligatory bifurcation of electron transfer from the Qo site are also possible, and our data may also be considered in relation to their predictions. An oxidant-induced reduction situation in which the site is occupied by quinol and with the iron-sulfur center oxidized is generally consistent with any model involving a thermodynamically unstable semiquinone at the Qo site, such as those described by Crofts and Wang (4Crofts A.R. Wang Z. Photosynth. Res. 1989; 22: 69-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and Ding et al. (9Ding H. Moser C.C. Robertson D.E. Tokito M.K. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15979-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, it does rule out models in which semiquinone should accumulate. In the catalytic switch model in its original form (10Brandt U. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), a change of conformation into the ‘b-state’ after a first electron transfer could result in semiquinone accumulation (once the hemes b had become reduced), whereas the iron-sulfur center would become oxidized. This is not supported by our data. However, it was later suggested that the switch itself was initiated only in synchrony with a heme bL →bH electron transfer (11Brandt U. Haase U. Schägger H. von Jagow G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19958-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this particular situation, once heme bL had become reduced, the switch might be imagined to be locked in a state in which quinol could no longer be oxidized, and so this possibility cannot be ruled out by our data. If movement of the semiquinone to a different binding orientation occurs after electron donation to the iron-sulfur center, as considered recently (8Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar), again accumulation of semiquinone, in the presence of oxidized iron-sulfur center, might be expected to occur, a situation that also cannot be supported by our data. The proton-gated affinity switch model (12Link T.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) deserves special mention. The model predicts accumulation of a species containing Q⨪o bound tightly to reduced iron-sulfur center. In the simplest case, one might expect to observe EPR signals from both semiquinone and iron-sulfur center, neither of which is the case. However, it has been pointed out by Link (12Link T.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) that the two redox centers may be antiferromagnetically coupled in such a way that neither species could be detected by EPR spectroscopy. Some precedence comes from studies of the interaction of the quinone analogue 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropanylbenzoquinone with the iron-sulfur center of the homologous plant cytochrome bf complex, where redox titrations indicate that generation of the semiquinone form of 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropanylbenzoquinone, while bound to the iron-sulfur center, results in loss of the iron-sulfur EPR signal (27Malkin R. FEBS Lett. 1981; 131: 169-172Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It was suggested that this arose from the antiferromagnetic coupling of the two species, although the corresponding semiquinone signal was not analyzed to confirm this point. In any case, the possibility that we observe neither semiquinone nor iron-sulfur center because they are strongly antiferromagnetically coupled cannot be excluded with our present measurements and may require an alternative spectroscopic technique to resolve the issue. In summary, our data support a model of control of bifurcation governed simply by the instability of the intermediate semiquinone state that, in simplest form, may be described by the intermediate-controlled bifurcation model described in the Introduction. Models in which the semiquinone is stabilized are ruled out, except for the special case in which semiquinone may be strongly antiferromagnetically coupled to the reduced iron-sulfur center (12Link T.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), a possibility that requires further investigation. Although other complications remain unresolved, the likely redox states of Qo site semiquinone and of the iron-sulfur center under oxidant-induced reduction conditions, as established here, are key observations in limiting the mechanistic possibilities at this site. We are grateful to Professors U. Brandt and E. Berry for useful comments and access to prepublished material."
https://openalex.org/W2086004321,"We report the characterization of aTrypanosoma brucei 75-kDa protein of the RGG (Arg-Gly-Gly) type, termed TBRGG1. Dicistronic and monocistronic transcripts of theTBRGG1 gene were produced by both alternative splicing and polyadenylation. TBRGG1 was found in two or three forms that differ in their electrophoretic mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, one of which was more abundant in the procyclic form of the parasite. TBRGG1 was localized to the mitochondrion and appeared to be more abundant in bloodstream intermediate and stumpy forms in which the mitochondrion reactivates and during the procyclic stage, which possesses a fully functional mitochondrion. This protein was characterized to display oligo(U) binding characteristics and was found to co-localize with an in vitro RNA editing activity in a sedimentation analysis. TBRGG1 most likely corresponds to the 83-kDa oligo(U)-binding protein previously identified by UV cross-linking of guide RNA to mitochondrial lysates (Leegwater, P., Speijer, D., and Benne, R.

Trypanosomes are primitive eukaryotes whose parasitic life cycle involves the differentiation into several successive adaptive forms in different hosts and environments. The main developmental stages are the bloodstream form in the mammalian host and the procyclic form in the tsetse fly vector. Each of these stages is characterized by a major surface protein, the variant surface glycoprotein in the bloodstream form and procyclin in the procyclic form (1Roditi I. Schwarz H. Pearson T.W. Beecroft R.P. Liu M.K. Richardson J.P. Buhring H.J. Pleiss J. Bulow R. Williams R.O. Overath P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 2Pays E. Vanhamme L. Berberof M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 25-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Another major difference between these forms is the energy metabolism. Bloodstream forms possess an inactive mitochondrion and respire through the catabolism of glucose in specialized organelles termed glycosomes, whereas procyclic forms utilize a fully functional mitochondrion for oxidative phosphorylation, and amino acids probably serve as the major carbon source in vivo (3Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In the bloodstream, the mitochondrion is reactivated when the trypanosomes differentiate from the proliferative slender form into the quiescent stumpy form through several intermediate stages. The nuclear genome of these organisms appears to be organized in long polycistronic transcription units and probably contains only a few promoters (4Graham S.V. Parasitol.

Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 442-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The expression of many genes analyzed so far appears to be stage-specific and reflects the developmental stage of the parasite. Interestingly, genes belonging to the same transcription unit are often differentially stage-regulated, indicating that post-transcriptional processes operating at the levels of RNA maturation, stability, and translation are primarily responsible for controlling cellular differentiation (4Graham S.V.

The primary polycistronic transcripts of trypanosomes are rapidly processed into mature mRNAs by trans-splicing and polyadenylation. These processing events appear to be coupled, the choice of a polyadenylation site being apparently dictated by the position of the downstream splice site, probably through the scanning of transcripts by a multifactorial complex encompassing both processing activities, which is recruited to the RNA by the binding to a polypyrimidine stretch (7Hehl A. Roditi I. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 442-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 8Ullu E. Tschudi C. Gunzl A. Smith D.F. Parsons M. Molecular Biology of Parasitic Protozoa. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 115-133Google Scholar). Several observations indicate that trans-splicing and polyadenylation can be stage-regulated. Alternative splicing of transcripts of theESAG6 and TBA1 genes differs between bloodstream and procyclic forms of the parasite (9Pays E. Coquelet H. Pays A. Tebabi P. Steinert M. Mol. Cell.

In all these processes, it is believed that RNA-binding proteins play a major role, but presently nothing is known about these proteins. Mitochondrial transcripts of trypanosomes are also subjected to a developmentally regulated post-transcriptional RNA processing, which involves mechanisms of a nature totally different from that of nuclear genes. These transcripts are rendered functional by a complex editing mechanism involving endonuclease(s), terminal uridylyl transferase or uridylyl exonuclease, and RNA ligase activities, which leads to the insertion and/or deletion of uridylate residues templated by short polyuridylated RNAs termed guide RNAs, all encoded in the mitochondrial genome (12Kable M.L.

RNA editing allows the expression of several mitochondrial cryptogenes, which encode subunits of the enzymes of a respiratory-redox chain coupled to phosphorylation of ADP, which is only active in procyclic forms. Here we report the characterization of an RNA-binding protein specific for poly(U), which selectively accumulates in the mitochondrion when this organelle is active. Alternative processing of the transcripts and stage-regulated protein modification suggest that complex controls regulate the expression of TBRGG1. It is likely that this protein is involved in mitochondrial RNA processing, either in rRNA synthesis and maturation or in RNA editing. Trypanosoma brucei pleomorphic bloodstream forms were from the AnTat 1.1 clone. Procyclic forms were derived from these cells by in vitro cultivation (18Pays E. Hanocq-Quertier J. Hanocq F. Van Assel S. Nolan D. Rolin S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A cDNA library was constructed in λgt10 from poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from bloodstream forms using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech cDNA synthesis and cloning kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

This gave rise to pGEM2.9 and pGEMRGG, respectively. For bacterial expression, a MscI-PvuII fragment from pGEM2.9 containing the whole TBRGG1 ORF was cloned inSmaI-digested pGEX4T1, giving pGEX2.9. In addition, a 720-bpMscI-SalI fragment from pGEMRGG containing the sequence encoding the RGG repeats was cloned in SmaI +SalI-digested pGEX4T1, giving pGEXRGG. Southern and Northern blot analysis were conducted as described previously (18Pays E. Hanocq-Quertier J. Hanocq F. Van Assel S. Nolan D. Rolin S. Mol. Biochem.

The TBRGG1 protein and a polypeptide of 238 amino acids (amino acids 30 to 268) containing the RGG repeats (RGG peptide) were expressed in E. coli from pGEX2.9 and pGEXRGG. The two GST fusion proteins were purified in large amounts using the Bio-Rad Cell Prep SDS-PAGE apparatus. The fractions containing the purified recombinant proteins were applied on a column of AG11A8 resin to remove the SDS. The RGG peptide was cleaved from the GST moiety using thrombin and repurified using the same procedure. The TBRGG1-GST fusion and the RGG peptide were then used to immunize rabbits and chickens. Chicken egg yolks delipidified with chloroform as well as rabbit antisera were used for subsequent analyses. The TBRGG1 protein and the RGG peptide were synthesized in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine from pGEM2.9 and pGEMRGG, respectively, using the Promegain vitro transcription and translation systems. 2 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing the labeled protein were mixed with 25 μl of agarose beads bound to oligoribonucleotides (poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), and poly(U), purchased from Amersham or Sigma) or single-stranded salmon sperm DNA (purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.), in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 250, 500, 750, or 1000 mm NaCl). The binding was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 4 °C with mild agitation. The beads were then pelleted and subjected to 6 washes with 1 ml of binding buffer. Sample buffer was added to the beads, followed by boiling for 5 min and SDS-PAGE analysis. After electrophoresis, the gel was subjected to fluorography, dried, and exposed. UV cross-linking assays were conducted as described previously (19Leegwater P. Speijer D. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial vesicle isolation was performed in a 20–35% renografin gradient, essentially as described (20Feagin J.E. Jasmer D.P. Stuart K. Cell. 1987; 49: 337-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Renografin gradients were divided into 14 fractions of 2 ml. Before Western blotting, 0.02% laurylmaltoside was added to the fractions followed by dialysis against 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6. Proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in SDS-PAGE layer mix at a concentration of approximately 3 μg/ml. Procyclic T. brucei IsTaR 1 (21Stuart K. Gobright E.

Schönenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation of mitochondrial vesicles followed the protocol of Harris et al. (23Harris M.E. Moore D.R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11368-11376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detergent lysates of the vesicle preparations were prepared as described by Göringer et al. (24Göringer H.U. Koslowsky D.J. Morales T.H. Stuart K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1776-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (75-fold critical micellar concentration) for the solubilization. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial lysates (10 mg) in 20 mmHepes, pH 8.3, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml bovine trypsin inhibitor were fractionated by density centrifugation in linear 10–35% (v/v) glycerol gradients (26Pollard V.W. Harris M.E. Hajduk S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Centrifugation was performed in a Beckman SW 41 rotor at 38,000 rpm for 5 h at 4 °C. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. The fractions were tested for their in vitro RNA editing activity as described by Seiwert et al. (13Seiwert S.D. Heidmann S Stuart K. Cell. 1996; 84: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Affinity purification of the antibodies was performed as described (27Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Immobilized full-length GST-TBRGG1 fusion protein was used as the antigen. For immunoblotting, protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and probed with the antibodies. The protein samples were run in 10% Laemmli SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed by the semi-dry method for 2 h limited at 250 mA onto nitrocellulose. This was followed by standard detection procedures. The antisera used were rabbit and chicken anti-TBRGG1, a rabbit anti-ATPase raised against the mitochondrial ATP synthase ofCrithidia fasciculata and showing cross-reactivity predominantly with the β-subunit from T. brucei, and a rabbit anti-glucosephosphate isomerase raised against glucosephosphate isomerase of T. brucei, which in procyclic forms is 50% glycosomal and 50% cytoplasmic (a gift of Prof. F. R. Opperdoes, Institute for Cellular Pathology, Brussels). Pre-immune sera served as negative controls. Secondary incubations were done with the appropriate antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase. Detection of alkaline phosphatase activity was performed with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate, both from Boehringer Mannheim, according to the manufacturer. Trypanosomes were fixed in suspension (1.75% paraformaldehyde, 0.25% glutaraldehyde), permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (28Ferguson M. Torri F. Ward C.D. Englund P.T. Cell. 1992; 70: 621-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Chicken anti-TBRGG1 was used at a 1:50 dilution, and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled anti-chicken antibody (Sigma) was diluted 320-fold. Images were taken on a Zeiss Axioscop microscope coupled to a CCD camera and processed by a ISIS 3 software. Pleomorphic bloodstream forms and a purified mitochondrial fraction from procyclic culture forms were fixed and embedded in Lowicryl as described previously (29Salmon D. Geuskens M. Hanocq F. Hanocq-Quertier J. Nolan D. Ruben L. Pays E. Cell. 1994; 78: 75-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were floated overnight at 4 °C on rabbit anti-TBRGG1 immune and pre-immune serum diluted 100-fold. After careful washes, the sections were incubated for 1 h with Fab fragments of goat anti-rabbit IgGs conjugated to 10-nm gold particles (EM.GFAR10, BioCell, Cardiff, UK) diluted 100-fold. The cloning of the TBRGG1 gene was initially designed to characterize the trypanosome homologue of nucleolin from higher eukaryotes. Nucleolin is an RNA-binding protein involved in the synthesis and processing of polI transcripts (30Lapeyre B. Bourdon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We were interested in the identification of a trypanosome homologue of this protein because the transcription of the variant surface glycoprotein andprocyclin genes appears to be mediated by polymerase I (31Chung H.M. Lee M.G.S. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Parasitol. Today. 1992; 8: 414-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and RNA-binding proteins are likely to represent key control elements for the expression of these genes (2Pays E. Vanhamme L. Berberof M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 25-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 4Graham S.V. Parasitol.

Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 442-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a probe from hamster nucleolin to screen a T. brucei bloodstream form cDNA library cloned in a bacteriophage vector. Several positive clones were obtained, which were found to contain the same sequence, at least partially. The nucleotide sequence of the largest cDNA is shown in Fig. 1. This cDNA (3.4 kb) was full-sized, since at the 5′ extremity it contained the end of the common spliced leader (termed mini-exon), and it was polyadenylated at the 3′ extremity. Interestingly, this cDNA was found to contain two successive ORFs. The largest one encoded a putative 75-kDa protein showing five typical repeated motifs found in a class of RNA-binding proteins termed RGG, which consist of closely spaced RGG tripeptides interspersed with phenylalanine and/or aromatic amino acids (32Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A andB); hence the trypanosome gene was termed TBRGG1, for T. brucei RGG gene 1. The region of the RGG repeats is the only one showing significant homology with hamster nucleolin (30Lapeyre B. Bourdon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and was probably responsible for the selection of these clones. The first ORF encoded a putative polypeptide of about 15 kDa, showing no significant homology with sequences from data bases.Figure 2Amino acid sequence of the TBRGG1 protein. In panel A, the underlinedstretches are 5 repeats containing the conserved RGG motif found in a class of RNA-binding proteins (32Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Panel B shows an alignment of the 5 repeats, with indication of the RGG and related motifs (boxed) and of the aromatic residues (black squares). Panel C shows the amphipatic helix contained in the N-terminal sequence, which could be a mitochondrial targeting signal (33Köller J. Müller U.F. Schmid B. Missel A. Kruft V. Stuart K.

As shown in Fig.3, the different probes confirmed the arrangement of the two successive ORFs. Probe 1, which is specific to ORF1, hybridized to the same 2.2-kb SacI fragment as probe 2, which is specific to the beginning of ORF2 (Ss+ S digests in panels 1 and 2). In the same digests, probe 3 recognized two different fragments of 2.4 and 0.8 kb (see map in Fig. 3). Similarly, as expected from the map, the same 1.6-kb PstI fragment was recognized by probes 1 and 2, whereas KpnI allowed an identification of the specific fragments hybridizing to each of the two probes. This analysis showed that although the ORF1 region is unique, a few sequences distantly related to the region encompassing TBRGG1 exist elsewhere in the genome (see, for instance, the weakly hybridizing bands at the top of the Ss+ S and K lanesin panel 2 or the upper KpnI fragment inpanel 3). To evaluate the significance of the existence of two ORFs in the TBRGG1 cDNA, we used probes specific to either of these ORFs to screen the cDNA library and analyze the pattern of steady-state transcripts. The diagrams at the bottom of Fig.4 show the structure of different full-sized cDNAs obtained by this screening. The 3.4-kb cDNA was described above, whereas the 2.9- and 0.7-kb cDNAs appeared to result, respectively, from alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation of the same primary transcript, generating mature mRNAs for ORF1 and ORF2, respectively. The respective 5′ limit of the 2.9-kb cDNA and 3′ limit of the 0.7-kb cDNA are indicated in Fig. 1 (black and open arrowheads, respectively). From the location of these limits, it was clear that the two alternative processings are mutually exclusive. The different transcripts cloned as cDNAs were detected in steady-state RNA from both bloodstream and procyclic forms. The Northern blot analysis presented in Fig. 4 indicates that the 3.4-kb species was a minor transcript slightly more abundant in bloodstream than in procyclic forms, whereas the 0.7-kb transcript was more abundant and slightly enriched in procyclic forms. The 2.9-kb transcript was the major species and was present in roughly equal amounts in both forms of the parasite. Apart from a possible alternative transcript of ORF1 (about 2 kb, see panel 1), there was no evidence for other processing products, indicating that the generation of the stable mRNAs for ORF1 and 2 resulted from mutually exclusive processing of the same primary transcripts. These data also indicated that the DNA fragments faintly cross-hybridizing with the TBRGG1 probe 2 in Fig. 3did not give rise to detectable levels of additionalTBRGG1-specific RNAs. The entireTBRGG1 gene and the region of the RGG repeats were cloned in an E. coli expression vector, and the recombinant proteins were purified by SDS-PAGE from cells transfected with the appropriate vectors. Antibodies were raised against these polypeptides in rabbits and chickens. Western blot analyses were performed using these antibodies, and similar results were obtained irrespective of the nature of the immunogen or the source of antibodies. As shown in Fig.5, the TBRGG1 protein was present in both bloodstream and procyclic forms as a doublet or triplet of bands, depending on the antibody and cell extract, and migrated with the relative molecular mass predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA (about 75 kDa). With both antibodies, the upper band was more visible in the procyclic form (arrow). As theTBRGG1 mRNA appears to be unique (see above), the multiplicity of protein bands may be explained by either modification or proteolysis or by cross-detection of related proteins. We attempted to determine whether TBRGG1 was modified by phosphorylation (data not shown). First, TBRGG1 was immunoprecipitated from trypanosomes grown in the presence of32P-orthophosphate and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. No labeling was observed although TBRGG1 was readily immunoprecipitable in control experiments. Second, treatment with phosphatases did not interfere with the pattern of migration in SDS-PAGE. Since other RGG proteins contain the modified amino acidN G,N G-dimethylarginine (35Najbauer J. Johnson B.A. Young A.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10501-10509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we evaluated the possible involvement of this modification in the observed pattern of bands. The methylation of arginines is inhibited by adenosine dialdehyde (35Najbauer J. Johnson B.A. Young A.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10501-10509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, after incubation of both bloodstream and procyclic forms for three generation times (respectively, 24 and 50 h) in the presence of sub-toxic concentrations of this compound (10 μm), no change of the electrophoretic pattern was observed (not shown). It is worth noting that the electrophoretic mobility of the upper band corresponded to that of the in vitro translation product of the TBRGG1 mRNA (data not shown). Therefore, it is possible that the lower bands arise by proteolytic cleavage. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that a second band can appear from thein vitro synthesized protein after prolonged storage. The use of the chicken anti-TBRGG1 antibodies allowed the demonstration that TBRGG1 is mitochondrial in intermediate and stumpy bloodstream forms. A preferential accumulation of the protein in the mitochondrion of these developmental forms is clearly demonstrated by immunofluorescence (Fig.6, SS) and electron microscopy (Fig. 7, panel b). In bloodstream slender forms, this preferential localization was not observed (Fig. 6, SLD). In procyclic forms, the protein also appeared to be present in the mitochondrion (Fig. 6, P).Figure 7Localization of TBRGG1, as determined by electron microscopy on sections of mitochondrial vesicles isolated from procyclic forms (panel a) and on cell sections of intermediate bloodstream forms (panel b).

Renografin gradients are routinely used to purify trypanosomal mitochondrial vesicles (see Ref. 20Feagin J.E. Jasmer D.P. Stuart K. Cell. 1987; 49: 337-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), which are easily identifiable because of the presence of specific cytochromes. Fig. 8 Ashows a Western blot comparing equal amounts of total and mitochondrial proteins from procyclic forms probed with both anti-TBRGG1 and anti-mitochondrial ATPase antibodies. The bands, respectively, detected with each of these antibodies alone are indicated by thearrows. The TBRGG1 signal in the mitochondrial fraction was about 10 times stronger than that obtained with the total protein fraction, which is similar to the enrichment observed for the mitochondrial ATPase, providing further evidence for the mitochondrial location of the protein. To check that this result was not due to contamination of the mitochondrial fraction with the glycosomal fraction, the complete renografin gradient was tested in Western blotting assays with different antibodies. As can be seen in Fig.8 B, the TBRGG1 protein colocalized with the mitochondrial ATPase and not with glycosomal glucosephosphate isomerase. The presence of the TBRGG1 protein in the mitochondrial vesicles was directly observed by electron microscopy. Fig. 7 a allowed the verification of the purity of the mitochondrial fraction and showed that the labeling is associated with fuzzy material inside the vesicles. Taken together, these results indicated that, at least at the developmental stages where the mitochondrion is active, TBRGG1 is present in the mitochondrion. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence at the N terminus of TBRGG1 predicted an amphipatic helix compatible with a targeting signal for mitochondrial import (Fig. 2 C) (33Köller J. Müller U.F.

ZO proteins are members of the MAGUK (membrane associatedguanylate kinase) superfamily that are often found at sites of cell-cell contact and may function to couple extracellular signaling pathways with the cytoskeleton. Other proteins found in or near the TJ include cingulin, 7H6, symplekin, unidentified phosphoproteins, and a series of signal transduction molecules (reviewed in Ref. 5Denker B.M. Nigam S.K. Am. J.

MDCK cells are a cultured epithelial cell line that has been extensively utilized for studies of epithelial polarity, targeting of proteins, and the study of intercellular junctions (6Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nelson W.J. Science. 1989; 245: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ switch model of TJ formation in MDCK cells has been widely utilized to gain insights into the function of polarized epithelial cells (7Stuart R.O. Sun A. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. J. Biol.

Valdes J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 17: 127-132Crossref Google Scholar) and recapitulates many of the critical molecular events of epithelial morphogenesis. MDCK cells cultured in low calcium (μm) lack cell-cell contact, polarity, and junctions. “Switching” to normal calcium medium (NC) triggers a series of molecular events that leads to establishment of the polarized phenotype with characteristics of a tight transporting epithelium. Tight junction development can be followed by measuring the transepithelial resistance (TER), a rapid and reproducible assessment of tight junction integrity. Because MDCK cells are clonal and TJ development can be synchronized in the Ca2+ switch, the role of specific proteins on TJ biogenesis can be studied in this system by cDNA transfections. The critical role of calcium in the formation of intercellular junctions is well established. Extracellular calcium is required for homotypic interactions of E-cadherin and is likely to be the initial event of junctional complex formation (12Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). Regulated intracellular calcium stores are also important for tight junction biogenesis. There are local increases in intracellular calcium concentration at the points of cell-cell contact (9Nigam S.K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Silver R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6162-6166Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and chelation of intracellular calcium perturbs TER development (13Stuart R.O. Sun A. Panichas M. Hebert S.C. Brenner B.M. Nigam S.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin depletes intracellular endoplasmic reticulum stores of calcium, and thapsigargin treatment of MDCK cells prior to initiation of cell-cell contact prevents TER development and the sorting of ZO-1 to the TJ (7Stuart R.O. Sun A. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13636-13641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The signaling events important for TJ biogenesis are complex and utilize a variety of pathways. Phosphorylation events are important as several proteins become phosphorylated in the TJ, and protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms translocate to the TJ during biogenesis. PKC inhibitors markedly inhibit the development of TER in the calcium switch, and PKC agonists stimulate ZO-1 translocation to the membrane. The importance of PKC in tight junction biogenesis, as well as regulated calcium stores, suggests important roles for heterotrimeric G proteins. The proximity of several G proteins to the TJ also suggests they may have potential roles in regulating the development and/or maintenance of the TJ. PKCζ and PKCα, have also been localized in the vicinity of the TJ (14Rosson D. O'Brien T.G. Kampherstein J.A. Szallasi Z. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Mullin J.M. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 507-515PubMed Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that expressing a constitutively activated Gαo (Q205L) in MDCK cells significantly accelerated TJ biogenesis without affecting base-line resistances. Although Gαo is a member of the G protein family inhibited by pertussis toxin (∼80% similar to Gαi1–3), its receptors and effectors are distinct, and furthermore, Gαo is not detected in renal epithelia or MDCK cells (16Denker B.M.

Several Gαi family members are expressed in epithelial cells, and Gαi2 has been shown to overlap with the tight junction in epithelial cell lines (16Denker B.M. Saha C. Khawaja S. Nigam S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25750-25753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17de Almeida J.B. Holtzman E.J. Peters P. Ercolani L. Ausiello D.A. Stow J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 507-515PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that Gαi2 may be an important regulator of tight junctions. To test this hypothesis, we initially looked for effects of AlF4− (activator of Gα subunits) on tight junctions in control cell lines and then established MDCK cell lines overexpressing wild type Gαi2 and a constitutively activated Gαi2 (GTPase-deficient, Q205Lαi2). We find that AlF4− significantly increases TER in control cells and accelerates TER development during the Ca2+ switch. The effects of AlF4− can be reproduced in MDCK cells expressing activated Gαi2, indicating that this Gα subunit is critical to the development and maintenance of tight junctions. Rat Gαi2 cDNA was cloned into Bluescript (Stratagene) as described previously (20Denker B.M. Boutin P.M. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5544-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and recloned into the EcoRI andApaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Q205Lαi2 was provided by Dr. Gary Johnson and cloned into Bluescript using HindIII sites and then into pcDNA3 using XhoI and XbaI sites. MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics plus 5% fetal calf serum. Transfected cell lines were maintained in G418 (500 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) Subconfluent MDCK cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were transfected with 10 μg of linearized plasmid by calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (16Denker B.M. Saha C. Khawaja S. Nigam S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25750-25753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). G418-resistant colonies were analyzed for increased Gαi2expression by Western blot using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed toward the C terminus of Gαi2 (AS7; NEN Life Science Products). Control cells were obtained by transfecting pcDNA3 without insert, and all cell lines were established in parallel. Confluent PC-, Gαi2-, or Q205Lαi2 -MDCK cells were washed twice with PBS and then scraped into buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 75 mmsucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA). Cells were frozen and thawed three times and triturated ten times through a 27 gauge needle. All samples were incubated at 30 °C with no added nucleotide or 100 μm GTPγS. Samples were immediately placed on ice, and trypsin was added (20 pmol ofl-1-(tosylamido)-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma). All samples were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, and digestion was terminated by the addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot using AS7 anti-Gαi2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1,000) and ECL (Pierce) with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000). PC-, Gαi2-, or Q205Lαi2-MDCK cells were grown on coverslips or Transwell filters (12 mm) (Costar), rinsed with PBS, and fixed with methanol (100%, −70 °C) for 10 min. Cells were then washed with PBS and blocked as described previously (16Denker B.M. Saha C. Khawaja S. Nigam S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25750-25753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated with rabbit polyclonal Gαi2 (AS7, from NEN Life Science Products) at several dilutions and rat monoclonal to ZO-1 (undiluted supernatant; courtesy of D. Goodenough) for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS three times at 5-min intervals and incubated with secondary antibodies (fluorescein- or Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-rat IgG; Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA) at 1:100 with for 1 h. Coverslips were visualized on a Nikon Labphot-2 immunofluorescence microscope or a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal microscope using the 63× oil immersion objective. Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, CA) and figure compiled in Adobe Illustrator (Adobe, CA). MDCK cells were plated on 12-mm transwell filter (Costar) at confluence (∼3 × 105 cells) and allowed to attach for 24–36 h to form a tight monolayer in normal Ca2+ containing medium (NC). Cells were placed in low Ca2+ (1–4 μm) medium (low calcium) for 1 h followed by switch to NC medium. TER was measured using a Millipore (Bedford, MA) electrical resistance system, and the results are expressed in Ω·cm2. TER was measured in stable monolayers and during Ca2+ switch in the presence and absence of aluminum fluoride (AlF4−; 3 mm NaF + 50 μmAlCl3, Sigma). Several lines of evidence have suggested the involvement of heterotrimeric G proteins in tight junction formation. Early studies with G protein modulators such as pertussis toxin, cholera toxin, AlF4−, and a variety of other agents showed variable effects on TJ biogenesis (10Balda M.S. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Macias-Silva M. Torres-Marquez M.E. Garcia Sainz J.A. Cereijido M. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 122: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Several confocal studies have localized Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gα12 in the vicinity of the tight junction (16Denker B.M. Saha C. Khawaja S. Nigam S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25750-25753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17de Almeida J.B. Holtzman E.J. Peters P. Ercolani L. Ausiello D.A. Stow J.L. J.

Membr. Biol. 1996; 149: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that Gαo (a member of the Gα family inhibited by pertussis toxin) expressed in MDCK cells localizes to the subapical lateral membrane overlapping with ZO-1 in the tight junction (16Denker B.M. Saha C. Khawaja S. Nigam S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25750-25753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and this was subsequently confirmed in another study (19Hamilton S.E. Nathanson N.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A constitutively active mutant of Gαo (Q205L) also localizes in this region, and cells expressing Gαoshowed no differences in base-line junctional properties as determined by transepithelial resistance. However, in the Ca2+ switch, MDCK cells expressing activated Gαo(Q205Lαo-MDCK) developed tight junctions at twice the rate and reached significantly higher peak TER values than either Gαo-MDCK or PC-MDCK cells. Although Gαo is not normally expressed in epithelia, this observation raises the possibility that one of the Gα subunits normally found in this location could have a fundamental role in regulating the development and/or maintenance of the TJ. To further examine the role of G protein α subunits affecting the TJ, we studied the effects of the G protein activator AlF4− on TJ formation in wild type (not transfected; WT-MDCK) and vector (pcDNA3) transfected MDCK cells (PC-MDCK). AlF4− has no known effects on small GTP binding proteins but activates heterotrimeric Gα subunits. Crystal structures of Gαi1 obtained with GDP complexed with AlF4− reveal that the position of the γ-phosphate is occupied by AlF4−. AlF4− in this position prevents catalysis by immobilizing Gln204 and Arg178 (22Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that wild type MDCK cells and PC transfected cells cultured on filters develop significantly higher TER in the presence of AlF4−. Untreated steady state TER values were similar between the cell lines, and AlF4− reproducibly increased TER values 3–4-fold. This finding is consistent with activation of one or more endogenous Gα subunits that results in enhanced steady state resistances. Because AlF4− activates all Gα subunits in MDCK cells and several studies have placed Gαi2 in close proximity to the TJ, we tested the hypothesis that Gαi2 was important to this process by stably expressing Gαi2 and a constitutively activated Gαi2 (Q205Lαi2) in MDCK cells. The amount of transfected Gαi2 was determined relative to the levels of endogenous Gαi2 in PC-MDCK cells. Western blots of the three cell lines using identical amounts of total protein were analyzed (not shown) using NIH image (Wayne Rasband, NIH). Relative to PC-MDCK cells, the level of Gαi2 in Gαi2-MDCK cells was 3.9 ± 0.4-fold (n = 7) increased, and for Q205Lαi2-MDCK the level was of Gαi2 was 1.8 ± 0.2-fold (n = 7) above PC-MDCK cells. To confirm that constitutively activated Gαi2 was expressed in these transfected MDCK cells, we utilized a tryptic cleavage analysis of Gαi2 (Fig. 2). This technique has been widely utilized as an indicator of Gα subunit conformation (23Denker B.M. Schmidt C.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9998-10002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Denker B.M. Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6272-6277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is based on the observation that Gα subunits have a different cleavage pattern depending on whether they are folded into an active or inactive conformation. In the active conformation (GTP-liganded), there is only a single tryptic site accessible near the N terminus (approximately Arg21) resulting in a slightly truncated protein (39 kDa instead of 41 kDa for Gαi2). In the inactive (GDP-liganded) conformation, an additional site becomes accessible in the α2 helix or switch region (near Arg209) resulting in peptides of approximately 25 and 17 kDa. Fig. 2 demonstrates the tryptic cleavage patterns of cell homogenates from each of the transfected cell lines (PC-, Gαi2-, and Q205Lαi2-MDCK cells). In PC- and Gαi2-transfected cells, untreated Gαi2migrates at 41 kDa (first lane of each set) and is stabilized in the active conformation (39 kDa) if preincubated with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTPγS (last lane of each set). However, in the absence of added nucleotide (middle lane of each set) the Gα subunits should be GDP bound from endogenous GTP/GDP in the cell, and Gαi2 is cleaved into 25- and 17-kDa fragments with no detectable 39-kDa peptide. The 25-kDa fragment (derived from the N terminus) is not detectable with the AS7 antibody, and the 17-kDa fragment is more labile (25Neer E.J. Lok J.M. Wolf L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14222-14229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and consequently is not well visualized on these blots (not shown). Tryptic digestion of Q205Lαi2-transfected cells shows that in the absence of added nucleotide (middle lane), there is a fraction of Gαi2 that is tryptic-resistant, indicating persistence of Gαi2 in an “active” conformation. The amount of Gαi2 in the active conformation of Q205Lαi2-MDCK cells is a small fraction of the starting material. This is due, in part, to the observation that Gα subunits with mutations that result in an active conformation are more sensitive to proteolysis than wild type Gα subunits activated with GTPγS (20Denker B.M. Boutin P.M. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5544-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, it is necessary to do these studies on whole cell lysates in the absence of protease inhibitors. The Western blots were deliberately overexposed to look for bands migrating at 39 kDa. This analysis confirms expression of constitutively activated Gαi2 in Q205Lαi2-MDCK cells. We have previously demonstrated that WT-MDCK cells express some Gαi2 in the subapical lateral membrane overlapping with ZO-1 (16Denker B.M. Saha C. Khawaja S. Nigam S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25750-25753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility that the transfection process affects Gαi2 localization, PC-MDCK cells were characterized by confocal microscopy. Fig.3 A shows a confocal image of PC-MDCK cells costained with antibodies to ZO-1 and Gαi2(used at 1:25 dilution). The confocal images reveal that Gαi2 partially colocalizes with ZO-1 at the level of the tight junction. There is significant intracellular staining that was also seen in WT-MDCK cells (16Denker B.M. Saha C. Khawaja S. Nigam S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25750-25753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To determine whether transfected Gαi2 subunits were localized in a similar manner to the endogenous Gαi2, the Gαi2 antibody (AS7) was diluted to a point where the endogenous Gαi2 was barely detectable. Fig. 3 B shows a confocal analysis of PC-, Gαi2-, and Q205Lαi2-MDCK stained and analyzed under identical conditions using a 1:100 dilution of the Gαi2 antibody. In panel a, PC-MDCK cells only demonstrate faint intracellular staining, but in panels band c, transfected Gαi2 and Q205Lαi2 can be visualized in the subapical lateral membrane overlapping with the TJ marker, ZO-1. Again, there is intracellular staining that is similar to the endogenous Gαi2 (Fig. 3 A). Overall the pattern of transfected Gαi2 and Q205Lαi2 is very similar to that seen with the endogenous Gαi2 subunits. These results confirm that transfected Gαi2 and Q205Lαi2 partition between the lateral membrane overlapping with the TJ and intracellular compartments. This finding is similar to our prior findings with Gαo-transfected MDCK cells (16Denker B.M. Saha C. Khawaja S. Nigam S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25750-25753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because transfected Gαi2 and Q205Lαi2 were localized in a manner similar to that of the endogenous Gαi2, we next determined whether Gαi2localization in the TJ had any functional consequences for the tight junction. PC-, Gαi2-, and Q205Lαi2-MDCK cells were simultaneously analyzed under steady state conditions and also by using the Ca2+ switch. TJ integrity was followed by measurement of transepithelial resistance. Fig.4 A demonstrates the base-line resistances in these cells and the pattern of TER development after the Ca2+ switch. Overexpressing Gαi2 had a small but insignificant (p = 0.07) effect on base-line resistances in comparison with PC-MDCK cells (576 ± 89versus 377 ± 52; n = 12), but Q205Lαi2-MDCK cells had significantly higher base-line TER values (1187 ± 150 Ω·cm2; p< 0.001). The base-line TER values for Gαi2- and PC-MDCK cells were similar to reported values of Gαo (16Denker B.M. Saha C. Khawaja S. Nigam S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25750-25753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and several clones were analyzed with no significant differences seen among the clones. To gain insight into the mechanism of higher TER values observed in Q205Lαi2-MDCK cells, all three cell lines were simultaneously analyzed in the Ca2+ switch. The elevated TER in Q205Lαi2-MDCK cells could be achieved by differences in the kinetics of TER development. Nonlinear regression analysis of the TER data between 0–12 h for all of the cell lines (Fig. 4 A) indicates an asymptotic approach to peak TER. Although the data do not precisely fit standard kinetic models, the kinetics of TER development in these cells is similar to what has been reported in other studies (15Stuart R.O. Nigam S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6072-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 26Balda M.S. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Matter K. Cereijido M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The time to half-maximal TER is a useful value for discussing the effects of Gαi2expression on TER biogenesis, and these values were calculated for each cell line in the presence and absence of AlF4− (TableI). Table I shows that the time to half-maximal TER (T50) was significantly more rapid in Gαi2- and Q205Lαi2-MDCK cells (0.8 ± 0.3 and 1.2 ± 0.3 h, respectively) in comparison with PC cells (3.0 ± 0.5 h). AlF4− had no significant on Gαi2-transfected cells but significantly shortenedT50 for PC cells (1.1 ± 0.7 h, a value similar to that of Gαi2 cells). The observation that PC-MDCK cells treated with AlF4−develop TER nearly as rapidly as Q205Lαi2-MDCK cells suggests that Gαi2 may be the predominant Gα subunit critical in TER development. Fig. 4 B shows that the base-line TER values for the three cell lines on the day following the Ca2+ switch (26 h) are significantly higher in the presence of ALF4−. In contrast to AlF4− effects on the rate of TER development, all three cell lines had significantly increased base-line TER at 26 h in the presence of AlF4−. Similar effects of AlF4− were seen with the three cell lines cultured in the steady state (not shown). This raises the possibility that AlF4− activates additional Gα subunits in the steady state that enhances transepithelial resistance.Table ISummary of times to half-maximal TER for Gαi2-, Q205Lαi2-, and PC-MDCK cellsTER MaxT50Ω·cm2hGαi25250.8 ± 0.3Gαi2 + AlF4−6000.5 ± 0.4Q205Lαi29751.2 ± 0.3Q205Lαi2 + AlF4−9751.1 ± 0.5PC4503.0 ± 0.5PC + AlF4−7001.1 ± 0.7Ca+2 switch TER data from 0–12 h for each cell line was analyzed by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA).

Taken together, these studies offer direct evidence that Gαi2 is a critical regulator of tight junction biogenesis and affects base-line characteristics of the tight junction. The protein composition of the TJ is complex with one integral membrane protein identified so far (occludin), several peripherally attached proteins with partially defined functions (including ZO-1, -2, and -3) and a variety of signal transduction molecules including PKC isoforms, Gα subunits, and tyrosine kinases (see Ref. 5Denker B.M. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F1-F9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for review). How these diverse proteins function to maintain and regulate the development of tight junctions is not well understood. G proteins could be activated within the TJ through a classical seven-transmembrane receptor (although none yet identified in the TJ) or alternatively through a modulatory protein that promotes GDP release or slows GTP hydrolysis. Additional transmembrane proteins must exist within the TJ (27Saitou M. Fujimoto K. Doi Y. Itoh M. Fujimoto T. Furuse M. Takano H. Noda T. Tsukita S. J.

Trends Biotechnol. 1992; 10: 200-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As expected, MMP activity is highly regulated and includes inhibition by a family of specific protein inhibitors known as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Four TIMPs have now been identified (TIMP-1 to TIMP-4), which are about 190 amino acids in length and share 40–50% sequence identity (3Docherty A.J.P. Lyons A. Smith B.J. Wright E.M. Stephens P.E.

The TIMPs inhibit activated MMPs by forming tight (Kd < 1 nm), 1:1, noncovalent complexes and do not undergo cleavage by the enzymes (7Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The TIMPs show relatively little selectivity in binding to the MMPs, but substantial differences have been reported for their binding to members of the recently discovered membrane-bound MMP family (8Will H.

The TIMPs appear to consist of two domains, although only the N-terminal one has been shown to form a stable, autonomously folded unit (N-TIMP). This domain, encompassing about two-thirds of the molecule and including three of the six disulfide bonds, retains full inhibitory activity and is able to form stable tight complexes with MMP catalytic domains (9Murphy G. Houbrechts A. Cockett M.I. Williamson R.A. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8097-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Previously, we were able to determine a low resolution solution structure for N-TIMP-2 (127 residues) using only two- and three-dimensional 1H NMR data (10Williamson R.A. Martorell G. Carr M.D. Murphy G. Docherty A.J.P. Freedman R.B. Feeney J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11745-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); this revealed the backbone topology of the molecule and surprisingly identified it as a member of the oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding protein fold family (11Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). These studies were carried out using recombinant N-TIMP-2 produced in mammalian cells. To obtain a high resolution solution structure for N-TIMP-2, it was necessary to produce uniformly15N- and 15N/13C-labeled N-TIMP-2. This was recently achieved by expression of the protein inEscherichia coli grown on labeled minimal medium followed by refolding of the labeled N-TIMP-2 from inclusion bodies (12Williamson R.A. Natalia D. Gee C.K. Murphy G. Carr M.D. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this paper we report both the high resolution solution structure of N-TIMP-2 and the mapping of its binding site for the catalytic domain of human stromelysin-1 (N-MMP-3), both of which were achieved using double and triple-resonance heteronuclear NMR-based methods. Recently, a crystal structure for the complex formed between TIMP-1 and N-MMP-3 has been reported (13Gomis-Ruth F.-X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourne G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The coordinates of this model have been made available by the authors and a comparison with the high resolution structure reported here for N-TIMP-2 reveals several notable differences between the structures for bound TIMP-1 and free N-TIMP-2. For example, the extended β-hairpin formed from strands A and B in N-TIMP-2 allows this region to make extensive interactions with N-MMP-3, which are simply not possible for TIMP-1 and may form the basis for the selectivity reported for membrane bound MMPs (8Will H. Atkinson S.J. Bulter G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In addition, the well defined loop connecting β-strands C and D in N-TIMP-2 would need to undergo a substantial conformational change on binding to N-MMP-3 if TIMP-2 is to interact with the catalytic domain in a manner analogous to TIMP-1. The following protein samples were prepared as described previously: nonisotopically enriched and uniformly 15N- or 15N/13C-labeled N-TIMP-2, N-MMP-3, and complexes formed between N-TIMP-2 and N-MMP-3 (10Williamson R.A.

The NMR experiments were carried out on 0.6-ml samples of 1.5–3.0 mm nonisotopically enriched, 1.7 mm15N-labeled and 1.4 mm15N/13C-labeled N-TIMP-2 dissolved in 25 mm sodium phosphate and 100 mm potassium chloride at pH 6.7. In the case of the15N/13C-labeled N-TIMP-2·unlabeled N-MMP-3 complex, spectra were recorded from 0.9 ml samples of 0.6 mm complex in 5 mm deuterated imidazole, 100 mm sodium chloride, and 5 mm calcium chloride at pH 6.7 using 8-mm Shigemi tubes. The NMR samples were prepared in either 100% D2O or 90% H2O, 10% D2O as appropriate. All NMR experiments were performed on Varian Unity and UnityPlus spectrometers operating at 500 and 600 MHz, with all the data collected in phase-sensitive mode using the method of States (17States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar) and at a temperature of 35 or 40 °C.

In the case of the N-TIMP-2·N-MMP-3 complex, experiments carried out were two-dimensional 15N/1H HSQC, two-dimensional13C/1H HMQC, three-dimensional15N/13C/1H HNCA and CBCA(CO)NH (25Norwood T.J.

Soc. 1992; 114: 6291-6293Crossref Scopus (923) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional spectra were recorded over about 65 h with acquisition times in the indirect dimensions (F1 of F2) of 9.4–15.5 ms for 15N, 6–11.3 ms for13C, and 18.7–24.6 ms for 1H, as appropriate, and in the real time domain of 48–128 ms. Water suppression in the experiments was achieved by using the pulsed-field gradient-based WATERGATE method (28Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Two- and three-dimensional NMR data were processed essentially as described previously (10Williamson R.A. Martorell G.

Pfeifer J. Bax A. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11446) Google Scholar). All the spectra were analyzed on-screen using the program XEASY (31Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Würthrich K. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Structurally significant intra- and interresidue NOEs were identified in three-dimensional15N/1H NOESY-HSQC, three-dimensional13C/1H HMQC-NOESY, and two-dimensional NOESY spectra of N-TIMP-2 recorded with mixing times of 125 ms. The relationship between NOE intensity and interproton distance was calibrated using NOEs corresponding to known distances in regular β-sheet and α-helical regions of N-TIMP-2, and on this basis the NOEs were converted to upper distance constraints using the program CALIBA (32Guntert P. Braun W. Würthrich K. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref Scopus (912) Google Scholar) with the maximum upper distance limit set to 6 Å. Where appropriate, standard distance corrections were applied to constraints involving methyl and aromatic ring protons (33Wüthrich K. NMR of Protein and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar, 34Wüthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). In addition, where spectral overlap prevented reliable determination of volumes for NOE cross-peaks the distance constraints were set to the upper limit of 6 Å. The ratios of diagonal to cross-peak volumes in HNHA spectrum allowed reliable 3 JHN-Hα coupling constants (±1 Hz) to be determined for 100 residues of N-TIMP-2. In addition, the relative intensities of the HN to Hβ cross-peaks in the HNHB spectrum allowed 37 3 JN-Hβcoupling constants to be estimated as either large (−5 ± 0.5 Hz) or small (−1 ± 0.5 Hz). This coupling constant data together with intraresidue and sequential NOEs were used as input for the program HABAS (32Guntert P. Braun W. Würthrich K. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref Scopus (912) Google Scholar), which produced 89 φ, 89 ψ, and 42 χ1 torsion angle constraints. The high resolution solution structure of N-TIMP-2 was calculated with the program DYANA (35Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Würthrich K. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref Scopus (2550) Google Scholar), which uses simulated annealing combined with torsion angle dynamics. The simulated annealing protocol used consisted of a high temperature conformational search stage of 2000 steps, followed by slow cooling over 8000 steps, with conjugate gradient minimization at the end. To maximize the number of converged structures obtained from an initial set of 100 random starting coordinates, each stage of the calculations also included 5 cycles of the REDAC procedure. The set of NMR-derived structural constraints used for the final N-TIMP-2 calculations was the result of several cycles of an interactive process that involved using converged N-TIMP-2 structures from the previous generation of calculations to assign NOEs that were ambiguous with chemical shift information alone. In addition, these preliminary N-TIMP-2 structures, together with3 JN-Hβb coupling constant and rotating frame Overhauser effect data, were used to determine stereospecific assignments and χ1 angles for more residues. At each stage in the calculation cycle new generations of N-TIMP-2 structures were calculated from 100 random starting coordinates, with the additional information obtained now included. In the final stages of the N-TIMP-2 structure refinement, additional distance constraints were included in the calculations corresponding to NMR determined hydrogen bonds between backbone amide and carbonyl groups. Hydrogen bonds were included only for residues whose amide proton was detectable after at least 1 h in D2O and where the distance between the hydrogen bond acceptor and donor atoms was less than 2.5 Å and the NH—O bond angle greater than 135°. For each hydrogen bond identified in N-TIMP-2, appropriate lower and upper distance limits were used to constrain NH to O to 1.8–2.3 Å and N to O to 2.4–3.3 Å. The solution structure of N-TIMP-2 was determined using a total of 3413 NMR-derived structural constraints (26.8/residue), including 3132 NOE-based upper distance limits (672 intraresidue, 784 sequential (i,i + 1), 602 medium-range (i, i ≤ 4), and 1074 long range (i, i ≥ 5)), 56 hydrogen bonding constraints corresponding to 14 protein backbone hydrogen bonds and 220 torsion angle constraints (89 φ, 89 ψ, and 42 χ1). In addition, the calculations included a further 18 distance constraints for the three disulfide bonds (Cys1–Cys72, Cys3–Cys101, and Cys13–Cys126) previously mapped in N-TIMP-2 and TIMP-1 (10Williamson R.A. Martorell G. Carr M.D. Murphy G. Docherty A.J.P. Freedman R.B. Feeney J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11745-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 36Williamson R.A. Marston F.A.O. Angal S.

Stereospecific assignment information was incorporated for three glycine α- protons, 37 β-, 12 γ-, 3 δ-, and 6 ε-methylene groups and 5 γ- and 3 δ-methyl groups. After the final round of DYANA calculations, 49 satisfactorily converged N-TIMP-2 structures were obtained from 100 random starting conformations. The converged structures contain no distance constraint or van der Waals violations greater than 0.5 Å and no dihedral angle violations greater than 5°. The sums of the violations for upper distance limits, lower distance limits, van der Waals contacts, and torsion angle constraints were 64.9 ± 1.5 Å, 0.8 ± 0.2 Å, 34.6 ± 1.1 Å, and 40.7 ± 4.9o, respectively. Similarly, maximum violations for the converged structures were 0.42 ± 0.04 Å, 0.19 ± 0.05 Å, 0.35 ± 0.04 Å, and 3.8 ± 0.6o, respectively. The solution structure of N-TIMP-2 is determined to very high precision, which is reflected in very low root mean squared deviation values for both backbone and all heavy atom coordinates of 0.38 ± 0.06 and 0.74 ± 0.08 Å, respectively, for the family of 49 converged structures. The residue by residue distribution of the NOEs identified for N-TIMP-2 is shown in Fig. 1. The observed NOEs are distributed relatively evenly throughout the protein, with only residues near the N (Cys1-Ser2) and C termini (His120–Tyr122 and Gly125–Glu127) and in three short stretches corresponding to Ser68–Ala70, Gly79-Gly80, and Gly92–Gly94 showing significantly fewer than average NOEs. The backbone amide signals for Cys1, Ser2, and Ser68–Val71 were not detectable in the NMR spectra, which may in part account for the lack of NOEs involving these residues. The topology of the protein backbone in the high resolution solution structure of N-TIMP-2 is shown in Fig. 2,A and C. The locations of the elements of regular secondary structure are identical to those described for our low resolution structure of N-TIMP-2 determined previously (10Williamson R.A. Martorell G. Carr M.D. Murphy G. Docherty A.J.P. Freedman R.B. Feeney J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11745-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), with the exception that strand C is extended to include Ala66. The most striking feature of the protein remains the closed, five-stranded β-barrel, which is formed from β-strands A (Val17–Asp34), B (Asn38–Phe53), C (Phe62–Ala66), D (Tyr84–Glu91), and E (Lys95–Ile98). The β-hairpin involving strands A and B, together with strands C and D, forms a classic Greek Key motif, with the β-barrel closed by strand E, which runs parallel to strand C and antiparallel to strand D. The short strand F (Val105–Trp107) can really be considered a continuation of strand E with the disulfide-bonded loop formed by residues Thr99–Ile104 separating the two parts. The two α-helices present in N-TIMP-2 (Pro8–Asn14 and Thr112–Leu118) run essentially parallel to each other and pack side by side against the face of the β-barrel formed by the N-terminal residues of strands A and D, the C-terminal residues of strand B, and strand F. The majority of the backbone dihedral angles in the high resolution N-TIMP-2 structures are very well defined with order parameters of greater than 0.9 (37Hyberts S.G. Goldberg M.S. Havel T.F. Wagner G. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 736-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), however, the first two N-terminal residues (Cys1-Ser2) and a few others (Glu61, Ala90, Asp102) are significantly less ordered. Many side chain dihedral angles (χ1, χ2, etc.) are also well defined (Fig.2 B), not only for residues located in the core of the protein, but also for some surface residues such as Val6, Glu28, and Gln123. Examination of the Ramachandran plot obtained for the family of N-TIMP-2 structures (Fig.3) reveals that almost all residues adopt favorable values of φ and ψ, although 6 residues (Lys41, Gln49, Val78, Ala90, Trp107, and Ser111) adopt nonpreferred backbone dihedral angles. Analysis of the high resolution N-TIMP-2 structures revealed that the side chain of Cys101 adopts two distinct conformational groups with χ1 angles centered around −130oand −30o (Fig. 2, A and B). This local conformational variability in the N-TIMP-2 structures may be a reflection of insufficient NMR data for this residue, or alternatively it may indicate real conformational heterogeneity in the protein. Comparison of the high resolution structures reported here with the family of low resolution structures determined previously for N-TIMP-2 (10Williamson R.A. Martorell G. Carr M.D. Murphy G. Docherty A.J.P. Freedman R.B. Feeney J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11745-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) reveals that the β-barrels have a very similar topology with an average root mean squared deviation of 2.06 ± 0.02 Å for the backbone atoms. However, the orientation of helix-2 (Thr112–Leu118) with respect to the rest of the protein is substantially different in the high resolution N-TIMP-2 structures with helix-2 running almost parallel to and packing against helix-1 (Pro8–Asn14; Fig. 2, A andC). The improved definition of the helix-2 orientation can be attributed to a very significant increase in the number of NOE-derived distance constraints obtained for residues in helix-1 and -2, in particular, from the 13C/1H HMQC-NOESY spectra. Apart from the orientation of helix-2, the low resolution structure reported previously for N-TIMP-2 has proved to be essentially correct and has already been very successful in guiding and interpreting site-directed mutagenesis work (38Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The binding site for the catalytic domain of stromelysin-1 (N-MMP-3) on N-TIMP-2 was mapped by analyzing the changes in chemical shifts of backbone HN, N, and Cα resonances of N-TIMP-2 that occur on formation of the N-TIMP-2·N-MMP-3 complex. The chemical shifts of signals from NMR active nuclei depend on their environment, hence this approach identifies residues in N-TIMP-2 that undergo an environmental change on MMP binding, either due to close proximity to bound N-MMP-3 or as a consequence of a binding-induced conformational change in the protein. Sequence-specific 15N,13C, and 1H backbone resonance assignments were obtained for 87% of the residues in13C/15N-labeled N-TIMP-2 bound to unlabeled N-MMP-3 by analysis of spectra from three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH and HNCA experiments. No signals could be identified from the backbone amide groups of Cys1–Ser4, Asn14, Ile35, Ile40, Ser68–Ala70, Cys72, Ser75, Thr112, Thr113, His120, and Arg121. The inability to detect these resonances for N-TIMP-2 in the complex probably arises because they are significantly exchange broadened compared with signals from other backbone groups in the protein. Interestingly, many of these signals are also not detected in free N-TIMP-2, in particular the two stretches around the C1-C72 disulfide bond (Cys1–Ser4 and Ser68–Cys72). We previously proposed that these signals could be broadened due to intermediate exchange between different local conformations (10Williamson R.A. Martorell G. Carr M.D. Murphy G. Docherty A.J.P. Freedman R.B. Feeney J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11745-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Williamson R.A. Carr M.D. Frenkiel T.A. Feeney J. Freedman R.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13882-13889Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To identify N-TIMP-2 signals perturbed by N-MMP-3 binding, the backbone assignments for bound N-TIMP-2 were compared with those determined for the free protein and the chemical shift change noted for each signal. The shifts in backbone amide 15N and α carbon13C signals were then scaled to take some account for the difference in spectral dispersion compared with backbone amide1H signals giving a more equal weighting to each data set (15N range 130–107 = 23 ppm; 13C range 67–44 = 23 ppm; 1H range 10.1–6.9 = 3.2 ppm; giving a correction factor of 0.14 for both 15N and13C signals). Correction in this manner allows an average change in backbone chemical shift to be calculated for each residue in N-TIMP-2, results of which are shown in Fig.4. Examination of the chemical shift differences clearly identifies 8 residues in N-TIMP-2 whose backbone signals undergo large chemical shift changes on complex formation, specifically Ser32, Tyr36, Ile40, Lys41, Ala70, Val71, Gly73, and Cys101. These residues fall into three distinct regions of the protein: (i) the end of strand A, the AB loop, and the beginning of strand B (Glu28–Lys41); (ii) Ala70–Gly73 in the long loop between strands C and D, which is disulfide-bonded to Cys1 through Cys72; and (iii) in the loop between strands E and F (His97–Ile104), which is also linked to the N terminus by the Cys3–Cys101 disulfide bond. Val71 showed the largest chemical shift changes, more than twice as large as those of any other residue, whereas signals from about 70% of the residues in N-TIMP-2 showed no appreciable chemical shift changes on complex formation. Fig. 5 shows a space-filled view of N-TIMP-2 in which residues are color-coded according to the changes in average backbone chemical shift observed on N-MMP-3 binding (red > 0.20 ppm, yellow > 0.05 ppm, blue < 0.05 ppm, and white unknown). This clearly shows that the MMP binding site is formed from the region around the Cys1–Cys72 and Cys3–Cys101 disulfide bonds, which connect loops CD and EF to the N terminus, and by the prominent β-hairpin involving residues Glu28–Lys41 that links strands A and B (Figs. 2 C and 5). Although no chemical shift data were obtained for Cys1–Ser4, the central position of these residues in the NMR-mapped MMP binding site clearly suggests that they play a key role in TIMP-MMP interactions. Further evidence for the location of the MMP binding site on N-TIMP-2 comes from analysis of chemical shift changes for methyl groups in N-TIMP-2. Sequence-specific 1H and 13C resonance assignments for methyl groups in bound N-TIMP-2 were made from three-dimensional 13C/1H HMQC-NOESY spectra of the 15N/13C-labeled N-TIMP-2·unlabeled N-MMP-3 complex, using the α and β carbon assignments obt"
https://openalex.org/W2047063931,"Agonist-bound heptahelical receptors activate heterotrimeric G proteins by catalyzing exchange of GDP for GTP on their α subunits. In search of an approximation of the receptor-α subunit complex, we have considered the properties of A326S Giα1, a mutation discovered originally in Gsα (Iiri, T., Herzmark, P., Nakamoto, J. M., Van Dop, C., and Bourne, H. R. (1994) Nature 371, 164–168) that mimics the effect of receptor on nucleotide exchange. The mutation accelerates dissociation of GDP from the αi1β1γ2 heterotrimer by 250-fold. Nevertheless, affinity of mutant Giα1 for GTPγS is high in the presence of Mg2+, and the mutation has no effect on the intrinsic GTPase activity of the α subunit. The mutation also uncouples two activities of βγ: stabilization of the GDP-bound α subunit (which is retained) and retardation of GDP dissociation from the heterotrimer (which is lost). For wild-type and mutant Giα1, βγ prevents irreversible inactivation of the α subunit at 30 °C. However, the mutation accelerates irreversible inactivation of α at 37 °C despite the presence of βγ. Structurally, the mutation weakens affinity for GTPγS by steric crowding: a 2-fold increase in the number of close contacts between the protein and the purine ring of the nucleotide. By contrast, we observe no differences in structure at the GDP binding site between wild-type heterotrimers and those containing A326S Giα1. However, the GDP binding site is only partially occupied in crystals of G protein heterotrimers containing A326S Giα1. In contrast to original speculations about the structural correlates of receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange, rapid dissociation of GDP can be observed in the absence of substantial structural alteration of a Gα subunit in the GDP-bound state."

In vertebrates, two isoenzymes of these low molecular weight PTPases are commonly expressed.

A wide variety of cellular processes are linked by cascades of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins, catalyzed by enzymes that set up subtly balanced molecular signals that regulate the rhythms of the cell. These enzymes encompass a large group of kinases and phosphatases that modify serine/threonine or tyrosine residues on other enzymes, receptors, transcription factors, and binding proteins. Several major groups of phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) 1The abbreviations used are: PTPasephosphotyrosine phosphataseBPTPbovine low molecular weight phosphotyrosine phosphataseHCPTPA and HCPTPBtwo isoenzymes of human low molecular weight phosphotyrosine phosphataseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. enzymes have been extensively studied. A high molecular weight PTPase family includes the receptor-like PTPases, such as CD45 and LAR, and nonreceptor PTPases, such as PTP1B and Yersinia PTPase. The sequence identity within the 30-kDa catalytic domain of these enzymes is roughly 30–40%, in contrast to the presence of little apparent conservation in the remainder of the sequence, and suggests a highly conserved catalytic domain. Crystallographic studies of these PTPases as well as a so-called dual specificity enzyme showed that their catalytic domains indeed share a high degree of structure homology (1Stuckey J.A.

The low molecular weight PTPases are a distinctive class of soluble proteins with an Mr of approximately 18,000 (6Zhang M. Stauffacher C.V. Van Etten R.L. Merlevede W. Advances in Protein Phosphatases. 9. Leuven University Press, Leuven, Belgium1995: 1-23Google Scholar,7Ramponi G. Merlevede W. Advances in Protein Phosphatases. 8.

These PTPases, which are highly conserved among themselves and have been identified and isolated from a wide variety of sources, exhibit no apparent sequence homology with the high molecular weight PTPases, with the exception of the PTPase signature sequence CXXXXXR(S/T) at the phosphate binding site (6Zhang M. Stauffacher C.V. Van Etten R.L. Merlevede W. Advances in Protein Phosphatases. 9. Leuven University Press, Leuven, Belgium1995: 1-23Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although the crystallographic and solution structures of the bovine low molecular weight PTPase (8Zhang M. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V.

Stauffacher C.V. Van Etten R.L. Merlevede W. Advances in Protein Phosphatases. 9. Leuven University Press, Leuven, Belgium1995: 1-23Google Scholar). A recent high resolution structure of a transition state analog complex of the bovine enzyme established that enhanced hydrogen bonding to the equatorial oxygens of the trigonal bipyramid occurs in the transition state, enforced by the relative rigidity of the phosphate binding loop (11Zhang M. Zhou M. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The similarities in the active sites of other PTPases suggests a highly similar catalytic mechanism. In contrast to the mechanistic similarities, the substrate specificities of the various high and low molecular weight PTPases differ markedly. Moreover, even within a specific PTPase class, structural variations lead to the existence of isoenzymes that may exhibit different catalytic properties. Distinctive isoenzymes of the human low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatase have been identified (12Yoshihara C.M. Mohrenweiser H.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1980; 32: 898-907PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dissing J. Johnsen A. Sensabaugh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20619-20625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Dissing J. Johnsen A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on protein and cDNA sequencing, activity studies, and mRNA blotting, it is now clear that the human enzyme known as erythrocyte acid phosphatase (E.C.3.1.3.2) is actually a PTPase and is present in all major human tissues (15Hopkinson D.A. Spencer N. Harris H. Nature. 1963; 199: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 16Waheed A. Laidler P.M. Wo Y.-Y.P. Van Etten R.L.

In human populations, this phosphatase exhibits stable polymorphisms and so has attained a major role as a forensic and genetic marker (18Cavalli-Sforza L. Menozzi P. Piazza A.

A large structural modification defines two major groups of isoenzymes, namely an alternative sequence segment corresponding to amino acid residues 40–73 in the mature human protein (13Dissing J.

This segment, which we refer to as the variable loop, affects a number of physical and catalytic properties of the isoenzymes (22Dissing J. Rangaard B. Christensen U. Biochim. Biophys.

Genomics. 1995; 30: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and gives rise to the two major isoenzyme forms termed “fast” and “slow” on the basis of their electrophoretic mobility (15Hopkinson D.A. Spencer N. Harris H. Nature. 1963; 199: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the human PTPases, the fast and slow electrophoretic forms correspond to the isoenzymes HCPTPA and HCPTPB (17Wo Y.-Y.P. McCormack A.L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Davis J.P. Mitchell G.L. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10856-10865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From their differences in behavior toward substrates and inhibitors, it appears possible that the two isoenzymes may have different natural substrates and perform different physiological functions. In addition to substrate specificity differences between these two isoenzymes, some residues that are conserved in the isoenzymes show different intrinsic properties. In the human isoenzyme HCPTPB and the bovine low molecular weight PTPase (BPTP), both His-66 and His-72 have unusually high pKa values, 8.36 and 9.19, respectively (23Zhou M.-M. Davis J.P. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8479-8486Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Based on the BPTP structure, it was proposed (8Zhang M. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11097-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) that two acidic residues (Glu-23 and Asp-42) located near His-72 and an acidic residue (Glu-139) found near His-66 were primarily responsible for altering the pKa values of the two histidine residues, and this has been confirmed in a detailed experimental and theoretical examination (27Tishmack P.A. Bashford D. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11984-11994Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In HCPTPA, His-72 also has an anomalously high pKa of 9.23. In contrast, the pKa of His-66 is 7.67, which is close to that of free histidine in solution despite the fact that Glu-139 is conserved in HCPTPA (23Zhou M.-M. Davis J.P. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8479-8486Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, the structural basis for this pKa alteration of His-66 in HCPTPA was unknown. To provide the basis for answering these and other questions related to the cellular role of this enzyme, we describe here the first three-dimensional structure of a human low molecular weight PTPase isoenzyme, HCPTPA (human red cell fast form) and compare this with the previously reported structure of BPTP (a protein that is expected to most closely resemble the human red cell slow electrophoretic form) (8Zhang M. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11097-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9Su X.-D. Taddei N. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Nordlund P.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11087-11096Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These enzymes have been solved in complex with the sulfonate inhibitors, MES, and HEPES, respectively. HCPTPA was purified using a previously described procedure (17Wo Y.-Y.P. McCormack A.L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Davis J.P. Mitchell G.L. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10856-10865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rod-shaped crystals (0.1 × 0.1 × 0.8 mm) were produced in hanging drops with a 10 mg/ml solution of HCPTPA, 30% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (Mr 5000), and 200 mm (NH4)2SO4 in 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5 as the well solution, using microseeding techniques with crushed clusters of small spontaneous HCPTPA crystals grown under the same conditions. HCPTPA crystallized in the orthorhombic space group, P212121, with unit-cell parameters of a = 34.1 Å, b = 56.6 Å, andc = 97.3 Å. Assuming 1 molecule/asymmetric unit, the calculated VM is 2.61 Å3/Da. The HCPTPA crystals diffracted to beyond 2.2 Å resolution and were stable for approximately 8 h in the beam. X-ray diffraction data from HCPTPA crystals were collected on a R-Axis IIC imaging plate system (Molecular Structure Corp.) mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode x-ray generator operating at 50 kV, 100 mA. Diffraction data were measured from two crystals with a 1.0° oscillation angle and 120-mm crystal detector distance. All data were indexed and integrated using the program Denzo and merged and scaled together with the program Scalepack (28Otwinowski A. Data Collection and Processing. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1993: 56-62Google Scholar). The initial structure determination was done with data to 2.2 Å taken from a single crystal (80% complete). Rotation and translation function searches were performed with these data in the program AMoRe (29Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1987; 43: 645-653Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) using as the model the complete bovine heart PTPase structure (8Zhang M. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11097-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). An 8.0–2.3 Å cross-rotation function search with a radius of integration of 20 Å and an angular step size of 1.5° produced a unique solution at α = 147.94°, β = 81.81°, and γ = 207.31°. The Crowther and Blow translation function identified the optimal translation at x = 0.07706, y = 0.09339, and z = 0.12038. The R-factor calculated from AMoRe after rigid-body refinement was 37.6%. This rotation function solution was used to produce an electron density map for HCPTPA at 2.2 Å into which a model was built. After three rounds of rebuilding in 2Fo-Fc maps and omit 2Fo-Fc maps, the model was put into refinement in XPLOR (30Brunger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) with an initial R-factor of 33.5% for data from 20 to 2.8 Å (35.8% for data to 2.2 Å). The model was refined using simulated annealing followed by positional refinement and cycles of refitting. With individual B-factors, the refinement converged to an R-factor to 2.8 Å of 20.0% with an R-free of 32.2% for 355 reflections (9% total measured reflections). The reflection data to 2.2 Å were then included in the refinement, and a similar protocol followed with the addition of 82 water molecules (R-factor of 18.6% and R-free of 25.4%). A MES molecule was found in this improved map, bound to the active site, and built into the density. At this stage, additional data were taken from a second large crystal, resulting in a 2.2 Å data set that was 92% complete. Refinement in XPLOR using the data to 2.2 Å was repeated starting with the unrefined HCPTPA model. The resulting structure showed only minor changes from the previously refined model, although the density maps were significantly improved. The final refined model of HCPTPA consisted of 157 amino acids, 82 water molecules, and 1 MES molecule and had an R-factor of 18.1% and R-free of 24.8%. The first four amino acids at the N terminus and the last two amino acids at the C terminus have poor electron density. The final refined model possessed good geometry with r.m.s. deviations of bond length of 0.015 Å and bond angle of 2.018°. The average temperature factor for the protein (residues 5 to 157) is 22.9 Å2 for the main chain and 27.0 Å2 for side chains. The Ramachandran plot showed no outliers and demonstrated that more than 90% of the residues were in the most favored regions.

Open table in a new tab The overall topology of the human low molecular weight PTPase isoenzyme A (Fig. 2) closely resembles that of the bovine enzyme (r.m.s. deviation of Cαs is 0.42 Å). Like the structure of BPTP, the structure of HCPTPA consists of a four-stranded central parallel β sheet with flanking α helices on both sides, showing two right-handed βαβ motifs. The active site of HCPTPA is located at the C-terminal end of β1 of the central, parallel β sheet and at the N terminus of the first α helix (α1). The consensus PTPase sequence motif CXXXXXR(S/T), which is present as the sequence CLGNICRS in HCPTPA, forms a loop connecting the first β strand and the first turn of the helix α1 in the structure (Fig. 2). HCPTPA does not contain the typical glycine-rich P-loop or Walker-A sequence motif associated with nucleotide-binding proteins (31Schulz G.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 61-67Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar), but the active site sequence folds into a peptide backbone arrangement that is identical to that of a P-loop structure (8Zhang M. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11097-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 32Evans B. Tishmack P.A. Pokalsky C. Zhang M. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13609-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the crystal of HCPTPA, a MES molecule was found at the active site, with its sulfonate moiety sitting in the phosphate binding pocket. Three oxygens on the sulfonate group form multiple hydrogen bonds with the NHs on the backbone of the active site loop as well as the nitrogens of the side chain of the conserved Arg-18 in a fashion similar to that of the phosphate bound in the active site of the original BPTP structure (8Zhang M. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11097-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The BPTP structure complexed with a similar sulfonate derivative, HEPES, was also solved using difference Fourier techniques (11Zhang M. Zhou M. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Both MES and HEPES molecules were found to be well ordered in the structures with average temperature factors of 29.3 Å2 and 39.3 Å2, respectively, as shown by the electron density of the MES and HEPES molecules (Fig.3). The sulfonate moiety in both MES and HEPES showed even lower average temperature factors, 22.9 Å2 in MES and 18.8 Å2 in HEPES, which is very close to the average temperature factor of the backbone of the active site. Although the active site loops of HCPTPA and BPTP are virtually superimposable, the relative positions of the structure of MES and HEPES at the active site are not identical (Fig.4). In both cases, the sulfonate moiety sits in the center of the active site loop, but the orientation of the six-membered rings differ by a 60 degree relative rotation. However, because the MES molecule is located in one of the intermolecular contact sites in the crystal, the position of the MES molecule could be strongly influenced by crystallographic packing and may not represent its natural position in solution.Figure 32Fo-Fc electron density for MES and HEPES in the structures of HCPTPA and BPTP. In each case the view shown is perpendicular to the inhibitor ring. Residues immediately surrounding these sulfonate inhibitors are shown, including the Arg-18 of the active-site loop. The density for the inhibitors is contoured at a level corresponding to that of the protein (1.5ς) and indicates that both molecules are well-ordered in the structure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4The active sites of the structures of HCPTPA and BPTP in complex with sulfonate inhibitors. Shown here are the active-site loop (in red), a portion of the variable loop containing residues 50 and 53, one of the aromatic claws (residue 49), and a portion of the loop between β4 and α5, which contains the other two aromatics (Tyr-131 and -132). The overall backbone arrangement at the active site and the positions of 131,132 are identical for the two isoenzymes. In the HCPTPA structure, Tyr-49 forms an interaction with the inhibitor, MES, stacking face to edge with the morpholino ring, whereas in the BPTP structure, Trp-49 does not appear to interact with the bound inhibitor, HEPES. The residues, 50 and 53, located on the variable loop bordering the active site, also change in nature, altering the charge surface on one wall of the crevice near the active site from negative in HCPTPA (Glu-50/Asn-53) to positive in BPTP (Asn-50/Arg-53).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Close examination of the surrounding residues near His-66 in the structure of HCPTPA also provided the explanation of why His-66 has a relatively normal pKa of 7.67, compared with that of His-66 in BPTP, which is 8.36. In BPTP, an acidic residue (Glu-139) was found near His-66 and therefore was proposed to be responsible for the altered pKa (8Zhang M. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11097-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Tishmack P.A. Bashford D. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11984-11994Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although Glu-139 is conserved between the two enzymes, the amino acids that surround this residue in the three-dimensional structure are clearly different. In the HCPTPA structure, an arginine (Arg-65) appears to interact with Glu-139. In the BPTP structure, residue 65 is an asparagine and is too distant to interact with Glu-139. It is likely that the negative charge on Glu-139 is shared between His-66 and Arg-65, resulting in a relatively normal pKa for His-66. Biochemical studies have shown that the isoenzyme class containing HCPTPB and BPTP often behaves very differently toward substrates than does the HCPTPA isoenzyme. This includes not only reactivity to small synthetic substrates but also toward more physiological protein targets. For example, HCPTPA exhibited a much higher activity, as compared with HCPTPB and BPTP, toward phosphotyrosyl angiotensin II, RR-src, and myelin basic protein (TableII). An examination of the surface structure and charge distribution indicates a structural source for some of the differences between the isoenzymes and their binding of the substrates and inhibitors. Effectively, all of the amino acid variations of the two isoenzymes occur on one side of the molecule (to the right in Figs. 2 B and5 A), indicating that this portion of the PTPase structure could be an important site for the interaction between the enzyme and its physiological substrate or other biological targets. One of the most striking features of the low molecular weight PTPase structures in this region is a shallow crevice leading from one side of the molecule into the active site (Fig.5 A). The variable loop, which determines the isoenzyme type, forms one wall and the floor of this crevice, whereas the loop between β4 and α5, which contains the catalytically critical Asp-129 (33Zhang Z. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25947-25950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), forms the other wall. A set of three aromatic residues (Tyr-49, Tyr-131, Tyr-132) reaches out like claws from either wall near the active site. The structure of the variable loop in this region is quite rigidly determined by a proline-proline sequence in the crevice floor of HCPTPA, together with a set of hydrogen bonds that align the residues along the crevice walls (Fig. 5B). A β kink with a type II hydrogen bond in the variable loop positions residues 50 and 53 pointing toward the crevice and places the aromatic residue at 49 into a position above the active site. Toward the C-terminal end of this structure, two of the conserved residues in the variable loop, Asp-56 and Arg-58, form a set of hydrogen bonds with the backbone of the β4-α5 loop. This interaction positions the aromatic claws of Tyr-131 and -132 on the opposite side of the active site, forming a hydrophobic wall against which the phosphorylated tyrosine ring of the substrate would be expected to lie.Table IISpecific activity (units/mg) of low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatases toward phosphorylated peptides and proteins (24Wo W.-Y.P.

Open table in a new tab The differences between the HCPTPA and BPTP structures in these regions suggests residues critical for substrate recognition. The variable loop residue 49, which is Tyr in HCPTPA and Trp in BPTP (and HCPTP), forms one of the aromatic claws located above the active site. Differences in the positions of these two residues appear to parallel the differences in the ring position of the bound sulfonate inhibitor (Fig. 4). In the BPTP complex, the side chain of Trp-49 extends away from the active site and does not appear to interact with HEPES molecule. In contrast, in the HCPTPA complex, the side chain of Tyr-49 flips back into the active-site pocket and stacks face to edge with the morpholino ring of the MES molecule. This holds the ring of the MES molecule in the active site, sandwiched between Tyr-49 on one side and Tyr-131 and Tyr-132 on the other. The position of the two aromatic residues on the opposite side of the active site is identical in both structures, with edge-to-face interactions between all three rings. We believe that the hydrophobic sandwich seen in these low molecular weight PTPase structures may reflect the binding of the ring portion of the natural phosphotyrosine substrate. It has also been reported that Tyr-131 and -132 can be transiently phosphorylated and can themselves serve as substrates for a second molecule of phosphatase (34Tailor P. Gilman J. Williams S. Couture C. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5371-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible control mechanism associated with these active-site residues. An examination of the variable loop portions of the wall of the crevice that leads to the aromatic claws at the active site of the two structures shows that there is a dramatically different charge pattern that is the result of changes in residues 50 and 53 (Fig.5 A). Changes of Glu to Asn at residue 50 and Asn to Arg at residue 53 (in HCPTPA and in BPTP, respectively) result in a change from a negative patch near the active site of HCPTPA to a positive patch in BPTP, a difference that occurs between all fast and slow isoenzyme forms. This distinct charge alteration near the active site would be expected to cause the two isoenzymes to recognize amino acids with different charges as part of potential peptide or protein substrates. To test this, we measured the specificity constantskcat/Km for two phosphotyrosyl peptides that possess differing charge complementarities. Hydrolysis of a predominantly negatively charged molecule, the epidermal growth factor-related phosphopeptide SLDNPDpYQQDFF, by HCPTPA and -B gave nearly identicalkcat/Km values of 88 and 83m−1 s−1, respectively. In contrast, hydrolysis of a predominantly positively charged peptide, the STAT-related peptide QERRKpYLKHRLIVV by HCPTPA and -B gavekcat/Km values of 95 and 18m−1 s−1, respectively. These results demonstrate that multiple positive charges surrounding the phosphotyrosine in a peptide tends to disfavor its hydrolysis by the B-type isoenzyme. 2A. D. Schroff, unpublished results. Given their position facing into the crevice in close proximity to the site where the phosphotyrosine binds, it appears that two residues, 50 and 53, are the critical determinants of a specific charge distribution recognition that is important in determining the natural substrates of these isoenzymes. Evidence that the residue at position 50 is important for selectivity has been presented by Cirri et al. (35Cirri P. Fiaschi T. Chiarugi P. Camici G. Manao G. Raugei G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2604-2607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), based on studies done with the rat low molecular weight PTPases. Preliminary results from a more extensive study of the human enzyme properties in our laboratory using both chemical and biological substrates and inhibitors show that in fact all three variable loop residues (positions 49, 50, and 53) have significant roles in determining the specificities of the two enzymes. 3B. Evans, unpublished results. Similar features that contribute to substrate binding and specificity also occur in the high molecular weight PTPases. For example, the aromatic residues near the active site, which provide a hydrophobic surface for interacting with the ring of the phosphorylated tyrosine, can be seen in all PTPase structures. Where the HCPTPA structure shows a set of aromatic claws on both sides, the high molecular weight PTPases appear to have a single aromatic residue. The single conserved aromatic residue near the active site in these high molecular weight PTPases (Tyr-46 in PTP1B and Phe-229 inYersinia PTPase) occupies a similar position as Tyr-49 in HCPTPA or Trp 49 in BPTP and was originally thought to confer stabilization in binding for the Tyr(P) (1Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Zhang Z.-Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 2Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). However, in the structure of PTP1B complexed with a phosphorylated peptide, another aromatic residue (Phe-182) is found near the active site in a similar position as Tyr-131, situated on a loop that moves toward the substrate in the complex (36Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The phenylalanine (Phe-182) side chain provides a site for a hydrophobic interaction with the aromatic ring of pTyr in the bound peptide. This loop movement is also seen in theYersinia PTPase structures with nitrate, vanadate, and tungstate (37Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Stuckey J.A. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1904-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interactions of Yersinia phosphotyrosine phosphatase with a phosphorylated tyrosine have been modeled on the structures of these complexes in which the loop movement brings a glutamine (Gln-46) into the analogous Tyr-131 site (38Fauman E.B. Yuvaniyama C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18780-18788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The members of the low molecular weight PTPase family were proposed to have similar three-dimensional structures because of their high sequence homology (8Zhang M. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11097-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have shown that the overall structure of HCPTPA appears quite similar to that of BPTP. However, although the two enzymes possess the same three-dimensional fold, they may have distinctly different physiological functions as a consequence of side chain differences near the active site mediated by the charges in the variable loop residues. Finally, there is a developing body of evidence that the human low molecular weight PTPase plays a role in the engagement and activation of ELK and Nuk signaling complexes that accompanies capillary-like endothelial assembly (39Stein E. Cerretti D.P. Schoecklmann H.O. Schroff A.D. Van Etten R.L. Daniel T.O. ASBMB Satellite Meeting, Seattle, WA Aug. 20–23. 1997; (Abst. P5B-14)Google Scholar, 40Stein E. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P.

Glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5) catalyzes the formation ofS-d-lactoylglutathione from the hemithioacetal formed nonenzymatically from methylglyoxal and reduced glutathione (1Mannervik B. Jakoby W.B.

John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 597-641Google Scholar). Methylglyoxal is produced as a by-product of the triosephosphate isomerase reaction in glycolysis (4Richard J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4581-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Because this 2-oxoaldehyde readily reacts with proteins and nucleic acids, its inactivation by glyoxalase I is an important detoxication reaction. Glyoxalase I has attracted interest in research on diabetes and cancer because of the toxicity of the 2-oxoaldehyde substrate (2Thornalley P.J. Mol. Aspects Med. 1993; 14: 287-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Human glyoxalase I is a homodimeric protein of 43 kDa. Its catalytic activity is dependent on Zn2+, one metal atom located in each of the two active sites of the enzyme (5Aronsson A.-C. Marmstål E. Mannervik B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The Zn2+has been replaced by other divalent ions of metals such as magnesium, manganese, cobalt, and copper (3Vander Jagt D.L. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Coenzymes and Cofactors. 3A. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 597-641Google Scholar, 6Aronsson A.-C. Sellin S. Tibbelin G. Mannervik B. Biochem.

The replacement with magnesium is the only one that fully restores the highkcat value of the wild-type enzyme. The two active sites are located at the dimer interface, and residues from both subunits contribute to each of the binding pockets (8Cameron A.D. Olin B. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3386-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The Zn2+ is coordinated to four amino acid residues, two from each subunit (Fig. 1). The crystal structure obtained with S-benzylglutathione as ligand shows a square pyramidal arrangement with glutamine 33, glutamate 99, glutamate 172 and one molecule of water in the plane, and histidine 126 as the axial ligand. NMR studies of the manganese-substituted enzyme showed a second molecule of water to be present in the first coordination sphere of the active-site metal when glutathione derivatives were absent from the active site (9Sellin S. Eriksson L.E.G. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4850-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Sellin S. Rosevear P.R. Mannervik B. Mildvan A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10023-10029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of bound S-p-bromobenzylglutathione andS-d-lactoylglutathione, only one molecule of water could be detected (9Sellin S. Eriksson L.E.G. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4850-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In agreement with the NMR data, the second water molecule is not seen in the crystal structure of glyoxalase I with S-benzylglutathione as ligand. If present, the coordination of Zn2+ would be octahedral (8Cameron A.D. Olin B. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3386-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 11Sellin S. Eriksson L.E.G. Aronsson A.-C. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2091-2093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate is bound adjacent to the Zn2+ via its glutathione moiety with the S-substituent in a hydrophobic pocket. The catalytic mechanism of glyoxalase I has been proposed to involve a base responsible for the abstraction of a proton from carbon 1 of the hemithioacetal moiety of the substrate and deliver it to carbon 2 of the same molecule (9Sellin S. Eriksson L.E.G. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4850-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Sellin S. Rosevear P.R. Mannervik B. Mildvan A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10023-10029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This shielded proton transfer has support from NMR and other spectroscopic studies. However, in the crystal structure no amino acid residue that could serve as a base is present in the active site close to the expected position of the carbon 1 proton of the substrate, with the exception of the metal ligands glutamate 99, glutamate 172, and the metal-bound water. Glutamate 172 is closest to carbon 1, and based on modeling, the distance could be less than 4 Å (8Cameron A.D. Olin B. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3386-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). If this residue were released from the Zn2+ upon binding of the substrate the carboxylate would be in a favorable position for abstraction of the proton. The possible involvement of glutamate 99 in catalysis cannot be excluded. This residue is positioned 6 Å from carbon 1 of theS-substituent of the S-benzylglutathione and 5 Å from carbon 2. Replacement of the equivalent residue by aspartate in glyoxalase I from Pseudomonas putida (12Lan Y. Lu T. Lovett P.S. Creighton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12957-12960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) resulted in a mutant with less than 0.02% activity in comparison to the wild-type enzyme. However, metal analyses were not reported, and the metal-binding site might have been lost or compromised in the mutant protein. Therefore, no definitive conclusions about the identity of the catalytic groups can be based on these earlier results. The two glutamate residues are conserved among all known primary structures of glyoxalase I (Table I), indicating the importance of these residues in the active site of the enzyme. To elucidate whether glutamate 172 or glutamate 99 are involved in catalysis, the residues were replaced sequentially by glutamine using site-directed mutagenesis. To compensate for the loss of the charged residue, a third metal ligand, glutamine 33, was replaced by glutamate. The mutant enzymes were purified and characterized by metal analysis and activity measurements. The crystal structure of the Q33E/E172Q mutant in complex with S-hexylglutathione was determined.Table IConservation of the zinc ligands among glyoxalase I from various sourcesSourceAmino acid Position no.

Oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized by Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). [α-32P]dCTP and Sequenase version 2.0 were purchased from Amersham International (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). Glutathione and methylglyoxal dimethyl acetal were obtained from Sigma. Methylglyoxal was obtained by boiling of methylglyoxal dimethyl acetal for 10 min in 10% sulfuric acid (13Kellum M.W. Oray B.

Two consecutive PCRs were performed to generate the single mutants Q33E, E99Q, E172Q and the double mutants Q33E/E99Q and Q33E/E172Q. The reactions were performed under standard conditions. Human glyoxalase I inserted in the expression vector pKK-D (14Björnestedt R. Widersten M. Board P.G. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was used as template. The mutant Q33E was constructed in the following way: The 5′ end containing the mutation was PCR amplified with the vector specific primer pKKFor (5′-AAT TGT GAG CGG ATA ACA AT-3′) and the mutant primer HGIQ33E (5′-CTTAGGATCC TT CAC TCG TAG CAT GGT CTC CTG CAA-3′) for 10 cycles. The 3′ end of the cDNA was achieved by amplification using the primers GIEX15A (5′-TCTA GAATTC ATG GCN GAR CCD CAR CCD CCD TCB GGY GGY CTB ACY GAY GAR GCD GCD CTC AGT TGC TGC T-3′) and GIEX2STOP (5′-TAA GTCGAC TGC AGT TAT TAC ATT AAG GTT GCC ATT TTG TTA GG-3′) (15Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The amplified 5′ and whole cDNA for the 3′ part of glyoxalase I were combined and cut with the internalBamHI present in the cDNA sequence (underlined in primer HGIQ33E), followed by ligation. A second PCR was performed using the ligated fragment as DNA template with pKKFor and GIEX2STOP as primers, for 25 cycles under standard conditions. The mutant E172Q and the double mutant Q33E/E172Q were obtained by using the human glyoxalase I cDNA and the mutant cDNA Q33E inserted in the pKK-D vector as template DNA, respectively. Mutagenic PCR was performed with the pKKFor primer in combination with the mutagenesis primer HGIE172Q (5′-TTT GTT AGG ATT CAA AAT TTG AAT CCA-3′) for 10 cycles. In the second PCR, using the first as a template, the GIEX2STOP primer was linked to the sequence combined with the 5′ primer pKKFor. The mutant E99Q and the double mutant Q33E/E99Q were constructed with the same templates for the PCR. The primers used for the amplification of the 5′ part of the cDNA were pKKFor and GI5B (5′-GTC CGA CTC GGT GCC CCA-3′) and for the 3′ part HGIE99Q (5′-GCC TG GGCGCT C TCC AGA AAA GCT ACA CTT CAG CTG ACA-3′) combined with GIEX2STOP for 10 cycles. The 5′ and 3′ fragments were combined and digested with the internalHaeII present in the cDNA sequence (underlined in the primer HGIE99Q), ligated, and used as template in the second PCR with the primers pKKFor and GIEX2STOP. The cDNA sequences containing the desired mutations were cut with EcoRI and SalI and ligated to the expression vector pKK-D (14Björnestedt R. Widersten M. Board P.G. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All constructed mutants were sequenced for verification that no unwanted mutations were present. The mutant forms of glyoxalase I and the wild-type enzyme were purified from 1- to 3-liter cultures of E. coli grown in the presence of 1 mm ZnSO4at 30 °C as described previously (15Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Human glyoxalase I and the mutant variants were purified on S-hexylglutathione affinity gel and eluted with 5 mm S-hexylglutathione in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. The purified enzymes were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The relative molecular mass of the purified glyoxalase I mutants were determined on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5% w/v) with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver staining for visualization of the protein bands. Specific activity was measured in a 1-ml reaction with 2 mmmethylglyoxal and 2 mm reduced glutathione in 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 30 °C. The extinction coefficient used for the formation of the glutathione thiolester at 240 nm was 3 370 m−1 cm−1 (16Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 190: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was chromatographed on a PD-10 column prior to measurements of specific activity as well as for the kinetic analysis to remove anyS-hexylglutathione remaining from the purification. The earlier estimated extinction coefficient (1.68 mg−1·cm−1) was used to determine the protein concentration (15Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Measurements for the determination of steady-state kinetic saturation curves for Q33E/E99Q, Q33E, and E99Q were made in 1 ml of 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 30 °C. The concentration of free glutathione was kept constant at 0.3 mm. The data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using the Simfit program package (17Bardsley W.G. Bukhari N.A.J. Ferguson M.W.J. Cachaza J.A. Burguillo F.J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 19: 75-84Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Analysis of metal content in all of the mutant variants of glyoxalase I (11 metals/sample) was made by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. Crystals of the mutant Q33E/E172Q were obtained as described for the wild-type protein (8Cameron A.D. Olin B. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3386-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on a Rigaku R-axis imaging plate mounted on a rotating anode source. The crystals were prepared for freezing by a short soak in an equivalent mother liquor containing 5% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The crystals were of space group P41, as opposed to P43 in which the wild-type enzyme crystallized, but had similar cell dimensions (P41; a = b = 67.3 Å, c = 164.7 Å, P43; a = b = 68.0 Å, c = 169.4 Å). Data were integrated using MOSFLM (18Leslie A.J.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography No. 26. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar) and scaled and processed using the CCP4 suite of programs (19CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). The data set extends to a resolution of 2.2 Å, has anR-merge of 4.8% (12.8%), is 90% complete (63%), has a redundancy of 3.5 (1.8), and has an <I/SigI> of 27 (5.6), where the values in parentheses are for the highest resolution bin (2.32–2.2 Å). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMORE (20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar). The search model consisted of all protein atoms of one dimer of a structure of the enzyme that had been solved in complex with the ligand S-p-nitrocarbobenzoxyglutathione and refined to 1.7 Å resolution. 2M. Ridderström, A. D. Cameron, T. A. Jones, and B. Mannervik, unpublished data. During the initial refinement strict noncrystallographic symmetry constraints were kept between the 4 molecules of the asymmetric unit. Refinement involved cycles of simulated annealing in X-PLOR (21Brünger A. X-PLOR: A System for Crystallography and NMR, version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using the slow-cool procedure (22Brünger A.T. Krukowski A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) interspersed with manual rebuilding in program O (23Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. O, The Manual. 1991; (Uppsala, Sweden)Google Scholar, 24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) into maps averaged using RAVE (25Kleywegt G. Jones T. Bailey S. Hubbard R. Waller D. From First Map to Final Model (. 1994: 59-66Google Scholar). All data between 28 and 2.2 Å were used in refinement and a bulk solvent correction was used. When the R-factor was 25.0% (28–2.2) and the correspondingR-free (26Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar) 28.0% (based on 5% of the data calculated in thin shells), no further improvement could be obtained whereas maintaining strict noncrystallographic symmetry. The constraints were therefore replaced by restraints. Further refinement was carried out in REFMAC (27Murshodov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) after resetting the B-values of all atoms to 20 Å2. Anisotropic scaling of the data was used. Because this program works optimally when the data set aside for use in theR-free calculation are selected randomly, a newR-free data set was chosen for use in monitoring the refinement procedure (R-free after resettingB-values = 29.1%). Water molecules were located with the use of the program ARP (28Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because each of the two dimers is in a similar crystallographic environment, during the last cycle of refinement, restraints were applied only between the two dimers of the asymmetric unit but not between the two monomers of each dimer. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank and have been given an entry code of 1BH5. The mutant forms of glyoxalase I were expressed in E. colicultured in the presence of 1 mm ZnSO4. Affinity for the S-hexylglutathione matrix was retained in all of the mutant proteins, indicating structural integrity of the active site. The amounts obtained from the purification of mutants Q33E, E99Q, E172Q, and the double mutants Q33E/E99Q and Q33E/E172Q were 11, 10, 32, 8, and 45 mg, respectively, from a 3-liter culture. These yields are somewhat lower than the yield of the wild-type enzyme (60 mg/liter). DNA sequencing verified that the mutant forms did not contain any unwanted mutations in their sequences. The relative molecular mass of the corresponding purified proteins was estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to 22 kDa/subunit. Metal analysis of the mutant enzymes revealed a stoichiometry of 1:1 zinc/subunit of the double mutant Q33E/E172Q and 0.8:1/subunit for Q33E (Table II). The second double mutant Q33E/E99Q and the single mutants of the glutamates contained considerably lower amounts of zinc. Ten other divalent metal ions were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and were not found to substitute for the Zn2+ (Table II, values for aluminum, chromium, molybdenum, and nickel were <0.08 atoms/subunit and are not shown in the table). In all of the analyzed samples the amount of iron and calcium appear to be because of unspecific binding to the protein and presence in the buffer in the different batches.Table IIMetal analysis of human glyoxalase I and mutant variantsMetalMetal content (atoms per 43-kDa protein)Wild-typeaFrom Ref. 15.Q33E/E99QQ33EE99QQ33E/E172QE172QCalcium0.16NDbND, not determined.0.08<0.070.220.15Cobalt<0.005<0.02<0.02<0.05<0.01<0.01Copper<0.020.040.03<0.03<0.01<0.01Iron0.730.330.910.25<0.04<0.03Magnesium0.02<0.02<0.03<0.07<0.01<0.01Manganese0.04<0.01<0.01<0.03<0.004<0.004Zinc2.070.561.570.092.030.32The stoichiometry of moles of metal/mol of dimer of enzyme.a From Ref. 15Ridderström M.

The specific activities of the mutant variants were significantly lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. The double mutant Q33E/E172Q had no detectable activity with the hemithioacetal adduct of methylglyoxal and glutathione. Based on the sensitivity of the assay method and the amount of enzyme used, any remaining activity was estimated to be less than 3·10−6μmol·min−1·mg−1, which corresponds to a >108-fold decrease in activity compared with 2 340 μmol·min−1·mg−1 for wild-type human glyoxalase I (Table III). The Q33E/E99Q mutant had a specific activity of 34 μmol·min−1·mg−1, which corresponds to 1.5% of the wild-type value. The single-point mutants Q33E and E99Q displayed 1.3 and 0.1% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme, respectively. The mutant E172Q had less than 10−5 times the specific activity of the wild-type enzyme.Table IIISpecific activities and kinetic constants determined for human glyoxalase I and the mutant variantsGlyoxalase ISpecific activitykcatKmkcat/Km[Zn2+]/[dimer]μmol · min−1 · mg−1s−1μmm−1 · s−1mol/molWild-typeaThe data for the wild-type enzyme are from Ref. 38.2340 (1)1500 ± 3066 ± 52.3 · 1072.0Q33E/E99Q34 (0.01)36 ± 2236 ± 221.5 · 1050.6Q33E30 (0.01)34 ± 4175 ± 471.9 · 1051.6E99Q3 (0.001)2 ± 0.2219 ± 409.1 · 1030.1Q33E/E172Q(<10−8)2.0E172Q(<10−5)0.3Measurements were carried out at 30 °C in 1 ml of 0.1 msodium phosphate, pH 7.0.

The kcat, Km, andkcat/Km values for the mutant variants (Q33E, E99Q, and Q33E/E99Q) with detectable activity with the glutathione adduct of methylglyoxal are also given in Table III. TheKm values determined for all of these mutants are 3–4-fold higher than for the wild-type enzyme. Thekcat values range between 0.1 and 2% compared with the wild-type. Hence, the calculatedkcat/Km values are in a range of 100–2500 times lower than for the wild-type. The estimatedkcat/Km values of the double mutant Q33E/E99Q and the single mutant Q33E are similar, although their Zn2+ contents differ by a factor of 1.3. The structure of the catalytically inactive Q33E/E172Q mutant was solved using molecular replacement and refined to a resolution of 2.2 Å. The refined model has anR-factor of 18.8% based on all data between 28 and 2.2 Å and a corresponding R-free of 25.4% (see “Experimental Procedures”). It includes all residues from 2 to 183 of one subunit of each dimer and all residues from 7 to 183 of the other, one zinc ion and one molecule of S-hexylglutathione per subunit and 507 water molecules. The S-hexylglutathione remains from the purification of the enzyme. The root mean square differences from ideal bond lengths and angle distances (29Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1992; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar) are 0.009 and 0.029 Å, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 2that the zinc ion and its protein ligands are clearly defined in the associated electron density. The major differences among the four protein subunits of the asymmetric unit are localized at the N and C termini of the protein. Around the zinc ion, however, there is little variation among molecules. The model prior to the release of the noncrystallographic symmetry constraints is used in the following discussion. Comparison of the structures of the mutant and wild-type proteins shows no gross differences (root mean square deviation 0.25 Å for all Cα atoms of one monomer). There are, however, some small changes around the zinc-binding site (Fig. 1). In the first coordination sphere the side chains of residues 33, 99, and 172 are all rotated around their Cγ—Cδ bonds in the mutant protein with respect to the wild-type structure. The largest change is seen at residue 172, which rotates ≈60o with respect to its position in the wild-type structure so that the OE1 atom is ≈2.8 Å from the zinc (see TableIV). In contrast, the position of His-126 is unaltered. The water coordination is also different in the two proteins. In the structure of the mutant the 6th coordination position of the zinc, which was left unoccupied in the wild-type structure, is taken up by a water molecule, albeit at a greater distance from the zinc than would be expected for good coordination (Table IV). The water molecule that was seen in the wild-type structure has less electron density associated with it. In the unaveraged maps the electron density associated with this water molecule appears to be stronger at two of the zinc sites than at the other two but this may be an artifact of the refinement. The alterations of the residues coordinating the zinc also affect two nearby residues Gln-32 and Leu-174. The replacement of Gln-33 with a glutamic acid disrupts the hydrogen bonding arrangement involving Gln-32, and consequently this residue changes conformation. Leu-174 also moves such that a water molecule can bind and hydrogen bond to both Gln-32 and Gln-172.Table IVLigand distances (Å) to the Zn2+ in the crystal structure of wild-type glyoxalase I and the mutant variant Q33E/E172QMetal ligandWild-type (S-benzylglutathione)Q33E/E172Q (S-hexylglutathione)Gln/Glu-332.02.0Glu-992.02.2His-1262.02.2Glu/Gln-172aThe change of distance of residue 172 in the two proteins is caused by a 60 ° rotation with respect to its position in the wild-type.2.02.8Water 12.11.9Water 22.8The glutathione derivative in the crystal structure of the wild-type enzyme is S-benzylglutathione and in the Q33E/E172Q mutantS-hexylglutathione.a The change of distance of residue 172 in the two proteins is caused by a 60 ° rotation with respect to its position in the wild-type. Open table in a new tab The glutathione derivative in the crystal structure of the wild-type enzyme is S-benzylglutathione and in the Q33E/E172Q mutantS-hexylglutathione. The isomerization reaction catalyzed by glyoxalase I is believed to involve a base responsible for the abstraction of a proton from carbon 1 and its delivery to carbon 2 of the substrate. However, in the crystal structure of the active site of human glyoxalase I, no residue that could act as a base seems to be present in close proximity to the chemical groups undergoing reaction. The strongest candidate seems to be one of the ligands to the active-site zinc ion, glutamate 172, which is situated close to the expected position of the carbon 1 atom of the substrate. It is also possible that another of the zinc ligands, glutamate 99, could be involved in the reaction mechanism. Based on the out of plane distance of the zinc ion from the carboxylates of these 2 residues, glutamate 172 and glutamate 99 may be more weakly bound to the zinc ion than are the other two ligands (8Cameron A.D. Olin B. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3386-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and therefore could dissociate from the zinc ion during the reaction. To investigate the possible contribution of glutamate 172 to the reaction mechanism, the residue was changed into the isosteric amino acid glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis. Because the affinity for the zinc ion would be expected to become severely reduced by the removal of the charged residues, glutamine 33 was simultaneously replaced by glutamate. Both the double mutant Q33E/E172Q and the single mutant E172Q were drastically impaired in their catalytic functions. The double mutant Q33E/E172Q has no detectable activity (>108-fold lower than the wild-type, Table III). Its metal-binding site is fully occupied by zinc, as determined by chemical analysis. The crystal structure of the mutant in complex with S-hexylglutathione shows the zinc to be bound and there to be only minor changes of the zinc-binding site (Fig. 1). The most significant differences appear to arise from the substitution of glutamine 33 with a glutamic acid. In the wild-type structure this residue is hydrogen-bonded to glutamine 32. In the mutant, however, because this hydrogen bond cannot occur, glutamine 32 is displaced. Instead it hydrogen bonds to a water molecule, which in turn hydrogen bonds to the NE2 atom of glutamine 172. In the wild-type structure the position of this water molecule is occupied by the side chain of leucine 174, and glutamate 172 is in a completely hydrophobic environment. In addition to these differences the S-substituted glutathione allows two water molecules to remain bound in the active site, whereas the benzyl group of the ligand previously used sterically hinders the binding of one of the molecules. In contrast to the double mutant, the single mutant E172Q does retain a very small but detectable activity (10−5 of the wild-type enzyme) and has a lower zinc content than the wild-type enzyme (TableII). The differences in activity may be because of the alteration of the hydrogen bonding network around glutamate 172 that is caused by the mutation of glutamine 33. The single mutation of glutamine 33 to a glutamate does indeed result in enzyme with decreased activity, but this could also be explained by the additional negative charge in the active site. Regardless of the reason for the very slight differences in activity of the two mutants, there is a drastic drop in activity when the carboxylate is removed. Other investigators have shown that on replacement of catalytically important amino acid residues, the mutant proteins can retain detectable activity. For example, the replacement of serine (to alanine) in the catalytic triad of trypsin results in a reduced catalysis by a factor of 2.5·10−5 (30Corey D.R. Craik C.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 1784-1790Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This taken together with the approximate conservation of structure between the wild-type and mutant enzymes strongly suggests that glutamate 172 is acting as the base in catalysis (Fig.3). The exact mechanism is not clear. The currently accepted reaction mechanism is one where the enediol intermediate does not bind to the zinc ion. Based on the structure, however, it is also possible to propose a reaction mechanism where the intermediate is coordinated to the metal. One of the arguments that has been used against this scenario is that the enzyme is still active when the zinc ion is replaced by either Ga3+ or V2+, which are relatively inert to ligand exchange (3Vander Jagt D.L. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Coenzymes and Cofactors. 3A. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 597-641Google Scholar). However, this argument may no longer be valid, because ligand exchange may be necessary whether the reaction intermediate binds to the zinc ion or not. First, glutamate 172 must dissociate from the zinc to abstract the proton from the substrate, and second, to model the C1 atom of the substrate sufficiently close to the carboxylate of glutamate 172 may also require the removal of the zinc-coordinated water molecule seen in the wild-type structure. Therefore, whether the enediol intermediate does bind to the zinc ion is still an open question. Based on the metal analysis, the mutations introduced in E99Q and Q33E/E99Q seem to distort the zinc-binding site (Table II). Why the double mutant involving glutamate 99 should disrupt the zinc-binding site more than the corresponding Q33E/E172Q mutant is not clear. In the wild-type structure in complex with S-benzylglutathione, neither glutamate 99 nor glutamate 172 are involved in hydrogen bonding networks. It is possible that in the Q33E/E99Q double mutant the hydrogen bonding pattern involving glutamine 33 and glutamate 172 seen in the Q33E/E172Q mutant is retained. This would mean that the Q33E/E99Q double mutation would affect three of the four zinc ligands. The double mutant Q33E/E99Q has 1% of the wild-type enzyme activity, showing that although impaired the enzyme is still catalytically competent (>105 times the estimate for Q33E/E172Q), which supports the suggestion that glutamate 99 is not the base responsible for the abstraction of the C1 hydrogen. Structural information of this mutant would be needed for explanation of the loss of metal and activity. However, no crystals have yet been obtained. The single mutant Q33E has lower activity than expected solely in relation to its decreased zinc content. Because this residue is far from the position of the C1 hydrogen, it is presumed that it cannot be involved directly in the reaction. Moreover, in most glyoxalase I amino acid sequences the structurally equivalent residue is histidine. The low specific activity of mutant Q33E might be a result of an additional negative charge introduced by glutamate 33 in the active-site cavity or may be a result of the altered hydrogen bonding network described previously. The involvement of glutamate 172 in catalysis needs further clarification by structural information with substrate analogues and this is in progress.

To directly examine the influence of this pathway on intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), cardiac myocytes were cotransfected with effectors of this pathway and with green fluorescent protein, which allowed the living transfected myocytes to be identified and examined for [Ca2+]i via indo-1. Transfection with constitutively active Ras (Ha-RasV12) increased cell size, decreased expression of the myofibrils and the calcium-regulatory enzyme SERCA2, and reduced the magnitude and prolonged the decay phase of the contractile [Ca2+]i transients. Similar effects on [Ca2+]i were obtained with Ha-RasV12S35, a Ras mutant that selectively couples to Raf, and with constitutively active Raf. In contrast, Ha-RasV12C40, a Ras mutant that activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, had a lesser effect. The PKC-activating phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, also prolonged the contractile [Ca2+]i transients. Cotransfection with dnMEK inhibited the effects of Ha-RasV12, Raf, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate on [Ca2+]i. The effects of Ha-RasV12 and Raf on [Ca2+]i were also counteracted by SERCA2 overexpression. Both Ras and PKC may thus regulate cardiac [Ca2+]i via the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade, and this pathway may represent a critical determinant of cardiac physiological function.

Cardiac hypertrophy commonly develops in response to hemodynamic pressure overload (1Wankerl M. Schwartz K. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The participation of Ras in the development of hypertrophy is suggested by the observations that hypertrophic stimuli activate Ras, dominant-negative Ras mutants inhibit the hypertrophic response, and overexpression of constitutively active Ha-RasV12 elicits hypertrophic growth (2Thorburn A.

Downstream effectors of Ras, particularly kinases of the Raf-MEK-ERK and MEKK1-JNKK-JNK pathways, may also participate in these growth processes (4Bogoyevitch M.A. Sugden P.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hypertrophic and failing hearts feature reduced contractile calcium transients with prolonged decay, myofibrillar disarray, and reduced expression of SERCA2, an enzyme responsible for reuptake of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (1Wankerl M.

Exposure of cultured cardiac myocytes to PKC-activating phorbol esters also results in prolonged calcium transients and reduced SERCA2 (7Hartong R. Villarreal F.J. Giordano F. Hilal-Dandan R.

The PKC effectors responsible for the altered regulation of [Ca2+]i have not been identified, but an intriguing possibility may be Raf, which can be activated by either PKC or Ras (4Bogoyevitch M.A. Sugden P.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Zou Y. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Aikawa R. Kudoh S. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. J. Biol.

To address this possibility, the present study was undertaken to assess the effects of Ras, PKC, and related ERK activators on cardiac [Ca2+]i. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were dissociated and transfected via electroporation as described previously (11Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To prepare myocytes for indo-1 measurements, 9 × 106 cells/transfection were electroporated and split into two 35-mm wells containing fibronectin-coated glass coverslips for plating. Cells to be analyzed for morphology were plated as described previously (11Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). After 18–20 h in serum-containing plating medium, the cells were rinsed and refed with serum-free maintenance medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 nm T3, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 1 μg/ml insulin, and 0.1 ng/ml selenium). Unless otherwise stated, cells were kept in maintenance medium for 48 h prior to analysis. pDCR Ha-RasV12 (activated Ha-Ras), pDCR Ha-RasV12S35, and pDCR Ha-RasV12C40 were obtained from D. Bar-Sagi (SUNY, Stony Brook, NY). RSV-Raf-1 BXB (codes for activated Raf-1 kinase) and RSV-C4B (codes for the amino terminus of Raf-1 kinase) were from U. Rapp (University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany). pCMV5 MEKKCOOH (codes for activated MEKK-1) was from G. Johnson (University of Colorado, Denver, CO). pEXV3-MAPKK1-Ala-217 (referred to as “dnMEK”) was obtained from S. Fuller (Imperial College, London, UK) and codes for a mutant MAPKK1 (synonymous with MEK1), which can act in a dominant-negative fashion because it is poorly phosphorylated by Raf (12Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). PKAC was from M. Muramatsu (DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA). These constructs utilize the highly effective CMV, 1The abbreviations used are: CMVcytomegalovirusPKCprotein kinase CGFPgreen fluorescence proteinPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePIphosphatidylinositolSRsarcoplasmic reticulumMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseJNKc-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. SV40, or Rous sarcoma virus promoters to drive expression of the regulatory protein. The amount of DNA used per transfection depended upon the constructs. The transfection markers pGreen Lantern-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and CMV-β-galactosidase were used at 4 μg or 9 μg/transfection, respectively. Within each experiment, the DNA amounts per transfection were equalized with empty vector DNA such as pCEP. Although transfection efficiency is relatively low with this cell type (averaging approximately 5%), the use of β-galactosidase and GFP allowed analysis of individual transfected myocytes for morphology, cell structures, and calcium transients. cytomegalovirus protein kinase C green fluorescence protein phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate phosphatidylinositol sarcoplasmic reticulum mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Rat SERCA2 cDNA (nucleotides −267/3726, numbered relative to the start codon) in pBluescript was digested with ApaI and re-ligated, deleting 254 base pairs of the 5′ noncoding sequence SERCA2 (−13/3726). Next, the plasmid was linearized with DraIII at nucleotide 3076 of SERCA2 (located in the 3′ noncoding region of the SERCA2 cDNA), and the overhang was filled with T4 polymerase, generating a blunt end. The plasmid was subsequently digested with KpnI, and the SERCA2 encoding fragment was inserted into the adenoviral shuttle vector, pACCMV.pLpA, at the KpnI/blunted HindIII sites. The resulting vector (pACCMV.pLpA-SERCA2) contains SERCA2(−13/3076) inserted between the CMV promoter and the SV40 polyadenylation sequence. Cardiac myocytes were fixed and stained for β-galactosidase, actin, and SERCA2 as published (7Hartong R. Villarreal F.J. Giordano F. Hilal-Dandan R. McDonough P.M. Dillmann W.H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 2467-2477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). An fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was utilized to visualize the anti-SERCA2 primary antibody. Actin was visualized using rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were loaded with indo-1 as described previously (13McDonough P.M. Stella S.L. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9466-9472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indo-1 measurements were made in air-compatible Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at room temperature at 20 Hz. GFP-expressing myocytes, corresponding to myocytes that had taken up the GFP expression vector during the transfection procedure, were identified by monitoring fluorescence with an excitation wavelength of 475 nm. Excitation was then switched to 355 nm (optimal for indo-1), and indo-1 fluorescence was recorded from the cytoplasmic region of the myocyte. In the absence of indo-1, GFP-expressing myocytes were nonfluorescent at the excitation wavelength of 355 nm, indicating that GFP does not interfere with measurement of indo-1. Although indo-1 fluorescence is related to free calcium concentration via well established equilibrium relationships, exact calibration of the signal in vivo is problematic (14Bassani J.W. Bassani R.A. Bers D.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1453-1460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); the results are thus reported as the ratio between the fluorescence emission at 405 and 485, or as “normalized” transients, where the ratios at diastole and at the peak systole of the transient equal 0 and 100%, respectively. Myocytes were transfected with the test constructs and a hemaglutinin-tagged ERK2 expression vector (Cobb, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Cultures were extracted, immunoprecipitated for the hemaglutinin epitope tag, and assayed for ERK activity in vitro as described (11Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Control myocytes (cotransfected with empty expression vector) were mildly stellate or elongate (Fig.1 A) and averaged 841 ± 115 μm2 (mean ± S.E., n = 13) in surface area. Ha-RasV12 transfection (16 μg/electroporation) resulted in an approximate 6-fold increase in cell area (to 4984 ± 412, n = 25) and the cells exhibited a highly irregular, sprawling morphology (Fig.1 B). Although Ha-RasV12-transfected myocytes sometimes stained strongly for actin, the actin filaments were not striated (Fig. 1 C). The absence of striations in the Ha-RasV12-transfected myocytes does not represent a limitation of the detection technique, because striated myofibrils were easily identified in neighboring, nontransfected myocytes (Fig.1 C). Also, this staining procedure visualizes striations in myocytes subjected to pacing of contractions, phenylephrine, or transfection with the p38 activator MKK6 (11Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 15McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because Ha-RasV12 had such a profound effect on morphology, it was of interest to determine whether gene expression relating to regulation of [Ca2+]i, such as SERCA2, would also be altered. Myocytes were therefore cotransfected with Ha-RasV12 along with CMV-β-galactosidase; the cells were then fixed and stained for β-galactosidase and endogenous SERCA2, which were visualized with Texas Red- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively. Control myocytes exhibited SERCA2 staining that was equivalent to neighboring, nontransfected myocytes (Fig. 1, E and F). In contrast, myocytes transfected with Ha-RasV12 exhibited weaker staining for SERCA2 (Fig. 1, G and H). Photomicrographs representing SERCA2 staining were scanned, and the intensity of the images were quantified via NIH Image. For nontransfected, control-transfected, and Ha-RasV12-transfected myocytes, pixel intensities averaged 18.4 ± 0.7 (n = 50), 19.3 ± 0.8 (n = 6), and 8.8 ± 0.7 (n = 13) (mean ± S.E., arbitrary pixel intensity units), respectively, and the values for Ha-RasV12 transfection were significantly different (p < 0.05, Student-Newman Keuls). Although pixel intensity and SERCA2 expression may not be strictly linearly related because of factors such as photobleaching, these data indicate that Ha-RasV12 transfection diminishes SERCA2 expression. The above results suggested that the regulation of [Ca2+]i might be modified by Ha-RasV12. To test this hypothesis, myocytes were cotransfected with the GFP expression plasmid, along with the Ha-RasV12 expression plasmid, then loaded with indo-1, and monitored for fluorescence during the electrical pacing of contractions. Myocytes transfected with 1 μg of the Ha-RasV12 expression plasmid exhibited statistically significant reductions in systolic indo-1 ratios (Rsys) and a trend toward prolongation of decay (Fig. 2 A and TableI). Transfection with 16 μg of Ha-RasV12 prolonged decay even more (Fig. 2 A and Table I) and, additionally, increased tpeak, the time required for the calcium transients to reach their maximal values; transfection with 16 μg of Ha-RasV12 also significantly increased the diastolic (Rdia) indo-1 ratios. Virtually every myocyte transfected with Ha-RasV12(e.g. 19 of the 20 myocytes transfected with 16 μg of Ha-RasV12 in Fig. 2 A) exhibited abnormal calcium transients, suggesting a high “cotransfection efficiency” for GFP and Ha-RasV12. These results are consistent with Ha-RasV12-mediated reduction of SERCA2, because reduced calcium removal from the cytoplasm might elevateRdia and prolong the decay phase of the calcium transient.Table IEffects of ERK effectors on [Ca2+ ]i in cultured neonatal ventricular myocytesConditionsRdiaRsvstpeaktdecayH-RasV12 dose response (Fig 2, Aand B) Control (n = 20 cells)0.672 ± 0.0211.26 ± 0.050100 ± 23100 ± 7 1 μg of H-RasV12 (20)0.684 ± 0.0190.945 ± 0.048ap < .05 compared to control.124 ± 12155 ± 18 16 μg of H-RasV12 (20)0.775 ± 0.029ap < .05 compared to control.0.964 ± 0.043ap < .05 compared to control.175 ± 28ap < .05 compared to control.233 ± 34ap < .05 compared to control.H-RasV12S35 vs. H-RasV12C40 (Fig. 2,C and D) Control (15)0.614 ± 0.0261.21 ± 0.080100 ± 9100 ± 11 16 μg of H-RasV12S35 (15)0.676 ± 0.0161.12 ± 0.079216 ± 29ap < .05 compared to control.192 ± 19ap < .05 compared to control. 16 μg of H-RasV12C40 (15)0.584 ± 0.0311.18 ± 0.069111 ± 9147 ± 8ap < .05 compared to control.BXB Raf (Fig.2, E and F) Control (63)0.568 ± 0.0201.10 ± 0.042100 ± 5100 ± 7 16 μg of BXBRaf (45)0.551 ± 0.0150.863 ± 0.042ap < .05 compared to control.187 ± 14ap < .05 compared to control.190 ± 16ap < .05 compared to control. 16 μg of MEKK1COOH (28)0.604 ± 0.0230.836 ± 0.038ap < .05 compared to control.182 ± 32ap < .05 compared to control.223 ± 24ap < .05 compared to control.dnMEK vs. H-RasV12 (Fig. 3, A andB) Control (20)0.678 ± 0.0171.21 ± 0.056100 ± 8100 ± 6 1 μg of H-RasV12 (20)0.676 ± 0.0160.837 ± 0.048ap < .05 compared to control.125 ± 19297 ± 48ap < .05 compared to control. 45 μg of dnMEK (20)0.679 ± 0.0191.20 ± 0.04881 ± 694 ± 5 H-RasV12 + dnMEK (20)0.674 ± 0.0151.26 ± 0.066bp < .05 compared to H-RasV12.95 ± 6163 ± 28bp < .05 compared to H-RasV12.dnMEK vs. BXB Raf (Fig. 3,C and D) Control (25)0.667 ± 0.0241.18 ± 0.044100 ± 5100 ± 7 16 μg of BXB Raf (25)0.694 ± 0.0241.09 ± 0.066138 ± 11ap < .05 compared to control.151 ± 15ap < .05 compared to control. 45 μg of dnMEK (35)0.632 ± 0.0271.15 ± 0.04482 ± 5112 ± 11 BXB Raf + dnMEK (23)0.694 ± 0.0211.19 ± 0.048100 ± 10108 ± 11dnMEK vs.PMA (Fig. 3, E and F) Control (40)0.656 ± 0.0141.31 ± 0.037100 ± 4100 ± 6 300 nM PMA (42)0.689 ± 0.0191.28 ± 0.039168 ± 8ap < .05 compared to control.132 ± 10ap < .05 compared to control. 45 μg of dnMEK (40)0.687 ± 0.0151.21 ± 0.037100 ± 568 ± 5 PMA + dnMEK (39)0.689 ± 0.0201.26 ± 0.040131 ± 9ap < .05 compared to control.,cp < .05 compared to PMA.78 ± 14C4BRaf vs. PKAC Control (16)0.717 ± 0.0281.31 ± 0.058100 ± 11100 ± 10 8 μg of PKAC (15)0.535 ± 0.041ap < .05 compared to control.1.21 ± 0.111119 ± 9262 ± 29ap < .05 compared to control.

Raf and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI 3-kinase) are among the best known Ras effectors in mammalian cells. To distinguish between these pathways, Ha-RasV12 mutants have been identified that selectively couple to Raf (Ha-RasV12S35) or PI 3-kinase (Ha-RasV12C40) (16Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 17Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). As a first step toward evaluating the role of these effector pathways in the growth and [Ca2+]i responses to Ha-RasV12, the differential coupling of Ha-RasV12S35 and Ha-RasV12C40 to the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway was verified; to do this, myocytes were cotransfected with hemaglutinin-ERK2 along with Ha-RasV12, Ha-RasV12S35, or Ha-RasV12C40, and in vitro kinase assays were performed on hemaglutinin-ERK2-specific immunoprecipitations. Cotransfection with Ha-RasV12 resulted in a strong activation of ERK (17-fold), whereas transfection with Ha-RasV12S35 yielded a moderate activation (2.5-fold). In contrast, transfection with Ha-RasV12C40 did not activate ERK, at all (0.8-fold). Thus, although Ha-RasV12S35specifically activates the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, it is a less effective stimulator of ERK activation than Ha-RasV12; this result is consistent with other reports (17Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), and should be considered when interpreting the effects of these Ras mutants on cell growth and [Ca2+]i. Myocytes were transfected with equimolar amounts of Ha-RasV12S35 or Ha-RasV12C40 and analyzed for cell size and [Ca2+]i. Ha-RasV12S35-transfected myocytes were larger than controls (1751 ± 206 μm, n = 15) but were smaller than myocytes transfected with Ha-RasV12 (see above). Ha-RasV12C40-transfected myocytes were similar in size to controls (1010 ± 96 μm, n = 16). Transfection with Ha-RasV12S35 modified [Ca2+]i in a manner similar to the effects of Ha-RasV12, with statistically significant, pronounced prolongation oftdecay and tpeak (Fig. 2,C and D, and Table I). Transfection with Ha-RasV12C40 also modified [Ca2+]i, but the effect of Ha-RasV12C40 was limited to the prolongation of transient decay, and the prolongation of decay was more modest than that elicited by Ha-RasV12S35. Thus, the relative effects of the Ras mutants on [Ca2+]i(Ha-RasV12 > Ha-RasV12S35 > Ha-RasV12C40) are consistent with the rank order of these mutants on ERK activation, suggesting that the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may serve as a major route via which [Ca2+]i may be altered by Ras activity. The data with Ha-RasV12S35 further suggest that the PI 3-kinase pathway might also participate in the Ha-RasV12-mediated disregulation of [Ca2+]i but most likely to a lesser degree than the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Because Raf links Ras to ERK activation, it was of interest to test the effects of constitutively active Raf (BXB-Raf) on [Ca2+]i. BXB-Raf transfection results in substantial activation of ERK and cell enlargement but does not increase myofilament expression or organization (11Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). BXB-Raf-transfected myocytes exhibited normalRdia but displayed reducedRsys, increased tpeak, and prolonged decay (p < 0.05 for all parameters, data pooled from three separate cell preparations; Fig. 2, E andF, and Table I). The alterations of transient kinetics by BXB-Raf are consistent with the results obtained with Ha-RasV12 and Ha-RasV12S35 and show striking similarities to the contractile defects induced by pressure overload hypertrophy (5Wang J. Flemal K. Qiu Z. Ablin L Grossman W. Morgan J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H918-H924PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bailey B.A. Dipla K. Li S. Houser S.R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1823-1835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Additionally, transfection with MEKK1COOH, a truncated version of MEKK1 that very strongly activates ERK in this cell type (11Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), also modified the calcium transients in a manner similar to Ha-RasV12 and BXB-Raf, eliciting a trend toward increasingRdia, statistically significant reductions inRsys, and prolongations oftpeak and tdecay(transients not shown, but see Table I for descriptive statistics). As a further test of the involvement of the MEK-ERK pathway in the regulation of cardiac [Ca2+]i by Ras and Raf, the effects of cotransfection with dnMEK on [Ca2+]i were tested. Cotransfection of dnMEK with Ha-RasV12 strongly corrected the effect of Ha-RasV12 on Rsys, returning Rsys to near normal values, and partially inhibited the effect of Ha-RasV12 on transient decay (Fig. 3, A andB, and Table I). The ability of dnMEK to antagonize the effects of Ha-RasV12 is consistent with the hypothesis that Ha-RasV12 alters [Ca2+]i via the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Consistent with the relative position of Raf and MEK in the ERK activation cascade, cotransfection of dnMEK also strongly inhibited the effects of BXB-Raf on [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3, C and D), returning the transients to normal kinetics. Because incubation of cultured cardiac myocytes with protein kinase C-activating phorbol esters activates ERK (18Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 19McDonough P.M. Hanford D.S. Sprenkle A.B. Mellon N.R. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1996; 271: H1031-H1039PubMed Google Scholar), it was of interest to test the ability of dnMEK to inhibit the effects of PMA on [Ca2+]i. Consistent with previous studies, PMA treatment prolonged tpeak andtdecay (Fig. 3, E and F, and Table I). Transfection with dnMEK significantly inhibited the effect of PMA on tpeak andtdecay (Fig. 3, E and F, and Table I). Thus, PMA, which activates the α-, ε-, and δ-PKC isoforms in this cell type (20Puceat M. Hilal-Dandan R. Strulovici B. Brunton L.L. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16938-16944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), may modify [Ca2+]i primarily via activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Transfection with PKAC, a constitutively active PKC-α isoform (21Muramatsu M. Kaibuchi K. Arai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), also strongly prolonged decay of the transients (transients not shown, but see Table I for descriptive statistics), and this effect was inhibited by the dominant-negative C4BRaf (22Troppmair J. Bruder J.T. Munoz H. Lloyd P.A. Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Avruch J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7030-7035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKAC also reducedRdia in a C4BRaf-sensitive manner. These results further suggest that PKC may modify cardiac [Ca2+]i via the Raf pathway. Because transfection with Ha-RasV12 leads to down-regulation of SERCA2 expression and alteration of [Ca2+]i, it was of interest to monitor [Ca2+]i handling in myocytes cotransfected with expression vectors for both Ha-RasV12and for SERCA2. Coexpression of SERCA2 with Ha-RasV12resulted in partial but not complete restoration of the calcium transients (Fig. 4, A andB, and Table I). For example, cotransfection of SERCA2 did not counteract the effect of Ha-RasV12 onRdia but significantly counteracted the effects of Ha-RasV12 on Rsys andtpeak; SERCA2 also exhibited a trend toward correcting the effect of Ha-RasV12 ontdecay. SERCA2 transfection, by itself, had no effect on cell morphology and did not alter the effect of Ha-RasV12 on cell morphology. Cotransfection with SERCA2 also strongly corrected the effect of BXB-Raf on [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4, C and D, and Table I). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may alter [Ca2+]i, in part, by regulating SERCA2 expression. However, the inability of SERCA2 cotransfection to completely restore the alterations in [Ca2+]i induced by Ha-RasV12 suggest that Ha-RasV12 activity might also alter [Ca2+]i by additional pathways that are independent of"

In this report, we describe the molecular, biochemical, and cell biological characterizations of Vti1-rp2, a novel 29-kDa SNARE associated with the Golgi apparatus. Vti1-rp2 is structurally homologous to Vti1p, a recently described yeast Golgi SNARE (23von Mollard G.F. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J.

We further show that Vti1-rp2 exists in distinct syntaxin 5- and syntaxin 6-containing SNARE complexes and is functionally important for protein trafficking in the secretory pathway. Mouse EST clones (accession numbers AA016379 andW13616) were generated by the Washington University-Merck expressed sequence tag (EST) project and made available by IMAGE consortium via Research Genetics Inc.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Brefeldin A was from Epicentre Technologies. Mouse EST clones were fully sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using a kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The complete coding region was assembled using the DNA Strider 1 program.

Vero cells grown on coverslips were infected with the vesicular stomatitis virus ts045 strain at 31 °C for 45 min and then shifted to 40 °C for 1 h. Cells were then transferred to 4 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum, and microinjection was performed under a Zeiss Axiophot microscopy using an Eppendorf micromanipulation system. Cells were transferred back to 40 °C immediately after injection and incubated at 40 °C for 2 h to accumulate the G-protein in the ER. Transport of G-protein was performed by incubating cells at 31 °C for 45 min in the presence of cycloheximide (to prevent new synthesis of G-protein).

The EST clone W13616 was fully sequenced, and the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 1 A. This protein was independently identified in three other laboratories and has been referred to as Vti1-rp2 (31Lupashin V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. McNew J.A. Waters M.G. Mol. Biol.

Preceding the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic tail are four regions (residues 32–62, 69–93, 112–134, 146–179) that have the potential to form coiled-coil structures as predicted by the COILS 2.1 program (Fig.1 B). A search of motifs with the ScanProsite program revealed the existence of an ATP/GTP binding motif A (P-loop) in the sequence (residues 170–177, ADANLGKS). Vti1-rp2 is homologous to Vti1p, a yeast Golgi SNARE implicated in at least two trafficking events (23von Mollard G.F. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The homology between Vti1-rp2 and Vti1p occurs throughout the entire polypeptide with an overall amino acid identity of 28% and similarity of 45% (Fig. 1 C). Since Vti1p does not contain the consensus ATP/GTP binding site motif A, it is not clear if the ATP/GTP binding site motif A observed in Vti1-rp2 is functionally important. To examine whether Vti1-rp2 is involved in a general cellular process or its function is restricted to certain tissues, Northern blot analysis was performed to examine the levels of Vti1-rp2 mRNA in various mouse tissues (Fig.2 A). A major mRNA species of about 2.6 kilobases was detected at varying levels in all the tissues examined, consistent with the notion that Vti1-rp2 may participate in an event common to all the cell types. Interestingly, the Vti1-rp2 mRNA detected in the testis has a smaller size (about 1.5 kilobases). The basis and significance for this different mRNA size of Vti1-rp2 in the testis is currently unknown. The cytoplasmic domain (residues 1–185) of Vti1-rp2 was expressed as a recombinant fusion protein with GST (GST-Vti1-rp2). The purified GST-Vti1-rp2 was used to raise polyclonal antibodies against Vti1-rp2 in rabbits. Although the predicted size for Vti1-rp2 is 249710, its apparent size revealed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is about 29 kDa (Fig.3 A), because it migrates (lane 1) in between the 30-kDa marker (the marker lane) and GS28 (lane 2) (a Golgi SNARE with an apparent size of 28 kDa) (20Subramaniam V.N. Peter F. Philip R. Wong S.H. Hong W. Science. 1996; 272: 1161-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 30Subramaniam V.N. Krijnse-Locker J. Tang B.L. Ericsson M. Yusoff A.R.B.M. Griffiths G. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2405-2414PubMed Google Scholar). Another mammalian protein homologous to Vti1p has also been identified and has been referred to as Vtil-rp1 (31Lupashin V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. McNew J.A. Waters M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2659-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), Vti1 (32von Mollard G.F. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2624-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and Vti1b (33Advani R.J. Bae H.-R. Bock J.B. Chao D.S. Doung Y.-C. Prekeris R. Yoo J.-S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10317-10324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), respectively. To avoid further confusion, we have adopted the name Vti1-rp1 for the other mammalian homolog of yeast Vti1p. Since Vti1-rp2 displays significant amino acid sequence identity (about 30%) with Vti1-rp1, it is essential to establish that our affinity-purified antibodies do not cross-react with Vti1-rp1. As shown (Fig. 3 A), the detection of the 29-kDa protein in immunoblot was selectively abolished by preincubation of antibodies with recombinant cytoplasmic domain of Vti1-rp2 (lane 4) but not with the cytoplasmic domain of Vti1-rp1 (lane 3), establishing that our antibodies are specific for Vti1-rp2. Immunoblot analysis revealed that Vti1-rp2 is enriched in Golgi membranes (Fig.3 B, lanes 4–6) as compared with total membranes, and microsomal membranes. The enrichment of Vti1-rp2 in Golgi membranes is comparable with that of Golgi α2,6-sialyltransferase (lanes 1–3). When Golgi-enriched membranes were subjected to different extraction conditions (Fig. 3 C), Vti1-rp2 was effectively extracted by detergents but not by phosphate-buffered saline, 2.5m urea, 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate (pH 12), or 2m KCl. Vti1-rp2 is thus an integral membrane protein enriched in the Golgi fractions. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was used to examine the exact subcellular localization of Vti1-rp2 (Fig.4). Affinity-purified antibodies against Vti1-rp2 specifically labeled perinuclear structures (Fig.4 A, panel a) characteristic of the Golgi apparatus (34Louvard D. Reggio H. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 92-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and this labeling colocalized well with that of Golgi mannosidase II (panel b) (35Moreman K.W. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). When the Golgi apparatus was fragmented by nocodazole treatment (panels c–d), Vti1-rp2 and mannosidase II were colocalized well in the fragmented Golgi apparatus. Similar to mannosidase II and other Golgi proteins (36Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar), Vti1-rp2 was redistributed to the ER when cells were treated with brefeldin A (e–f). These results firmly establish that Vti1-rp2 is an integral membrane protein associated preferentially with the Golgi apparatus. To investigate whether Vti1-rp2 indeed functions as a novel SNARE of the Golgi apparatus, we examined the potential interaction of Vti1-rp2 with α-SNAP. As shown in Fig. 5 A (upper panel), Vti1-rp2 in the Golgi detergent extract was specifically retained by immobilized GST-α-SNAP in a dose-dependent manner. Under identical conditions, Vti1-rp2 was not retained by immobilized GST or several other control GST fusion proteins (data not shown). Furthermore, other Golgi proteins, including α2,6-sialyltransferase, were not retained by immobilized GST-α-SNAP (Fig. 5 A, lower panel). The interaction of Vti1-rp2 with α-SNAP was further investigated (Fig. 5 B). Proteins in the Golgi extract were incubated with GST (lanes 1 and 4), GST-α-SNAP (lanes 2 and5), and GST-γ-SNAP (lanes 3 and 6); after extensive washing, the beads (lanes 1–3) and 1/10 of the supernatants (lane 4–6) were analyzed by immunoblot to detect Vti1-rp2 (upper row) as well as GS28 (lower row), which serves as a positive control. Vti1-rp2 was retained by GST-α-SNAP as efficiently as GS28 (lanes 2 and5). Neither Vti1-rp2 nor GS28 was retained by GST (lanes 1 and 4). To lesser extents, Vti1-rp2 and GS28 was significantly retained by GST-γ-SNAP. These results establish that interaction of Vti1-rp2 with GST-α-SNAP is specific and occurs with efficiencies comparable with that of known Golgi SNAREs such as GS28. Furthermore, interaction of Vti1-rp2 with immobilized GST-α-SNAP could be abolished by NSF in conditions that promote dissociation of SNARE complexes (Fig. 5 C). When Golgi extract was incubated with immobilized GST-α-SNAP in the presence of increasing amounts of NSF in conditions (assembly buffer) that promote formation of SNARE complexes (lanes 1–6), comparable amounts of Vti1-rp2 were retained. However, retention of Vti1-rp2 by immobilized GST-α-SNAP was readily abolished by NSF in conditions (lane 7–12) that promote ATP hydrolysis by NSF and disassembly of SNARE complexes. These results not only further confirmed that the interaction of Vti1-rp2 with α-SNAP is specific but also revealed that the interaction of Vti1-rp2 with α-SNAP is in the context of Vti1-rp2-containing SNARE complexes. To gain additional understanding of Vti1-rp2 as a Golgi SNARE, we investigated the potential interaction of Vti1-rp2 with two Golgi t-SNAREs, the cis-Golgi syntaxin 5 (13Banfield D.K. Lewis M.J.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Golgi detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against syntaxin 5, syntaxin 6, or control rabbit IgG. The immunoprecipitates (beads) (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6) and 1/10 of the supernatants (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8) were analyzed by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 6 (lanes 1–4), syntaxin 5 was efficiently precipitated by its antibodies (lanes 1 and 3) but not by control antibodies (lanes 2 and 4). Vti1-rp2 was clearly coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies against syntaxin 5 (lanes 1 and 3) but not by control antibodies (lanes 2 and 4), suggesting that a significant fraction of Vti1-rp2 exists in a syntaxin 5-containing SNARE complex. Usually, about 3–5% of Vti1-rp2 could be coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies against syntaxin 5. Under identical conditions, syntaxin 6 was not coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies against syntaxin 5 (lanes 1 and 3). When Golgi extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against syntaxin 6 (lanes 5–8), essentially all syntaxin 6 was precipitated (lanes 5 and 7). Furthermore, Vti1-rp2 was obviously coimmunoprecipitated by anti-syntaxin 6 antibodies (lanes 5 and 7) but not by control control IgG (lanes 6 and 8). About 10–15% of Vti1-rp2 is routinely coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies against syntaxin 6. In contrast, syntaxin 5 was not coimmunoprecipitated by anti-syntaxin 6 antibodies (lanes 5 and 7). These results suggest that significant amounts of Vti1-rp2 exist in at least two distinct SNARE complexes, one containing syntaxin 5 and the other containing syntaxin 6. This conclusion was further substantiated by our observation that significant amounts of syntaxin 5 and syntaxin 6 were coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies against Vti1-rp2 (data not shown). The association of Vti1-rp2 with the Golgi apparatus and its establishment as a SNARE suggest that it may participate in protein trafficking in the secretory pathway. To investigate this, Vero cells grown on coverslips were first infected with vesicular stomatitis virus ts045 and then microinjected with affinity-purified antibodies against Vti1-rp2. Transport of G-protein along the secretory pathway was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Since microinjection of antibodies against EAGE epitope of β-COP was shown previously to inhibit G-protein transport (29Pepperkok R. Scheel J. Horstmann H. Hauri H.P. Griffiths G. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 71-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), cells microinjected with β-COP antibodies serve as the positive control. We have shown recently that syntaxin 7 is in the endosomal compartment (28Wong S.H. Xu Y. Zhang T. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and syntaxin 7 is thus not expected to function in the secretory pathway. Cells microinjected with syntaxin 7 antibodies thus serve as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 7, in cells microinjected with antibodies against Vti1-rp2 (C,arrows), surface labeling of G-protein was dramatically reduced, resulting in accumulation of G-protein in perinuclear structures characteristic of the Golgi apparatus (D,arrows). This inhibitory effect is comparable with that seen in cells microinjected with antibodies against β-COP (A–B, arrows). In marked contrast, transport of G-protein to the cell surface was unaffected (E andF, arrows) in cells microinjected with syntaxin 7 antibodies. These results suggest that transport of G-protein from the ER to the plasma membrane is specifically inhibited in cells microinjected with antibodies against Vti1-rp2, and the site of inhibition seems to be at the level of the Golgi apparatus because G-protein was seen to accumulate in structures characteristic of the Golgi apparatus and the arrested G-protein colocalized well with markers of the Golgi apparatus such as 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl))-ceramide and binding sites for lectin lens culinaris agglutinin (data not shown). Although more detailed future experiments are needed to address the mechanistic aspects of Vti1-rp2 involvement in protein transport, these results clearly revealed a role of Vti1-rp2 in protein transport in the secretory pathway. We have identified a novel 29-kDa mammalian protein (Vti1-rp2) that has characteristics of a SNARE based on the presence of a COOH-terminal hydrophobic membrane anchor and several regions that can potentially form coiled-coil structures (6Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 7Pfeffer S.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 441-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 8Rothman J.E.

Subramaniam V.N. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20162-20166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Three observations establish that Vti1-rp2 is indeed a SNARE. First, Vti1-rp2 in Golgi detergent extract can interact with immobilized GST-α-SNAP in a specific and dose-dependent manner. Interaction of Vti1-rp2 with immobilized GST-α-SNAP occurs with efficiencies comparable with that of known Golgi SNAREs such as GS28 (20Subramaniam V.N. Peter F. Philip R. Wong S.H. Hong W. Science. 1996; 272: 1161-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The second line of evidence is that association of Vti1-rp2 with GST-α-SNAP could be abolished by NSF, specifically under conditions that promote NSF ATPase activity and dissociation of SNARE complexes. This suggests that interaction of Vti1-rp2 with immobilized α-SNAP occurs through Vti1-rp2-containing SNARE complex(es) in the Golgi extract. The demonstration of existence of Vti1-rp2 in at least two distinct SNARE complexes (one containing syntaxin 5 and the other containing syntaxin 6) provides the third line of evidence to support that Vti1-rp2 is a novel SNARE. The subcellular localization of Vti1-rp2 was established by two independent results. First, Vti1-rp2 is highly enriched in a membrane fraction that is also enriched for the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, Vti1-rp2 colocalized well with the Golgi marker mannosidase II in both control as well as nocodazole-fragmented Golgi apparatus. Like mannosidase II, Vti1-rp2 could be redistributed into ER-like structures by brefeldin A. It is thus firmly established that Vti1-rp2 is a novel SNARE of the Golgi apparatus. Data base searches with Vti1-rp2 sequence revealed that Vti1-rp2 is most homologous to Vti1p. Vti1p is a recently identified v-SNARE of the yeast Golgi and has been implicated in two independent vesicular transport events (23von Mollard G.F. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). By interacting with the early Golgi t-SNARE Sed5p (the yeast counterpart of syntaxin 5) (37Hardwick K.G. Pelham H.R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 38Sögaard M. Tani K. Ye R.B. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), Vti1p has been suggested to function as a v-SNARE for vesicles involved in retrograde intra-Golgi transport. Furthermore, Vti1p has also been shown to be involved in transport from the late Golgi to the vacuole (equivalent to the mammalian lysosome) by interacting with Pep12p (39Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), a syntaxin-like t-SNARE of the pre-vacuolar compartment (equivalent to the mammalian late endosome). Whether Vti1-rp2 represents the mammalian counterpart of Vti1p remains to be further investigated, although another mammalian protein (Vti1-rp1) homologous to Vti1p could functionally substitute for the yeast Vti1p (32von Mollard G.F. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2624-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Besides its sequence homology with Vti1p, another property of Vti1-rp2 that is similar to Vti1p is that a significant amount of Vti1-rp2 exists in a syntaxin 5-containing Golgi SNARE complex. In addition, a significant amount of Vti1-rp2 was also shown to be present in a syntaxin 6-containing SNARE complex. Since coimmunoprecipitation of syntaxin 5 and syntaxin 6 was not observed, these results suggest that Vti1-rp2 exists in distinct syntaxin 5- and syntaxin 6-containing SNARE complexes. Although the functional aspects remain to be established, syntaxin 6 has been shown recently to be enriched in the trans-Golgi network (22Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The presence of Vti1-rp2 in at least two distinct Golgi SNARE complexes indicates that it may function as a SNARE for at least two types of vesicle-mediated transport events. One will dock and fuse with cis-Golgi by interaction with syntaxin 5, whereas the other will dock and fuse with trans-Golgi network via interaction with syntaxin 6. The interaction of Vti1-rp2 with at least two syntaxin-like t-SNAREs is consistent with a recent study showing that yeast Vti1p could interact with at least five distinct syntaxin-like t-SNAREs (40Holthuis J.C.M. Nichols B.J. Dhruvakumar S. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Since Vti1p participate in two distinct transport events (one associated with the secretory pathway and the other in the endosomal pathway), the existence of two distinct mammalian proteins homologous to Vti1p indicates that the two equivalent transport events in mammalian cells may be mediated by two distinct proteins. The preferential association of Vti1-rp2 with the Golgi apparatus indicates that Vti1-rp2 may participate in a transport event in the secretory pathway. Consistent with this, we have shown that microinjection of antibodies against Vti1-rp2 specifically inhibited transport of G-protein to the cell surface at the level of Golgi apparatus. The extents of inhibition of G-protein transport seen in cells microinjected with Vti1-rp2 antibodies are comparable with those seen in cells microinjected with antibodies against β-coat protein. Serving as a negative control, G-protein transport to the plasma membrane was unaffected in cells microinjected with antibodies against endosomal syntaxin 7. Vti1-rp2 thus plays a role in protein transport in the secretory pathway, and the role of yeast Vti1p in the secretory pathway is most likely mediated by Vti1-rp2 in mammalian cells. Furthermore, our preliminary studies with Vti1-rp1 suggests that it is preferentially associated with the trans-Golgi network and/or the endosomal compartment, 3S. H. Wong and W.-J.

In rats, this enzyme is selectively expressed in the liver, and its expression is strongly repressed by androgens. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses revealed two hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF1), three CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), and one consensus palindromic thyroid hormone response elements within the first 215 base pairs (bp) of the promoter sequence of rat Std. This promoter is normally inactive in fibroblast-derived NIH 3T3 cells. However, overexpression of HNF1 and C/EBP resulted in synergistic activation of the Std promoter in this cell type, indicating essential roles of these two trans-regulators in liver-selective expression of the rat Std gene. On the other hand, point mutations at any one of five cis elements proximal to the −215 bp region markedly reduced reporter gene expression, suggesting that all of these sites are important for overall promoter function. Androgenic repression of the Std gene in rat liver can be recapitulated in androgen receptor (AR)-negative HepG2 hepatoma cells after cotransfection with an AR expression plasmid. Functional assay of a nested set of 5′-deleted promoters mapped the negative androgen response region between positions −235 and −310. Antibody supershift and oligonucleotide competition identified three OCT-1 and two C/EBP elements between bp −231 and −292. An additional OCT-1 site was found to overlap with a C/EBP element at the −262/−252 position. Mutational inactivation of any one of five cis elements within the −231/−292 region abolished negative androgen response. However, none of these cis elements showed DNase I protection by recombinant AR in footprinting assay, suggesting the absence of a direct AR-DNA interaction. Thus, these studies on rat Std promoter function indicate that (i) HNF1 and C/EBP are responsible for liver specificity of the ratStd gene; (ii) androgenic repression of the gene requires the presence of all of the OCT-1 and C/EBP elements between positions −231 and −292; and (iii) AR may exert its negative regulatory effect indirectly through transcriptional interference of OCT-1 and C/EBP rather than through a direct DNA-AR interaction.

Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase (EC 2.8.2) is a cytosolic sulfoconjugating enzyme that catalyzes sulfonation of a number of endogenous hydroxysteroids as well as polycyclic xenobiotics such as certain aromatic carcinogens (1Weinshilboum R.M.

However, in contrast to the inactivation of steroids and drugs, sulfonation enhances the carcinogenic/mutagenic potential of a group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by converting them to DNA-reactive metabolites (6Flesher J.W.

We showed earlier that the androgen sensitivity of the rat liver is reciprocally correlated with the hepatic expression of the dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase gene (designated asStd), and the androgen-mediated down-regulation ofStd ensures that a maximum state of androgen responsiveness of the liver could be attained during the animal's post-pubertal young adult life (8Song C-S.

Furthermore, using a transiently transfected cell culture system, we have recently provided evidence that Std can attenuate androgen receptor function as reflected by the loss of androgen induction of the probasin gene promoter (11Chan J. Song C.-S. Matusik R.J. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 109: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This finding lends further credence to a physiological role of Std in modulating androgen sensitivity in selected target tissues. Mammalian Std expression is under tissue-specific and hormonal control. The rodent enzyme is synthesized exclusively in the liver, whereas in humans, both the liver and adrenal cortex are the major sites of its expression, although minor amounts of Std are also expressed in the intestine and several other tissues (1Weinshilboum R.M.

DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The liver and intestinal expression of Std relates primarily to the metabolic inactivation of drugs and steroids and to the bioactivation of aromatic carcinogens, while the adrenal Std acts on locally synthesized DHEA. The significance of the high plasma levels of DHEA and DHEA-sulfate in human physiology remains unclear, although they are thought to be linked to the risk factors for neoplasia and cardiovascular diseases and to the humoral regulation of pregnancy, and they may also play roles in organizing the neocortex in developing brain (1Weinshilboum R.M.

A. 1998; 95: 4678-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a number of human breast cancer cell lines exhibit altered Std expression, suggesting that Std activity may contribute to the differences in sex steroid sensitivity of the normalversus neoplastic breast tissue (15Pasqualini J.R. Eur. J. Cancer. 1992; 28A: 758-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since DHEA also acts as a prohormone in the synthesis of androgens and estrogens in peripheral tissues (16Sourla A. Martel C. Labrie C. Labrie F. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 753-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the suggested role of Std in the local modulation of tissue androgen sensitivity is especially intriguing. In the rodent liver, the Std gene is regulated by both androgens and growth hormone. Std is expressed at severalfold higher levels in females than adult males, and either hypophysectomy or androgen supplementation following ovariectomy causes a marked down-regulation of this gene in the liver (9Demyan W.F.

In this article, we describe identification and characterization of the regulatory elements that provide the liver-specific and androgen-repressible regulation of the rat Std gene. Multiple cis elements cognate to the liver-enriched hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF1) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) are needed for appropriate expression of this gene, and both HNF1 and C/EBP are essential for the liver-selective promoter activity. Our results also show that androgenic inhibition of the Std promoter occurs in the absence of any identifiable binding site for the androgen receptor (AR) within the negative androgen response region (nARR) and that a composite interaction involving multiple OCT-1 and C/EBP elements at the upstream promoter is integral to the mechanism of the hormonal repression. The liver nuclear extract was prepared as by Hattori et al. (19Hattori M. Tugores A. Veloz L. Karin M. Brenner D. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (20Supakar P.C. Jung M.H. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 837-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and was dialyzed against 20% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mmEDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium molybdate. The nuclear lysis buffer and all subsequent solutions contained 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and bestatin as protease inhibitors, and all manipulations were performed at 2–4 °C. The end-radiolabeled DNA fragment (50,000 cpm, 10 fmol) was incubated with 50 μg of nuclear extract in a 50-μl reaction mixture at 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) double-stranded DNA. The reaction was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature without the DNA probe, after which the labeled DNA was added and incubation continued on ice for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then brought to 1 mmCaCl2 and 5 mm MgCl2 and incubated at room temperature for 1 min, after which the protein-bound DNA was digested with 0.02–0.1 μg of DNase I (30 s to 2 min, room temperature) under standard buffer conditions (20Supakar P.C. Jung M.H. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 837-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For incubations with BSA, 10-fold less DNase I was used. Digested DNA fragments were extracted with phenol-chloroform and analyzed on a sequencing gel. The 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA probe (50,000 cpm, 10 fmol) was incubated with nuclear extract (5 μg) under previously described conditions (21Song C.S. Her S. Choi S.J. Slomczynska M. Roy A.K. Chatterjee B. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For oligonucleotide competition, the unlabeled homologous or heterologous DNA was added during preincubation. In supershift assays, the nuclear extract was preincubated with the antibody (1–3 μg) for 10 min before addition of the DNA probe. Antibodies to HNF1-α and HNF1-β were gifts from Dr. Gerald Crabtree, and the antibodies to other transcription factors were purchased commercially (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The expression vectors pThioHis and pTrxFus (Invitrogen, CA) were used for Escherichia coliexpression of rat AR and human OCT-1, respectively. The 1.1-kilobase pair rat AR cDNA containing the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains of AR was generated by PCR using the full-length AR cDNA (a gift from Dr. S. Liao) as a template. The 1.1-kilobase pair rat AR cDNA was cloned at the BglII site of pThioHis to create pThioHis-AR, which contains an in frame fusion of the rat AR cDNA with the His-Patch thioredoxin start codon. The 2.3-kilobase pair full-length OCT-1 cDNA (gift from Dr. W. Herr) was cloned into theBamHI site of pTrxFus to create pTrxFus-OCT-1, which has OCT-1 and thioredoxin cDNAs in the same reading frame. Thioredoxin-AR was expressed in the E. coli strain TOP10 by induction of the log phase bacterial culture with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (room temperature, 7 h). Harvested cells were lysed by sonication and freeze-thaw. The supernatant of the cell lysate was purified by affinity chromatography on ProBondTM (Invitrogen). The expressed fusion protein was analyzed by gel shift and antibody supershift assays, using a 41-base pair androgen response element (ARE) from the tyrosine aminotransferase gene (22Xie Y.B. Sui Y.P. Shan L.X. Palvimo J.J. Phillips D.M. Janne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4939-4948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an anti-AR antibody (AR C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which was raised against a C-terminal epitope of AR. For OCT-1 expression, the E. coli strain GI724 was transformed with pTrxFus-OCT-1, and the transformed bacteria were grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase and induced with tryptophan (100 μg/ml) at 37C for 4 h. Harvested cells were osmotically shocked, and the supernatant from the cell lysate was used as the source for OCT-1. The expressed fusion protein was characterized by Western blot using anti-OCT-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A nested set of 5′-deleted promoters were prepared from the −1970/+38 ratStd gene fragment by PCR, using the plasmid pSMPA-CAT as the template. The PCR products were subcloned in the reporter vector pSV0CAT-reverse (8Song C-S. Kim J.M. Roy A.K. Chatterjee B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) at the SalI site. The senescence marker protein SMP-2, initially identified as an age-dependent liver protein, was later established to be DHEA-sulfotransferase, and thus the SMPA promoter is equivalent to the Std promoter (8Song C-S. Kim J.M. Roy A.K. Chatterjee B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,23Chatterjee B. Majumdar D. Ozbilen O. Murty C.V.R. Roy A.K. J. Biol.

Commun. 1990; 166: 1494-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The PCR products and the promoter/vector junctions were authenticated by DNA sequencing. Point mutations were introduced at specific regulatory elements by PCR-mediated splicing after overlap extension (25Ho A.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar). In initial steps, the left arm of the PCR product was generated from the wild type template, using a vector-derived sense primer and an antisense primer containing desired base changes corresponding to a specific protein-binding site of the Std promoter; similarly, the right arm of the PCR product was generated using the sense primer containing the mutant oligo sequence and the vector-derived antisense primer. Amplified DNAs were gel-purified, and vector-based sense and antisense primers were used to splice the left arm and right arm DNA products by overlap PCR. Mutant oligonucleotides for the individual sites (mutant bases in boldface type and underlined) are as follows: A, GAGAATATCGATGATTCTTTTAACT; B, AGTAGTTAGTTTCAGATCTGACT; C1, TGTGTGGATCCATATTTATTTATTC; C2 ,AGTTGAAAGAATTCAATACAATAAC; D, TGGGGGTACCGAACTTGGGCTCAC; E1, GTCACTTGCCTGCATATTTAAA; E3, AAATCATTCATATGGCTAAAT; E4, AGCTAACGCGCATTAGAAGA; E5, AAGATAGAATTCATTATCCTGC. The vector-derived sense primer, TCTGCTCTGATGCCGCATAGT, and the vector-derived antisense primer (located within the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) coding sequence), 5′-CGGTAACCCTATATAGTTGCCACCA, were used. The amplified DNAs were sequenced prior to their subcloning into pSV0CAT-reverse. The cell lines were from ATCC and were grown either in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) with 5% fetal bovine serum (HepG2 cells) or in minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (NIH 3T3 cells). The cells were seeded at 5 × 105/well in six-well plates (Falcon), cultured overnight, and transfected with plasmid DNAs by calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2031-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The Std-CAT plasmid was at 2 μg/well, and expression plasmids for HNF1-α (pRSV-HNF1-α; a gift from Dr. Gerald Crabtree) and C/EBP-α (pMSV-C/EBP-α; a gift from Dr. Steven McKnight) were each at 1 μg/well. The DNA amount per well was equalized to a total of 4 μg by adding the vector plasmid. Cells were harvested 36 h after transfection, and CAT activity in the cell extract was assayed using 14C-chloramphenicol andn-butyryl coenzyme A substrates. Radiolabeled products were quantified by liquid scintillation spectroscopy of xylene-extractedn-butyryl chloramphenicols. Alternately, reaction products were separated by thin layer chromatography on a silica gel plate (Sigma) and visualized by autoradiography. The protein content was measured by the Bradford assay (27Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). In our earlier studies, we observed that the rat Std promoter from −1970 to +38 is functional in hepatoma but not fibroblast-type cell lines (8Song C-S. Kim J.M. Roy A.K. Chatterjee B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this article, we show that the liver-selective activity of this gene is retained even with a much shorter promoter fragment. As evident from Fig.1 A, both −1023/+38 ratStd-CAT and −215/+38 rat Std-CAT plasmids are active in expressing CAT in transfected HepG2 (human hepatoma) but not NIH 3T3 (mouse fibroblast) cells (lanes 1 and2 versus lanes 5 and6), although both cell types could support the ubiquitous expression of the SV40 viral promoter (lanes 4and 8). The rat Std promoter is also inactive in several other nonhepatocytic cell lines such as COS-1, T47D, LNCaP, and HeLa, which are derived from diverse tissues. Thus, the DNA sequence between −215 and +38 contains sufficient regulatory information for the liver-selective transcriptional activation of the Stdpromoter. Androgen-dependent down-regulation of Std gene expression observed in vivo in the rat liver (9Demyan W.F. Song C.S. Kim D.S. Her S. Gallwitz W. Rao T.R. Slomczynska M. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Mol.

A. 1996; 93: 728-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) can be recapitulated in transfected liver cell lines. As shown in Fig.1 B, upon cotransfection of HepG2 cells with an AR expression plasmid and the Std-CAT reporter construct, CAT gene expression directed by either the −1970/+38 or the −1023/+38 promoter fragment was inhibited by 80% in the presence of 10−8m DHT. Androgenic inhibition was also observed at 10−9m DHT, albeit to a lesser extent. Because of the higher level of steroid-metabolizing enzymes in the liver and liver-derived cells, generally a higher level of the hormonal ligand is necessary for a maximal hormonal response in these cell lines. Selectivity of AR-mediated trans-repression of the Stdpromoter was established by the observed lack of any inhibitory effect by dexamethasone, progesterone, or estrogen in HepG2 cells cotransfected with the corresponding receptor expression plasmids. Interestingly, a DNA-binding mutant of AR, which carries a single amino acid substitution (Ala → Thr) at the 579-position, also failed to mediate the DHT-dependent down-regulation of theStd promoter (Fig. 1 B, inset), indicating the important role of this domain of the receptor in the negative hormonal regulation. The regulatory elements conferring the liver-specific activity to the Stdgene were initially investigated by DNase I footprinting of the −215/+38 promoter in the presence of rat liver nuclear extracts (Fig.2). Results show five strong footprinted regions at −32/−55 (site A), −58/−78 (site B), −92/−113 (site C1), −120/−138 (site C2), and −173/−193 (site D). Same DNA sequences were also protected for the antisense strand. However, no gender- and age-dependent differential nuclease protection of the −215/+38 DNA was detected (lane 2 versus lanes 3 and4), indicating that this promoter fragment lacks the necessary cis elements that confer the age- and sex-dependent regulation of Std gene expression. The site A (−32/−55) shows close similarity to the HNF1-binding elements of a number of hepatocyte-specific genes (28Mendel D.B. Crabtree G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 677-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and sites B (−58/−78), C1 (−92/−113), and C2(−120/−138) show 100% homology to the C/EBP consensus element ((G/A)TTGCG(C/T)AA(C/T) or T(G/T)NNG(C/T)AA(T/G)) (29Johnson P.F. Landschulz W.H. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 30Osada S. Yamamoto H. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition, the sequence GTTACAATATTTAT from positions −92 to −105 shows an overall similarity to the prototypic HNF1-binding sequence, despite having the half-sites separated by two bases instead of one; interestingly, examination of the promoters of a series of HNF1 target genes also revealed occasional examples of variable spacer bases within an HNF1 element (28Mendel D.B. Crabtree G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 677-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the D site at the −173/−193 footprinted sequence is identical to the TREpal, an inverted repeat of the core hexad consensus sequence (AGGTCA) that is activated by the thyroid hormone receptor, retinoic acid receptor, and the retinoid X receptor (31Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar). The putative cis-acting sites summarized in TableI were authenticated by oligonucleotide cross-competition and antibody supershift analyses (Figs.Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Fig. 3 shows that the binding site A yielded multiple gel-retarded complexes (lane 1), which were competed out with an excess of the unlabeled homologous sequence as well as the HNF1 consensus sequence (lanes 2 and 4) and not by the heterologous D element (lane 3). Moreover, as evident from the antibody supershift data, the major component of the A complex (marked with an asterisk) specifically immunoreacted with the antisera to either HNF1-α or HNF1-β (lanes 6 and 7). Three additional complexes with faster electrophoretic mobilities are most likely the proteolytic fragments of HNF1 that are not recognized by the epitope-specific HNF1 antibodies. Intensities of these additional bands varied in different batches of nuclear extracts, possibly due to differences in the extent of proteolysis.Table IPutative cis-acting sequences at the DNase I-footprinted sites of the −215/+38 rat Std promoterThe line drawing at the top is a schematic map (not to the scale) of the five DNA elements (A, B, C1, C2, and D) relative to the transcription start site (+1).

The nucleotide sequence of the sense strand of each element and its location with respect to the +1 site are shown.

In vivolabeling with [32P]orthophosphate demonstrates that in primary mast cells and in transfected RBL-2H3 cells overexpressing GTP cyclohydrolase I, the enzyme exists in a phosphorylated form. Antigen binding to the high affinity receptor for IgE triggers an additional and transient phosphorylation of GTP cyclohydrolase I with a concomitant rise in its activity, and in consequence, cellular tetrahydrobiopterin levels increase. These events culminate 8 min after stimulation and can be mimicked by phorbol ester. The hyperphosphorylation is greatly reduced by the protein kinase C inhibitor Ro-31-8220.

Consequently, these oxygenases initiate serotonin and catecholamine biosynthesis, respectively (reviewed in Ref. 1Kaufman S. Fisher D.B. Hayaishi O. Oxygenases. Academic Press, Inc., New York1972: 285-370Google Scholar). The cofactor H4biopterin is synthesized de novo from GTP, and the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway is catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16). The subsequent activity of 6-pyruvoyl H4pterin synthase (EC 4.6.1.10) and sepiapterin reductase (EC 1.1.1.153) yields the final product, H4biopterin (reviewed in Ref. 2Dutch D.S. Smith G.K. J. Nutr.

The activity of mammalian GTP cyclohydrolase I is regulated by cytokines in a cell line and tissue-specific manner. For example, in T cells (3Ziegler I. Schott K. Lübbert M. Herrmann F. Schwulera U. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and macrophages (4Schott K. Gütlich M. Ziegler I. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 5Schoedon G. Troppmair J. Fontana A. Huber C. Curtius H.C. Niederwieser H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 155: 303-310Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar) it is induced by interferon γ (3Ziegler I. Schott K. Lübbert M. Herrmann F. Schwulera U. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in rat mesangial cells it is triggered by tumor necrosis factor α or interleukin 1β (6Plüss C. Werner E.R. Blau N. Wachter H. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Among a panel of cytokines that support the growth of murine BMMC, KL (kit ligand; or stem cell factor) selectively enhances the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I about 6-fold (7Ziegler I. Hültner L. Egger D. Kempkes B. Mailhammer R. Gillis S. Rodl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12544-12551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that either interferon γ treatments of T cells and macrophages (4Schott K. Gütlich M. Ziegler I. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or cultivation of BMMC with KL (8Ziegler I. Schott K. Hültner L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 338: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) increases the steady state mRNA levels of this enzyme; moreover, it was reported (6Plüss C. Werner E.R. Blau N. Wachter H. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that increased GTP cyclohydrolase I protein levels occurred in rat mesangial cells exposed to interleukin 1β. Evidence is accumulating, however, that GTP cyclohydrolase I activity is not only subject to transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. For example, a conformational change may be induced by binding of a feedback regulatory protein consisting of 9.5-kDa subunits (9Milstien S. Jaffe H. Kowlessur D. Bonner T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 19743-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Yoneyama T. Brewer J.M. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9690-9696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, the kinetics of cytokine-induced or of cell-cycle-associated GTP cyclohydrolase I activity in T cells (4Schott K. Gütlich M. Ziegler I. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and in rat thymocytes (11Schott K. Brand K. Hatakeyama K. Kagamiyama H. Maier J. Werner T. Ziegler I. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), respectively, did not fully correlate with the kinetics of steady state levels of mRNA specific for the enzyme. It was suggested, therefore, that post-translational modification of GTP cyclohydrolase I may contribute to the changes in its activity. The combination of interleukin 1β with agents that elevate cellular cAMP levels caused an additive increase in mRNA for GTP cyclohydrolase I but also yielded a marked synergistic increase at the activity level in rat mesangial cells; therefore, a prominent post-translational modulation of the enzyme was postulated (6Plüss C. Werner E.R. Blau N. Wachter H. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the observation that phorbol ester triggers a rapid but transient accumulation of neopterin and biopterin in primed T cells and in various cell lines (12Seidl J. Borchert M. Ziegler I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) suggested that GTP cyclohydrolase I may become phosphorylated. Finally, in PC12 cells exposed to high KCl concentrations, Imazumi et al. (13Imazumi K. Sasaki T. Takahashi K. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reported that a rabphilin-3A antibody co-immunoprecipitated several phosphorylated proteins, one of which was a 30-kDa protein with a peptide map and amino acid analysis identical with GTP cyclohydrolase I. Nonetheless, a direct and unequivocal proof for a post-translational modification of this enzyme has been lacking. Consequently, we examined phosphorylation of GTP cyclohydrolase I and its modulation of activity in response to an external stimulus in rodent mast cells. Among all primary cells of mammalian origin, the expression level of GTP cyclohydrolase I activity in KL-induced BMMC is best for a biochemical experimentation; the activity levels in these cells are 5 to 50-fold higher than in liver, adrenal, brain (14Sawada M. Horikoshi T. Masada M. Akino M. Sugimoto T. Marsuura S. Nagatsu T. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), or in primed T cells (3Ziegler I. Schott K. Lübbert M. Herrmann F. Schwulera U. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3 has been an extensively used model for stimulus protein phosphorylation coupling in mast cells. Antigen binding to the IgE-primed cells leads to a complex sequence of events that transduce the signal. The sequence is initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the β and γ chains in FcεR1 by the protein-tyrosine kinase p53/56lyn and subsequent activation of p72syk (15Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rivera J. Hamawy M.M. IgE Receptor (FcεRI) Function in Mast Cells and Basophils.

Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997: 33-54Google Scholar). Activation of phospholipase C-γ 1 by tyrosine phosphorylation possibly involves p72syk and causes phosphoinositide breakdown. This generates 1,2-sn-diacylglycerol as a potent activator of all PKC isotypes (except PKC-ζ) that are reported to occur in rodent mast cells (reviewed in Refs. 16Rivera J. Hamawy M.M. IgE Receptor (FcεRI) Function in Mast Cells and Basophils. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997: 107-126Google Scholar and 17Benhamou M. Hamawy M.M. IgE Receptor (FcεRI) Function in Mast Cells and Basophils. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997: 33-54Google Scholar). The δ isoform of PKC partly associates with and phosphorylates the receptor upon engagement of FcεR1 by antigen. Besides, PKC-δ becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues associated with the membrane and primed to phosphorylate various substrates (Refs. 18Haleem-Smith H. Chang E.Y. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M.

Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997: 107-126Google Scholar). Here we show that the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I is rapidly and transiently enhanced in response to antigen binding to FcεR1 of KL-induced BMMC and of RBL-2H3. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the enzyme exists in the cell in a phosphorylated form and that it becomes hyperphosphorylated upon antigen triggering. Evidence is provided that PKC is linked to the modulation of enzyme phosphorylation and activity and thus, to a rapid regulation of H4biopterin production of the mast cell.

The sources of the following reagents appear in parentheses: phorbol ester (PMA) (Sigma); Ro-31-8220 and hemocyanin-DNP conjugate (Calbiochem); 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (Biomol); protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ); ECL detection system, ECL biotinylation system, Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham); CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham); alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim). Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: anti-rat Ig antibodies for immunoglobulin isotyping (Zymed Laboratories Inc. and American Type Culture Collection); peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG and second antibodies (Dianova); monoclonal IgE antibody to DNP (Sigma); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and supplements (Life Technologies); myelin basic protein (Life Technologies, Inc.); green fluorescent protein vector (CLONTECH). Monoclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing Lou/C rats with a bacterially expressed murine GTP cyclohydrolase I fused in frame with Escherichia coli maltose binding protein (MGTP-maltose binding protein) (25Gütlich M. Ziegler I. Witter K. Hemmens B. Hültner L. McDonald J.D. Werner T. Rödl W. Bacher A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1675-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The procedure was essentially as described in Kremmer et al. (26Kremmer E. Kranz B.R. Hille A. Klein A. Eulitz M. Hoffman-Fezer G. Feiden W. Herrmann K. Delecluse H.J. Delsol G. Bornkamm G.W. Müller-Lantzsch N. Graesser F. Virology. 1995; 208: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Screening of hybridoma supernatants was performed in a solid-phase immunoassay using bacterial extracts fromE. coli expressing either the MGTP-maltose binding protein or a maltose binding protein control. The immunoglobulin type was determined with rat Ig class (anti-IgM) and IgG subclass-specific mouse mAbs. Antibody specificity of MGTP-6B6 (rat IgG2b) and MGTP-6H11 (rat IgG2a) was tested by immunoblotting against murine GTP cyclohydrolase I expressed in E. coli (see Fig. 1). The monoclonal antibodies were purified using Protein G-Sepharose columns. In immunoprecipitates obtained from extracts of KL-induced BMMC or from E. coliexpressing recombinant GTP cyclohydrolase I, 90% of total GTP cyclohydrolase I activity was recovered. Moreover, pre-saturation of the mAb MGTP-6B6 with recombinant rat GTP cyclohydrolase I inhibited the subsequent immunoprecipitation as examined by activity determination in immunoprecipitates of KL-induced BMMC. Primary mouse BMMC were obtained from femoral bone marrow and were kept in interleukin 3-dependent growth. Their maturation was induced by KL for 40 h. Details of the culture conditions have been described previously (7Ziegler I. Hültner L. Egger D. Kempkes B. Mailhammer R. Gillis S. Rodl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12544-12551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hültner L. Szöts H. Welle M. Van Snick J. Moeller J. Dörmer P. Immunology. 1989; 67: 408-413PubMed Google Scholar). P815 cells were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig. The 2H3 subline of RBL cells was a gift of D. Arndt-Jovin, Goettingen, Germany. Cells were maintained in flasks with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2atmosphere. For experiments, they were seeded in 60-mm Petri dishes and grown to a density of 1–5 × 106 cells/dish. The cells were loaded with monoclonal anti-DNP IgE (0.5–1 μg/ml; 2–4 h). After washing in Hanks' solution, activation with DNP conjugated to hemocyanin (1–3 μg/ml) or with 60 nm PMA was performed at 37 °C for the indicated time according to standard procedures (27Turner H. Reif K. Rivera J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9500-9506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Germano P. Gomez J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23102-23107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by freezing of the cell pellet (BMMC and P815) or the Petri dishes (RBL-2H3) in liquid nitrogen. AnEcoRI/HindIII fragment of pNCO-GTP (25Gütlich M. Ziegler I. Witter K.

Bacher A. Ziegler I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which comprises the entire rat GTP cyclohydrolase cDNA sequence, had been cloned into the pSBC1 vector (30Dirks W. Wirth M. Hauser H. Gene. 1993; 128: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), yielding pSBC1-GTP. The construct was cotransfected with pUHD15–1 (30Dirks W. Wirth M. Hauser H. Gene. 1993; 128: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), coding for the rtTA transactivator and a green fluorescent protein expressing vector (CLONTECH). The transfection was carried out according to the method of Alber et al. (31Alber G. Kent U.M. Metzger H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2428-2436PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was up to 50% as monitored by green fluorescent protein fluorescence. KL-induced BMMC (1 × 108 cells) were washed three times and then labeled with32Pi (370 kBq/ml) in phosphate- and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) for 2 h at 37 °C. After the addition of DNP-specific IgE (1 μg/ml), the incubation was continued for 1 h. The cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate- and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Aliquots of 1.5 ml were activated with DNP-hemocyanin conjugate as described above for the indicated times. Identical numbers of RBL-2H3 cells were seeded in 60-mm plates, grown 36 h, and then treated as the BMMCs. Cells (0.8–1 × 107) were lysed, and GTP cyclohydrolase I was immunoprecipitated by MGTP-6B6 mAb and coupled with CNBr-activated Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions. The procedures of lysis and precipitation were essentially the same as described previously (32Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Zhang J. Siraganian R.P. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1363-1367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Depending on the experiment, preincubations and precipitations with control antibodies were performed and are indicated in the legend. After solubilization of the immunoprecipitates, equal amounts of protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and immediately transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked, probed with the biotinylated MGT-6H11 mAb, and visualized using peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and enhanced chemiluminescence.32Pi labeling of GTP cyclohydrolase I was documented by exposure of the blotting membrane to a Kodak X-Omat AR film. Relative quantitative estimations of radioactivity were performed with Fuji BAS1000 phosphoimaging. Nonlabeled extracts were blotted and then probed with purified MGTP-6H11 mAb, followed by second stage peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG and ECL detection. Recombinant rat GTP cyclohydrolase I from overexpressing E. coli and RBL-2H3 cells was immunoprecipitated using Sepharose-coupled MGTP-6B6 mAb. The bead-bound GTP cyclohydrolase I immune complexes were washed 2 times with lysis buffer, resuspended in kinase buffer (33Kieser A. Seitz T. Adler H.S. Coffer P. Kremmer E. Crespo P. Gutkind J.S. Henderson D.W. Mushinski J.F. Kölch W. Mischak H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1455-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and washed 3 times with 500 μl of the same buffer. The kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at 30 °C essentially as described (33Kieser A. Seitz T. Adler H.S. Coffer P. Kremmer E. Crespo P. Gutkind J.S. Henderson D.W. Mushinski J.F. Kölch W. Mischak H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1455-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recombinant PKC isoform α, β, and δ purified from baculo virus-infected insect cells (34Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar) were adjusted to equal activity using myelin basic protein as a substrate. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes. The labeled substrates were visualized by autoradiography after probing with MGTP-6H11 antibody as described above. The cells were homogenized in Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0) containing 2.5 mm EDTA. Aliquots of the centrifuged extracts (15 min at 14 000 × g) were used for determination of pterins and enzyme assays. H2neopterin and H4biopterin were determined after acidic iodine oxidation of the reduced forms. Deproteinization by trichloroacetic acid, prepurificaion by cation exchange chromatography, separation by reverse-phase HPLC, and fluorometric detection have been described previously (21Ziegler I. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 28: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The modifications of the method were the same as detailed in (3Ziegler I. Schott K. Lübbert M. Herrmann F. Schwulera U. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ziegler I. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 28: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Ziegler I.

Acta. 1989; 990: 15-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I was determined in aliquots of the cell extract prepared as described above. The reaction product was oxidized to neopterin triphosphate by acidic iodine solution. After reduction of excess iodine by ascorbic acid, the sample was immediately separated by ion pair reverse-phase HPLC. The detailed assay conditions have been described previously (23Kerler F. Hültner L. Ziegler I. Katzenmaier G. Bacher A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Kerler F. Schwarzkopf B. Katzenmaier G. LeVan Q. Schmid C. Ziegler I. Bacher A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 990: 15-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For further verification, aliquots of the oxidized sample were neutralized and dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase (0.8 units/200 μl). Neopterin was then determined by reverse-phase HPLC as described above. For determination of 6-pyruvoyl-H4pterin synthase, dihydroneopterin triphosphate was first generated by incubation of GTP with recombinant murine GTP cyclohydrolase I. To determine the activity of the synthase, the cell extract was added, and the metastable intermediate 6-pyruvoyl-H4pterin was converted to H4biopterin by the addition of recombinant murine sepiapterin reductase and NADPH. After acidic iodine oxidation, biopterin was separated by HPLC. Detailed assay conditions have been described in Gütlich et al. (35Gütlich M. Witter K. Bourdais J. Veron M. Rödl W. Ziegler I. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The activity of sepiapterin reductase was determined by reduction of sepiapterin to dihydrobiopterin with NADPH, acidic iodine oxidation, and HPLC separation of the product. The detailed conditions have been described in Kerler et al. (23Kerler F. Hültner L. Ziegler I. Katzenmaier G. Bacher A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Kerler F. Schwarzkopf B. Katzenmaier G. LeVan Q. Schmid C. Ziegler I. Bacher A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 990: 15-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Protein was estimated by the Coomassie dye binding reagent (Bio-Rad protein assay reagent) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cultivation of BMMC in the presence of KL increases the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I more than 6-fold. Enzyme activities and H4biopterin production culminate after 40 h as described earlier (7Ziegler I. Hültner L. Egger D. Kempkes B. Mailhammer R. Gillis S. Rodl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12544-12551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular expression levels of the enzyme in extracts of interleukin 3-grown cells and of cells exposed to KL for 40 h were compared by immunoblotting. The blots were probed with either mAb MGTP-6H11 (Fig.1) or mAb MGTP-6B6 (data not shown). The comparison with recombinant murine GTP cyclohydrolase I confirmed the specificity of both mAbs; the blots showed that cultivation with KL markedly enhances the expression of the GTP cyclohydrolase I (Fig. 1). The experiments, moreover, clearly demonstrate that such high expression levels of GTP cyclohydrolase I make KL-induced BMMC an appropriate tool to investigate regulation at the protein level. To follow the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I in response to IgE and antigen stimulation of FcεRI, we used KL-induced BMMC and the rat tumor cell line RBL-2H3. With BMMC, the activities of 6-pyruvoyl-H4pterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase had earlier been found to largely exceed the activitiy of GTP cyclohydrolase I (7Ziegler I. Hültner L. Egger D. Kempkes B. Mailhammer R. Gillis S. Rodl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12544-12551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In RBL-2H3, the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I was much lower than in BMMC (for activity levels, see the Fig.2 legend). Similarly, in RBL-2H3 cells, the activities of the two subsequent enzymes in the de novopathway of H4biopterin synthesis were 16- to 20-fold higher than GTP cyclohydrolase I activity (data not shown). This confirms that GTP cyclohydrolase I represents the rate-limiting step in both BMMC and the rat mast cell line. The BMMC and RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized with an anti-DNP monoclonal IgE and stimulated with antigen. GTP cyclohydrolase I activity and cellular biopterin levels of only IgE-primed cells were similar to unprimed cells. Subsequent antigen stimulation caused a transient increase that culminated after 8 min. Consequently, cellular H4biopterin levels also transiently increased in both BMMC and in RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). The mastocytoma cell line P815 lacks both α and β chains of FcεRI and thus cannot respond to an antigen trigger (36Kulczycki Jr., A. Isersky C. Metzger H. J. Exp. Med. 1974; 139: 600-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). No increase in GTP cyclohydrolase I activity after IgE treatment and triggering with IgE antigen was detected (Fig. 2 C), indicating that the modulation of GTP cyclohydrolase I depends essentially on a functional signaling pathway that originates from antigen binding to primed FcεRI. In KL-induced BMMC, the cofactor concentration is calculated to be about 30 μm (7Ziegler I. Hültner L. Egger D. Kempkes B. Mailhammer R. Gillis S. Rodl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993;"

Both Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and 3′ → 5′ exonuclease-deficient (exo−) Vent polymerase were blocked by all photoproducts, whereas Taq polymerase could slowly bypass the cis-syn dimer. T7 RNA polymerase was able to bypass all the photoproducts in the order cis-syn> Dewar > (6-4) > trans-syn-II. Klenow fragment could not bypass any of the photoproducts, but an exo−mutant could bypass the cis-syn dimer to a greater extent than the others. Likewise T7 DNA polymerase, composed of the T7 gene 5 protein and Escherichia coli thioredoxin, was blocked by all the photoproducts, but the exo− mutant Sequenase 2.0 was able to bypass them all in the order cis-syn > Dewar > trans-syn-II > (6-4). No bypass occurred with an exo− gene 5 protein in the absence of the thioredoxin processivity factor. Bypass of the cis-syn andtrans-syn-II products by Sequenase 2.0 was essentially non-mutagenic, whereas about 20% dTMP was inserted opposite the 5′-T of the Dewar photoproduct. A mechanism involving a transient abasic site is proposed to account for the preferential incorporation of dAMP opposite the 3′-T of the photoproducts."
https://openalex.org/W1966328901,"Mutations at the phosphorylation site (Asp-378) of the yeast plasma-membrane H+-ATPase have been shown previously to cause misfolding of the ATPase, preventing normal movement along the secretory pathway; Asp-378 mutations also block the biogenesis of co-expressed wild-type ATPase and lead to a dominant lethal phenotype. To ask whether these defects are specific for Asp-378 or whether the phosphorylation region as a whole is involved, alanine-scanning mutagenesis has been carried out to examine the role of 11 conserved residues flanking Asp-378. In the sec6–4 expression system (Nakamoto, R. K., Rao, R., and Slayman, C. W. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7940–7949), the mutant ATPases displayed varying abilities to reach the secretory vesicles that deliver plasma-membrane proteins to the cell surface. Indirect immunofluorescence of intact cells also gave evidence for a spectrum of behavior, ranging from mutant ATPases completely arrested (D378A, K379A, T380A, and T384A) or partially arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum to those that reached the plasma membrane in normal amounts (C376A, S377A, and G381A). Although the extent of ER retention varied among the mutants, the endoplasmic reticulum appeared to be the only secretory compartment in which the mutant ATPases accumulated. All of the mutant proteins that localized either partially or fully to the ER were also malfolded based on their abnormal sensitivity to trypsin. Among them, the severely affected mutants had a dominant lethal phenotype, and even the intermediate mutants caused a visible slowing of growth when co-expressed with wild-type ATPase. The effects on growth could be traced to the trapping of the wild-type enzyme with the mutant enzyme in the ER, as visualized by double label immunofluorescence. Taken together, the results indicate that the residues surrounding Asp-378 are critically important for ATPase maturation and transport to the cell surface.

In eukaryotic cells, the first step in the biogenesis of plasma membrane proteins takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum, where there is an elaborate machinery to ensure correct protein folding and integration into the lipid bilayer (1Gething M.-J.

In recent years, several genetic diseases have been traced to mutations that damage the ability of particular proteins to interact properly with this biosynthetic machinery (3Brooks D.A.

These observations make it important to understand the factors that contribute to the proper folding of plasma membrane proteins as well as the quality control mechanisms that prevent malfolded proteins from being transported to the cell surface. The budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae can serve as a good model organism for such studies because of the increasingly detailed knowledge of its secretory system (10Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the work to be described below, we have focused on the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase, which is encoded by the PMA1 gene and comprises ∼10% of total plasma-membrane protein (11Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 12Rao R. Slayman C.W. Brambl R. Marzluf G.A. The Mycota. 3. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 29-56Google Scholar). Based on hydropathy plots and trypsinolysis studies, the ATPase is thought to contain 10 transmembrane segments, four at the N-terminal end and six at the C-terminal end of the molecule; both the N and C termini are exposed at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (13Mandala S.M. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16276-16281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with CFTR (14Seibert F.S. Linsdell P. Loo T.W. Hanrahan J.W. Clarke D.M. Riordan J.R. J. Biol.

Atherosclerosis. 1997; 131: 67-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), folding of the yeast PMA1 ATPase can be disrupted by a single amino acid substitution. This phenomenon was first observed during mutational studies of Asp-378, a residue conserved in all P-type ATPases. Asp-378 lies near the beginning of the central cytoplasmic loop and is phosphorylated by ATP to form a high energy β-aspartyl phosphate intermediate; thus, it plays an essential role in the reaction cycle. Strikingly, replacement of Asp-378 by Asn, Ser, or Glu was found to cause intracellular accumulation of the mutant protein, blocking the biogenesis of co-expressed wild-type ATPase and giving rise to a dominant lethal phenotype (15Rao R. Nakamoto R.K. Verjovski-Almedia S. Slayman C.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Harris S.L. Na S. Zhu X. Seto-Young D. Perlin D.S. Teem J.H.

More recently, biochemical studies have shown that, although the D378N protein appears to be integrated into the ER lipid bilayer, it is poorly folded and severely impaired in ligand binding (18Nakamoto R.K. Verjovski-Almeida S. Allen K.E. Ambesi A. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7338-7344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because Asp-378 is a key player in catalysis, it could conceivably play a special role in folding and biogenesis. On the other hand, the entire region surrounding the phosphorylation site could be required for successful folding and transit through the secretory pathway. It therefore seemed worthwhile to explore the structural and functional role of residues throughout the phosphorylation region of the ATPase. With this goal in mind, we have conducted an alanine scan of 11 conserved amino acids that flank Asp-378. Each of the mutant proteins has been examined for expression, folding, subcellular location, enzymatic activity, and effect on trafficking of wild-type ATPase. The results indicate that most of the mutations, which cluster at the predicted site of a β-turn, cause structural defects resulting in ER retention and dominant lethality. We conclude that the local region surrounding D378A is critically important for proper folding and interaction with the secretory machinery. In addition, our results show that the principal quality control step for the ATPase is located early in the secretory pathway: misfolded ATPases accumulate in the ER, but once they bypass the ER quality control machinery, they move to the plasma membrane without detectable accumulation in the Golgi. NY605 (MATa; ura3–52; leu2–3, 112; GAL2) was kindly provided by P. Novick. SY4 (MATa; ura3–52; leu2–3, 112; his4–619; GAL1::PMA1::URA3; sec6–4ts, GAL2) is isogenic with NY605, and was described previously by Nakamoto and co-workers (19Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this strain, the chromosomal copy of the PMA1 gene has been placed under control of the GAL1 promoter (20Goff C.G. Moir D.T. Kohno T. Gravius T.C. Smith R.A. Yamasaki E. Taunton-Rigby A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1984; 27: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). SY4 also contains the temperature-sensitive sec6–4 allele that blocks the last step of the secretory pathway: namely, the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. When transformed with the appropriate plasmid (see below), SY4 allows newly synthesized ATPase to be arrested in the secretory vesicles for study (19Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For ease in detecting the ATPase during biogenesis studies, two different epitope-tagged versions of PMA1 were constructed, containing either a 10-amino acid c-Myc epitope plus linking sequences (MTASEQKLISEEDLNDTS… . ) or a 9-amino acid HA epitope (MTYPYDVPDYADTS… . ) near the N terminus of the ATPase. 2C. F. Tourinho dos Santos, N. D. DeWitt, K. E. Allen, and C. W. Slayman, manuscript in preparation. As shown in Table I, the Myc-tagged and HA-taggedPMA1 genes were placed under control of the GAL1 promoter in plasmids YCpGAL1pr-PMA1-myc (centromeric; URA3) and YCpGAL1pr-PMA1-HA (centromeric; LEU2). The lithium acetate method (21Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to transform the plasmids into NY605 cells to study the delivery of the ATPase to the plasma membrane. The tagged genes were also placed under heat-shock control in plasmid YCp2HSE-PMA1-myc (centromeric; LEU2). These plasmids were transformed into SY4 cells to study the early stages of ATPase biogenesis.Table ICentromeric plasmids used in this studyPlasmidPMA1geneSelectable markerOriginPromoterEpitope tagYCpGAL1pr-PMA1-mycGAL1c-MycURA3pRN93, derived from Ycplac33 (46Geitz R.D.

Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6708-6713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To Myc-tag the mutant alleles and place them under heat-shock or GAL1 control, DNA fragments carrying the mutations were subcloned into the centromeric expression plasmids described above. The presence of the mutations in the final constructs was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing of theStyI-BamHI region. Quantitative immunoblotting was carried out to measure the steady-state expression levels of Myc-tagged wild-type and mutant ATPases in total membranes. SY4 cells transformed with either the wild-type or a mutant version of YCp2HSE-PMA1-myc were grown on minimal medium containing 2% galactose at 23 °C, transferred to medium containing 2% glucose for 3 h, and then shifted to 39 °C for 30 min (19Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After zymolyase treatment and Dounce homogenization of the cells, total membranes were isolated by differential centrifugation (18Nakamoto R.K. Verjovski-Almeida S. Allen K.E. Ambesi A. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7338-7344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An aliquot of membranes containing 10 μg of protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, solubilized in loading buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), followed by incubation with 125I-protein A and fluorography. Subcellular structures containing Myc-tagged ATPase were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using a modification of the method of Redding et al. (23Redding K. Holcomb C. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). For these experiments, NY605 cells were transformed with YCpGAL1pr-PMA1-myc alone (mutant or wild-type version; URA plasmid) or YCpGAL1pr-PMA1-HA (wild-type PMA1 gene; LEU plasmid) in combination with YCpGAL1pr-PMA1-myc (mutant pma1 gene; URA plasmid). The transformed strains were grown at 30 °C in synthetic complete medium (24Rose M.D. Winston F. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) lacking uracil (or uracil and leucine) and containing 4% raffinose, which was used as a carbon source to prevent glucose repression in the next step. At 1 OD/ml, the cells were shifted to medium with 4% galactose for 4 h to induce expression of the plasmid-encoded ATPase gene(s). Cells were fixed, treated with Zymolyase T-100, and permeabilized by Triton X-100 as described previously (23Redding K. Holcomb C. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Fixed, permeabilized spheroplasts were stained for immunofluorescence essentially as described by Redding et al. (23Redding K. Holcomb C. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), but with the addition of a blocking step in modified WT buffer, in which the dry milk and bovine serum albumin were replaced by 5% normal goat serum (Sigma). Four different primary antibodies were used: HA polyclonal (Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan), diluted 1:100; Myc monoclonal 9E10.2 from ascites fluid (provided by H. Dohlman), diluted 1:100; Sec7 large domain polyclonal antibody (provided by R. Schekman; Ref. 25Franzusoff A. Redding K. Crosby J. Fuller R.S. Schekman R. J.

Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), diluted 1:5000. Goat anti-rabbit FITC and goat anti-mouse Texas Red IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, Pa) served as fluorescent secondary antibodies and were diluted 1:100. For double labeling experiments, both primary antibodies were present during the initial incubation and both secondary antibodies were present during the subsequent incubation. To control for spurious cross-reactivity of the c-Myc and HA antibodies, uninduced cells were simultaneously fixed and stained with each set of antibodies. Cells were then stained with 4,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma), and mounted in Citifluor (Ted Pella, Redding, PA). For fluorescence microscopy, cells were observed with a Nikon Microphot-FXA (Melville, NY) and photographed using Tmax 400 black-and-white film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For confocal microscopy, cells were observed on a Bio-Rad MRC-600 scanning confocal microscope using dual channel filters for simultaneous visualization of Texas Red and FITC fluorochromes. For all images, the slit width was set to provide an optical slice of <1 μm. The absence of nonspecific antibody binding was verified by examining uninduced controls using the same settings, and the absence of bleed-through, by confirming that the signal disappeared when viewed with single-wavelength filter blocks. Images were collected with Comos software (Bio-Rad) and modified by contrast stretching, application of pseudocolor, and merging, using Adobe Photoshop 4.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Secretory vesicles were isolated from SY4 cells transformed with the wild-type or a mutant version YCp2HSE-PMA1-myc using a two-step discontinuous sucrose gradient (27Ambesi A. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Assays of ATPase hydrolysis, ATP-dependent proton transport, and protein were carried out as described previously (17Portillo F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol.

Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7338-7344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To examine the genetic behavior of the various mutations, NY605 cells transformed with wild-type or mutant YCpGAL1-PMA1-myc plasmid were grown on synthetic medium lacking uracil and containing 2% glucose. Cells were diluted in water and tested for growth on solid medium, lacking uracil and containing either 2% glucose (wild-type gene expressed) or 2% galactose (both mutant and wild-type genes expressed). The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 42 h and photographed. As described above, a central goal of this work was to explore structure-function relationships in the phosphorylation region of PMA1, surrounding the site (Asp-378) at which the β-aspartyl phosphate reaction intermediate is formed. To choose residues for study, sequences were aligned from 15 P-type ATPases differing in cation specificity and evolutionary distance from PMA1. As shown in Fig. 1, there is a striking stretch of identity from Asp-378 through Thr-382; the 5-amino acid motif DKTGT is conserved in every known P-type ATPase. On either side of this motif, there are two residues (Cys-376 and Ser-377; Leu-383 and Thr-384) that are nearly invariant, except in the distantly related heavy metal pumps and the KdpB potassium pump from Escherichia coli. Further downstream, conservation falls off sharply after Thr-384. Upstream of Cys-376, there is still noticeable conservation at Leu-375, which is present in all known H+-ATPases and is replaced by Ile or Val in the other P-type enzymes, and at Ile-374, which is replaced by Val or Leu in many P-ATPases (but by Ala, Ser, or Thr in other members of the family). Interestingly, the Robson-Garnier algorithm (29Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3410) Google Scholar) predicts a β-turn in the phosphorylation region; the turn begins at Ser-377, continues to Asn-386, and except for a brief indeterminate stretch immediately following Asn-386, is flanked by sequences that are strongly α-helical in character (Fig. 1). Based on the alignment of Fig. 1, we carried out alanine-scanning mutagenesis from Ile-374 to Thr-384. Because it seemed likely that at least some of the Ala substitutions would be lethal (15Rao R.

Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for the initial set of experiments. Expression was switched from the wild-type ATPase gene, located on the chromosome and controlled by theGAL1 promoter, to a mutant allele, located on a centromeric plasmid and controlled by a heat-shock promoter. At the same time, a temperature-sensitive block (sec6–4) in the last step of the secretory pathway led to the accumulation of secretory vesicles in the cytoplasm. It was then possible to isolate the vesicles and assay by immunoblotting with anti-ATPase antibody for newly synthesized mutant protein en route to the plasma membrane. As shown in Table II, the expression levels of C376A (104%), S377A (103%), and G381A (81%) were essentially normal when compared with the wild-type control. However, expression was significantly reduced in the rest of the mutants: I374A (55%), L375A (31%), K379A (29%), T380A (20%), T382A (14%), L383A (12%), and T384A (9%). D378A was the most severely affected, with little or no ATPase present in the secretory vesicles (5%) compared with an empty-plasmid control (2%). In a companion experiment, total cellular membranes were isolated and examined by immunoblotting, as shown in Fig. 2. In this case, all of the mutant proteins could be seen at roughly normal levels 30 min after the temperature shift, and the amount did not change significantly after 90 min (data not shown).

The GCF cDNA hybridizes to two additional mRNA species, 4.2 and 1.2 kilobases. We have used differential hybridization to identify a cDNA clone (termed GCF2) for the 4.2-kilobase mRNA and find that it is highly expressed in HUT-102 cells. The open reading frame consists of 2256 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 752 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 83 kilodaltons. GCF2 expressedin vitro using reticulocyte lysates and Escherichia coli migrates as a 160-kilodalton protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but has a molecular mass of 83 kilodaltons as determined by mass spectrum analysis. GCF2 binds to epidermal growth factor receptor promoter fragments, and the major binding site is located between nucleotides −249 and −233. Cotransfection assays show that GCF2 acts to repress transcription from the epidermal growth factor receptor promoter in constructs containing the major GCF2 binding site and not when the site had been mutated.

Three repressor proteins, EGFR transcriptional repressor, GC-binding factor (GCF), and the Wilms' tumor supressor, also bind to sites within the EGFR promoter (24Hou X. Johnson A.C. Rosner M.R. J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4662-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).A cDNA for GCF was isolated by screening an A431 expression library with GC-rich sequences from the EGFR promoter. GCF is a 91-kDa protein that binds to three upstream sites of the EGFR promoter. Two are between bp −270 and −225, and the other site is between −150 and −90 relative to the translational start site. Cotransfection experiments have shown that GCF can repress transcription of the EGFR promoter and several other growth-related gene promoters such as transforming growth factor-α and insulin-like growth factor II (27Kitadai Y. Yamazaki H. Yasui W. Kyo E. Yokozaki H. Kajiyama G. Johnson A.C. Pastan I. Tahara E. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 291-296PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA for GCF hybridizes to three mRNA species of 4.5, 3.0, and 1.2 kb (28Johnson A.C. Kageyama R. Popescu N.C. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1689-1694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GCF cDNA contains 2.8 kilobase pairs and is likely to encode the 3.0-kb mRNA. The larger 4.5-kb mRNA may result from homology to another gene or possibly from alternative splicing of the GCF gene. Since the 5′ portion of the GCF cDNA that encodes the DNA binding region hybridizes very strongly to the 4.5-kb mRNA, it is possible that the cDNA for this mRNA also encodes a DNA binding protein. In this report, we present results on isolation of a cDNA that hybridizes to the larger mRNA and has homology to the 5′-end of the GCF cDNA. We also show that the protein encoded by this mRNA binds to the EGFR promoter and represses the activity of the EGFR, SV40, and RSV promoters.DISCUSSIONTranscriptional repression is an important factor in the regulation of many genes. Transcription of specific genes can be modulated downward in various ways. Most of the steps required for activation of transcription can be altered by transcriptional repressors. Repressors fall into two basic categories, passive and active. Passive repressors down-regulate the activity of one or more transcriptional activators by competing for binding sites or by binding the activator. Active repressors have an intrinsic repressing activity and inhibit transcription initiation directly.GCF2 Has Homology to GCFIn this paper, we describe a new repressor that has a DNA binding activity and represses the activity of the EGFR gene. The GCF2 cDNA was isolated and cloned based on homology to GCF. The initial 309 base pairs of the GCF cDNA are homologous to residues 1382–1690 of GCF2. There is a 98% identity, 305 of 309 base pairs, between the GCF and GCF2 cDNAs in this region. The region of homology is restricted to the 5′-end of the GCF cDNA but is internal, nucleotides 1382–1690, to the GCF2 cDNA.GCF2 Migrates with an Altered Mobility during SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel ElectrophoresisThe GCF2 deduced protein sequence contains a DNA binding and nuclear localization motif similar to GCF (Fig. 3). GCF2 expressed from the open reading frame migrates as a 160-kDa protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. However, the calculated molecular mass is 83 kilodaltons. This could be due to the acidic nature of the protein (p = 4.4 and 22% acidic residues) or to an unusual ability to form very stable dimers. ς-70 from E. coli also migrates at a significantly higher molecular mass (90 kDa) on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as compared with the calculated molecular mass of 70 kDa (41Burton Z. Burgess R.R. Lin J. Moore D. Holder S. Gross C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 2889-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Production of protein from deletion mutants in reticulocyte lysates revealed that the altered migration during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is associated with the protein sequence between residues 490 and 530 (data not shown). This region includes the putative DNA-binding region and the nuclear localization signal. It contains a sequence stretch of residues where 11 out of 14 are lysine. Charge interactions between this region and acidic regions may result in a protein conformation that has an aberrant migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gels.GCF2 Binds DNA and Represses TranscriptionGCF2 binds to EGFR promoter fragments with different affinities. The promoter fragments, −384 to −167 and −105 to −16, were labeled to similar specific activities, but GCF2 binding was stronger to the −384 to −167 fragment (Fig. 8). DNase I footprinting detected a single footprint in the −384 to −167 region. We have not been able to localize the GCF2 binding site in the −105 to −16 fragment due to a much lower affinity. The binding site detected by DNase I footprinting resembles binding sites for GCF. This is not unexpected, since there is sequence homology to the DNA binding region of GCF. The GCF2 binding site overlaps binding sites for Sp1 and AP2 (Fig. 8). Also, p53 has been reported to bind the EGFR promoter between −265 and −239 (42Ludes-Meyers J.H. Subler M.A. Shivakumar C.V. Munoz R.M. Jiang P. Bigger J.E. Brown D.R. Deb S.P. Deb S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6009-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, this location is very important in the regulation of EGFR promoter activity by transcriptional activators. Binding of GCF2 may provide a mechanism to turn down promoter activity after activation or to prevent unwanted activation. This could be mediated through direct binding to DNA or through protein-protein interactions with Sp1, AP2, and p53.GCF2 represses activity from three different promoters in cotransfection assays. Two of these promoters, EGFR and SV40, have GC-rich regions. The EGFR promoter has been shown previously to be repressed by GCF, while the SV40 promoter was shown not to be repressed (25Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that although the overall effect of GCF2 on the promoters was about the same, at lower GCF2/reporter ratios the effect was more evident on the SV40 and RSV promoters. This may be due to the greater activity of these promoters, which are 5–10-fold stronger than the EGFR promoter in CV-1 cells. GCF2 may be acting as either an active repressor or a passive repressor. In either case, it appears to be a general repressor, since it is active on both cellular and viral promoters. To determine whether GCF2 is an active or passive repressor requires detailed studies of DNA-protein interactions and protein-protein interactions. Recently, NAB1 was isolated and shown to be a repressor of NGFI-A- and Krox20-mediated transcription (43Russo M.W. Sevetson B.R. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6873-6877Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). NAB1 interacts directly with the activators to prevent transcriptional activation. Nucleolin was recently purified and shown to bind to the B-motif of the α-1 acid glycoprotein and to repress transcription of the α-1 acid glycoprotein promoter in transfection assays (44Yang T.H. Tsai W.H. Lee Y.M. Lei H.Y. Lai M.Y. Chen D.S. Yeh N.H. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6068-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Analysis of GCF2 will aid in increasing understanding of gene regulation and in extending our knowledge of the mechanisms of action of eukaryotic transcriptional repressors.The Relationship of the GCF and GCF2 cDNAsOne unresolved issue is the high degree of homology between the 5′-end of the GCF cDNA and residues 1382–1690 of the GCF2 cDNA. Attempts to isolate GCF cDNA clones from cell lines other than A431 have resulted in isolation of cDNAs that do not contain the GCF 5′-region (data not shown). Furthermore, we have not been able to isolate an identical GCF cDNA from an A431 cDNA library but have isolated additional cDNA clones that contain internal deletions. These cDNAs all contain 5′-ends that begin around nucleotide 320 of the GCF cDNA (data not shown). This indicates that the GCF 5′-region is possibly a cloning artifact or is a mutation found in A431 cells that have a number of chromosomal abnormalities. Also, P1 clones containing GCF genomic DNA sequences do not hybridize with the 5′-end of the GCF cDNA (data not shown). However, the melting temperature of the GCF cDNA around residue 320 is greater than 85 °C. This results in problems in amplifying the cDNA by PCR and may interfere with additional experimentation, including cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase. The origin of the GCF cDNA requires a more detailed analysis of gene structure that includes genomic clones from normal tissues and A431 cells.EGFR levels are decreased by a number of factors including retinoic acid and nerve growth factor. Recently, it has been shown that the decrease of EGFR in PC12 cells is controlled at the transcriptional level (45Shibutani M. Lazarovici P. Johnson A.C. Katagiri Y. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6878-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Also, correlating with the decrease in EGFR transcription is an increase in GCF2. In agreement with these studies is the correlation of a decrease in GCF2 mRNA and an increase in EGFR mRNA by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate reported in this study (Fig. 15). This suggests that GCF2 may have a physiological role in regulating EGFR transcription. Additional studies on GCF2 and EGFR expression will aid in understanding the complex nature of EGFR gene regulation. Regulation of transcription is achieved by gene-specific transcription factors that bind regulatory elements in gene promoters and enhancers and alter the rate of transcription initiation (1Roeder R.G.

Three repressor proteins, EGFR transcriptional repressor, GC-binding factor (GCF), and the Wilms' tumor supressor, also bind to sites within the EGFR promoter (24Hou X. Johnson A.C. Rosner M.R. J.

A cDNA for GCF was isolated by screening an A431 expression library with GC-rich sequences from the EGFR promoter. GCF is a 91-kDa protein that binds to three upstream sites of the EGFR promoter. Two are between bp −270 and −225, and the other site is between −150 and −90 relative to the translational start site. Cotransfection experiments have shown that GCF can repress transcription of the EGFR promoter and several other growth-related gene promoters such as transforming growth factor-α and insulin-like growth factor II (27Kitadai Y. Yamazaki H. Yasui W. Kyo E. Yokozaki H. Kajiyama G. Johnson A.C. Pastan I. Tahara E. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 291-296PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA for GCF hybridizes to three mRNA species of 4.5, 3.0, and 1.2 kb (28Johnson A.C. Kageyama R. Popescu N.C. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1689-1694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GCF cDNA contains 2.8 kilobase pairs and is likely to encode the 3.0-kb mRNA. The larger 4.5-kb mRNA may result from homology to another gene or possibly from alternative splicing of the GCF gene. Since the 5′ portion of the GCF cDNA that encodes the DNA binding region hybridizes very strongly to the 4.5-kb mRNA, it is possible that the cDNA for this mRNA also encodes a DNA binding protein. In this report, we present results on isolation of a cDNA that hybridizes to the larger mRNA and has homology to the 5′-end of the GCF cDNA. We also show that the protein encoded by this mRNA binds to the EGFR promoter and represses the activity of the EGFR, SV40, and RSV promoters. DISCUSSIONTranscriptional repression is an important factor in the regulation of many genes. Transcription of specific genes can be modulated downward in various ways. Most of the steps required for activation of transcription can be altered by transcriptional repressors. Repressors fall into two basic categories, passive and active. Passive repressors down-regulate the activity of one or more transcriptional activators by competing for binding sites or by binding the activator. Active repressors have an intrinsic repressing activity and inhibit transcription initiation directly.GCF2 Has Homology to GCFIn this paper, we describe a new repressor that has a DNA binding activity and represses the activity of the EGFR gene. The GCF2 cDNA was isolated and cloned based on homology to GCF. The initial 309 base pairs of the GCF cDNA are homologous to residues 1382–1690 of GCF2. There is a 98% identity, 305 of 309 base pairs, between the GCF and GCF2 cDNAs in this region. The region of homology is restricted to the 5′-end of the GCF cDNA but is internal, nucleotides 1382–1690, to the GCF2 cDNA.GCF2 Migrates with an Altered Mobility during SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel ElectrophoresisThe GCF2 deduced protein sequence contains a DNA binding and nuclear localization motif similar to GCF (Fig. 3). GCF2 expressed from the open reading frame migrates as a 160-kDa protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. However, the calculated molecular mass is 83 kilodaltons. This could be due to the acidic nature of the protein (p = 4.4 and 22% acidic residues) or to an unusual ability to form very stable dimers. ς-70 from E. coli also migrates at a significantly higher molecular mass (90 kDa) on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as compared with the calculated molecular mass of 70 kDa (41Burton Z. Burgess R.R. Lin J. Moore D. Holder S. Gross C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 2889-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Production of protein from deletion mutants in reticulocyte lysates revealed that the altered migration during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is associated with the protein sequence between residues 490 and 530 (data not shown). This region includes the putative DNA-binding region and the nuclear localization signal. It contains a sequence stretch of residues where 11 out of 14 are lysine. Charge interactions between this region and acidic regions may result in a protein conformation that has an aberrant migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gels.GCF2 Binds DNA and Represses TranscriptionGCF2 binds to EGFR promoter fragments with different affinities. The promoter fragments, −384 to −167 and −105 to −16, were labeled to similar specific activities, but GCF2 binding was stronger to the −384 to −167 fragment (Fig. 8). DNase I footprinting detected a single footprint in the −384 to −167 region. We have not been able to localize the GCF2 binding site in the −105 to −16 fragment due to a much lower affinity. The binding site detected by DNase I footprinting resembles binding sites for GCF. This is not unexpected, since there is sequence homology to the DNA binding region of GCF. The GCF2 binding site overlaps binding sites for Sp1 and AP2 (Fig. 8). Also, p53 has been reported to bind the EGFR promoter between −265 and −239 (42Ludes-Meyers J.H. Subler M.A. Shivakumar C.V. Munoz R.M. Jiang P. Bigger J.E. Brown D.R. Deb S.P. Deb S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6009-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, this location is very important in the regulation of EGFR promoter activity by transcriptional activators. Binding of GCF2 may provide a mechanism to turn down promoter activity after activation or to prevent unwanted activation. This could be mediated through direct binding to DNA or through protein-protein interactions with Sp1, AP2, and p53.GCF2 represses activity from three different promoters in cotransfection assays. Two of these promoters, EGFR and SV40, have GC-rich regions. The EGFR promoter has been shown previously to be repressed by GCF, while the SV40 promoter was shown not to be repressed (25Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that although the overall effect of GCF2 on the promoters was about the same, at lower GCF2/reporter ratios the effect was more evident on the SV40 and RSV promoters. This may be due to the greater activity of these promoters, which are 5–10-fold stronger than the EGFR promoter in CV-1 cells. GCF2 may be acting as either an active repressor or a passive repressor. In either case, it appears to be a general repressor, since it is active on both cellular and viral promoters. To determine whether GCF2 is an active or passive repressor requires detailed studies of DNA"

The γ12subunit is a known substrate for protein kinase C, suggesting phosphorylation as a potential regulatory mechanism. Therefore, recombinant β1γ12 dimers were overexpressed using the baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell system, purified, and phosphorylated stoichiometrically with protein kinase C α. Their ability to support coupling of the Gi1 α subunit to the A1 adenosine receptor and to activate type II adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C-β was examined. Phosphorylation of the β1γ12 dimer increased its potency in the receptor coupling assay from 6.4 to 1 nm, changed theKact for stimulation of type II adenylyl cyclase from 14 to 37 nm, and decreased its maximal efficacy by 50%. In contrast, phosphorylation of the dimer had no effect on its ability to activate phospholipase C-β. The native β1γ10 dimer, which has 4 similar amino acids in the phosphorylation site at the N terminus, was not phosphorylated by protein kinase C α. Creation of a phosphorylation site in the N terminus of the protein (Gly4 → Lys) resulted in a β1γ10G4K dimer which could be phosphorylated. The activities of this βγ dimer were similar to those of the phosphorylated β1γ12 dimer. Thus, phosphorylation of the β1γ12 dimer on the γ subunit with protein kinase C α regulates its activity in an effector-specific fashion. Because the γ12 subunit is widely expressed, phosphorylation may be an important mechanism for integration of the multiple signals generated by receptor activation.

Receptors activate this system by stimulating the release of bound GDP from the G protein α subunit leading to exchange of GDP for GTP in the protein's nucleotide binding site. Binding of GTP induces a conformational change in the α subunit, simultaneously activating the protein and markedly decreasing its affinity for the βγ dimer (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4711) Google Scholar). Both the GTP-bound form of the α subunit and the released βγ subunit are capable of activating multiple effectors to generate intracellular messages (3Neer E.J.

The mechanisms that regulate the lifetime of the active, GTP-bound form of the α subunit have been studied extensively.

Although the activity of the α subunit is regulated by multiple mechanisms, regulation of the activity of the βγ dimer is not well characterized. Recently, the γ12 subunit has been shown to be a substrate for protein kinase C (12Morishita R. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. Mizuno K. Ohno S. Kozawa O. Kato K.

The γ12 subunit is widely expressed (12Morishita R. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. Mizuno K. Ohno S. Kozawa O. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), its phosphorylation may have important consequences. To examine the effects of γ12 subunit phosphorylation on its activity, we purified recombinant β1γ12dimers from baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells, phosphorylated them with PKC α and β1, and tested their activity in three assays of βγ function. We examined the ability of phosphorylated dimers to support coupling of the Gi1 α subunit to the A1 adenosine receptor and to activate two effectors, type II adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C-β. Phosphorylation of the β1γ12 subunit had no effect on its ability to activate PLC-β, but increased its potency in the receptor coupling assay and markedly inhibited its ability to activate adenylyl cyclase. These results suggest that phosphorylation reduces the ability of the βγ signal to increase cyclic AMP levels and favors activation of other effectors. Full-length clones encoding the human γ10and γ12 proteins were identified in the EST data base and obtained from Research Genetics, Inc (γ12, GenBankTMN42722; γ10, GenBankTMU31383). To minimize the length of the construct 5′ from the ATG start codon, the end of the γ12 cDNA was modified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For the γ12 cDNA, the primers used were: (sense primer: 5′-CCCGGGATGTCCAGCAAAACAGCA-3′; antisense primer: 5′-ATAGAGACTGCAGAGTCCAT-3′). The PCR products were subcloned into the pCNTR shuttle vector, the γ12 coding sequence excised from pCNTR with SmaI and XbaI, and ligated into these sites in the baculovirus transfer vector, pVL1393. The native γ10 cDNA was excised from the pT7T3D plasmid with EcoRI, further digested withBanII and Asp700 and subcloned into the pCNTR shuttle vector. The γ10 coding sequence was excised from pCNTR with BamHI and XbaI and ligated into these sites in the pVL1393 transfer vector. The N terminus of the γ10 protein was modified to have a protein kinase C phosphorylation site by mutagenesis of the γ10 cDNA using PCR. The primers used were: (sense primer: 5′-GGATCCATGTCCTCCAAGGCTAGC-3′; antisense primer: 5′-CACTTTGTGCTTGAAGGAATTCC-3′). This modification introduced a Gly4 → Lys mutation (G4K) into the protein. The products of the PCR reaction were subcloned into pCNTR, digested withBamHI and EcoRI, and ligated into these sites in the pVL1393 transfer vector. To add the hexahistidine-FLAG affinity tags to the 5′ end of the β1 subunit, the polymerase chain reaction was used to add XbaI and BamHI restriction sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the β1 coding region, respectively. The primers used were: (sense primer: 5′-TCTAGAATGAGTGAGCTTGACCAGTT-3′; antisense primer: 5′-GGATCCTTAGTTCCAGATCTTGAGGA-3′). The products of the reaction were digested with XbaI and BamHI and ligated into the pDouble Trouble (pDT) vector, which adds the nucleotide sequences for the hexahistidine and FLAG affinity tags to the 5′ end of the β1 coding region (17Robeva A.S. Woodard R. Luthin D.R. Taylor H.E. Linden J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The β1HF coding region was excised from pDT with HindIII andBamHI and subcloned into the pCNTR shuttle vector. The β1HF coding sequence was excised from pCNTR withBamHI and ligated into the BamHI site of pVL1393. The pVL1393 transfer vectors containing these four constructs were sequenced to verify the fidelity of the β and γ sequences. Recombinant baculoviruses were constructed by co-transfecting each transfer vector with linearized BaculoGold® viral DNA into Sf9 cells using the PharMingen BaculoGold® kit as described (18Fletcher J.E.

The recombinant baculoviruses were purified by one round of plaque purification using standard techniques (19Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 1-56Google Scholar). The construction of the recombinant baculoviruses coding for the Gi1 and Gs α subunits and the A1 adenosine receptor have been described (20Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. J. Biol.

Methods Neurosci. 1996; 29: 207-226Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The Gi1 α subunit was purified to homogeneity as described (22Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The recombinant βγ dimers were extracted from Sf9 cells and purified using DEAE chromatography and an α subunit affinity column (23Graber S.G. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Neurosci. 1996; 29: 207-226Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The purified β1HFγ12 subunit was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 40–100 μm ATP, recombinant PKC α or β, 40 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 0.8 μg/ml diolein. Usually, 25 μg of βγ dimer was incubated with 0.74 unit of PKC α to achieve stoichiometric phosphorylation of the γ subunit. Control reactions contained deionized water in the place of PKC. The stoichiometry of the phosphorylation reaction was measured by including 40 μm [32P]ATP (500–2000 cpm/pmol) in the reaction mix and subjecting the phosphorylated βγ subunits to Tricine/SDS-PAGE (24Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). The resolved γ subunit was cut from the dried gel and the amount of radioactive phosphate incorporated estimated by scintillation counting. After the phosphorylation reaction and before use in the assays, the βγ subunit was repurified from the reaction mixture by loading it onto a 0.25 ml Ni2+-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen) and washing with 15 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.6% (w/v) CHAPS, and 5 mm imidazole to remove PKC. The βγ dimer was eluted with 1 ml of the wash buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. To ensure that no PKC activity was carried into the assays with the βγ dimer, its activity was monitored in the elution fractions using the kinase reaction buffer described above with 25 μg/ml histone 3S as substrate (25Roskoski R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). As expected, the kinase activity eluted in the void volume of the column and not with the βγ dimer. Controls were also performed to determine whether the 30 °C incubation with PKC and subsequent re-purification reduced the activity of the βγ dimer in the functional assays. In these experiments, a mock-phosphorylation reaction was performed in the absence of PKC, the βγ dimer re-purified and its activity compared with that of dimers subjected only to the α-agarose column (see “Results”). Sf9 insect cell membranes overexpressing recombinant A1 adenosine receptors were prepared as described (21Figler R.A. Graber S.G. Lindorfer M.A. Yasuda H. Linden J. Garrison J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1587-1595PubMed Google Scholar) and reconstituted with G protein α and βγ subunits on ice for 30 min (26Yasuda H. Lindorfer M.A. Woodfork K.A. Fletcher J.E. Garrison J.C. J.

The high affinity, agonist binding conformation of the receptor was measured using the agonist ligand125I-N 6-(aminobenzyl)adenosine as described (26Yasuda H. Lindorfer M.A. Woodfork K.A.

Each reaction tube contained 20 fmol of receptor, 6 nm Gi1 α subunit, 0–10 nm βγ dimer, 50 nm GDP, and 0.3 nm125I-N 6-(aminobenzyl)adenosine. Because this assay was incubated for 3 h before filtration, 100 nm microcystin was included to inhibit protein phosphatases in the Sf9 cell membrane preparation (27Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Large unilamellar phospholipid vesicles were prepared by extrusion into a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 3 mmEGTA, 80 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with a Avanti Polar Lipids mini-extruder (28Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). The phospholipid vesicles contained a 4:1 molar ratio of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate at final concentrations of 100 and 25 μm, respectively, and about 7000 cpm/assay of [inositol-2-3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Phospholipid vesicles and βγ subunits were mixed on ice in an assay buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.17 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 17 mmNaCl, 67 mm KCl, 0.83 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The final concentration of CHAPS contributed by the βγ preparations in each assay tube was kept below 0.01% (w/v) to eliminate effects of detergent on PLC-β activity (29Morris A.J. Waldo G.L. Downes C.P. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13501-13507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was begun by addition of 10 ng of recombinant, turkey erythrocyte PLC-β and 3 μm free Ca2+ to each assay tube. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by the addition of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Assay tubes were centrifuged at 4,000 ×g and the [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate released measured by liquid scintillation counting (30Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol.

The Gs α subunit was extracted from an Sf9 cell preparation with 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS as described (18Fletcher J.E. Lindorfer M.A. DeFilippo J.M. Yasuda H. Guilmard M. Garrison J.C. J. Biol.

Cyclase containing membranes (5 μg of protein/assay tube) were reconstituted with GTPγS-activated Gs α subunit (32Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and varying concentrations of βγ dimer on ice for 30 min. The reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.4 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 10 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm ATP, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) was preincubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Production of cyclic AMP was initiated by addition of the reconstituted membranes to the reaction buffer and the incubation continued for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.1n HCl and cyclic AMP measured using an automated radioimmunoassay (33Brooker G. Terasaki W.L. Price M.G. Science. 1976; 194: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gels were run according to the procedure of Schagger and von Jagow (24Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). The separating gel contained 16.5% total acrylamide, 0.4% bisacrylamide, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The stacking gel contained 4% total acrylamide and 0.1% bisacrylamide. Gels were run at constant voltage (∼100 volts) at 10 °C for 4–5 h. Resolved proteins were stained with silver by the method of Morrissey (34Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2939) Google Scholar), with the modification that the dithiothreitol incubation was reduced to 15 min. Experiments presented under “Results” are representative of three or more similar experiments. Data expressed as dose-response curves were fit to rectangular hyperbolas using the fitting routines in the GraphPad Prizm® software. Statistical differences between the curves were determined using all the individual data points from multiple experiments to calculate the F statistic as described (35Motulsky H.J. Ransnas L.A. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). All reagents used in the culture of Sf9 cells and for the expression and purification of G protein α and βγ subunits have been described in detail (20Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. J. Biol.

The baculovirus transfer vector, pVL1393, was purchased from Invitrogen; the BaculoGold® kit from PharMingen; 10% GENAPOL® C-100, CHAPS, microcystin, and the α and β1 isoforms of PKC from Calbiochem; Ni2+-NTA-agarose from Qiagen; [3H]phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate from NEN Life Science Products; PMA from Sigma; the pCNTR shuttle vector from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc. (Boulder, CO). All other reagents were of the highest purity available. Recent experiments have demonstrated that the bovine γ12 subunit is a substrate for protein kinase C (12Morishita R. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. Mizuno K. Ohno S. Kozawa O. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol.

As this newly discovered γ12 subunit is widely expressed (12Morishita R. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. Mizuno K. Ohno S. Kozawa O. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its phosphorylation may have important consequences. To examine the effects of γ12 subunit phosphorylation on its activity, we purified recombinant β1γ12 dimers from Sf9 insect cells, phosphorylated them with PKC α and β, and tested their activity in assays of βγ function. The human γ12 subunit was rapidly phosphorylated by PKC α to a stoichiometry of about 1 mol/mol as shown in Fig.1, A and B. Protein kinase C β1 was less effective than PKC α; the stoichiometry only reached 0.5 mol/mol after 60 min of incubation. Addition of a hexahistidine-FLAG affinity tag to the β1subunit (β1HF) facilitated removal of PKC from the reaction mixture prior to assessing βγ function. Thus, the phosphorylated β1HFγ12 dimer in the reaction mix can be applied to a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column and pure βγ dimer eluted with imidazole. The left sideof Fig. 1 C shows that stained PKC protein was removed by this procedure and assay of kinase activity in the column elution fractions determined that the βγ dimer was free of residual kinase activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). The right sideof the figure shows that only the γ12 subunit in the dimer is phosphorylated. Addition of the hexahistidine-FLAG affinity tag to the N terminus of the β1 subunit did not affect the association of the β and γ subunits or purification of the dimer on an α-subunit affinity column (data not shown). Ser1 in the N terminus of the bovine γ12subunit is the site phosphorylated by protein kinase C (12Morishita R. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. Mizuno K. Ohno S. Kozawa O. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29469-29475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Asano T. Morishita R. Ueda H. Asano M. Kato K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, the consensus phosphorylation sequence S*XK is the motif in the γ12 subunit recognized by the kinase (36Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the other known γ subunits have this motif, but the γ10subunit has a similar pair of serine residues at its N terminus (37Ray K. Kunsch C. Bonner L.M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21765-21771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the effect of phosphorylation on the activity of γ subunits, we mutated residue 4 in the γ10 subunit from glycine to lysine (Gly4 → Lys) to introduce the SSK motif (Fig. 2 A). The ability of the wild type and the mutated γ10 subunit to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C α was examined. As expected, the wild type β1HFγ10 dimer was not phosphorylated, but the dimer containing the γ10G4Ksubunit was rapidly phosphorylated by PKC β (autoradiograph in Fig.2 B) with a time course similar to that seen with γ12 (data not shown). The silver-stained gel in Fig.2 C compares the mobilities of the wild type and mutated γ10G4K subunits with those of the γ1 and γ12 subunits. Clearly, the SSK motif created in the γ10G4K subunit can be phosphorylated effectively. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation for the γ10G4K protein was about 0.5 mol/mol using PKC α and about 0.25 mol/mol using PKC β1 (data not shown). Thus, the differences in phosphorylation rates observed using γ12 as a substrate were also seen using the γ10G4K subunit. Having established the ability of protein kinase C to phosphorylate the two recombinant γ subunits, we examined the effects of phosphorylation on the function of the dimer. The βγ subunits play several important roles in the signaling mechanisms used by receptors to activate effectors. In combination with the α subunit, they participate in forming the high affinity agonist binding conformation of the receptor (21Figler R.A. Graber S.G. Lindorfer M.A. Yasuda H. Linden J. Garrison J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1587-1595PubMed Google Scholar, 38Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10495-10502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Florio V.A. Sternweis P.C. J.

The mutations were identified making use of three mutant forms of Ras that have reduced Raf-1 binding (Winkler, D. G., Johnson, J. C., Cooper, J. A., and Vojtek, A. B. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 24402–24409). One mutation in Raf-1, N64L, suppresses the Ras mutant R41Q but not other Ras mutants, suggesting that this mutation structurally complements the Ras R41Q mutation. Missense substitutions of residues 143 and 144 in the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain were isolated multiple times. These Raf-1 mutants, R143Q, R143W, and K144E, were general suppressors of three different Ras mutants and had increased interaction with non-mutant Ras. Each was slightly activated relative to wild-type Raf-1 in a transformation assay. In addition, two mutants, R143W and K144E, were active when tested for induction of germinal vesicle breakdown in Xenopus oocytes. Interestingly, all three cysteine-rich domain mutations reduced the ability of the Raf-1 N-terminal regulatory region to inhibit Xenopus oocyte germinal vesicle breakdown induced by the C-terminal catalytic region of Raf-1. We propose that a direct or indirect regulatory interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions of Raf-1 is reduced by the R143W, R143Q, and K144E mutations, thereby increasing access to the Ras-binding regions of Raf-1 and increasing Raf-1 activity.

The importance of the Raf protein kinases for cell growth and differentiation has been demonstrated in animals, tissue culture cells,Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans.

The phosphorylated serines at Ser-259 and Ser-621 represent regulated 14-3-3- binding sites (38Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 14-3-3 also binds to the cysteine-rich domain in Raf-1 by a different mechanism, and availability of this 14-3-3- binding site may be activation state-dependent (29Clark G.J. Drugan J.K. Rossman K.L. Carpenter J.W. Rogers-Graham K. Fu H. Der C.J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20990-20993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The regulated nature of these three 14-3-3- binding sites presents the possibility that 14-3-3 can bind to alternative sites during Raf-1 activation (40Rommel C. Radziwill G. Lovric J. Noeldeke J. Heinicke T. Jones D. Aitken A. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 609-619PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to identify specificity mutants of Ras that bind other effector proteins but not Raf-1 (1Winkler D.G. Johnson J.C. Cooper J.A. Vojtek A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24402-24409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (see Table I for the mutations in these mutants). In the present study, we produced a collection of random mutations in Raf-1 and used the two-hybrid system to select mutations that restored Raf-1 binding to these Ras mutants. In one case we found a single mutation in the RBD (N64L) that directly interacts with the residue that was mutated in the Ras mutant it complements, suggesting structural complementarity. In all other cases the mutated residue was either Arg-143 or Lys-144 in the CRD. These mutants have generally increased interaction with mutant and non-mutant Ras and are somewhat activatedin vivo. These mutations also decrease the ability of the isolated N-terminal regulatory region to inhibit the isolated C-terminal kinase domain. We propose that these mutations decrease an inhibitory interaction between the N-terminal regulatory region and the C-terminal kinase domain and expose the Raf-1 N terminus for Ras binding.Table IEffects of mutagenesis on Ras/Raf-1 interactionRas mutant designationG12VaMutation present is G12V.J10bMutations present are G12V and E31K.J25cMutations present are G12V, Q43E, D54N, and E63K.J31dMutations present are G12V, R41Q, and Y157N.no. interacting clones/104 transformantsRaf-1 WT1040.480.080.60Raf M1 library1040.652.62.3Raf M2 library10414318.0Strain L40 yeast cells were transformed with either wild-type (G12V) Ras or Ras specificity mutants, together with either wild-type Raf-1, the M1 library, or the M2 library.

The two-hybrid screens in this study used the L40 reporter strain with the dual reportersHIS3 and lacZ. The strength of interactions between LexA fusions of Ras mutants expressed from pBTM116 and VP16 fusions of Raf-1 mutants in pVP16 was measured by examining the extent of color change in filter assays for β-galactosidase, using 0.75 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4). Filters were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h to overnight (41Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Activation of the HIS3 reporter was indicated by plating cells on minimal media lacking histidine and containing increasing concentrations of 3-aminotriazole, an inhibitor of the HIS3gene product (41Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Comparisons between transformants were made by plating serial dilutions of cells in drops onto plates in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of 3-aminotriazole. The plating efficiency was calculated, and the HIS3 reporter level was determined to closely relate to the relative activity of thelacZ reporter assayed in parallel. The Raf M1 library was generated by regionalized codon mutagenesis of residues 58–70 in Raf-1 (42Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Science. 1993; 262: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Raf M2 library was generated by random PCR mutagenesis in the presence of MnCl2 as described elsewhere (1Winkler D.G. Johnson J.C. Cooper J.A. Vojtek A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24402-24409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The region from residues 1 to 149 (prior to the HindIII site at codon 150) was then subcloned into a wild-type backbone in pVP16. Both of these libraries were transfected into the L40 yeast reporter strain along with V12G Ras and the J10, J25, and J31 Ras mutants in pBTM116 (see Table I for mutations present in the Ras mutants used). The transformants were plated onto selective media in the absence of histidine to select for Raf-1 mutants that had increased binding to the J10, J25, and J31 Ras mutants. Increased binding was confirmed by β-galactosidase assays. Plasmids were recovered from the positive clones, and the clones were retested for binding to the Ras mutants and for binding to MKK1a. False positives that did not retest and mutants that had lost the ability to bind to MKK1a were discarded. Mutations were sequenced on both strands using dye terminator sequencing. Each VP16 Raf-1 mutant was then transfected with each LexA Ras mutant into L40, and the level of binding in the two-hybrid system was assessed as described above (41Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The Raf-CRD (Raf-1 residues 136–187) and the Ras variants used in the study were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and purified. The Ras mutants were eluted from the glutathione (GSH) beads and bound to GMP-PNP. The Raf-CRD was cleaved from the GSH beads using thrombin (26Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C.

The RBD (residues 51–131) was produced as a maltose-binding protein fusion in Escherichia coli and affinity purified on amylose agarose and eluted in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm maltose. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were employed to assess the interactions between the Ras mutants and the isolated Raf-1 CRD and RBD.

The DNA encoding the Raf-1 mutants were moved into pBTM116 and transfected into L40 along with pVP16 14-3-3ζ. The two-hybrid interaction between 14-3-3ζ and the Raf-1 mutants was assessed as described above (41Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The DNA encoding 14-3-3ζ was subcloned into pGEX3x for bacterial expression. GST and a GST 14-3-3ζ fusion protein were expressed inE. coli and affinity purified using GSH-Sepharose. Raf-1 mutants were subcloned into pCS3MT (43Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) and expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysates according to the supplier's instructions (Promega), in the presence of [35S]methionine. The reticulocyte lysates were diluted 1:10 in binding buffer (20 mm Tris 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 100 mm NaCl, 14 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), and 5% of the reaction was run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The expression levels of the Raf-1 proteins were estimated by PhosphorImager analysis. Raf-1 proteins were incubated with 1 μg of GST or GST 14-3-3ζ on GSH beads in 1 ml of binding buffer for 2 h at 4 °C with end over end shaking. The beads were precipitated by centrifugation and washed 4 times with 1 ml of binding buffer. After the final wash, the beads were incubated with SDS-PAGE Loading buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis and PhosphorImager analysis. Similar results were obtained four times.

Mutant Reg Raf constructs were generated by PCR amplification of Raf-1 residues 1–330 using mutant Raf-1 DNA as template. PCR products were cloned into the pA vector immediately downstream of the FLAG epitope tag. Mutations were also made in full-length Raf-1 in the pA vector by site-directed mutagenesis (Quickchange, Stratagene). Oocytes were isolated and defolliculated as described previously. 8–12 h after isolation, oocytes were injected with approximately 30 ng ofin vitro transcribed RNA encoding the full-length Raf-1 proteins or Reg Raf proteins. Oocytes expressing the Reg Raf proteins were then injected 4–8 h later with RNA encoding Cat Raf (15Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell.

We have recently used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify mutants of activated (G12V) Ras bind reduced levels of full-length Raf-1 (see Fig.1 for a schematic of Raf-1) but bind normal levels of two other Ras effector domain-binding proteins (1Winkler D.G.

Curiously, these specificity mutants still bind to the Raf-1 RBD in yeast (Ref. 1Winkler D.G. Johnson J.C. Cooper J.A. Vojtek A.B. J. Biol.

To test whether the Ras specificity mutants bind the RBD in vitro, an ELISA-based assay was used (Fig. 2). The RBD bound to the J10, J25, and J31 specificity mutants, although binding was reduced compared with wild-type (G12V) Ras. The CRD bound to wild type and mutants equally. These results suggest that the Ras specificity mutations reduce, but do not prevent, binding to the isolated RBD and have no effect on binding to the isolated CRD. Binding to full-length Raf-1 is strongly inhibited (1Winkler D.G. Johnson J.C. Cooper J.A. Vojtek A.B. J. Biol.

In intact E2M11 HEK293 cells that express high levels of murine G11α and the rat thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor, the immunofluorescence signal of G11α was restricted almost exclusively to the plasma membrane. Exposure to TRH (10 μm) resulted first in partial relocation of G11α to discrete, segregated patches within the plasma membrane (10–60 min). Further exposure to TRH caused internalization of G11α to discrete, punctate, intracellular bodies (2–4 h) and subsequently to a virtually complete loss of G11α from plasma membranes and the cells (8–16 h). Short-term treatment with TRH followed by wash-out of the ligand allowed G11α immunofluorescence to be restored to the plasma membrane within 12 h. In subcellular membrane fractions, G11α was centered on plasma membranes, and this was not altered by up to 1–2 h of incubation with TRH. Further exposure to TRH (2–4 h) resulted in transfer of a significant portion of G11α to light-vesicular and cytosol fractions. At longer time intervals (4–16 h), an overall decrease in G11α content was observed.

We have recently produced a clonal cell line derived from human embryonic kidney, HEK, 293 cells, in which both the long isoform of the rat thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor and murine G11α are expressed to high levels (24Svoboda P. Kim G.D. Grassie M.A. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar). The principal mechanism of action of TRH receptors is via activation of phosphoinositidase C in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner, a process which proceeds via interaction of the receptor with G proteins of the Gq/G11 family (23Kim G.D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this cell line and fractionation of cell homogenate on sucrose density gradient, we were able to demonstrate that long-term agonist treatment results in subcellular redistribution and down-regulation of this G protein (24Svoboda P. Kim G.D. Grassie M.A. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar). Herein we demonstrate the active internalization and trafficking of a phosphoinositidase C-linked G protein in response to agonist activation and that this proceeds on a much slower time scale than internalization of the TRH receptor. [3H]TRH (74 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products (NET-577). Goat anti-rabbit IgG FITC conjugate (T-6005), goat anti-mouse IgG TRITC conjugate (T-5393) and phenylarsine oxide were from Sigma, sucrose (Aristar grade) was obtained from BDH. HEK-293 cells were obtained from the American Tissue Type Collection. Clone E2M11 of HEK 293 cells that stably express high levels of the rat TRH receptor and murine G11α was prepared as described before (24Svoboda P. Kim G.D. Grassie M.A. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a full-length rat (long isoform) TRH receptor cDNA (2.2 kilobases) (27Sellar R.E. Taylor P.L. Lamb R.F. Zabavnik J. Anderson L. Eidne K.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 10: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA1 (Invitrogen) which is driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with linearized pcDNA1/TRH receptor and pSP neo (Invitrogen) using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Strathclyde, UK). Resultant Geneticin-resistant clones were picked, and TRH receptor-containing clones were identified as those in which TRH produced a rise in total inositol phosphate production. Expression of the TRH receptor in membranes from these clones was assessed by the specific binding of [3H]TRH. Clone E2, which expresses some 14 pmol of the receptor/mg of membrane protein (23Kim G.D. Carr I.C. Anderson L.A. Zabavnik J. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19933-19940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was selected for further transfection with plasmid pCMV, into which a cDNA encoding murine G11α was inserted, and with the plasmid pBABE hygro, which allows expression of resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin B. Clones were selected on the basis of resistance to hygromycin B, and the continued expression of the TRH receptor and novel expression of murine G11α were examined (24Svoboda P. Kim G.D. Grassie M.A. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar). Clone E2M11 cells were grown in tissue culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% (v/v) newborn calf serum and were maintained in the presence of Geneticin sulfate (800 μg/ml) and hygromycin B (200 μg/ml). Prior to confluency, they were split 1:5 into fresh tissue culture flasks or were harvested. Antisera 452 and CQ are rabbit polyclonal antipeptide antisera that were raised in rabbits obtained from VELAZ, Prague (452) and New Zealand White rabbits (CQ). Rabbits were immunized with a synthetic peptide QLNLKEYNLV (C-terminal decapeptide conserved between Gqα and G11α) (28Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) conjugated by the glutaraldehyde method to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem) as described before (29Mitchell F.M. Mullaney I. Godfrey P.P. Arkinstall S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Milligan G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). E2M11 cells were grown on ethanol-sterilized glass coverslips. Before confluency, they were pre-treated in the absence or presence of 10 μm TRH for various times. The cells were washed three times with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2) (pH 7.5) at 37 °C and fixed with methanol for 5 min at −20 °C and with acetone for 1 min at −20 °C. Cell membranes were permeabilized with 0.15% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature (Rt) and washed three times with PBS at Rt for 5 min. G11α and Gqα are expressed to very similar levels by HEK 293 cells (23Kim G.D. Carr I.C. Anderson L.A. Zabavnik J. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19933-19940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and these are both activated by the TRH receptor in E2M11 cells (23Kim G.D. Carr I.C. Anderson L.A. Zabavnik J. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19933-19940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Svoboda P. Kim G.D. Grassie M.A. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar). The level of overexpression of G11α in E2M11 cells (24Svoboda P. Kim G.D. Grassie M.A. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar) means that although the antiserum used should identify Gqα and G11α equally, at least 90% of the immunological signal is derived from the stably introduced murine G11α. The G11α was labeled with antiserum 452 (details above) for 1 h at 37 °C with a 1:500 dilution of the antiserum in PBS with 0.2% (w/v) BSA. In the cases in which double labeling procedures were employed, vimentin and β-tubulin were detected by mixing primary mouse monoclonal antibodies (1:500 dilution) directed against these proteins with the anti-G11α/Gqα antiserum. After primary labeling, coverslips were washed three times with PBS atRt for 5 min and then incubated with secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG whole molecule conjugated to FITC and goat anti-mouse IgG whole molecule conjugated to TRITC) diluted 1:100 in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, the coverslips were washed three times with PBS at Rt for 5 min, covered with 40% (v/v) glycerol in PBS, and laid on slides. Detection was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal laser scanning microscope. FITC (green color fluorescence) and TRITC (red color fluorescence) were exited at 468 and 567 nm, respectively. E2M11 HEK-293 cells (3 × 75 cm2 flasks per sample) were harvested by low speed centrifugation, washed twice in 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA, and homogenized in 2.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA using a Potter-Elvehjem (Teflon-glass homogenizer). Two ml of homogenate (after freezing at −80 °C for at least 1 h) was layered on the top of a discontinuous sucrose density gradient consisting of (from top to bottom) 19, 23, 27, 31, 35 (all 5 ml), and 43% (10 ml) (all w/w) sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 3 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA. The gradient was centrifuged for 30 min at 27,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 28 rotor and fractionated manually from the meniscus (fractions 1–7, 5 ml each). The first 5 ml (fraction 1) represented an interphase between the overlaid homogenate and 19% (w/w) sucrose. To separate the low density membranes (light-vesicles) from cytosol, fraction 1 was diluted 1:1 with redistilled water, centrifuged for 120 min at 50,000 rpm in Beckman Ti-50 rotor, and the resulting pellet (fraction 1P) was suspended by rehomogenization in 0.3 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA (TME buffer). The supernatant (fraction 1S) represented the cytosol fraction. The gradient fractions were frozen at −80 °C until use (see Ref. 24Svoboda P. Kim G.D. Grassie M.A. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar for further details). Sucrose density gradient fractions were precipitated with TCA (6% w/v, 1 h on ice), and the precipitate was solubilized in Laemmli buffer. Standard (10% w/v acrylamide, 0.26% w/v bisacrylamide) or urea (12.5% w/v acrylamide, 0.0625% w/v bisacrylamide containing 6 m urea) SDS-PAGE was carried out overnight at 60 V (standard gel) or 100 V (urea gel) as described before (24Svoboda P. Kim G.D. Grassie M.A. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular mass determinations were based on prestained molecular mass markers (Sigma, SDS 7B). After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked for 1 h in 4% (w/v) BSA in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). The 452 antiserum was added in 1% (w/v) BSA in TBS containing (0.2% w/v) Tween 20 and incubated for at least 2 h. The primary antibody was then removed and the blot washed extensively in TBS with 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20. Secondary antiserum (goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase) was applied for 1 h, and after three 10-min washes, the blots were developed in TNM buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 100 mmNaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (100 μg/ml) and nitro blue tetrazolium (200 μg/ml). The developed blots were scanned with a Bio-Rad GS 670 imaging densitometer to enable quantification of the immunoblots. [3H]TRH binding and internalization was measured according to Hinkle and Kinsella (30Hinkle P.M. Kinsella P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5462-5470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E2M11 cells were incubated with 10 nm[3H]TRH in serum-free DMEM medium for 0–120 min at 37 °C, the binding medium was then aspirated, and the cells washed three times with ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl to remove unbound [3H]TRH. Total binding was measured after solubilizing the cells with 1% SDS and 1% Triton X-100. When the internalized (acid-resistant) pool of TRH receptors was to be determined, the cells were incubated for 1 min with ice-cold 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2m acetic acid, pH 2.5 (acid/salt solution), and washed once with 0.15 m NaCl. The radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation. Nonspecific binding was assessed in parallel dishes which contained a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled TRH and represented less than 5% of total binding. This was done according to Petrou et al. (31Petrou C. Chen L. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2326-2333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After preincubation with 10 μm TRH for 1–120 min at 37 °C, E2M11 cells were rinsed once with 0.15 m NaCl, incubated for 1 min with acid/salt solution, washed twice with 0.15m NaCl (everything on ice), and incubated further with 10 nm [3H]TRH for 90 min at 0 °C. The cells were subsequently washed three times with ice-cold 0.15 mNaCl, solubilized with 1% SDS and 1% Triton X-100, and counted for bound radioactivity. E2M11 cells were split into 24-well plates. The next day they were labeled with [3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml) in inositol-free DMEM supplemented with 2% (v/v) dialyzed new born calf serum and 1% (w/v) glutamate for 24 h. On the day of experiment, cells were washed two times with Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer (KRH/LiCl: 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm LiCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mmCaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, 1.2 mmNa2HPO4, 10 mm glucose, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4), incubated for 10 min with KRH/LiCl, and stimulation was performed with 10 μm TRH in the same buffer for 10 min. All manipulations were done at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by aspiration of KRH/LiCl buffer with TRH, and cells were lysed by 0.75 ml of 20 mm formic acid on ice (30 min). Supernatant fractions were loaded on Dowex (Sigma, Dowex 1 × 8–200) columns, followed by immediate addition of 3 ml of 50 mm NH4OH ([3H]inositol fraction). The columns were then washed with 4 ml of 40 mm ammonium formate, followed by 5 ml of 2m ammonium formate ([3H]inositol phosphate (IP) fraction). Data were presented as the quotient of [3H]IP divided by [3H]inositol plus [3H]IP. E2M11 cells grown on glass coverslips were prepared for immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and G11α was detected using antiserum 452 which identifies the extreme C-terminal decapeptide of this G protein. The immunofluorescence signal was essentially entirely restricted to the plasma membranes of E2M11 cells, forming a sharp homogeneous barrier (Fig. 1 a). Dual labeling with an antibody directed against β-tubulin indicated this cytoskeletal protein to be distributed within the cytoplasm and that the cells had large distinct nuclei (Fig. 1 a). Addition and maintenance of TRH (10 μm, 16 h) prior to preparation of the cells for the immunofluorescence studies resulted in a vastly different cellular distribution of the G protein (Fig.1 b). Very little of the G11α protein could be detected then at the plasma membrane, whereas the vast majority of the immunodetectable G11α had a punctate, intracellular location. By contrast, the cytoplasmic distribution pattern of β-tubulin was unchanged (Fig. 1 b). E2M11 cells grown on glass coverslips were incubated with TRH (10 μm) for increasing time intervals (10, 30, and 60 min, 2, 4, and 16 h), and samples were prepared for immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy (Fig.2). Within 10–60 min of addition of TRH (10 μm), the G11α immunofluorescence signal (green) was restricted exclusively to plasma membranes; however, a fraction of the G11α immunofluorescence appeared to cluster to discrete segregated patches of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, b-d) compared with the largely homogeneous plasma membrane distribution prior to addition of TRH (Fig.2 a). Further maintenance of TRH (2 h) resulted in a distinct loss of plasma membrane-associated G11α with the marked appearance of distinct, punctate patterns of staining with intracellular location (Fig. 2 e). Subsequently (4 h), plasma membrane-localized G11α immunofluorescence all but disappeared (Fig. 2 f) and was largely confined to the areas of punctate, intracellular staining, and eventually (16 h) much of the total cellular G11α immunofluorescence was depleted (Fig.2 g), consistent with the major immunodepletion previously recorded in immunoblotting studies (24Svoboda P. Kim G.D. Grassie M.A. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar). To examine potential dynamic changes in the cellular cytoskeleton, parallel immunostaining was performed to detect the intermediate filament protein vimentin (red). In untreated cells, vimentin was distributed throughout the cytoplasmic space (Fig.2 a). However, a dramatic redistribution of vimentin was observed upon short-term (30–60 min) exposure to TRH. This change is demonstrated in Fig. 3 (black and white version of pictures taken from the same experiment), where the FITC-related fluorescence of G11α was excluded and TRITC-labeled vimentin could be therefore analyzed with much higher resolution than on colored pictures. The native vimentin structure was changed from an extended fibrillar organization (Fig. 3 a) into bundle-like coils which were closely allied to the nucleus (Fig.3, b and c). In cells that had been treated for extended periods (4 h) with TRH, this process was partially reversed (Fig. 3 d), and following 16 h of exposure to TRH, the pattern of vimentin immunostaining had returned to the initial state (Fig. 3 e). This cytoskeletal reorganization was associated with a change of overall cell shape. The relaxed state with extended processes observed in control cells was changed to a rounded state that appeared shortly (0.5–1 h) after agonist addition. E2M11 cells were untreated or treated with TRH (10 μm) for the same time intervals (10, 30, and 60 min and 2, 4, and 16 h) as described above for immunofluorescence analysis. The control and TRH-treated cells were collected by low speed centrifugation and then homogenized, and subcellular fractionation on sucrose density gradients was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in Ref.24Svoboda P. Kim G.D. Grassie M.A. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar. The cytosol (1S), light vesicular (1P and 2), plasma membrane (3 and 4), mitochondrial (5 and 6), and nuclear (8Holtmann M.H. Roettger B.F. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23566-23571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) fractions were precipitated by 6% TCA and resolved by 12.5% (w/v) acrylamide SDS-PAGE containing 6 m urea, and G11α was detected by immunoblotting with 452 antiserum. The immunoblots were quantified by densitometric scanning. The distribution of G11α along the gradient fractions was not significantly altered by up to 1 h of incubation with TRH (Fig. 4). At longer time intervals (2–4 h), a significant portion of the plasma membrane-located G11α (fractions 3 and 4) was transferred to the low density end of the gradient, i.e. to the light vesicular fractions 1P and 2. The amount of G11α proteins recovered in cytosol (fraction 1S) was increased in parallel. The decrease of the total immunoblot signal of G11α in E2M11 cells (down-regulation), which was calculated as a sum of the G11α content in all gradient fractions, after 16 h of incubation with TRH was some 50% as compared with controls (data not shown, but see Ref. 24Svoboda P. Kim G.D. Grassie M.A. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the results obtained by fractionation of E2M11 cell homogenate on sucrose density gradients supported strongly the data obtained by studies of intact cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy, i.e. the TRH-induced subcellular redistribution of G11α proceeded as a long-term process that was not detectable earlier than 1 h after agonist exposure. To compare the time course of G11α and TRH receptor internalization, the kinetics of [3H]TRH binding were measured in acid-washed E2M11 cells according to both Hinkle and Kinsella (30Hinkle P.M. Kinsella P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5462-5470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Petrou et al. (31Petrou C. Chen L. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2326-2333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). According to protocol I, [3H]TRH binding was measured by direct radioligand binding assays performed with untreated E2M11 cells (Fig.5 a); in protocol II, E2M11 cells were preincubated with unlabeled TRH to saturate the internal pool of TRH receptors before initiation of the internalization process. The remaining surface (membrane)-associated receptors were then determined by the [3H]TRH binding reaction (Fig.5 b). Both approaches produced virtually the same results. In untreated cells (protocol I), about 73% of receptors were transferred to the acid-resistant (internalized) pool within 60 min of agonist exposure (half-time ∼ 29 min). The cells pre-treated with unlabeled TRH exhibited very similar results—after 1 h of TRH exposure, about 70% of binding sites were lost from the surface (half-time ∼ 25 min). After prolonged exposure (up to 16 h) of E2M11 cells to the hormone, surface membrane-associated receptors were almost completely depleted. Incubation of E2M11 cells with 10 μm TRH for 0.5 h followed by wash-out of TRH and further incubation for 3 h without TRH resulted in recovery of 84% of receptors back to the surface (data not shown). The agonist concentrations used in these (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) as well as previous experiments to demonstrate down-regulation and/or redistribution of G proteins (for review, see Ref. 32Milligan G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 413-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), undoubtedly represents a supramaximal dose when compared with physiological hormone concentrations. Therefore, E2M11 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of TRH (0.1 nm–10 μm, 16 h), and the membrane-cytosol balance of G11α was measured after centrifugation of the cell homogenate for 1 h at 250,000 × g (Fig.6). The first decrease in membrane-bound G11α was observed with 1 nm TRH, with half-maximal response at 5 and 3 nm TRH for membrane (decrease in content) and cytosolic (increase in content) G11α, respectively. Distribution of G11α was not substantially altered by further increase of TRH concentration from 0.1 to 10 μm (Fig. 6). In preliminary experiments to determine the minimum time of TRH exposure sufficient to induce marked internalization of G11α, E2M11 cells were treated with TRH (10 μm) for 5, 10, 20, and 30 min, washed three times with DMEM to remove the agonist and further incubated for 3 h without TRH. The combination of 0.5 h TRH(+) and 3 h TRH(–) incubation periods was found to be sufficient to induce marked internalization of G11α (Fig.7 b) when compared with control signal (Fig. 7 a). Prolongation of the incubation period without TRH (after constant 0.5 h TRH exposure) to 5 h (Fig.7 c), 8 h (Fig. 7 d), and 12 h (Fig.7 e) was associated with a step-wise increase of G11α immunofluorescence such that after 12 h, the plasma membrane was again richly endowed with a uniform population of G11α. Further prolongation of recovery period up to 16 h did not further increase the plasma membrane-associated fluorescence signal of G11α (Fig. 7 f). Recovery of G11α immunofluorescence signal obtained after 0.5 h TRH(+) and 8 h TRH(–) incubation periods was significantly blocked by 100 μm cycloheximide (Fig.7 g). Therefore, recovery of plasma membrane G11α seems to require de novo protein synthesis. The cytoskeletal inhibitors nocodazole (microtubules), cytochalasin B (microfilaments), and colcemide (microtubules and intermediate filaments) exhibited clear inhibitory effects on internalization of G11α in response to TRH (data not shown).

To study the primase activity of the complex, we expressed cDNAs encoding for the human p58 and p48 subunits either as single proteins or together using Escherichia coliexpression vectors. Co-expression of both primase subunits allowed the purification of a heterodimer in high yields that revealed stable primase activity. Purified recombinant p48 subunit showed enzyme activity, whereas purified p58 did not. In contrast to the heterodimer, the primase activity of p48 was unstable. The activity of p48 could be stabilized by the addition of the divalent cations Mg2+ and Mn2+ but not Zn2+. On a poly(dC) template the primase activity was hardly influenced by the monovalent cation potassium. However, by using poly(dT) as a template the recombinant p48 activity was sensitive to salt, whereas recombinant p58-p48 and the bovine DNA polymerase α-primase purified from thymus were less sensitive to the addition of monovalent cations.

Since no known DNA polymerase is able to initiate DNA synthesis de novo, primase synthesizes oligoribonucleotides, called RNA primers, during initiation of genomic DNA replication in eukaryotes (2Kornberg A.

After the finding that eukaryotic primase forms an enzyme complex together with DNA polymerase α (8Conaway R.C. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2523-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), interest arose to determine the subunits of the complex that carry the catalytic center of the primase. Each of the four subunits of DNA polymerase α-primase (pol-prim) 1The abbreviations used are: pol-primDNA polymerase α-primaseBSAbovine serum albuminssDNAsingle-stranded DNA.1The abbreviations used are: pol-primDNA polymerase α-primaseBSAbovine serum albuminssDNAsingle-stranded DNA. was proposed to contain primase activity by biochemical and immunological methods (9Biswas E.E.

When the mouse primase was purified to near-homogeneity, it was found to contain two proteins of 55 and 49 kDa, which were comparable to the molecular masses of the two small subunits ofDrosophila pol-prim that showed primase activity after separation from the complex (17Kaguni L.S.

Chem. 1983; 258: 9845-9849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, it was proposed that the 48-kDa subunit of the bovine pol-prim is sufficient for primase activity (14Nasheuer H.-P. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8981-8988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soon this result was questioned, since cross-linking studies with photoreactive ribonucleotides suggested that the 58–60-kDa subunit of pol-prim might also be involved in the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides (19Foiani M. Lindner A.J. Hartmann G.R. Lucchini G. Plevani P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2189-2194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hartmann G.R. Biebricher C., S. Glaser S.J. Grosse F.

The characterization of a 48-kDa protein from bakers' yeast that had primase activity and that was immunologically related to the 48-kDa subunit of pol-prim seemed to provide a satisfactory solution to the issue (21Santocanale C. Foiani M. Lucchini G. Plevani P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1343-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the discussion concerning the function of the primase subunits was revitalized when the cloning and subsequent expression of pol-prim subunits from different organisms led to a controversy whether p48 alone can synthesize the first dinucleotide (initiation activity) and then elongates it or whether it has only elongation activity and requires p58 for the synthesis of the first dinucleotide (22Bakkenist C.J.

DNA polymerase α-primase bovine serum albumin single-stranded DNA. To address the activity of p48 again, we modified the T7 RNA polymerase promoter system of Escherichia coli (27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar) to allow the co-expression of multiprotein complexes from a single plasmid. The p58 and p48 subunits of human pol-prim were expressed either as wild type or as fusion proteins with oligohistidines at their N terminus. Thus, human primase that contained p58 and p48 was expressed and purified in high yields as a stable and active protein complex. Furthermore, for the first time the vectors that are described here allowed expression and purification of eukaryotic p48 in E. coli as a soluble protein and a fully active primase with regard to initiation and elongation. The addition of magnesium and manganese stabilized its primase activity. The bacterial and baculovirus expressed proteins could be assembled in vitro and formed a four-subunit pol-prim complex that is active in DNA replication. Enzymes were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany), Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany), or New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany). Reagents were purchased from Merck unless otherwise indicated (Darmstadt, Germany). [α-32P]ATP, [α-32P]GTP, [α-32P]dATP, [α-32P]dGTP, and [γ-32P]ATP (3000Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or NEN Life Sciences (Cologne, Germany). Ultrapure rNTPs were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; dNTPs were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim; poly(dT) and poly(dC) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; poly(dC,dT) and leupeptin were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany).

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) using a commercial reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). SDS-gel electrophoresis was carried out as described (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) with a 10-kDa ladder or prestained molecular mass marker proteins (Life Technologies GmbH, Eggenstein, Germany). After polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were detected either by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or by Western blot analysis as described (26Stadlbauer F. Brueckner A. Rehfuess C.

DNA polymerase α and DNA primase assays were performed according to Grosse and Krauss (30Grosse F. Krauss G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5470-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,31Grosse F.

One unit of DNA polymerase is defined as the amount that catalyzes the incorporation of 1 nmol of dAMP into acid-insoluble material in 1 h at 37 °C with activated DNA as template primer. One unit of primase is defined as the amount that leads to an incorporation of 1 nmol of dNMP/h at 37 °C using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I for elongation of the newly synthesized RNA primers on poly(dT) as template (30Grosse F. Krauss G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5470-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31Grosse F. Krauss G. J. Biol.

The EcoRI restriction site of pET11a and pET15b (AGS, Heidelberg, Germany) was deleted by cutting each plasmid with EcoRI and filling in the ends with Klenow DNA polymerase followed by ligation (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). This yielded the plasmids pET11-ΔEcoRI and pET15-ΔEcoRI. After digestion of each vector with NdeI andBamHI the two nonphosphorylated oligonucleotides (5′-TATGATCATCGGATCCCGGGTACCGCGGCCGCGTCGACTAGTAGAAT TCTCGA-3′ and 5′-GATCTCGAGAATTCTACTAGTCGACGCGGCCGCGGTACCCGGGATCCGATGATCA-3′) were added. The mixture was heated to 65 °C and slowly cooled to room temperature, and the DNA was ligated at 15 °C overnight. The plasmids containing the new oligonucleotides were called pET11-MCS and pET15-MCS, respectively. They were used for the expression of single proteins and multisubunit protein complexes (Fig.1, A and B). To express the cDNAs that code for human primase subunit p48 and p58, each cDNA was amplified with primer pairs that contain anNdeI site at its first ATG or a BamHI after its stop codon according to standard procedures (26Stadlbauer F. Brueckner A. Rehfuess C. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Förster V. Tseng B.Y. Nasheuer H.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 781-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cDNAs were cloned into the vectors pET11-MCS after verification of their sequence and pET15-MCS to express the primase subunits as unmodified proteins or fusion proteins with 6xHis, respectively. To co-express the proteins the vector pET11-Hp48 was digested withSpeI and EcoRI, and the vector pET15-Hp58 was cut with XbaI and EcoRI. The DNAs were separated on agarose gels and purified according to standard procedures (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The fragment containing the coding sequence of human p58 was ligated into vector pET11-Hp48, and the plasmid pET-Hp48-HisHp58 was created that expressed p48 as an unmodified protein and p58 as a fusion protein. E. coli cells BL21(DE3) containing the expression vectors either pET15-Hp48, pET15-Hp58, or pET-Hp48-HisHp58 were grown in terrific broth at 37 °C (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to an optical density of 2 measured at 600 nm. After lowering the growth temperature to 23 °C, the expression of recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested 3.5 h after induction, collected at 2000 ×g, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Alternatively, p48 was expressed and purified in the presence of divalent cations, as indicated. Cells that expressed p48 or p58 as single proteins were immediately homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05 mm leupeptin, and 0.01 mg/ml Trasylol) by sonication. After sonication the homogenate was adjusted to 1% Triton X-100, and then DNA and insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g. The supernatant was applied to metal chelate chromatography using Talon resins (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany). Then the resin was washed extensively with buffer 1 (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 250 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100; about 50 column volumes). After that the resin was washed with 5-column volumes of each buffer 2 (100 mm(NH4)2SO4, pH 8.2) plus 10 mm imidazole and buffer 2 plus 20 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted with 100 mm imidazole in buffer 2. For the purification in the presence of divalent cations, lysis buffer, buffer 1, and buffer 2 additionally contained 0.1 mmMnSO4 (Sigma) or 1 mm MgCl2, as indicated. To purify p48 further, the eluted fractions of the metal chelate column were dialyzed against buffer 3 (50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmMnSO4, and 1 mm MgCl2) plus 80 mm NaCl overnight and applied to phosphocellulose chromatography (buffer 3 and a gradient from 80 to 1000 mmNaCl) using the ÄKTA system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For long term storage of p48, the active fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 3 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm MnSO4, 1 mm MgCl2, and 30% glycerol. The half-life of the primase activity of the dialyzed enzyme was about 2 months at 4 °C. In the case of co-expressed Hp58-Hp48, the cells were frozen and stored at −80 °C until purification. Frozen cells were quickly thawed, and the heterodimer was purified as described above but without divalent cations. The purification yielded a stable protein complex. The pol-prim was purified from insect cells co-infected with four baculovirus vectors as described (26Stadlbauer F. Brueckner A. Rehfuess C. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Förster V. Tseng B.Y.

Biol. 1996; 16: 94-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively pol-prim was prepared from crude insect cell extracts that contained p180 and p68 mixed with crude E. coli extracts that included recombinant p58 plus p48. After incubation of the combined extracts for 1 h on ice, the four-subunit pol-prim was purified according to Stadlbaueret al. (34Stadlbauer F. Voitenleitner C. Brückner A. Fanning E. Nasheuer H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 94-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lengths of RNA primers were measured using poly(dT), poly(dC), poly(dC,dT), or M13 ssDNA as templates. The assay contained 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.3, 0.1 mm (nucleotide concentration) poly(dT), or poly(dC), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA. The reaction mixtures with poly(dT) as a template had 0.1 mm [α-32P]ATP (5 μCi/nmol), whereas the mixtures with poly(dC) contained 0.05 mm[α-32P]GTP (10 μCi/nmol). After addition of 0.2–1 unit of primase, as indicated, the assays were incubated 60 min at 37 °C. The synthesis products were precipitated with 0.8 m LiCl, 10 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), and 2.5-fold volume of ethanol for 15 min on dry ice, washed twice with 75% ethanol/water, dried, redissolved in 45% formamide, 5 mm EDTA, 0.09% xylene cyanol FF, 0.09% bromphenol blue at 65 °C for 10 min, heated for 3 min at 95 °C, and separated in denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio, 19:1; 7 m urea) for 3 to 4 h at 600 V with radioactively labeled oligo(dT)12–18 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as a marker (35Brückner A. Stadlbauer F. Guarino L.A. Brunahl A. Schneider C. Rehfuess C., C. Previes Fanning E. Nasheuer H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1716-1724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction products were visualized by autoradiography using x-ray films or PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). S100 extracts were prepared from logarithmically growing mouse FM3A cells as described previously (26Stadlbauer F. Brueckner A. Rehfuess C. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Förster V. Tseng B.Y. Nasheuer H.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 781-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34Stadlbauer F. Voitenleitner C. Brückner A. Fanning E. Nasheuer H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 94-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The replication of SV40 DNA in vitro was performed as described (34Stadlbauer F. Voitenleitner C. Brückner A. Fanning E. Nasheuer H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 94-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the SV40 assay (60 μl) contained 0.6 μg of SV40 T antigen, 0.25 μg of SV40 origin DNA (pUC-HS), 0.6 μg of human RP-A, 300 μg of S100 or depleted S100 extract from FM3A cells in 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmEGTA, pH 7.8, 4 mm ATP, 0.3 mm CTP, GTP, and UTP, 0.1 mm dATP and dGTP, 0.05 mm dCTP and dTTP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 80 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 5 μCi each of [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol). Comparisons between different enzyme preparations were made by adjusting the amounts of enzyme added to equal primase activity as indicated. The primase activity was determined at the time the replication assays were performed. The incorporation of radioactive deoxynucleoside monophosphate (dNMP) was measured by acid-precipitation of DNA and scintillation counting. The cDNAs of p48 and p58 were expressed separately fused to six histidine residues at their N terminus with the E. coli vectors pET15-Hp48 and pET15-Hp58. After metal chelate chromatography, the purified recombinant p48 subunit reproducibly showed primase activity as determined in the primer elongation assay using Klenow DNA polymerase (Fig. 3 A, column 1), whereas the recombinant p58 was inactive (Fig. 3 A,column 2). Typically about 1 mg of soluble p48 was purified from 500 ml of bacterial culture (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–3). Then affinity purified p48 was applied to phosphocellulose chromatography which yielded a single protein and activity peak (data not shown).Figure 2Purification of recombinant proteins. A, the subunit p48 and the heterodimer p58-p48 were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) using the vectors pET-HisHp48 and pET-HisHp58-Hp48. The p48 protein was expressed and purified in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+ by metal chelate chromatography, and the protein-containing fractions were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis (lanes 1–3). The two-subunit primase was expressed and purified in the absence of divalent cations, and the eluted fractions 1 and 2 were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis (lanes 4 and 5). P48 (lanes 1–3) and p58 (lanes 4 and 5) have slightly lower mobilities due to the additional histidine residues. B, the p180 and p68 subunits were expressed in insect cells, and Hisp58 and p48 were expressed in E. coli. After the assembly of pol-prim, the four-subunit complex was purified by phosphocellulose and immunoaffinity chromatography (lanes 1 and 2). Lanes M and M1represent a 10-kDa ladder molecular mass marker and the prestained molecular mass marker, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Primase preferentially synthesizes products of short size typically 5–10 nucleotides long (8Conaway R.C.

To verify the primase activity of the bacterially expressed proteins, the incorporation of NMP was directly determined by separating the synthesis products on denaturating gels and visualizing them by autoradiography (“direct assay”; Figs. 3 B and 7). In the direct assay, p58 did not show any primase activity (Fig. 3 B, lane 5), and no radioactive products were detectable above background (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 5 and7). In contrast to this result, p48 efficiently initiated oligoribonucleotide synthesis on different templates such as poly(dC) (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–4; Fig. 7 A), poly(dT) (Fig.7 D), poly(dC,dT), and M13ssDNA (data not shown). In addition, in the presence of p48, as well as p58–48 and pol-prim, long products were produced on poly(dC) that were not fully resolved by the gel electrophoresis (Figs. 3 B and 7, A–C). The observed high amounts of oligo/poly(G) primase products that were detected at the top of the gel might be due to a lower solubility of oligo/poly(G) products. Second, the poly(dC)·oligo/poly(G) products are extremely stable and they might quickly reanneal after heating to 95 °C and loading on the gel. Thus, a great portion of the primase products did not move into gel. These interpretations are consistent with the observation made by other investigators. 2R. Kuchta, personal communication. By using the plasmid pET-Hp48-HisHp58, co-expression of p48 and p58 yielded high amounts of purified two-subunit primase with high specific primase activity using metal chelate chromatography (8–10 mg per 500-ml culture of bacteria with a specific activity of about 10,000 units/mg; Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and 5; Fig. 3 , lane 6; data not shown). Interestingly, the size of products synthesized on poly(dC) by p48 alone and p58-p48 heterodimer varied. The p48 primase synthesized preferentially short products in the range of 5–10 nucleotides and some products longer than 17 nucleotides, whereas the p58-p48 heterodimer predominantly synthesized products that were longer than 17 nucleotides (Fig. 3 B, comparelanes 1–4 with lane 6, respectively). The activity of heterodimeric primase was stable for several months at 4 °C, and after dialysis against 30% glycerol it could be stored at −20 or −80 °C. Freezing and thawing was without detectable influence on the activity of p58-p48 primase (data not shown). However, the enzymatic activity of p48 expressed in E. coli was extremely unstable and could only be determined if expression, purification, and enzyme assay occurred within a few hours. Lengthy purification, freeze-thawing of bacterial cell pellets, or low concentrations of p48 resulted in a rapid loss of enzyme activity that could not be prevented by 1 mg/ml BSA, 10% glycerol, or 10% ethylene glycol (data not shown). Within 16 h of storage at 4 °C, the primase activity of p48 decreased by more than 85% of the starting activity (Fig. 4 A, comparecolumns 1 and 2). At concentrations of p48 that were lower than about 0.4 mg/ml, the half-life of primase activity was even shorter, and the activity decreased to background levels within 3 h (data not shown). The primase activity of p48 was reproducibly stabilized by the presence of 1–10 mm Mg2+ or 0.1–10 mmMn2+ (Fig. 4 A, compare column 2 withcolumns 3–7). In contrast, Zn2+ (1 μm to 10 mm; Fig. 4 A,columns 8–11), and low concentrations of Mg2+ or Mn2+ (1 μm to 0.1 mm or 1–10 μm, respectively, and data not shown) were ineffective. On the other hand, with 10 mmMg2+ or Mn2+ the enzyme activity of p48 was even detected after 14 days of storage at 4 °C (data not shown). Since divalent cations stabilized the primase activity of p48, we compared the influence of Mg2+ on the primase activity of recombinant p48, heterodimeric p58-p48, and heterotetrameric pol-prim (Fig. 4 B). The enzymes were diluted in buffer without (open bars 1–3) or with (hatched bars 4–6) 10 mm Mg2+, and the activity was measured after incubation at 37 °C. As expected the activity of p48 diminished within 10 min in the absence of Mg2+, and only about 5% activity of the starting activity that was determined before preincubation could be detected (Fig. 4 B, column 1). In the presence of Mg2+ the activity of p48 and of the other enzymes was equally stable (Fig. 4 B, compare columns 4–6). In contrast to p48, the presence of 10 mm of Mg2+ did not stabilize the primase activity of either p58-p48 or pol-prim (Fig. 4 B, comparecolumns 2 and 3 with 5 and6, respectively). These results prompted us to optimize the production of active p48. The primase activity was measured by the primer elongation assay or directly by analyzing the primase products on denaturing gels. The addition of divalent cations to the purification buffers increased specific primase activity of p48 by a factor of 3 to 4 (Fig.5, compare columns 1 and2). The presence of Mg2+ during protein expression and purification raised the specific primase activity by a factor of up to 10 in comparison with the procedure without divalent cations (Fig. 5, compare columns 1 and 3). These findings were supported by direct assays that were performed in parallel (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–4). It is worth mentioning that the addition of divalent cations to the bacteria decreases the level of expression of p48 by a factor of 2 to 3 (data not shown). To compare the dependence of the recombinant enzymes on Mg2+, the activity of the primase was investigated in the presence of increasing Mg2+ co"
https://openalex.org/W2036705609,"PMEG (9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)guanine) is an acyclic nucleotide analog being evaluated for its anti-proliferative activity. We examined the inhibitory effects of PMEG diphosphate (PMEGpp) toward DNA polymerases (pol) δ and ε and found it to be a competitive inhibitor of both these enzymes. The apparentKi values for PMEGpp were 3–4 times lower than theKm values for dGTP. The analog was shown to function as a substrate and to be incorporated into DNA by both enzymes. Examination of the ability of pol δ and pol ε to repair the incorporated PMEG revealed that pol ε could elongate PMEG-terminated primers in both matched and mismatched positions with an efficiency equal to 27 and 85% that observed for dGMP-terminated control template-primers. Because PMEG acts as an absolute DNA chain terminator, the elongation of PMEG-terminated primers is possible only by cooperation of the 3′-5′-exonuclease and DNA polymerase activities of the enzyme. In contrast to pol ε, pol δ exhibited negligible activity on these template-primers, indicating that pol ε, but not pol δ, can repair the incorporated analog.

(9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)guanine) (Fig.1) is a member of a new class of acyclic nucleotide analogs characterized as phosphonylmethyl ethers. Several analogs in this class have demonstrated broad spectrum antiviral activity (1De Clercq E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). PMEG is being evaluated as an antitumor agent for cancer treatment. Its anti-proliferative activity has been demonstratedin vitro against human leukemic cells (2Robbins B.L. Connelly M.C. Marshall D.R. Srinivas R.N. Fridland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 391-397PubMed Google Scholar) as well as a number of solid tumor cell lines (3Paborsky L.R. Mao C.T. Toole J.J. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 100Google Scholar). PMEG also showed antitumor activity in two types of mouse transplantable tumors, P388 lymphocytic leukemia and B16 melanoma (4Rose W.C. Crosswell A.R. Bronson J.J. Martin J.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 510-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, the analog suppressed the growth of papillomavirus-induced condylomas on human foreskin xenografts in mice (5Krieder J.W. Balogh K. Olson R.O. Martin J.C. Antiviral Res. 1990; 14: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) guanine polymerase bovine serum albumin 2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine 5′-monophosphate 2′-deoxyribonucleotides 9-β-d-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine 5′-monophosphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis proliferating cell nuclear antigen 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)guanine diphosphate simian virus 40. 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) guanine polymerase bovine serum albumin 2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine 5′-monophosphate 2′-deoxyribonucleotides 9-β-d-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine 5′-monophosphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis proliferating cell nuclear antigen 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)guanine diphosphate simian virus 40. Once inside the cells, cellular enzymes phosphorylate the analog to PMEG mono- and diphosphate (6Ho H.-T. Woods K.L. Konrad S.K. DeBoeck H. Hitchcock M.J.M. Innovations in Antiviral Development and the Detection of Virus Infection. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1992: 159-166Google Scholar). The diphosphate form (PMEGpp) is an analog of dGTP. Although the mechanism of action of PMEG has not yet been determined, PMEG diphosphate has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of rat DNA polymerase α and ε (7Kramata P. Votruba I. Otová B. Holy A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1005-1011PubMed Google Scholar) and to be incorporated into DNA in vitro by human DNA polymerase α and δ (8Cihlar T. Chen M.S. Antiviral. Chem. Chemother. 1997; 8: 187-195Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 9Pisarev V.M. Lee S.-H. Connelly M.C. Fridland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can potentially inhibit cellular DNA synthesis. DNA polymerases α, δ, and ε are the enzymes cooperating in chromosomal DNA replication (10Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Pol α, associated with DNA primase activity, synthesizes RNA-DNA primers for initiation of DNA replication at ori sites and for priming of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of DNA. Pol δ, in cooperation with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and other protein factors, synthesizes the leading strand of DNA. Pol ε, which is dispensable for SV40 DNA replication (11Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) but not for cellular DNA replication (12Zlotkin T. Kaufmann G. Jiang Y. Lee M.Y.W.T. Uitto L. Syvaoja J. Donreiter I. Fanning E. Nethanel T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2298-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), may be required as a second DNA polymerase on the lagging DNA strand (13Podust V.N. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast to pol α, both pol δ and pol ε have intrinsic 3′-5′-exonuclease activity associated with a proofreading function (14Kunkel T. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Both enzymes are necessary for the repair of cellular DNA damage after UV irradiation (15Zeng X.-R. Jiang Y. Zhang S.-J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 501-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably participating in filling the excision gaps during the final step of nucleotide excision repair (17Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 69-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Moreover, pol δ is associated with DNA mismatch repair (18Longley M.J. Pierce A.J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10917-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and pol ε was described as a cell cycle checkpoint regulator sensing DNA damage during S phase (19Navas T.A. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that pol δ and pol ε may have the potential to remove a nucleotide analog such as PMEG following its incorporation into cellular DNA. In this study, we investigated the interaction of PMEGpp with purified bovine pol δ and human pol ε. By using oligonucleotide template-primers, we examined the inhibitory effects of PMEGpp and the ability of these enzymes to incorporate the analog into DNA as well as to excise it from 3′-ends. PMEGpp was synthesized at Gilead Sciences (Foster City, CA) according to a published procedure (20Holy A. Rosenberg I. Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 1987; 52: 2801-2809Crossref Google Scholar). The purity was checked by high pressure liquid chromatography using a Adsorbosphere SAX ion-exchange column (Alltech) and found to be greater than 97%. Deoxynucleotide triphosphates were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [3H]dTTP (1.89 TBq/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (222 TBq/mmol), and [α-32P]dGTP (111 TBq/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Poly(dA) and oligo(dT)12–18were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oligonucleotide primers and templates were synthesized by Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). The primers were 5′-end-labeled by [γ-32P]ATP with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The labeled products were separated on Quick Spin (TE) columns (Boehringer Mannheim) and annealed in a 1.5:1 ratio to the respective templates in 10 mm TE, pH 7.5, by heating to 70 °C for 10 min and then slow cooling to room temperature. The following template-primers (T·P) were used. 5′­TGACCATGTAACAGAGAG­3′3′­ACTGGTACATTGTCTCTCTCAACACAGCCAACACAGCAACACGCACAACGA­5′ TEMPLATE­PRIMER1 5′­TGACCATGTAACAGAGAG­3′3′­ACTGGTACATTGTCTCTCCAATGTATAGGTTATGAGTAGATAGTTAAGTGT­5′ TEMPLATE­PRIMER2 5′­TGACCATGTAACAGAGAGG or PMEG3′­ACTGGTACATTGTCTCTCCAATGTATAGGTTATGAGTAGATAGTTAAGTGT­5′ MATCHEDT·P 5′­TGACCATGTAACAGAGAGG or PMEG3′­ACTGGTACATTGTCTCTCTCAACACAGCCAACACAGCAACACGCACAACGA­5′ MISMATCHEDT·POligonucleotides terminated at the 3′-ends with PMEG or dGMP (matched and mismatched T·P) were prepared using pol α (the major portion of DNA polymerase activity separated from pol ε during the purification from CCRF-CEM cells, see below). The reaction mixture (300 μl) contained the same buffer as for pol δ assays (see DNA polymerase activity unit), 0.5 μm32P-labeled T·P-2, 10 μm PMEGpp or dGTP, and 20 units of pol α. After a 60-min incubation at 37 °C, the products were mixed with the formamide stop solution and separated by 20% denaturing PAGE. The bands corresponding to incorporated PMEG or dGTP (conversion of T·P was approximately 70%) were excised from the gel and extracted overnight with water. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied onto DEAE-Sephacel column (100 μl) equilibrated in water. The column was washed with water, and the oligonucleotide was eluted with 1 m NaCl. The eluate was finally concentrated by n-butanol and desalted using a spin column. Primers were annealed to corresponding templates as described above. DNA polymerase ε was isolated from 28 g of human T lymphoblastoid CCRF-CEM cells (ATCC, CCL 119) by a published procedure (22Syvaoja J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2489-2497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a modification in the last step. After sequential chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, phosphocellulose (P-11), and hydroxylapatite, the protein sample (0.54 mg) was applied to a heparin-agarose column (0.66 × 0.8 cm), and pol ε was eluted at the end of a 0.2–0.5 m KCl linear gradient under conditions published elsewhere (23Mozzherin D.J. Fisher P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3572-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Bovine DNA polymerase δ was purified according to a published procedure (24Ng L. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11699-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCNA was prepared from fetal calf thymus as described (25Tan C.-K. Castillo C. So A.G. Downey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 12310-12316Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. One unit of DNA polymerase incorporated 1 nmol of dTMP into acid-insoluble precipitate after 30 min at 37 °C under the following conditions. The reaction mixture for pol δ (25 μl) contained buffer δ (40 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μg/ml BSA, 1 μg/ml PCNA), 0.5 units/ml poly(dA)-oligo(dT)12–18, and 20 μm[3H]dTTP (18.9 GBq/mmol). The reaction conditions for pol ε were the same except the pH was 7.5 (buffer ε) and PCNA was omitted. Reactions were stopped by spotting aliquots onto GF/A fiberglass disks (Whatman). The filters were washed 3 times in cold 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 20 mmNa4P2O7, once in 96% ethanol, and then dried. The acid-insoluble radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Monoclonal anti-pol α antibody from the hybridoma cell line SJK 132-20 was purified as described previously (8Cihlar T. Chen M.S. Antiviral. Chem. Chemother. 1997; 8: 187-195Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Aliquots of fractions eluted from the heparin-agarose column (1 μl) were preincubated with 2 μg of the anti-pol α antibody in 1.6 mg/ml BSA and 33 mm NaCl for 1 h at 4 °C. The reaction mixture (25 μl) was adjusted to 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 400 μg/ml BSA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 units/ml poly(dA)-oligo(dT)12–18, 20 μm[3H]dTTP (18.9 GBq/mmol), and 80 μg/ml anti-pol α antibody. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were processed as described above. The enzyme sample was separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE (Novex) and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. See Blue pre-stained standards (Novex) were used as a transfer marker. The membrane was incubated at room temperature for 1 h in blocking buffer (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 10% (w/v) non-fat dry milk) and then for 1 h with the monoclonal anti-pol ε antibody 3C5.1 (Ref. 21Chui G. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7799-7808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, a generous gift of Dr. S. Linn, University of California, Berkeley) diluted to 10 μg/ml in blocking buffer. Following the washing (4 × for 15 min) in blocking buffer without the milk (TTBS), the membrane was incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Promega) diluted to 0.13 μg/ml in blocking buffer. Following the additional washing (3 × for 15 min) with TTBS and once with TBS (TTBS without Tween 20), the blot was developed in a chromogenic solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate. The reaction mixture (15 μl) for the determination of kinetic constants (Vmax,Ki, and Km) was the same as for DNA polymerase unit definition except that poly(dA)-oligo(dT)12–18 was replaced by T·P-1 (0.1 μm), and dATP, dCTP, and dTTP (10 μm each) were added. The assays were performed with various concentrations of [32P]dGTP (0.5–29 TBq/mmol) and PMEGpp and 0.01 units of either pol δ or pol ε. After a 12-min incubation at 37 °C, aliquots were applied onto DE81 ion-exchange paper disks (Whatman). The disks were washed (3 × for 10 min) in 5% Na2HPO4, once in water, and once in 96% ethanol. The radioactivity on the disks was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. The kinetic constants were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plots using KinetAsyst software (Think Technologies). Pol ε was purified from exponentially growing human CCRF-CEM cells. A heparin-agarose chromatography step was added to the published procedure outlined for HeLa cells (22Syvaoja J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2489-2497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to ensure the separation of pol α and pol ε. The separation was verified using a monoclonal anti-pol α antibody (SJK 132). As shown in Fig. 2 A, the antibody neutralized pol α activity (fractions 2–20) but not pol ε activity (fractions 51–60). To confirm the presence of pol ε, fractions 51–60 were collected and immunoblotted against an anti-pol ε monoclonal antibody (3C5.1). As shown in Fig. 2 B, our purified human pol ε has a molecular mass of >250 kDa, which is consistent with previously published observations (21Chui G. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7799-7808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Syvaoja J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2489-2497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To kinetically characterize the competition between PMEGpp and dGTP, an oligonucleotide template-primer (T·P-1) containing 13 incorporation sites for dGMP was used. Kinetic analysis utilizing Lineweaver-Burk plots confirmed that PMEGpp was a competitive inhibitor of both pol δ and pol ε with respect to dGTP (plots are not shown). The apparentKi values of 13 ± 1 and 12 ± 1 nm were calculated for pol δ and pol ε, respectively. The inhibitory potency, expressed as aKi(PMEGpp)/Km(dGTP) ratio (TableI) indicated that the affinity of both enzymes was approximately 3–4 times higher for the analog than for dGTP. These results indicated that PMEGpp was a strong competitive inhibitor of both pol δ and pol ε.Table IKinetic analysis of DNA polymerase inhibition by PMEGppVmaxKm(dGTP)Ki(PMEGpp)Ki/Kmpmol/min/mgnmpol δ56 ± 443 ± 613 ± 10.30pol ɛ1.3 ± 0.149 ± 712 ± 10.24 Open table in a new tab A primer extension assay utilizing an oligonucleotide template-primer (T·P-2) was used to determine the ability of pol δ and pol ε to incorporate the analog into DNA. The Km andVmax for PMEGpp and dGTP were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plots as shown in Fig. 3,A (pol δ) and B(pol ε). In agreement with the affinity data derived from the Ki studies, both pol δ and pol ε had 3–4 times lower Km values for PMEGpp as compared with dGTP. However, this was combined with proportionally lowerVmax values for the analog (Table II). When the incorporation efficiency of PMEGpp toward dGTP (finc = (Vmax/Km)PMEGpp/(Vmax/Km)dGTP(27Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Boosalis M.S. Sowers L.C. Cheong C. Tinoco I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This result would suggest that the analog and the natural substrate have equal incorporation efficiencies only if there was not a substantial difference in their excision following incorporation under “standing start” reaction conditions.Figure 3Incorporation of PMEG by pol δ (A) and pol ε (B). Pol δ or pol ε (0.07 units) was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 15-μl reaction mixtures containing buffer δ or ε, 0.1 μm32P-labeled T·P-2, and various concentrations of PMEGpp or dGTP as indicated. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 98% formamide containing 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 0.2% xylene cyanole FF. Products were separated by 20% denaturing PAGE; the gels were scanned, and the radioactivity was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). TheKm and Vmax values were calculated based on the Michaelis-Menten equation using Lineweaver-Burk plots and the KinetAsyst computer program.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIIncorporation of PMEGpp and dGTP by DNA polymerases using a primer extension assayPMEGppdGTPVmaxKmVmaxKmpmol/min/mgnmpmol/min/mgnmpol δ1.94 ± 0.2575 ± 165.88 ± 0.94282 ± 40pol ɛ0.054 ± 0.00656 ± 120.169 ± 0.013140 ± 16PMEG or dGMP was incorporated by the enzymes tested as a first nucleotide following the 3′-primer terminus under the reaction conditions described in Fig. 3.

Open table in a new tab PMEG or dGMP was incorporated by the enzymes tested as a first nucleotide following the 3′-primer terminus under the reaction conditions described in Fig. 3. Products separated by PAGE were scanned by PhosphorImager, and the counts corresponding to incorporated PMEG or dGMP were evaluated by KinetAsyst program. To examine the ability of the DNA polymerases to excise and repair the incorporated PMEG, template-primers were generated with PMEG incorporated in matched (with dC) or mismatched (with dT) positions. The results were compared with those generated with dGMP-terminated primers. To quantify the difference, the products of the DNA polymerase reactions were scanned and the activity of pol δ and pol ε on templates with dGMP-terminated primers was taken as 100%. As shown in Fig.4, A and B, and Table III, pol ε not only excised the PMEG from PMEG-terminated primers (lanes −dNTPs, 23 and 68% of the control dGMP matched and mismatched primers, respectively) but was able to use the PMEG-terminated oligonucleotide as a primer for elongation in the presence of dNTPs (27 and 83% of the control dGMP matched and mismatched primers, respectively). Because PMEG lacks a 3′-OH group, the elongation was possible only following the cleavage of PMEG from the 3′ terminus. The observation that the mismatched PMEG-terminated primer was elongated more efficiently than the matched one is consistent with the known preference of the 3′-5′-exonuclease activity of pol ε for mismatched ends of DNA (28Sabatino R.D. Myers T.W. Bambara R.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5340-5344PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to pol ε, pol δ excised and elongated the PMEG-terminated primers poorly (TableIII). Pol δ excised matched PMEG-terminated primers with 9% of the efficiency compared with the control. In the presence of dNTPs, the efficiency decreased to less than 1%, compared with the control. This result indicated that the 3′-5′-exonuclease activity of pol δ, in contrast to pol ε, was inhibited by the presence of dNTPs in the reaction mixture. This inhibition, however, was not found for the mismatched PMEG-terminated primer, in which 4% of the efficiency compared with the control was observed both in the exonuclease and polymerase reactions. These results demonstrated that pol ε, but not pol δ, has the ability to repair PMEG from the 3′ terminus by cooperation of 3′-5′-exonuclease and DNA polymerase activities.Table IIIDNA polymerase and 3′-5′-exonuclease activity of pol δ and pol ɛ on oligonucleotide templates with 3′-dGMP- and 3′-PMEG-terminated primersMatched T · PMismatched T · PdG-dCPMEG-dCdG-dTPMEG-dTpolexopolexopolexopolexofmol/min%fmol/min%pol δ11.7 ± 3.73.1 ± 0.50.9 ± 0.28.7 ± 0.93.3 ± 1.05.4 ± 1.23.6 ± 1.84.3 ± 0.6pol ɛ5.9 ± 1.68.9 ± 2.727.0 ± 0.422.5 ± 3.05.8 ± 1.49.3 ± 3.082.9 ± 5.267.9 ± 8.9Pol δ or pol ɛ (0.07 units) was incubated with the template-primers in corresponding buffers under the same conditions as described in Fig4.

The corresponding enzyme activity using PMEG-dC or PMEG-dT template-primers was as a percent. This study demonstrated the strong inhibitory potential of PMEG diphosphate toward DNA polymerase δ and ε. PMEGpp was found to be a competitive inhibitor of pol δ and ε with respect to dGTP incorporation. The apparent Ki values for the analog (13 and 12 nm for pol δ and pol ε, respectively) were 3–4 times lower than the Km values for the natural substrate. In addition, both enzymes can recognize PMEGpp as a substrate and incorporate PMEG into DNA. Due to the lack of a 3′-OH moiety, the nucleotide analog functions as an absolute DNA chain terminator. The prevention of DNA chain elongation as well as the competition between PMEGpp and dGTP for the nucleotide-binding site of the polymerases are probably the main mechanisms of PMEGpp inhibition. The inhibition of DNA polymerases in vivo depends on the intracellular concentration ratio of PMEGpp to dGTP. The size of the dGTP pool, which is usually the smallest of the dNTP pools (29Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), differs considerably among cell lines, ranging between 3 and 50 μm (30Gandhi V. Mineishi S. Huang P. Chapman A.J.

Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 567-572PubMed Google Scholar). The level of PMEGpp will also differ among cell lines depending on the transport and phosphorylation efficiency of the analog. Following the incubation of Vero cells with PMEG, intracellular PMEGpp was found in micromolar concentrations (6Ho H.-T. Woods K.L. Konrad S.K. DeBoeck H. Hitchcock M.J.M. Innovations in Antiviral Development and the Detection of Virus Infection. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1992: 159-166Google Scholar). Due to the higher affinity of both pol δ and pol ε for PMEGpp than for dGTP, DNA replication may be significantly slowed down not only in cells with equimolar PMEGpp and dGTP ratios but also in cells containing an excess of the natural substrate. The analog may also successfully compete with dGTP during DNA repair synthesis, because both pol δ and pol ε also participate in nucleotide excision repair (17Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 69-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). PMEG molecules incorporated into DNA may be repaired by the cooperation of the 3′-5′-exonuclease and the DNA polymerase activities of pol δ and/or pol ε. We determined that pol ε, but not pol δ, was able to repair PMEG incorporated into the 3′ terminus of DNA. Pol ε may recognize incorporated PMEG and remove it prior to cells undergoing mitosis as a part of its checkpoint role in S phase (19Navas T.A. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) or during homologous recombination (32Jessberger R. Podust V. Hubscher U. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to PMEG, dFdCMP, and F-ara-AMP, the active forms of anticancer drugs gemcitabine and fludarabine were not effectively excised by pol ε from the 3′ terminus of DNA (33Huang P. Chubb S. Hertel L.W. Grindey G.B. Plunkett W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6110-6117PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kamiya K. Huang P. Plunkett W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19428-19435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The pol ε-catalyzed reduction in the number of PMEG molecules in DNA may have certain limits depending on the extent of DNA damage and on the intracellular concentration ratio of PMEGpp to dGTP. Therefore, the significance of our observation in vivo has to be determined. Pol δ was unable to repair PMEG efficiently even on the template-primer terminated by PMEG in the mismatched position. This may be due either to the decreased ability of pol δ to recognize PMEG-terminated primers or to cleave the phosphodiester bond between PMEG and the adjacent nucleotide.

In addition, these nucleoside analogs inhibit ribonucleotide reductase activity resulting in the imbalance of the cellular deoxynucleotide pools. Currently, studies are underway to determine whether PMEG inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and other enzymes participating in the de novo and salvage synthesis of nucleotides."

To identify the location of those sequences, we usedrecA-assisted restriction endonuclease (RARE) cleavage to truncate the 5′- or 3′-flanking sequences from a 145-kilobase (kb) bacterial artificial chromosome spanning the entire human apoB gene. Seven RARE cleavage– modified bacterial artificial chromosomes with different lengths of flanking sequences were used to generate transgenic mice. An analysis of those mice revealed that as little as 1.5 kb of 3′ sequences or 5 kb of 5′ sequences were sufficient to confer apoB expression in the liver. In contrast, apoB gene expression in the intestine required DNA sequences 54–62 kb 5′ to the structural gene. Those sequences retained their ability to direct apoB expression in the intestine when they were moved closer to the gene. These studies demonstrate that the intestinal expression of the apoB gene is dependent on DNA sequences located an extraordinary distance from the structural gene and that the RARE cleavage/transgenic expression strategy is a powerful approach for analyzing distant gene-regulatory sequences.

ApoB48 is essential for the assembly of chylomicrons in the intestine, and apoB100 is essential for the formation of VLDL in the liver. When apoB gene mutations prevent the synthesis of apoB48 and apoB100, neither chylomicrons nor VLDL can be detected in the plasma, and the plasma concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterol are extremely low (3Gregg R.E.

Although the basic function of apoB (the assembly of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins) is the same in the liver and intestine, the genetic control of apoB gene expression in these two tissues is strikingly different. In transgenic mouse expression studies, an ∼80-kb P1 bacteriophage (p158) spanning the entire human apoB gene (and containing 19 kb of 5′ sequences and 17.5 kb of 3′ sequences) yielded human apoB expression in the liver of transgenic mice, but expression was completely absent in the intestine (5Linton M.F.

Similarly, a P1 bacteriophage clone spanning the mouse apoB gene (and containing 33 kb of 5′-sequences and 11 kb of 3′ sequences) did not direct transgene expression in the intestine of transgenic mice (7McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Véniant M. Borén J. Pierotti V. Flynn L.M. Grass D.S. Connolly A. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11963-11970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). More recently, we identified a 145-kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone spanning the human apoB gene and used it to generate human apoB transgenic mice. That clone, which contained 70 kb of 5′ sequences and 22 kb of 3′ sequences, conferred completely appropriate levels of apoB gene expression in the absorptive enterocytes of the intestine (8Nielsen L.B.

In the current study, we have used transgenic mouse expression studies with BACs to further define the sequences that are important for the expression of the apoB gene in the intestine. Our approach involved the use of recA-assisted restriction endonuclease (RARE) cleavage to delete portions of the 5′- or 3′-flanking sequences from the 145-kb BAC. The RARE cleavage-modified BACs were then used to generate multiple lines of human apoB transgenic mice. This experimental approach allowed us to document that the intestinal expression of the apoB gene is controlled by DNA sequences located an extraordinary distance upstream from the human apoB gene. All of the BACs used in this study were derived from a 145-kb BAC, BAC(70,22), spanning the human apoB gene. BAC(70,22) contained 70 kb of 5′-flanking sequences and 22 kb of 3′-flanking sequences. To delete portions of the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences from BAC(70,22), we deleted segments of DNA between two EcoRI sites or two HindIII sites. BAC(70,22) contains more than 40 EcoRI and more than 40HindIII sites. To cleave specifically at only two of theEcoRI sites or at only two of the HindIII sites, we used RARE cleavage (9Ferrin T.E.

In the presence of the bacterial proteinrecA, oligonucleotides can be used to “cover up” restriction sites in a BAC clone and thereby protect them from methylation by a specific DNA methylase. After inactivation of therecA and the methylase, the protected restriction sites in the BAC DNA can be digested with HindIII (orEcoRI). RARE cleavage was performed as described previously, with some minor modifications (12Ferrin L.J. Genet. Eng. 1995; 17: 21-30Google Scholar, 13Borén J. Lee I. Callow M.J. Rubin E.M. Innerarity T.L. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Each RARE cleavage reaction contained 5× recA buffer (32 μl; 125 mm Tris acetate, 20 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmspermidine hydrochloride, 2 mm dithiothreitol (all from Sigma), pH 7.85), ADP (8 μl; 22 mm; Boehringer Mannheim (catalogue no. 102164)), ATPγS (8 μl; 6 mmol/liter, Boehringer Mannheim (catalogue no. 1162306)), recA protein (20 μl; 2 mg/ml, U.S. Biochemical Corp. (catalogue no. E70028Y/Z) or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) (catalogue no. 249S)), 60-mer oligonucleotide(s) (4.5 μl; 160 nmol/μl for experiments with two oligonucleotides or 320 nmol/μl for experiments with a single oligonucleotide), and distilled H2O (to accomplish a final volume of 160 μl). These reagents were mixed and prewarmed to 37 °C for 1 min. BAC DNA (4 μg in TE (10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA; Digene Technologies, Silver Spring, MD)) and acetylated bovine serum albumin (8 μl; 2 mg/ml; New England Biolabs) were added, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C for 20 min. EcoRI methylase (8 μl; 4 units/μl; New England Biolabs (catalogue no. 211S or 220L)) (or AluI methylase, which methylatesHindIII sites) and S-adenosylmethionine (8 μl; 4 units/μl; New England Biolabs) were then added. After incubating at 37 °C for 60 min, recA protein and methylase were denatured by incubating the mixture at 65 °C for 15 min. Methylated DNA was dialyzed on filters (VS, 0.025 μm, Millipore, Bedford, MA) against 0.5× TE for 30 min and then cleaved with EcoRI (orHindIII) for at least 1 h at 37 °C in the buffer provided by the supplier of the enzyme (New England Biolabs or Boehringer Mannheim). The RARE cleavage products were separated by pulsed field electrophoresis (CHEF-mapper, Bio-Rad) on 1% low melting point agarose gels (SeaPlaque GTG-agarose, FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME). A gel slice (200–400 mg of gel) containing the DNA fragment was excised (14Callow M.J. Ferrin L.J. Rubin E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4348-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar,15Allan C.M. Taylor S. Taylor J.M. J. Biol.

The agarose was placed in an Eppendorf tube and melted by incubation at 65 °C for 10–15 min. The tube was cooled to 42 °C, and gelase (5 units/100 μl of melted gel; Epicentre Technologies) was added. After digestion of the agarose for 1 h at 42 °C, the tube was placed on ice for 2 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 2 min to pellet any undigested gel. The linearized DNA (a 100-μl aliquot) was then circularized by adding 1.5 μl of T4 ligase (New England Biolabs) and 10 μl of 10× ligase buffer and incubating the mixture at 14 °C for 12–16 h. The ligation product was filter-dialyzed for 30 min against 0.5× TE; a total of 1–2 μl was used to transform 20–50 μl of electrocompetent Escherichia coli (strain DH10B, Life Technologies, Inc.) by electroporation. The transformations were done according to the instructions from Life Technologies, except that we used 13 instead of 18 V/cm. The transformed cells were then plated on agar plates containing chloramphenicol (12.5 μg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim) and incubated at 37 °C for 16–24 h. In most experiments, 10 bacterial colonies were picked. To confirm that the modified BACs contained the correct inserts, the BAC clones were cleaved with XhoI, NotI, EcoRI, andHindIII (alone and in combination) and analyzed by conventional and pulsed field agarose gel electrophoresis. In some cases, the BACs were also analyzed by sequencing across the newEcoRI or HindIII restriction site generated by the RARE cleavage reaction. To prepare DNA for screening of new BAC clones, bacterial colonies were grown overnight in 4.5 ml of LB medium (Digene Diagnostics, Beltsville, MD) containing 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol (Boehringer Mannheim). The bacterial cultures were centrifuged for 10 min at 5500 × g. The bacteria were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mg/ml RNase A) containing 10 μl of a lysozyme solution (10 mg/ml in buffer A, Boehringer Mannheim). After an incubation for 3 min at room temperature, the resuspended cells were lysed by adding 200 μl of 0.2 m NaOH containing 1% SDS, followed by 150 μl of a 3 m potassium acetate solution in 1.5% acetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g. Finally, the DNA in the supernatant fluid was precipitated with ethanol, washed in 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 20 μl of TE. This method yielded ∼4 μg of BAC DNA. We previously cloned a P1 bacteriophage, P1–70, containing 70 kb of sequences upstream from a NotI site within intron 1 of the apoB gene (8Nielsen L.B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29752-29758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); we then subcloned the EcoRI andHindIII fragments of the P1 clone into pBluescript SK II+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The insert from P1–70 spans from intron 1 of the human apoB gene to 70 kb 5′ of the gene (8Nielsen L.B. McCormick S.P.A. Pierotti V. Tam C. Gunn M.D. Shizuya H. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29752-29758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). EcoRI orHindIII subclones located −5, −30, −47, −54, or −62 kb 5′ to the apoB gene were identified by quantitative DNA fiber mapping. The ends of these subclones were sequenced with T7, T3, M13 forward, or M13 reverse primers. The sequence on both sides of the restriction site of interest was obtained by sequencing back across the restriction sites using P1–70 as template. For these sequencing reactions, we used the oligonucleotide primers 1 (5′-GGA GAA GGG AGA CAG GGG GAT GG-3′ (to define the sequence surrounding the EcoRI site located −5 kb 5′ to the gene)), 2 (5′-TCT ATG AAA AAT CTA TGC CAA AT-3′ (to define the EcoRI site located −47 kb 5′ to the gene)), 3 (5′-ATG TCT GAA GGC AAG GAA GTA AT-3′ (to define the HindIII site located −54 kb 5′ to the gene)), and 4 (5′-AGC CCC AGG TAG ACC CCA TTC TC-3′ (to define the EcoRI site located −62 kb 5′ to the gene)). Oligonucleotide primers 5 (5′-TGT GGA ATT GTG AGC GGA TAA C-3′) and 6 (5′-GCT GGC GAA AGG GGG ATG TGC TG-3′) (corresponding to BAC vector sequences) were used to sequence across the HindIII cloning site at the 3′ and 5′ ends of BAC(70,22), respectively. All sequencing was done with the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin-Elmer) according to the manufacturer's protocol, except for sequencing of BAC or P1 DNA, in which we used 2 or 4 μg of DNA in each sequencing reaction. To clone both BAC(30,22) and BAC(54,22), we used a single 60-mer oligonucleotide that protected two HindIII sites; the first 30 bp of each oligonucleotide consisted of sequences immediately 5′ to the HindIII cloning site in BAC(70,22), while the last 30 bp consisted of sequences immediately 3′ to a HindIII site located −30 or −54 kb 5′ to the apoB gene. To generate the remainder of the BACs, we used pairs of two different 60-mer oligonucleotides, each of which spanned specific HindIII or EcoRI sites. BAC(54,22) was also cloned with a two-oligonucleotide approach. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies or Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR). The oligonucleotides used to generate the BACs used in this study were as follows: BAC(70,1.5), 7 (5′-ATC CTT CAA CCT CCA CCA TTC TTT CAT AAA GCT TCA CAT TCT CTT GGT GAA GCC CAC TGT-3′ (covering a HindIII site +1.5 kb 3′ of the apoB gene)) and 8 (5′-CTA TTT AGG TGA CAC TAT AGA ATA CTC AAG CTT TTG GCT CCA TTG AAG GAT TAT TTG ATG-3′ (covering the HindIII site at the 3′ cloning site within BAC(70,22))); BAC(30,22), 9 (5′-TCC TCT AGA GTC GAC CTG CAG GCA TGC AAG CTC TAT AGT TTT AAC TTT TAC ATG AAG GTC-3′ (covering both the 5′ HindIII cloning site and a HindIII site located −30 kb 5′ to the apoB gene)); BAC(54,22) (using the single oligonucleotide approach), 10 (5′-TCC TCT AGA GTC GAC CTG CAG GCA TGC AAG CTT CAT CCC CTA ACC CCA AAA AAC AAT TTA-3′ (covering both the 5′HindIII cloning site and a HindIII site −54 kb 5′ to the apoB gene)); BAC(54,22) (using the two-oligonucleotide approach), 11 (5′-GAT CAA TGA TGA AGG AGT TGA GAA AAC AAG CTT CAT CCC CTA ACC CCA AAA AAC AAT TTA-3′ (covering a HindIII site −54 kb 5′ to the apoB gene)) and 12 (5′-TCC TCT AGA GTC GAC CTG CAG GCA TGC AAG CTT TAA ACA TGC TTT TGT GGT GTG GCT TCC-3′ (covering the 5′HindIII cloning site in BAC(70,22))); BAC(5,22), 13 (5′-ACA TTT CCC TTC ATA GCT CTG AAC AAG GAG AAT TCA GCC CAA TTC TCA TGG CCT TCT ACA-3′ (covering an EcoRI site −5 kb 5′ to the apoB gene)) and 14 (5′-AGT GAA TTG TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC GAA TTC GAG CTC GGT ACC CGG GGA TCC TCT-3′ (covering an EcoRI site in the BAC vector located 49 bp from the 5′ cloning site)); BAC(62,1.5), 15 (5′-TGC TGT GTG AGC ACT GAC AGT TCA GAA TTC CTT GAA GTA TAC AGA AGG TAG GGA AGG GAA-3′ (covering an EcoRI site −62 kb 5′ to the apoB gene)) and oligonucleotide 13; BAC(Δ5–47,1.5), 15 (5′-ACA TAT TGA CTA TAT CCT TAA TGC TCT GAA TTC TCA TTA CAT TTG TAC AGA TGT GGG GCC-3′ (covering an EcoRI site −47 kb 5′ to the apoB gene)) and oligonucleotide 13; BAC(Δ5–62,1.5), oligonucleotides 13 and 15. BAC plasmid DNA for microinjection was prepared as described previously from 1-liter bacterial cultures that had been grown in LB medium containing 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol (16McCormick S.P.A. Allan C.M. Taylor J.M. Young S.G. Houdebine L.M. Transgenic Animals: Generation and Use. Harwood Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1997: 273-281Google Scholar). To prepare the DNA for microinjection into fertilized mouse eggs, 10–30 μg of BAC DNA was cleaved withBssHII (which cleaves the BAC vector twice but did not cleave within the insert of any of the BACs). TheBssHII-cleaved DNA was size-fractionated on a 1% low melting point agarose pulsed field gel (SeaPlaque GTG, FMC Bioproducts), and the segment of the gel containing the largeBssHII fragment was excised and digested with gelase (Epicentre Technologies) (17Schedl A.

Nature. 1993; 362: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The DNA solution was then adjusted to 0.5, 2, or 3 ng/μl and microinjected into fertilized mouse eggs (C57BL/6J × SJL for the generation of two lines of BAC(5,22) mice and four lines of BAC(70,1.5) mice; FVB/N for the generation of the other transgenic lines). The concentration of the microinjected DNA had no discernible effect on transgenesis efficiency or on transgene copy number. Transgenic founders were identified by a human apoB-specific radioimmunoassay (5Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To determine transgene copy numbers, 5 or 10 μg of genomic DNA from human leukocytes or tails of mice was digested with EcoRI orHindIII. The digested DNA was separated on 1% agarose gels and blotted onto a nylon membrane. Southern blot analysis was performed with a 32P-labeled 1857-bpBamHI–EcoRI fragment from exon 26 of the human apoB gene (apoB cDNA nucleotides 4650–6507) using Quickhybe (Stratagene). Transgene copy number was assessed by comparing the intensity of the human apoB signal in transgenic mouse genomic DNA with that in human genomic DNA with a phosphor imager (BAS1000, Fujix). In some experiments, transgene copy number was determined with slot-blot analysis of genomic DNA. To determine whether any of the transgenic animals had incorporated only a portion of the BAC transgene, we used PCR to enzymatically amplify BAC vector sequences located at the far 5′ or far 3′ ends of the transgene (2Young S.G. Circulation. 1990; 82: 1574-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In these experiments, a 272-bp fragment of the BAC vector at the 5′ end of the transgene and a 322-bp fragment at the 3′ end of the transgene were amplified using oligonucleotide primers that have been described previously (8Nielsen L.B.

PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Total cellular RNA was isolated from mouse liver and duodenum with the Totally RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). To analyze apoB expression, RNase protection assays were performed with the RPA II ribonuclease protection assay kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two human apoB antisense riboprobes were transcribed from linearized plasmids with T7 RNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim); one probe spanned the first 121 nucleotides of exon 1 of the apoB gene, and the other spanned 220 bp of exon 26 (cDNA nucleotides 4487–6507) (8Nielsen L.B.

A 316-bp mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe was used as an internal control (Ambion, catalogue no. 7431). The riboprobes were mixed with 5–25 μg of total RNA from liver and intestine. Yeast RNA (25–40 μg) was used as a negative control. After the digestion of the RNA/riboprobe mixture, the samples were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gels containing either 7 or 8.3 m urea (Novex, San Diego, CA). Dried gels were exposed to autoradiographic film to visualize protected RNA fragments. We recently isolated a 145-kb BAC spanning the human apoB gene (designated BAC(70,22) because it contains 70 kb of 5′-flanking sequences and 22 kb of 3′ apoB gene-flanking sequences) and showed that it conferred an appropriate pattern of apoB gene expression in both the liver and intestine of transgenic mice (8Nielsen L.B.

To localize the DNA sequences that govern apoB gene expression in the intestine, we have used RARE cleavage reactions to generate a series of BAC clones containing different lengths of 5′- or 3′-flanking sequences. We subcloned most of the EcoRI and HindIII fragments from the 70 kb of sequences upstream from the apoB gene and mapped their locations by quantitative DNA fiber mapping (19Duell T. Nielsen L.B. Jones A. Young S.G. Weier H.-U. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1997; 79: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After determining the DNA sequences flanking various EcoRI orHindIII sites, we generated oligonucleotides and used RARE cleavage reactions to cleave BAC(70,22) at specific HindIII or EcoRI sites within BAC(70,22). An example of a RARE cleavage reaction in which BAC(70,22) is cleaved at oneHindIII site within the BAC vector and at anotherHindIII site 54 kb upstream from the gene is shown in Fig.1. In that example, the 145-kb BAC was cleaved into 129- and 16-kb DNA fragments. The 129-kb DNA fragment was gel-purified, ligated, and transformed into E. coli, generating the modified BAC construct, BAC(54,22) (containing 54 kb 5′ and 22 kb 3′ to the apoB gene). A total of seven different RARE cleavage– modified BACs were generated and used to create human apoB transgenic mice (Fig. 2).Figure 2A, map of the 5′ region of the apoB gene showing the positions of EcoRI or HindIII sites used in RARE cleavage reactions. The positions of these sites were mapped previously by quantitative DNA fiber mapping (19Duell T. Nielsen L.B. Jones A. Young S.G. Weier H.-U. Cytogenet.

Thecolored fiber shows the results of multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of a single DNA molecule (P1–70) that spans from intron 1 of the apoB gene to 70 kb upstream from the gene. The P1–70 DNA fiber was immobilized on glass and visualized (in green) by FISH, using the entire P1–70 DNA as a probe (the probe was labeled with fluorescein). TwoHindIII subclones of P1–70 were labeled with digoxigenin (blue) and biotin (red), respectively. By FISH, these subclones were positioned 36 and 20 kb 5′ of the apoB gene. The orientation of the DNA fiber was revealed by FISH with a digoxigenin-labeled probe spanning a 5.1-kb portion of the P1 bacteriophage vector at the 5′ end of the DNA fiber. In some cases, the orientation of the DNA fiber was also determined with a digoxigenin-labeled probe spanning a 2.1-kb portion of the P1 bacteriophage vector at the 3′ end of the DNA fiber. B andC, ethidium bromide– stained pulsed field gels showingNotI digests of modified BACs generated by RARE cleavage reactions. Each of the BACs contains the entire apoB structural gene, but they differ in the lengths of 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences. The amounts of 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences in the BACs are indicated by their names (e.g. BAC(70,22) contains 70 kb 5′ and 22 kb 3′ to the apoB gene). Each BAC contains two NotI sites that flank the insert, so a NotI digest cuts out the 7-kb BAC vector fragment. Each BAC also contain a NotI site in intron 1 of the apoB gene, 221 bp 3′ to the transcription start site. Thus, digestion of the BACs results in generation of a 7-kb BAC vector fragment and two additional DNA fragments: one fragment representing the apoB 5′ region and the other representing the 43 kb of the structural gene (located downstream to the intron 1 NotI site) and the 3′-flanking sequences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The generation of human apoB transgenic mice from BAC constructs was efficient. Fifteen percent of the offspring (43 of 280 mice screened) were transgenic founders, as judged by the presence of human apoB in the plasma. The transgene copy number in the majority of founders and transgenic lines ranged from one to four (Fig. 3), although it was occasionally less than one (suggesting that a few of the founders were mosaics). Both 5′ and 3′ BAC vector sequences could be amplified from the genomic DNA of each human apoB transgenic founder animal (or F1) (Fig.4). 2In prior experiments, we generated transgenic mice using BAC(120,35) and BAC(70,22) (8Nielsen L.B.

In those experiments, we used two different approaches to analyze whether the BAC transgenes had been incorporated intact into the chromosomal DNA. First, we demonstrated by PCR that BAC vector sequences at either end of the transgene were present in the genomic DNA. Second, we used pulsed field gel electrophoresis of NotI-digested genomic DNA (obtained from hepatocyte plugs), followed by Southern blotting, to directly identify the transgene and verify that it was intact within the genomic DNA. We have also used both approaches to show the “intactness” of an 86-kb P1 bacteriophage transgene and of YAC transgenes (7McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Véniant M. Borén J. Pierotti V. Flynn L.M.

Because our Southern blotting studies have invariably supported the results obtained by PCR, we performed only the PCR analyses in this study. We recognize that these PCR studies cannot provide definitive evidence for transgene intactness (50Young S.G. Lusis A.J. Hammer R.E. Chien K.R. Breslow J.L. Leiden J.M. Rosenberg R.D. Seidman C.

However, in view of our prior experience, the PCR studies suggest that the BAC transgenes were incorporated intact into the genomic DNA.

Here, using scanning site-directed mutagenesis of the chimeric Gαt/Gαi1 α-subunit (Gαt/i), we identified Gαt residues critical for interaction with the effector enzyme, rod cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). Our evidence suggests that residue Ile208 in the switch II region directly interacts with the effector in the active GTP-bound conformation of Gαt. Residues Arg201, Arg204, and Trp207are essential for the conformation-dependent Gαt/effector interaction either via direct contacts with the inhibitory PDE γ-subunit or by forming an effector-competent conformation through the communication network between switch II and the switch III/α3-helix domain of Gαt. Residues His244 and Asn247 in the α3 helix of Gαt are responsible for the conformation-independent effector-specific interaction. Insertion of these residues rendered the Gαt/i chimera with the ability to bind PDE γ-subunit and stimulate PDE activity approaching that of native Gαt. Comparative analysis of the interactions of Gαt/i mutants with PDE and RGS16 revealed two adjacent but distinct interfaces on transducin.

A wealth of biochemical data on G protein interaction with effectors combined with the structural information allowed a detailed mapping of effector surfaces of Gα subunits. The two well characterized G protein/effector systems are Gαs/adenylyl cyclase and Gαt/PDE. Initially, several potential effector binding sites corresponding to the α2 helix (switch II), the α3 helix/α3-β5 loop, and the α4-β6 loop were identified on Gαs using a scanning mutagenesis approach (17Itoh H.

A synthetic peptide, Gαt-(293–314) corresponding to the α4-β6 region was shown to activate PDEin vitro (19Rarick H.M. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E.

Analysis of the interaction of Gαt/Gαi1 chimeras with Pγ strongly implicated the Gαt α3 helix with the α3/β5 loop as a major effector binding region in both basal and activated states (23Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The study concluded that the α3-β5 region provides for the specificity of the Gαt-Pγ interaction. The second composite Pγ binding site is dependent on the active conformation of Gαt and conserved between Gαt and Gαi1 (23Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Two switch regions of Gαt, II and III, have been proposed to participate in the interaction with Pγ (12Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and might therefore form such a conserved domain. The switch III region contains a cluster of acidic residues that represent a speculative target for the polycationic region of Pγ which is known to interact with Gαt. However, mutation of the acidic cluster did not affect the ability of mutant Gαt to stimulate PDE (25Li Q. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21673-21676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Evidence for the involvement of the switch II region of Gαt in interaction with PDE is based on the inability of the Gαt mutant W207F to activate the enzyme (24Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The involvement of the switch II region of Gα subunits in effector recognition has been supported recently by identification of conserved switch II residues in both Gαi and Gαs required for interaction with adenylyl cyclase (26Grishina G. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20619-20626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The role of the switch II domain and the α3-β5 region as major regions for Gα/effector interactions that emerged from biochemical studies has just been confirmed by the crystal structure of Gαs complexed with catalytic domains of adenylyl cyclase (27Tesmer J.J.G.

To define roles of the switch II and α3-β5 regions in the Gαt/PDE interaction and identify specific residues required for the effector binding we carried out scanning mutational analysis of these regions in the Gαt/Gαi1chimera (Gαt/i) containing Gαt switch II and Gαi1 α3-β5. Conserved surface-exposed residues of the Gαt/i switch II region were replaced by Ala residues to delineate conserved conformation-dependent effector interactions. Gαi1 residues that are different between Gαi1 and Gαt within the α3-β5 region of Gαt/i were replaced by corresponding Gαtresidues to identify effector-specifying residues of Gαt.

Mutagenesis of Gαt/i switch II residues was performed using the vector for expression of His6-tagged Gαt/Gαi1 chimera 8 (Gαt/i) as a template for PCR amplifications (23Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J.

The R201A, E203A, R204A, K205A, and K206A substitutions were introduced using 5′-primer 1 and 3′-primers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively, for PCR amplification (see below). The PCR products were digested withNcoI and BamHI and subcloned into theNcoI/BamHI digested pHis6Gαt/i. The 5′-primer 1 and 3′-primers 7 and 8 were used to obtain the PCR products carrying the I208A and W207F mutations, respectively. The PCR products were blunt-ended with Klenow fragment, digested with NcoI, and ligated into pHis6Gαt/i. Prior to the ligation pHis6Gαt/i was digested withBamHI, blunt-ended with mung bean nuclease, and then cut with NcoI. The E212A and E212N/G213D substitutions were introduced by PCR using 5′-primers 9 and 10, respectively, and a 3′-primer 11. The PCR products were cut with BamHI andHindIII and subcloned into theBamHI/HindIII-digested pHis6Gαt/i.

The Lys248-Asp251 → His244-Asn247 (HN) mutant was generated by PCR with primers 14 and 11 using the LHN template. The PCR products were digested with SphI and HindIII and inserted into pHis6Gαt/i. A silent SpeI site was created in pHis6Gαt/i using QuikChange kit (Stratagene). pHis6Gαt/i was a template for PCR reaction using oligonucleotides 16 and 17, and Pfu DNA polymerase. The PCR products were treated with DpnI specific for methylated and hemimethylated DNA and then transformed intoE. coli DH5α. pHis6Gαt/i-SpeI was used for PCR-directed mutagenesis with 5′-primer 1 and 3′-primers 18 and 19 to generate a triple mutant Asn256-Lys257-Trp258 → His252-Arg253-Tyr254 (HRY), and a double mutant Thr260-Asp261 → Ala256-Thr257 (AT), respectively.

The following primers were used to generate mutant Gαt/i (the restriction sites are underlined and mutated codons are in bold):1, ATCACGCCATGGGGGCTGGGGCCAGC; 2,AGCAGTGGATCCA CTT CTT GCG CTC TGA CGC CTG CCC;3, AGCAGTGGATCCA CTT CTT GCG CGC TGA GCG; 4, AGCAGT GGATCCA CTT CTT CGCCTC TGA GCG; 5, AGCAGTGGATCCA CTT CGCGCG CTC TGA GC; 6, AGCAGTGGATCCA CGCCTT GCG CTC TGA GC; 7, CGC CCA CTT CTT GCG CTC TGA GCG CTG; 8, GAT AAA CTT CTT GCG CTC TGA GCG CTG C; 9, AAGT GGATCC AC TGC TTT GCGGGC GTG AC; 10, AAGT GGATCC AC TGC TTT AAC GAT GTG ACT GCC; 11,TCGTCTTCAAGAATCGATAAGCTT; 12, TGAACCGCATGC AT GAA AGC CTG CAC CTG TTC AATAGC ATA TG; 13, TGAACC GCATGC AT GAA AGCCTG AAG CTG TTC GAT AGC; 14, TGAACCGCATGC ATGAA AGT ATG CAC CTG TTC;15, TGAACC GCATGC AT GAA AGC ATG AAG CTG TTC AAT AGC ATA TG; 16, CAAC AAG TGG TTT ACG GACACT AGT ATC ATC CTT TTC CTG AAC; 17, GTT CAG GAA AAG GAT GAT ACT AGT GTC CGT AAA CCA CTT GTTG;18, GAT GAT ACT AGT GTC CGT AAA GTA CCG GTG GTT ACA TAT GC; 19, GAT GAT ACT AGT GGT CGC AAA CCA CTT GTT G. The sequences of all mutants were verified by automated DNA sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. Gαt/i and all mutants were expressed and purified as described previously (23Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were tested in the trypsin protection assay as described previously (34Kleuss C. Raw A.S. Lee E. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9828-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Gαt/i or its mutants (1 μmfinal concentration) were mixed with glutathione-agarose retaining ∼10 μg of GST-RGS16 in 200 μl of 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2(buffer A) containing 30 μm AlCl3 and 10 mm NaF. After incubation for 20 min at 25 °C, the agarose beads were spun down and washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A, and the bound proteins were eluted with a sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Single turnover GTPase activity measurements were carried out in suspensions of uROS membranes (5 μm rhodopsin) reconstituted with Gαt/ior its mutants (2 μm) and Gβγt (1 μm) essentially as described in Refs. 11Natochin M.

The GTPase reaction was initiated by addition of 100 nm [γ-32P]GTP (∼4 × 105 dpm/pmol). The GTPase rate constants were calculated by fitting the experimental data to an exponential function: %GTP hydrolyzed = 100(1 − e −kt ), where k is a rate constant for GTP hydrolysis. Fluorescence assays of interaction between Gαt and PγBC were performed on a F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi) in 1 ml of buffer A essentially as described in Ref. 33Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4188-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. Where indicated, the buffer A contained 30 μm AlCl3 and 10 mmNaF. Fluorescence of PγBC was monitored with excitation at 445 nm and emission at 495 nm. Concentration of PγBC was determined using ε445 = 53,000. Time traces of AlF4−-induced increase in the tryptophan fluorescence of Gαt/i and its mutants (200 nm) were recorded on an AB2 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Spectronic Instruments) in a stirred 1-ml cuvette with excitation at 280 nm and emission at 340 nm. Stock solutions of AlCl3 and NaF were mixed immediately prior to injection of 10 μl of the mixture into a cuvette (final concentrations 30 μmAlCl3 and 10 mm NaF). HoloPDE was extracted from ROS membranes and purified as described earlier (36Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PDE (0.2 nm) was reconstituted with 2 μmGαtGDP or Gαt/i mutants and 2 μm Gβγt in suspensions of urea-washed ROS membranes containing 10 μm rhodopsin. GTPγS (10 μm) was added to the reaction mixture, and PDE activity was measured using [3H]cGMP similarly as described (37Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using IgG as a standard or using calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) in 12% acrylamide gels. Rhodopsin concentrations were measured using the difference in absorbance at 500 nm between “dark” and bleached ROS preparations. Fitting of the experimental data was performed with nonlinear least squares criteria using GraphPad Prizm (version 2) software. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate measurements. Examination of the crystal structures of Gαt, Gαi, and RGS4 was performed using RasMol (version 2.6) software. The following amino acid residues of Gαt switch II that are surface-exposed based on the crystal structure of GαtGTPγS, were selected for the scanning mutagenesis (12Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar): Arg201, Ser202, Arg204, Lys205, Lys206, Trp207, Ile208, His209, Glu212, and Gly213. The surface exposure of Trp207 is limited, but this residue had been implicated in the effector interaction previously (24Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, we included in our analysis a Gαt mutant E203A as its GDP-bound form was reported to be constitutively active toward PDE (40Mittal R. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Science. 1996; 271: 1413-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Conserved Gαt residues Arg201, Arg204, Lys205, Lys206, and Ile208 were replaced by Ala residues. Trp207 was substituted by Phe because the Gαt W207F mutant was properly folded when characterized previously (24Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Nonhomologous substitutions of the Gαt residues involved in the interactions with RGS proteins, S202D and H209Q, have been generated earlier (41Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4300-4303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and utilized in this study. Residues Glu212 and Gly213 of Gαt are conserved between Gαt and Gαi, but Gαs has the Asn-Asp pair instead. Two mutants, E212A and a double mutant E212N/G213D, were made to assess the role of these residues. All mutations of Gαt residues were introduced into Gαt/Gαi1 chimeric protein, Chi8, which is efficiently expressed in E. coli. (23Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Chi8 contains more than 80% of the Gαt sequence including all three Gαt switch regions and is fully competent to interact with activated rhodopsin and Gβγt (23Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 41Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4300-4303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For clarity, we refer to Chi8 as Gαt/i. Expression of Gαt/i and all switch II mutants yielded similar amounts of soluble protein (∼5 mg/liter of culture). To critically evaluate the potential role of mutations within the switch II region, it is essential to confirm that these mutations do not interfere with the ability of Gα to undergo conformational change to the active state. Activation of GαtGDP upon exchange with GTPγS or binding of AlF4− leads to an increase in Trp207 fluorescence and to protection of the switch II region from cleavage with trypsin (24Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 42Fung B.K.-K. Nash C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10503-10510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Time-traces of AlF4−-induced tryptophan fluorescence increase for Gαt, Gαi1, Gαt/i, and the Gαt/i switch II mutants are shown in Fig. 1. The fluorescence changes were ∼40–45% for Gαt, and Gαi1 and ∼35% for Gαt/i, with similar fast kinetics for Gαi1 and Gαt/i, whereas the kinetics for Gαt were slower (Fig. 1). Except for R204A, all Gαt/i mutants had comparable (∼25–40%) enhancement in tryptophan fluorescence upon addition of AlF4−. However, the kinetics of the fluorescence change varied substantially for different mutants from slow, Gαt–like, to fast, analogous to Gαi. The R204A mutant had a very low degree of fluorescent enhancement (<5%). In the crystal structure of GαtGDP·AlF4−(Gαt·AlF4−) side chains of Arg204 and Trp207 contact one another (15Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Perhaps loss of the Arg204/Trp207 contact and the Arg204/Glu241 salt bridge (43Iiri T. Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5656-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in the R204A mutant are responsible for the low fluorescence enhancement. Four mutants, R201A, E203A, R204A, and W207F, have displayed a low degree of proteolytic protection (10% or less) in the trypsin protection assay in the presence of AlF4− (not shown). Similar reduction in trypsin resistance was observed for analogous mutants of Gαt translated in vitro or expressed in COS-7 cells (44Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The most stringent criterion for proper folding of Gαt/i mutants is the ability to hydrolyze GTP. GTPase activity of Gαt/i mutants attests to their ability to interact with Gβγt and rhodopsin to exchange GTP for GDP and to undergo activation-inactivation conformational changes. All tested Gαt/i switch II mutants had basal GTPase rates ranging from 0.010 s−1 to 0.025 s−1, which are comparable to those of Gαt/i (0.015 s−1) (Table I) and native Gαt(0.019 s−1) measured under similar conditions (11Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17444-17449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Several of the mutated residues, Arg201, Glu203, Lys206, Trp207, and His209, contact Gβγt (45Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), which may account for some variability in observed GTPase rates. A somewhat lower GTPase rate for the E203A mutant is consistent with the catalytic properties of the Gαi E207A mutant (34Kleuss C. Raw A.S. Lee E. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9828-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Appropriate GTPase activities of R201A, E203A, R204A, and W207F mutants indicate that reduced trypsin protection of these mutants may result from the differences in primary structures rather than distortion of the switch II conformation. Side chains of Gαt Arg201, Arg204, and Trp207 may be involved in preventing tryptic cleavage of Gαt·AlF4− by forming ordered interactions with the switch III/α3 region (13Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4188-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Binding of GαtGTPγS or Gαt·AlF4− to PγBC causes ∼7-fold maximal increase in the probe fluorescence. Using this assay, affinities of GαtGTPγS or Gαt·AlF4− for PγBC are similar (Kd values 2–4 nm), whereas GαtGDP affinity for PγBC drops by ∼20-fold to aKd of 75 nm (11Natochin M. Granovsky A.E.

https://openalex.org/W1964775821,"SecA is found in the cytosol and bound to the plasma membrane of Escherichia coli. Binding occurs either with high affinity at SecYEG or with low affinity to lipid. Domains of 65 and 30 kDa of SecYEG-bound SecA insert into the membrane upon interaction with preprotein and ATP. Azide blocks preprotein translocation, in vivo and in vitro, through interacting with SecA and preventing SecA deinsertion. This provides a measure of the translocation relevance of each form of SecA membrane association. We now report that azide acts exclusively on SecA that is cycling at SecYEG and has no effect on SecA lipid associations. SecA molecules recovered with sucrose gradient-purified inner membrane vesicles (“endogenous” SecA) support translocation at the same rate as “added” SecA molecules bound at SecYEG. Both endogenous and added SecA yield the same proteolytic fragments, which are distinct from those obtained from SecA once it has inserted into membranes at SecYEG or from SecA at lipidic sites. Endogenous and added SecA differ, however, in their resistance to urea extraction. The translocation supported by either endogenous or added SecA is blocked by azide or by antibody to SecY.

We conclude that SecA functions in preprotein translocation only through cycling at SecYEG. Protein export across the plasma membrane of Escherichia coli is catalyzed by preprotein translocase, composed of the integral SecYEGDFyajC complex and the peripheral dimeric SecA ATPase (1Duong F. Eichler J. Price A. Leonard M.R. Wickner W. Cell. 1997; 91: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). SecA exchanges between the cytosol, where it is a translational repressor (2Dolan K.M. Oliver D. J. Biol.

Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In the latter state, it is activated for binding preprotein through SecA recognition of both the leader and mature preprotein domains and, for certain preproteins, through the binding affinity of SecA for the SecB chaperone (3Hartl F.-U.

Upon association with SecYEG, preprotein, and acidic phospholipid, SecA binds and hydrolyzes ATP (6Douville K. Price A. Eichler J. Economou A. Wickner W. J. Biol.

ATP binding drives a dramatic conformational change in SecA in which 65- and 30-kDa domains of SecA insert into the membrane and become accessible from its periplasmic face (7Economou A. Wickner W.

Inserted SecA is largely shielded from the membrane phase but is in close contact with the transiting polypeptide chain (9Joly J.C. Wickner W.

Insertion of SecA causes movement of a segment of the preprotein across the membrane (11Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4871-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). SecA then hydrolyzes ATP, releases from the preprotein, deinserts, and even exchanges with soluble SecA molecules (12Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The transmembrane preprotein, when not bound by SecA, can be driven forward by the membrane electrochemical potential (11Duong F. Wickner W.

Indeed, preproteins have been shown to translocate in a stepwise fashion (14van der Wolk J.P.W. de Wit J.G. Driessen A.J.M.

In addition to its association with SecYEG, SecA can also bind acidic phospholipids and insert into the bilayer (17Breukink E. Demel R.A. de Korte-Kool G. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 18Ulbrandt N.D. London E. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15184-15192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acidic phospholipid association activates ATP hydrolysis by SecA and, in the presence of ATP, causes 38-, 28-, and 21-kDa domains to become resistant to proteolysis (8Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 90: 620-624Google Scholar). However, SecA alone does not promote preprotein translocation across a pure lipid bilayer, and SecYEG is also required (6Douville K.

Finally, the conformations, associations, and specific translocation activity of the endogenous SecA that copurifies with inner membrane vesicles have not been defined. We now report studies that address these issues. The formation of protease-resistant 65- and 30-kDa SecA domains occurs far more readily in intact membranes, where resistance is seen over a wide range of protease concentrations (7Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 8Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 90: 620-624Google Scholar), than in mixed micellar solution with the same concentration of SecYEG, where these domains are digestion intermediates during proteolysis. Furthermore, sodium azide (NaN3), a translocation inhibitor (14van der Wolk J.P.W. de Wit J.G. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 24Oliver D.B.

Lipid-associated SecA is largely removed during sedimentation through sucrose, suggesting that the SecA that is endogenous to purified IMVs 1The abbreviations used are: IMVinner membrane vesicleAMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphateBSAbovine serum albuminHis6hexahistidineβ-octyl glucosiden-octyl-β-d-glucopyranosideproOmpAprecursor of outer membrane protein APAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: IMVinner membrane vesicleAMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphateBSAbovine serum albuminHis6hexahistidineβ-octyl glucosiden-octyl-β-d-glucopyranosideproOmpAprecursor of outer membrane protein APAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is associated with SecYEG. This is confirmed by observations that endogenous SecA and added SecA (bound with high affinity at SecYEG) yield similar proteolytic patterns, distinct from that of SecYEG-inserted or lipid-bound forms of SecA.

Cells were harvested (5,000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C), resuspended in an equal weight of 10% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. IMVs were prepared as described previously (6Douville K. Price A. Eichler J. Economou A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20106-20111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Some membrane preparations were treated with 6 m urea (30 min, 0 °C) to remove and inactivate endogenous SecA (25Cunningham K. Lill R. Crooke E. Rice M. Moore K. Wickner W. Oliver D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Peripherally bound SecA molecules were removed from other IMV preparations by centrifugation through 100 μl of buffer S (0.2m sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0; 73,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C, in a TL120.2 rotor; Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge). Ten microliters of 10× buffer B (500 mmKCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 500 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9), 3 μg of SecB, water, an ATP regenerating system (1 μg of creatine kinase and phosphocreatine to 10 mm), 10 μl of [35S]SecA (7,000 cpm/μl), 10 μg of IMVs, 1 μl of proOmpA (1.5 mg/ml in urea buffer (6 m urea, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9)), and either 2 mm ATP or 2 mm AMP-PNP were added in sequence to a final volume of 0.1 ml. ProOmpA, creatine kinase, and phosphocreatine were omitted when AMP-PNP was added in place of ATP. Where indicated, IMVs were first solubilized in 20% glycerol, 3.75 mg/ml E. coli phospholipids, and 1.25% β-octyl glucoside for 30 min on ice (28Brundage L. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 62: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and then added to the above mixture. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, or at 4 °C for 30 min when AMP-PNP served as the nucleotide. NaN3 (20 mm) was either included in the initial reaction mixture or was added after 20 min. Reactions were then transferred to ice and digested with trypsin (0.1–10 mg/ml) for 15 min. For some samples, either 1% Triton X-100 or 1.25% β-octyl glucoside was added immediately prior to trypsinolysis. Trypsinolysis was terminated by the addition of 34 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were held at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C, microcentrifuge). Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold acetone, collected by centrifugation, dissolved in sample buffer, and examined by SDS-PAGE (6Douville K. Price A. Eichler J. Economou A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20106-20111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). IMVs (10 μg in buffer B, in some cases preincubated for 30 min on ice with 3 μg of SecA, 20 μg of BSA in a volume of 100 μl) were centrifuged through 100 μl of buffer S and resuspended in 96.5 μl of buffer B with 4 μg of SecB, 20 μg of BSA, 2 mm ATP, and an ATP regenerating system (as above). Where indicated, either 20 mm NaN3, 2 μl of anti-SecY COOH-terminal antiserum or antiserum together with the peptide used for antibody induction (2 mg/ml) was added for a 15-min preincubation on ice. Either chemical (3.5 μl, 0.9 mg/ml, 8.75 × 104 cpm, in urea buffer) or radiochemical amounts of 125I-proOmpA (1.25 × 105 cpm) were added to these mixtures. Translocation was initiated upon transfer to 37 °C and terminated by transfer to ice. Samples were digested with 10 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) for 15 min. Proteolysis was terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 15%. Samples were then processed for SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) with a BSA standard. SDS-PAGE used 15% gels (6Douville K. Price A. Eichler J. Economou A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20106-20111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) using a Genie electrophoretic blotter (Idea Scientific, Minneapolis, MN) at 250 milliamps for 1.25 h and probed using an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-SecA preparation. Antibody binding was detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Densitometry was performed using a Silverscan III scanner (LaCie Ltd., Beaverton, OR) and IPLabH software. SecA has two folded domains, a 65-kDa NH2-terminal domain that includes nucleotide binding domain I as well as a 30-kDa, more COOH-terminal domain (8Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 90: 620-624Google Scholar, 12Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 19Price A. Economou A. Duong F. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31580-31584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When bound at SecYEG, SecA undergoes a conformational change during translocation, which renders these 65- and 30-kDa domains resistant to protease (7Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 8Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 90: 620-624Google Scholar, 11Duong F. Wickner W.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This protease resistance requires either preprotein, ATP, and 37 °C (Fig.1 A, lane 2, arrows) or AMP-PNP (a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP) (lane 3). Protease resistance is lost when the membrane permeability barrier is disrupted by either freeze/thaw or sonication in the presence of protease (but not when such treatments were followed by the addition of protease to the resealed membrane vesicles; Refs. 7Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar and 8Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 90: 620-624Google Scholar), by the addition of Triton X-100 (7Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 8Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 90: 620-624Google Scholar), or by β-octyl glucoside (Fig. 1 A,lanes 4 and 5). When membranes were solubilized in β-octyl glucoside, glycerol, and E. coliphospholipids prior to the addition to translocation reactions (conditions that solubilize the intact, native SecYEG heterotrimer (6Douville K.

Driessen A.J.M. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 62: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar)) protease-resistant SecA 65- and 30-kDa fragments were not formed (lanes 6 and 7). It has been recently reported that a protease-resistant, 125I-labeled 30-kDa fragment of SecA can be recovered from incubations of SecA, purified SecYEG in detergent solution, and AMP-PNP at 4 °C (21van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Translocation reactions were therefore performed in the presence of AMP-PNP, a 21-fold higher concentration of purified SecYEG in mixed micellar solution, and radiolabeled SecA. Since there is an almost exclusive COOH-terminal distribution of radioiodine in125I-SecA, we employed metabolically labeled [35S]SecA to label all domains of SecA (8Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 90: 620-624Google Scholar). As reported (21van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), a protease-resistant SecA 30-kDa fragment (lane 8; open arrow) was generated, although far less was seen in reactions lacking either nucleotide or SecYEG (lanes 9 and 10, respectively). In these experiments, there were numerous additional protease-resistant SecA fragments (lanes 8 and 9). The patterns obtained from digestion of SecA with solubilized SecYEG are reminiscent of the partial tryptic digestions of SecA in solution (8Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 90: 620-624Google Scholar,19Price A. Economou A. Duong F. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31580-31584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Translocation reactions were therefore performed with SecA and purified SecYEG in mixed micellar solution and digested with trypsin (Fig. 1 B). Although the SecA 65- and 30-kDa fragments formed in the presence of intact IMVs, ATP and physiological temperature remained intact over a wide range of added protease concentrations (7Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar,8Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 90: 620-624Google Scholar), SecA was completely degraded by 5 mg/ml trypsin in the presence of purified SecYEG (Fig. 1 B). Thus, while SecA in solution can interact with preprotein, ATP (20Shinkai A. Mei L.H. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5827-5833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or purified SecYEG in detergent solution (21van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), undergoing conformational changes that confer altered protease susceptibility, solubilized SecYEG does not mediate true protection of the SecA 65- and 30-kDa domains from proteolysis. The simplest explanation for the translocation-related protease protection of the SecA 65- and 30-kDa fragments is the insertion of these domains into the membrane. NaN3 blocks preprotein translocation both in vivo and in vitro (24Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). NaN3 also dramatically increases the level of the protease-inaccessible SecA COOH-terminal 30-kDa domain under translocation conditions (14van der Wolk J.P.W. de Wit J.G. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Proteolytic treatment of complete translocation reactions containing [35S]SecA, ATP, and proOmpA revealed protease-protection of SecA 65- and 30-kDa fragments (Fig. 2, lane 1). The levels of these protease-protected SecA fragments were enhanced by NaN3 (lane 4), while an even larger increase in these SecA fragments was observed when NaN3 was added after preprotein translocation and the SecA membrane insertion/deinsertion cycle was initiated by ATP (lane 8). Far less protease protection of SecA was observed with NaN3 in the absence of preprotein or ATP (lanes 5 and 9 and lanes 6 and10, respectively). [35S]SecA not only reveals the protease-protected SecA N-terminal 65-kDa domain but also protease-resistant fragments from lipid-associated SecA (8Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 90: 620-624Google Scholar). NaN3 had no effect on the level of SecA fragments derived from lipid-associated SecA molecules (compare the bands marked by asterisks in lanes 1, 4, and 8), and ATP was still required (8Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 90: 620-624Google Scholar) for the generation of these fragments (comparelanes 1, 4, and 8 withlanes 3, 6, 7, and10). NaN3 acts exclusively on the deinsertion step of the SecA membrane insertion/deinsertion cycle at SecYEG (12Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 21van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, azide provides a direct demonstration that SecA membrane cycling is involved in physiological translocation as well as the means for critical analysis of the roles of each form of membrane-bound SecA in translocation (see below). Tryptic digestion of translocation reactions containing IMVs, ATP, and proOmpA results in the appearance of SecA fragments (8Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 90: 620-624Google Scholar) of 98, 38, and 21 kDa derived from lipid-bound SecA (Fig.3, lane 1,asterisks) in addition to translocation-related 65- and 30-kDa fragments (Fig. 3, lane 1,filled and open arrows). Only the 98-kDa band was detected in reactions without ATP (lane 2), whereas only the 38- and 21-kDa fragments were detected in reactions lacking proOmpA (lane 3). Moreover, the 38- and 21-kDa fragments do not require SecYEG, since they can be generated in the presence of ATP and liposomes (8Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 90: 620-624Google Scholar). To explore the association of this lipid-bound SecA with the membrane, translocation reactions with [35S]SecA were subjected to centrifugation through sucrose prior to trypsinolysis. Scatchard analysis has shown that low affinity, lipid-bound SecA molecules are removed by such treatment (3Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Membrane sedimentation (lanes 4–6) had little effect on the yield of 65- and 30-kDa tryptic SecA fragments, as compared with samples not sedimented through sucrose (compare lanes 1 and 4). In contrast, substantially decreased levels of the 21- and 38-kDa fragments, each derived from lipid-associated SecA, were apparent (compare lanes 3 and 6). Thus, lipid-associated SecA is bound with lower affinity and is readily removed by sedimentation, while translocase-inserted SecA remains firmly bound. In addition to added SecA bound to the membrane either with high affinity at SecYEG or with low affinity at lipid, there is additional endogenous membrane-bound SecA (22Chen X. Xu H. Tai P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29698-29706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Qian L. Oliver D.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23239-23246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To determine the specific activity for translocation of the endogenous SecA, the amount of SecA in either native or urea-treated IMVs from SecYEG-overexpressing cells was quantitated by immunoblot (Fig.4 A). Prior to urea treatment, 8 μg of SecA were associated with the IMVs per mg of IMV protein, while 7.2 μg of SecA remained after urea. Centrifugation though sucrose to remove low affinity bound SecA molecules decreased the SecA associated with native IMVs to 6.5 μg/mg of IMV protein, while no further decrease in the SecA content of urea-treated IMVs was observed after sedimentation through sucrose. These values are in good agreement with earlier estimates of the amount of “integral” SecA in IMVs (22Chen X. Xu H. Tai P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29698-29706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the membranes are centrifuged over sucrose gradients during IMV preparation (6Douville K. Price A. Eichler J. Economou A. Wickner W. J. Biol.

Trypanosoma cruzi, a hemoflagellate parasite, is the causative agent of American trypanosomiasis or Chagas' disease (1Brener Z.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1973; 27: 347-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). This disease is prevalent throughout most of Central and South America, and no effective chemotherapeutic agent or immunoprophylactic vaccine against the parasite is available. Lines of investigation directed toward identifying promising targets for chemotherapeutic or immunoprophylactic intervention have focused on structures or cellular processes that are unique to the parasite. One such unique structure present in T. cruzi and almost all of the other members of the order Kinetoplastida is the paraflagellar or paraxial rod.

The major PFR proteins have been most extensively studied in the parasitic hemoflagellates T. cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, Leishmania mexicana, and Leishmania amazonensis (TableI). In these organisms, the major PFR proteins migrate in two bands on SDS-PAGE with electrophoretic mobilities of about 70–75 and 68–72 kDa and appear to be present in approximately equimolar amounts. The complexity of the proteins present in these two bands has been difficult to assess because classical biochemical techniques have not been highly successful in separating these proteins (6Schlaeppi K.

Additionally, most polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against these proteins identify both bands, suggesting that the proteins present in these bands share common epitopes (4Saborio J.L.

This issue was apparently resolved by studies in T. bruceiwhere genes coding for proteins present in both the slower and faster migrating PFR bands have been isolated and designated pfr A and pfr C, respectively (6Schlaeppi K. Deflorin J. Seebeck T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1695-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Deflorin J. Rudolf M. Seebeck T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28745-28751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conceptual proteins encoded by these genes share high aa sequence similarity, thus supporting the concept that the PFR proteins are closely related. The homologues of pfr A have been isolated and characterized in both T. cruzi and L. mexicana and have been designated par 2 and pfr 2, respectively (7Beard C.A. Saborio J.L. Tewari D. Krieglstein K.G. Henschen A.H. Manning J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21656-21662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Moore L.L. Santrich C. LeBowitz J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by these genes all share high aa sequence similarity. In contrast, we have reported that proteins present in the slower and faster migrating PFR bands could be partially separated by chromatographic techniques, and that amino acid sequence analysis of the proteins present in these two bands indicates the presence of two distinct polypeptides that share no apparent sequence similarity (7Beard C.A. Saborio J.L. Tewari D. Krieglstein K.G. Henschen A.H. Manning J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21656-21662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein in the slower migrating band was designated PAR 1, and that in the faster migrating band was designated PAR 2. The amino acids of peptides derived from the protein preparations enriched in PAR 2 were identified in the protein sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the par 2 gene. However, the aa sequences of several peptides present in the preparations enriched in PAR 1 could not be found in the PAR 2 preparations, suggesting the presence of a polypeptide in the slower migrating band that is distinct from PAR 2. Subsequent review of the PFR C sequence showed that only one of the PAR 1 peptides showed high sequence similarity with a region of PFR C, suggesting that a homologue of pfr C may be present inT. cruzi. However, the issue of the origin of the remaining putative PAR 1 polypeptides remained unresolved. Here, we report the isolation and partial characterization of the gene that encodes the PAR 1 protein. We also report the isolation of the T. cruzihomologue of pfr C, as well as the isolation of a gene, designated par 4, that encodes a previously unidentified polypeptide present in the faster migrating PFR protein band. These results show that the two PFR protein bands contain four distinct proteins, only two of which show high aa sequence similarity. These results also provide an explanation of why these four proteins are difficult to separate by common biochemical techniques and why some antibodies generated against the PFR proteins recognize only one of the two electrophoretic bands, while others recognize both. T. cruzi Esmeraldo clone 3 strain was obtained from James Dvorak, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. Growth and maintenance of epimastigotes and tissue culture derived trypomastigotes are as described previously (7Beard C.A. Saborio J.L. Tewari D. Krieglstein K.G. Henschen A.H. Manning J.E. J. Biol.

For analysis of whole cell lysates, parasites were harvested from culture media by centrifugation, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized by direct addition of boiling 2% SDS with boiling continued for 5 min. These and all other samples were separated by one-dimensional PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose by methods previously described (4Saborio J.L. Hernandez J.M. Narayanswami S. Wrightsman R.A.

Filters probed with mouse sera or monoclonal antibodies were reacted with peroxidase-linked anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) and detected with the ECL system (DuPont) An epimastigote poly(A)+ RNA cDNA library was constructed in the phage λ ZAP Express vector using a cDNA synthesis system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). A genomic DNA library was constructed in the λ ZAP Express vector using epimastigote nuclear DNA as described (13Fouts D.L. Ruef B.J. Ridley P.T. Wrightsman R.A. Peterson D.S. Manning J.E. Mol.

The λ genomic DNA library was probed with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide consisting of nucleotides 1011–1031 (5′-CGACCGCAGATCTGCTGTGAG-3′) of the T. cruzi DNA insert of pTccPar1b (accession no. AF047023). The inserts present in phages showing positive hybridization were characterized by restriction enzyme mapping and direct nucleotide sequence analysis. DNA sequence information was obtained by use of the dideoxy chain-termination method (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Fragments to be sequenced were sequenced directly from the excised pBK-CMV phagemid. Oligonucleotide sequencing primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA. A preparation of purified PFR proteins was injected into BALB/cByJ mice, and the spleens from animals with a positive reaction were used to obtain antibody-producing mouse hybridomas as described previously (15Wrightsman R.A.

Fifteen hybridoma cell lines that produced antibodies against PFR proteins were initially selected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, of these, seven recloned positive. Monoclonal antibodies were isolated from culture supernatants by affinity chromatography on Sepharose-Protein G columns as described previously (15Wrightsman R.A. Leon W. Manning J.E. Infect.

Plasmid DNA was isolated by the StratacleanTM/Boiling miniprep protocol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, Ca). DNA restriction fragments were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dNTP using the Ambion random prime kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) as recommended by the manufacturer. Synthetic oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA, Southern transfer, prehybridization, hybridization, and filter washing were performed as described (17Fouts D.L. Manning J.E. Fox G.M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 7053-7064Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. Gels were 1% agarose, and the washing temperature was 42 °C following hybridization with the end-labeled oligonucleotide. RNA was electrophoresed in a formaldehyde gel, blotted to nylon, cross-linked by UV irradiation, prehybridized, hybridized, and washed as described (19Rozed C.E. Davidson N. Cell. 1983; 32: 23-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Northern and Southern blots were imaged using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 435SI. Analysis of the digital images was conducted using the program ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). All restriction enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and used as recommended. Indirect immunofluorescence with preparations of air-dried epimastigotes and trypomastigotes, fixed with acetone at room temperature, was done using FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse as the secondary antibody as described previously (20Saborio J.L.

The production of recombinant PAR 2 in the baculovirus expression system was accomplished as described elsewhere (21Wrightsman R.A. Dawson B.D. Fouts D.L. Manning J.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3148-3154PubMed Google Scholar). For production of PAR 1, the entire PAR 1 coding region was expressed in the baculovirus expression system by cloning a 1.8-kb region of pTcgPar1a (GenBank accession no. AF004380) containing nucleotides 8–1824 into the shuttle vector pVL1393. The fragment was inserted into the BamHI/XbaI sites in the polylinker of the shuttle vector by generating a BamHI restriction enzyme site at nucleotides 7–12 and an XbaI restriction enzyme site at nucleotides 1824–1829 by using the following oligonucleotides as primers for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the par 1 gene: 5′-GAAATAGGATCCGACAATGGCGGTTTAC-3′ representing nucleotides 1–28 and 5′-ATTTCCTTCTAGAGTACACAC-3′ representing nucleotides 1816–1836 ofpar 1. For production of PAR 3 and PAR 4 in the baculovirus expression system, the entire T. cruzi cDNA inserts in pTccPar3a and pTccPar4b were excised from the recombinant phagemid DNAs with restriction enzymes BamHI and NotI, which cleave only within the polylinker sites of the phagemid vector. The excised inserts were cloned directly into theBamHI/NotI sites in the polylinker of the shuttle vector pVL1393. Production of recombinant baculovirus, production of recombinant proteins, and protein purification were as described elsewhere (21Wrightsman R.A. Dawson B.D. Fouts D.L. Manning J.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3148-3154PubMed Google Scholar). PFR proteins were purified as described previously (4Saborio J.L. Hernandez J.M. Narayanswami S. Wrightsman R.A. Palmer E. Manning J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4071-4075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1011 Peru strain epimastigotes were harvested by centrifugation, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 0.1 m Tricine (pH 8.5) containing 1% Nonidet P-40. The pellet was extracted with high salt buffer consisting of 0.1m Tricine (pH 8.5), 1 m NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100, using sonication. This crude flagellar pellet was successively extracted with 2.0 and 6.0 m urea in 10 mmTricine (pH 8.5). The resulting supernatant contains approximately 50% PFR and 50% tubulin. The PFR proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a Bio-Rad Prep Cell model 491. Fractions containing the PFR proteins were extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, concentrated by centrifugation in a Centricon concentrator (Amicon, Beverley, MA) and sterilized by 0.22-μm filtration. The amino acid sequence of several peptides generated by CNBr cleavage of a protein(s) preparation highly enriched for protein(s) present in the slower migrating band of the PFR protein doublet have been reported (7Beard C.A. Saborio J.L. Tewari D. Krieglstein K.G. Henschen A.H. Manning J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21656-21662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein that was the putative origin of these peptides was designated PAR 1. In order to identify the gene that might encode PAR 1, one of these peptides, peptide 4, was synthesized, coupled to ovalbumin, and used as an antigen for generating peptide-specific antisera in mice. As shown in Fig. 1, sera (pcAbPep4) from mice immunized with the peptide ovalbumin conjugate contain antibodies that recognize the slower migrating protein band but do not recognize the faster migrating band, consistent with the belief that PAR 1 is present only in the slower migrating PFR band. To isolate a cDNA fragment that contains at least a portion of thepar 1 gene, an epimastigote cDNA expression library was constructed in λ ZAP and screened with polyclonal mouse serum directed against proteins present in both the slower and faster protein bands (7Beard C.A. Saborio J.L. Tewari D. Krieglstein K.G. Henschen A.H. Manning J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21656-21662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 200,000 recombinant phage were screened, and 18 primary positive plaques were identified. Two plaques, designated λTccPar1a and λTccPar1b, rescreened positive with pcAbPep4. The phagemids containing the T. cruzi DNA inserts were excised for further analysis. Restriction enzyme mapping analysis of the cDNA inserts in these two phagemids, designated pTccPar1a and pTccPar1b, reveal fragments of 1.0 and 1.9 kb, respectively. The complete nucleotide sequence of each of these DNA inserts was determined. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed that pTccPar1a is entirely contained within pTccPar1b, that both share a common open reading frame and that both contain the peptide 4 coding region. However, since the open reading frame in the largest cDNA insert, pTccPar1b, terminates in the 5′ synthetic EcoRI linker, it is likely that neither cDNA insert contains the entire coding region of the PAR 1 protein. Since T. cruzi genes lack intron sequences, it seemed reasonable that the complete sequence of the par 1 gene could be obtained by analysis of genomic DNA. To obtain genomic DNA fragments that putatively contained the par 1 gene, an oligonucleotide whose sequence is present in pTccPar1b, but is not found in the previously identified PFR genes, was synthesized, radiolabeled, and used as a probe to screen a λ recombinant genomic DNA library. Three recombinant phage rescreened positive following plaque purification. The phagemids in each of the three λ phage were excised, a partial restriction enzyme map of eachT. cruzi DNA insert was generated (data not shown), and those DNA fragments that contained sequences complementary to the cDNA insert in pTccPar1b were determined by Southern blot analysis. A partial nucleotide sequence of one of the four DNA inserts, pTcgPar1a, was determined. Analysis of the DNA sequence of the recombinant phagemids pTccPar1a, pTccPar1b, and pTcgPar1a shows that they encode part or all of the PAR 1 protein. The complete nucleotide sequence of the T. cruzi DNA insert in pTccPar1a and pTccPar1b are present in pTcgPar1a. With the exception of the poly(A) sequences on the 3′ terminus of the cDNA inserts, no nucleotide sequence heterogeneity was observed in an alignment of the 3 sequences (data not shown). The predicted amino acid sequence of the PAR 1 protein encoded by pTcgPar1a is shown in Fig. 2. This conceptual translation product has a predictedMr of 68,173, consistent with the observedMr of 70,000, and it contains the amino acid sequences of six of the seven polypeptides identified by direct amino acid analysis of protein in the slower migrating PFR protein band (7Beard C.A.

Additionally, expression of this gene in the baculovirus system generates a polypeptide of approximately 70 kDa that is recognized on Western blots by pcAbPep4 (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the peptide sequence that previously was identified in the slower migrating PFR band (Ref. 7Beard C.A. Saborio J.L. Tewari D. Krieglstein K.G. Henschen A.H. Manning J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21656-21662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; peptide 14) that is not present in either PAR 1 or PAR 2 is found in the predicted aa sequence of the PFR C protein of T. brucei (11Deflorin J. Rudolf M. Seebeck T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28745-28751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that a gene similar to the pfr C gene of T. brucei may be present in the genome of T. cruzi. In an attempt to isolate the putative T. cruzi homologue of the pfr C gene of T. brucei, the 18 recombinant phage identified in the screen of the T. cruzi cDNA library with anti-PFR mouse serum were rescreened with monoclonal antibody mAbPAR2, which is monospecific for PAR 2 (4Saborio J.L. Hernandez J.M. Narayanswami S. Wrightsman R.A. Palmer E. Manning J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4071-4075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thirteen phage rescreened positive, indicating they likely encoded PAR 2, while five phage rescreened negative. The phagemid in each of the five phage was excised and the nucleotide sequence of the T. cruzi DNA insert in each was determined. Of the five phagemids, two were identified as the previously isolated pTccPar1a and pTccPar1b and three contained nucleotide sequences not present in par 1. These three phagemids were designated pTccPar3a, pTccPar3b, and pTccPar3c. The length of the T. cruzi DNA insert in each, as determined by direct nucleotide sequence analysis, was 1980, 1962, and 1976 bp, respectively (accession nos. AF005194, AF005195, and AF005193, respectively). Each T. cruzi DNA insert contains a single long open reading frame of 590 aa that encodes a conceptual protein ofMr 68,753 and con"

Steric exclusion of water molecule-binding sites by the 5-methyl group of thymine drives the adoption of alternative water-mediated contacts with ATversus GC flanks. This structure provides a rare example of structural adaptability in the recognition of different DNA sequences by a protein and suggests preferred strategies for the expansion of target site specificity by EcoRV. Restriction endonucleases function in all prokaryotes as components of defensive restriction-modification systems and are superb models for the study of protein-DNA interactions owing to their exceptionally high sequence specificities. The type II restriction-modification systems are the best studied from a structure-function perspective and are composed of a homodimeric endonuclease and monomeric methylase (1Roberts R.J. Halford S.E. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 35-88Google Scholar, 2Pingoud A. Jeltsch A. Eur. J.

Nature. 1997; 388: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). With the exception of Cfr10I and EcoRI, the enzymes have been solved in both the absence and presence of DNA. The structures reveal extensive complementarity at the protein-DNA interfaces, which appears to explain the high specificities of up to 106-fold in cleavage rate constants for the specific sites (Ref. 12Jen-Jacobson L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 305-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar and references therein). An additional, less appreciated, contribution to specificity may also arise from DNA-induced conformational changes in the enzymes. EcoRV has recently emerged as the best studied of the restriction endonucleases from both structural and mechanistic standpoints. This enzyme cleaves the sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ at the center TA step in a blunt-ended fashion, generating 5′-phosphate groups (13Schildkraut I. Banner C.D.B. Rhodes C.S. Parekh S. Gene ( Amst .). 1984; 27: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The cocrystal structure of the EcoRV-DNA complex reveals a tight network of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic and van der Waals contacts at the protein-DNA interface over the entire hexameric DNA site (4Winkler F.K. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R. Martin P.D. Petratos K. Wilson K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1781-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Specificity at the outer two base pairs of each half-site is determined by hydrogen bonding with discriminating base functional groups in the major groove. At the center step the DNA is bent sharply by 50° into the major groove, so that protein cannot penetrate to contact the hydrogen bonding moieties. Indirect readout is thus implicated in specificity at this position. This may originate in part from differences in the energetic cost of partially unstacking the center TA step relative to CG or GC steps (14Horton N.C. Perona J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whereas the specificity of EcoRV in vivo is limited to the hexamer target site GATATC, the crystal structures show that the enzyme also contacts 2–3 base pairs of DNA to either side of this site (4Winkler F.K. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R. Martin P.D. Petratos K. Wilson K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1781-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). These contacts with flanking DNA in five cocrystal structures with 5′-AAAGATATCTT at 2.0–2.1-Å resolution (5Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 6Perona J.J. Martin A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Horton N.C. Perona J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and with the decamer 5′-GGGATATCCC at 3.0 Å, are primarily with the sugar-phosphate backbone (4Winkler F.K. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R. Martin P.D. Petratos K. Wilson K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1781-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 5Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that the enzyme is sensitive to perturbation of these contacts. Replacement of phosphate groups with phosphorothioates showed thatSp and Rp substitutions directly 3′ to GATATC reduceVmax/Km toward a dodecamer substrate by 4- and 50-fold, respectively (15Thorogood H. Grasby J.A. Connolly B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8855-8862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of four amino acids contacting flanking phosphate groups reduceskcat/Km toward a 20-mer substrate containing GATATC (16Wenz C. Jeltsch A. Pingoud A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5565-5573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The most striking effect occurs with the mutant R226A within the C-terminal subdomain, which lowers activity by nearly 103-fold relative to the wild-type enzyme. These studies show that the distal enzyme-DNA contacts outside the target site significantly increase the catalytic rate, perhaps by helping to orchestrate the mutual conformational changes in the enzyme and DNA which occur en route to the transition state. The biological role of EcoRV (and other type II enzymes) requires that all flanking sequences permit target site cleavage with high catalytic efficiency. However, this does not preclude the existence of some sequence preference. Indeed, 10- and 500-fold variations in binding constants with different flanks have been found in in vitrostudies of EcoRV and EcoRI, respectively (17Engler L.E. Welch K.K. Jen-Jacobson L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,18Jen-Jacobson L. Biopolymers. 1997; 44: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Additionally, within the context of cleavage of the “star” site GTTATC, EcoRV prefers 5′-G and 3′-C on either side of the target (19Taylor J.D. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6198-6207Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20Taylor J.D. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These flanking sequence selectivities are modest compared with the 106-fold and greater specificitiesversus base substitutions internal to the GATATC site, but they nonetheless suggest that target site expansion may be feasible. This is a prospect of considerable practical importance for the development of new restriction enzymes specific for 8–10 base recognition sites. Attempts to alter the substrate specificity of the EcoRI andEcoRV restriction endonucleases have not been successful thus far (21Heitman J. Model P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3369-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Flores H. Osuna J. Heitman J. Soberon X.

Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a need for further basic studies. WhereasEcoRV is the best studied enzyme of the class, its structure bound to DNA with GC flanks is determined at only 3.0 Å resolution (4Winkler F.K. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R. Martin P.D. Petratos K. Wilson K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1781-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). This is insufficient for describing detailed protein-DNA interactions, particularly those involving solvent molecules. Moreover, large differences in DNA and protein conformation, most probably arising from altered crystal packing contacts, have been noted in the structures of the enzyme bound to specific DNA sites possessing ATversus GC flanks (4Winkler F.K. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R. Martin P.D. Petratos K. Wilson K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1781-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 5Kostrewa D.

Therefore, to characterize the structural aspects of the flanking interactions better, we have determined a new cocrystal structure of EcoRV bound to 5′-CGGGATATCCC at 2.1 Å resolution. We find that Lys104makes novel water-mediated interactions with hydrogen bonding functional groups of the flanking GC bases. By contrast, no interactions of Lys104 with bases of the flanking DNA are present in the five 2.0–2.1-Å resolution complexes with 5′-AAAGATATCTT (5Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 6Perona J.J. Martin A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Horton N.C. Perona J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These data provide insight into new modes of flanking sequence recognition by EcoRV and suggest preferred alternatives for engineering sequence specificity for larger DNA sites into the enzyme. Wild-type EcoRV was prepared as described and stored as an ammonium sulfate pellet at 4 °C (6Perona J.J. Martin A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The self-complementary oligonucleotide 5′-CGGGATATCCC was synthesized for cocrystallization by standard methods and purified on a Rainin PureDNA high pressure liquid chromatography column developed in a gradient of triethylammonium acetate/acetonitrile. Detritylation was performed on the column (25Aggarwal A.K. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 1990; 1: 83-90Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The DNA was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until ready for use, when it was brought to a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA. Cocrystals ofEcoRV complexed with 5′-CGGGATATCCC were grown by vapor diffusion from solutions containing 0.17 mm EcoRV and 0.34 mm DNA, in the presence of 15% PEG 4K, 100 mm imidazole (pH 6.5), and 150 mmNaCl (final conditions). The protein was prepared by resuspending the ammonium sulfate slurry at 30 mg/ml in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol and then exhaustively dialyzed versus this buffer. Crystals were mounted for data collection directly from the drop. X-ray diffraction amplitudes were measured on an R-AXIS IIC area detector mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode generator. Data were obtained at ambient temperature from two crystals. Determination of the orientation matrix, integration, scaling, and merging of data was performed with DENZO and with the HKL suite of programs (26Otwinowski Z.

Local scaling of the structure-factor amplitudes against those of the isomorphous cocrystal with 5′-AAAGATATCTT (6Perona J.J. Martin A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was performed using the program MAXSCALE.

The crystal structure of EcoRV complexed to 5′-CGGGATATCCC was phased directly using the isomorphous cocrystal with 5′-AAAGATATCTT (5Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) as the starting model. The flanking DNA sequences and 57 water molecules at the enzyme-DNA interface were removed from the model. The starting crystallographic R-factor was 31.1%, and this was reduced to 19.6% by several rounds of model building iterated with positional B-factor and simulated annealing refinement in XPLOR (27Brunger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). Very tight stereochemical constraints were maintained throughout the refinement. Criteria for the inclusion of water molecules in both structures were the appearance of peaks at 1.0 ς in (2Fo − Fc) maps, 3.0 ς in (Fo − Fc) maps, and at least one hydrogen bonding interaction with protein or DNA. All water molecules and side chains possessing B-factors above 50.0 Å2 were carefully examined prior to inclusion in the final model. Model building utilized the programs CHAIN (28Sack J.S. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 224-225Crossref Google Scholar) and LORE (29Finzel B.C. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1995; 51: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Parameters for the DNA used in XPLOR refinement were those recently described (30Parkinson G. Vojtechovsky J. Clowney L. Brunger A.T. Berman H.M. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1996; 52: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Determination of Cα atoms in the dimerization or DNA-binding domains was by difference-distance calculations, as described (6Perona J.J. Martin A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Least squares superpositions were performed with Insight II (31Dayringer H. Tramontano A. Sprang S. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Graphics. 1986; 4: 82Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and GEM (32Perry K.M. Fauman E.B. Finer-Moore J.S. Montfort W.R. Maley G.F. Maley F. Stroud R.M. Proteins. 1990; 8: 315-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). EcoRV was cocrystallized with the undecamer duplex 5′-CGGGATATCCC possessing a 5′-C overhang (dGC) 1The abbreviations used are: dGCcocrystal structure of EcoRV bound to 5′-CGGGATATCCCdATcocrystal structure of EcoRV bound to 5′-AAAGATATCTTWatwater. in the absence of divalent metals. The crystals are in the well described P1 lattice (5Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar,6Perona J.J. Martin A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with cell dimensions isomorphous to the previous complexes (TableI). Nearly all of the molecular packing interactions in this crystal are identical with those of the cocrystal with 5′-AAAGATATCTT (dAT). Only base stacking of the unpaired 5′ nucleotide (C versus A) on the dimerization domain of an adjoining molecule is very slightly altered because of the differing sizes of the pyrimidine and purine rings. The crystals have an enzyme dimer and duplex DNA in the asymmetric unit, so that this packing interaction is not made on the opposite end of the molecule. Conserved features observed on each of the two flanks occur in the context of different nearby lattice contacts and are consequently likely to reflect true aspects of the flanking interactions in solution. Thus, comparison of the cocrystal structures of EcoRV complexed with dAT versus dGC provides an excellent opportunity to elucidate detailed differences in the interactions of EcoRV with AT versus GC flanks. cocrystal structure of EcoRV bound to 5′-CGGGATATCCC cocrystal structure of EcoRV bound to 5′-AAAGATATCTT water. The overall structure of this EcoRV-DNA complex is very similar to that of EcoRV cocrystallized with dAT (Fig.1 (5Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar)), with no significant differences in structure detectable within the GATATC target site. The quaternary structure is also identical with that of the dAT cocrystal lacking divalent metal ions. The relative orientations of the DNA binding/catalytic domains in the two structures differ by only a 0.4–0.6° rotation and a 0.22-Å difference in the center of mass separation of the two subunits. These differences are within the level of coordinate error, estimated from Luzzatti plots at roughly 0.2–0.25 Å for each structure (data not shown). Small but perhaps significant intersubunit rotations of 1.0–1.5° are present in comparisons of either cocrystal lacking divalent metals, with isomorphous crystals of metal-containing ternary complexes (data not shown (5Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 6Perona J.J. Martin A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)). Nearly all of the previously observed major and minor groove enzyme-DNA contacts, both with base functional groups and sugar-phosphate moieties, are also present in this complex. The only significant exception is the conformation of the Arg221 side chain in both subunits. In the dAT structure the guanidinium group makes a direct electrostatic interaction with a DNA phosphate at GpATATC in subunit I and a water-mediated interaction with the identical phosphate on the opposite half-site in subunit II (5Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In the dGC structure, the direct contact is absent, and the side chain instead adopts a novel well ordered conformation where it bridges through two ordered water molecules to the guanidinium group of Arg115 (Fig.2). The water-mediated phosphate interaction in subunit II is preserved in dGC, but the conformation of Arg221 differs somewhat to permit an additional water-mediated interaction with Arg115. The conformations observed in dGC are further demonstrations of the alternative binding modes accessible to Arg221 and are unique in the sense that in one subunit no contacts with the DNA are made. Apparently Arg221 has very little energetic preference for making water-mediated intramolecular protein contacts as compared with interactions with the DNA. Conformations of the surrounding 220s loop, the DNA backbone, and Arg115 are identical in the two structures. The mutation R221A is without significant effect on the activity of the enzyme (16Wenz C. Jeltsch A. Pingoud A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5565-5573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and this can now be rationalized based on the observation that the side chain adopts conformations which do not involve DNA binding. The newly introduced exocyclic amino groups of the guanosine flanking bases are outside of the region contacted by the minor groove bindingQ loops (Fig. 1) and surface loops at residues Lys119-Asn120 and are consequently without effect on the structure. However, differences between the dAT and dGC cocrystal structures appear in the major groove interactions of the flanking base pairs with the enzyme. On both sides of the GATATC target the exocyclic N-4 amino groups of flanking cytosines interact through water molecules to Lys104 on an enzyme surface loop (Fig.3, A and B). Water molecules bridging Lys104 to the flanking bases are not present in any of the dAT structures previously determined (5Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 6Perona J.J. Martin A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and could not be visualized in the cocrystal with the decamer 5′-GGGATATCCC (4Winkler F.K. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R. Martin P.D. Petratos K. Wilson K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1781-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) owing to the lower resolution (3 Å) of this structure. In subunit I Lys104 bridges through a network of water molecules binding in the major groove at the two flanking CG pairs (Fig. 3 A and Table II). The water molecules hydrogen-bond with protein at three positions as follows: the Lys104 side chain amine, the backbone at amino acids Ala181-Gly182, and the backbone at Phe105. Water molecules 3 and 5 also bridge through other water molecules to the DNA phosphates at Cyt1 and Cyt9 (Table II). In this subunit Lys104interacts through one water molecule to the N-4 of Cyt11and through two water molecules to the O-6 of its base-pairing partner at Gua2, whereas its connection to the inner flanking pair Gua3-Cyt10 is through a chain of three water molecules: Wat1,3,4. Recognition of this inner pair occurs via water molecules more closely connected to the Ala181-Gly182 main chain. The Gly182-amide also serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor from the N-4 of Cyt9, providing part of the discrimination for the outer GC base pairs of GATATC (Fig. 3,A and B). Similar water-mediated interactions of Ala181 and Gly182 with the inner Ade3-Thy10 pair are observed in the dAT structures (4Winkler F.K. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P.

However, in these structures no direct or water-mediated recognition of base functional groups on the outer flanking Ade2-Thy11 pair occurs.Table IIInteractions of water molecules mediating flanking sequence recognitionSubunit ISubunit IIAtomDistanceAtomDistanceÅÅWat1Wat1′ Lys104:Nε2.8 Lys104:N ε2.5 Cyt11:N43.2 Wat2′3.0 Wat22.6 Wat32.6Wat2Wat2′ Wat12.6 Cyt10:N-42.7 Cyt11:N-42.9 Wat1′3.0 Wat3′3.1Wat3Wat3′ Gua2:O-62.7 Gly182:O3.2 Wat12.6 Wat2′3.1 Wat42.6 WatbThis water bridges through other water molecules to the main chain amides of Lys104 and Phe105 and to the DNA phosphate at C-9.2.8 WataThis water bridges through one other water molecule to the side chain of His193.2.7Wat4 Cyt10:N-43.2 Wat32.6 Wat52.6Wat5 Gly182:O3.0 Wat42.6 Wat62.5 WatcThis water bridges through one other water molecule to the DNA phosphate at C-9.2.7Wat6 Phe105:O2.7 Wat52.5 Wat73.2Wat7 Ala181:O2.6 Wat63.2a This water bridges through one other water molecule to the side chain of His193.b This water bridges through other water molecules to the main chain amides of Lys104 and Phe105 and to the DNA phosphate at C-9.c This water bridges through one other water molecule to the DNA phosphate at C-9. Open table in a new tab In subunit II the Lys104-amine group interacts directly with two water molecules, one of which (Wat2′) bridges directly to the N-4 amino group of the inner flanking cytosine (Fig.3 B). Wat2′ also interacts with another water (Wat3′) which donates a hydrogen bond to the main chain amide of Gly182. While preserving the common feature of water-mediated flanking sequence recognition through Lys104, the interactions made in subunits I and II thus clearly differ. This appears attributable to the proximity of a crystal packing contact made by the 5-overhanging cytosine (Cyt1) in subunit I. The base of Cyt1 packs onto the peptide main chain in the dimerization domain of an adjoining molecule, which provides stabilization in a manner apparently similar to the continuation of base-stacking in a longer duplex DNA. In subunit II, which lacks this lattice contact, the 5′-overhanging cytosine is disordered. Moreover, the outer flanking Gua2-Cyt11 pair is also destabilized; atomicB-factors of Cyt11 are above 60 Å2, and the electron density for this nucleotide is weak in the final 2Fo − Fc electron density maps (Fig. 3 D). Superposition of the flanking interactions from subunits I and II of dGC shows that Cyt11 of subunit II is shifted away from the protein by approximately 1.0–1.5 Å (Fig.4), and this can account for why water-mediated interactions with the Gua2-Cyt11pair are not observed in subunit II. It thus appears that the water-mediated flanking interactions in subunit I are more likely to be representative of the contacts present in solution. The recognition of the flanking CG base pairs by these water-mediated interactions is clearly nonspecific. In no case does a water molecule make more than one hydrogen bond with protein, a requirement for presenting obligate donor/acceptor functions to the DNA (33Steitz T.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 205-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Therefore, the waters could in principle reorient their two hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups to provide equivalent interactions with flanking TA pairs. Moreover, it is also very unlikely that discrimination could be achieved against flanking GC or AT base pairs in which the purine and pyrimidine rings are exchanged. This is because the positions of the major groove hydrogen-bonding sites in these pairs are altered by only 1 Å (34Seeman N.C. Rosenberg J.M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 804-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar), and this shift should be readily accommodated by small rearrangements of the waters. To address why the apparently nonspecific water-mediated interactions between Lys104 and the outer flanking base pairs are not present in dAT, we superimposed the dAT and dGC structures based on polypeptide backbone atoms within the DNA-binding domains (root mean square deviation = 0.24 Å for the superposition of 244 amino acids (6Perona J.J. Martin A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)). This shows that in both subunits one of the water molecules bound to Lys104 is blocked from binding to flanking AT pairs by one of the thymine C-5 methyl groups (Fig.5, A and B). In subunit II the steric hindrance by Thy10, occluding binding of Wat2′, is sufficient to acco"

J., Ladner, R., Hansbury, M., Kosciuk, M., Lynch, F., and Muller, S. J. (1996) Exp. Cell Res. 222, 345–359). One of these is an Mr 29,000 processed form of the highly conserved uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG1) located in the mitochondria. The others are located in the nucleus and migrate as a group of at least three distinct bands within the 35,000–37,000 molecular weight range. In this report, we perform a detailed characterization of the Mr35,000–37,000 purified proteins. To accomplish this, uracil-DNA glycosylases were affinity purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and their identities were verified by renaturation and activity assays. The three protein bands were individually digested with cyanogen bromide, and the resulting peptide fragments were analyzed by direct amino acid sequencing. Peptide sequence, derived from each band, was identical and corresponded to a recently identified isoform of UDG1. This isoform (UDG1A) has a unique 44-amino acid N-terminal region and a C-terminal region that is identical to UDG1. To begin to study the signals required for nuclear targeting, the N-terminal regions of UDG1 and UDG1A were isolated and cloned into pEGFP-N2 to generate fusions with a red-shifted variant of green fluorescent protein (GFP). When these constructs were transfected into NIH3T3 cells, UDG1/pEGFP was targeted to the mitochondria, and UDG1A/pEGFP was targeted to the nucleus. Further studies, using deletion mutants, demonstrate that the nuclear localization signal resides within the first 20 amino acids of UDG1A. To investigate the possibility that the heterogeneity observed on SDS-PAGE results from post-translational modification(s), the UDG/pEGFP fusion constructs were transfected into NIH3T3 cells, and the cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Results from these experiments show that UDG1A is a phosphoprotein. Subsequent phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that UDG1A is phosphorylated on both serine and threonine residues. As a final characterization, RNase protection assays were performed to examine expression of each of these isoforms. These studies demonstrate that UDG1A is expressed in a wide variety of cell types and that message levels are elevated in transformed cells. We have previously demonstrated that human cells contain multiple forms of uracil-DNA glycosylase (Caradonna, S. J., Ladner, R., Hansbury, M., Kosciuk, M., Lynch, F., and Muller, S. J. (1996) Exp.

The deamination of cytosine to uracil is a potentially mutagenic event. This damage must be recognized and repaired before replication in order to preserve the genomic integrity of a cell (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1994; 362: 709-715Crossref Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) 1The abbreviations used are: UDGuracil-DNA glycosylaseUgiuracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitorkbkilobasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisNLSnuclear localization signalGFPgreen fluorescent proteinbpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionPBSphosphate-buffered salineDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumDTTdithiothreitolPipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidPthphenylthiohydantoin. catalyzes the first step in the base excision repair pathway to remove uracil from DNA (2Lindahl T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1979; 22: 135-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The enzyme hydrolyzes the N-glycosyl bond between the uracil base and the deoxyribose sugar moiety. The resulting apyrimidinic site is then repaired by the sequential actions of an AP endonuclease, phosphodiesterase, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 4Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem.

Given the importance of this enzyme, it is not surprising that uracil-DNA glycosylases have been studied extensively in a variety of bacteria, viruses, and eukaryotic organisms (4Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Some of the most intriguing recent data suggest a role for uracil-DNA glycosylase in DNA replication as well as repair. For example, in vaccinia virus and cytomegalovirus, uracil-DNA glycosylase is required for DNA synthesis and viral replication (6Stuart D.T. Upton C. Higman M.A. Niles E.G. McFadden G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Millns A.K. Carpenter M.S. DeLange A.M. Virology. 1994; 198: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Prichard M.N. Duke G.M. Mocarski E.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the N-terminal region of the highly conserved human uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG1) associates with replication protein A2 (9Nagelhus T.A. Haug T. Singh K.K. Keshav K.F. Skorpen F. Otterlei M. Bharati S. Lindmo T. Benichou S. Benarous R. Krokan H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6561-6566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this interaction may recruit UDG1 to the DNA replication-repair complex. In humans, four putative uracil-DNA glycosylases have been identified. These include the following: 1) a 29,000 molecular weight protein that is highly conserved in nature (10Olsen L.C. Aasland R. Wittwer C.U. Krokan H.E. Helland D.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3121-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); 2) a cyclin-like protein (UDG2) (11Muller S.J. Caradonna S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); 3) thymine-DNA glycosylase (12Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar); and 4) a recently identified isoform of the highly conserved uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG1A) (13Nilsen H. Otterlei M. Haug T. Solum K. Nagelhus T.A. Skorpen F. Krokan H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). At present an in vivo role for many of these proteins is unclear. For example, the cyclin-like UDG2 generates uracil-DNA glycosylase activity in vitro and specifically interacts with the uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein (11Muller S.J. Caradonna S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Caradonna S.J. Ladner R. Hansbury M. Kosciuk M. Lynch F. Muller S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, we do not know how or when this (uracil-removing) activity is required by the cell. Similarly, thymine-DNA glycosylase can remove uracil from duplex G/U substrates in vitro (12Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Gallinari and Jiricny (12Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) postulate that this enzyme may function to remove uracil damage when the cell is at rest or is not proliferating. It has also been reported that partially purified preparations of theMr 36,000 subunit of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase contains uracil-DNA glycosylase activity (15Meyer-Siegler K. Mauro D.J. Seal G. Wurser J. DeRiel J.K. Sirover M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, results from our laboratory indicate that this may be due to UDG contamination of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase preparations used in these studies (14Caradonna S.J. Ladner R. Hansbury M. Kosciuk M. Lynch F. Muller S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The best characterized human uracil-DNA glycosylase is the 29,000 molecular weight protein that we refer to as UDG1 (10Olsen L.C. Aasland R. Wittwer C.U. Krokan H.E. Helland D.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3121-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). UDG1 arises from proteolytic processing of a precursor during mitochondrial import and has been reported to play a role in mitochondrial DNA repair (14Caradonna S.J. Ladner R. Hansbury M. Kosciuk M. Lynch F. Muller S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,16Slupphaug G. Markussen F.H. Olsen L. Aasland R. Aaarsaether N. Bakke O. Krokan H.E. Helland D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2579-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Recently, a cDNA encoding a putative isoform of UDG1 was identified by Nilsen et al. (13Nilsen H. Otterlei M. Haug T. Solum K. Nagelhus T.A. Skorpen F. Krokan H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We refer to this isoform as UDG1A. The UDG1A cDNA encodes a 313 amino acid protein with a unique 44-residue N terminus and appears to arise from alternate splicing. Constructs that express a fusion of UDG1A with green fluorescent protein show targeting to the nucleus (13Nilsen H. Otterlei M. Haug T. Solum K. Nagelhus T.A. Skorpen F. Krokan H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, because in vivo analyses of the native protein were not performed, questions remain as to the size and location of UDG1A within the cell. To examine directly UDGs in human cell extracts, we have used the uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein (Ugi). In contrast to most organisms in nature, the PBS1 and PBS2 bacteriophages of Bacillus subtilis contain uracil in their genome (17Takahashi I. Marmur J. Nature. 1963; 197: 794-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To protect their DNA from host repair mechanisms, these phages synthesize an inhibitor that inactivates uracil-DNA glycosylase (18Cone R. Bonura T. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10354-10358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein can specifically bind to and inactivate uracil-DNA glycosylase from a variety of organisms, including humans (19Karran P. Cone R. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mol C.D.

We have recently conjugated Ugi to Sepharose beads and used this matrix to affinity purify uracil-DNA glycosylases from cellular extracts (14Caradonna S.J. Ladner R. Hansbury M. Kosciuk M. Lynch F. Muller S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Results from these studies show that human cells contain multiple forms of this enzyme. One is the processed form (Mr29,000) of the highly conserved uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG1) located in the mitochondria. The second is a group of at least three 35,000–37,000 molecular weight proteins located in the nucleus. In the present study, we set out to identify and characterize the three apparent nuclear uracil-DNA glycosylases. Cellular extracts were prepared from 1 × 1010 HeLa cells using a modification of the hypotonic shock protocol developed by Dignam et al. (22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 × g for 15 min, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 5 packed cell pellet volumes of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9; 1.5 mm MgCl2; 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm DTT). After a 10 min incubation on ice, the cells were again collected by centrifugation (800 × g/5 min) and resuspended in 2 cell pellet volumes of buffer A. The cells were then lysed with 10 strokes of a Kontes glass homogenizer using the B-type pestle. Complete lysis of the cells was monitored by phase contrast microscopy. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (800 × g/5 min) and washed twice with 5 volumes of buffer A. After the final wash, an aliquot of the nuclei were analyzed for mitochondrial contamination using a mitochondrion-selective dye (MitoTracker Green FM, Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Nuclei were incubated in 20 nmMitoTracker for 30 min prior to analysis. Once it was established that the nuclei were free from significant mitochondrial contamination, they were resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 250 mm NaCl; 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mmEDTA) and sonicated extensively. The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble debris and then applied to the Ugi-Sepharose matrix. Preparation of the Ugi-Sepharose, incubation times, and wash conditions have been described previously (14Caradonna S.J. Ladner R. Hansbury M. Kosciuk M. Lynch F. Muller S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted by the addition of an equal volume of electrophoresis gel-loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 100 mm dithiothreitol; 2% sodium dodecyl sulfide; 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol (v/v)). The samples were heated to 85 °C and resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-12.6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). High range, protein molecular weight standards were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and used according to manufacturer's directions. These include the following: lysozyme, 14,300; β-lactoglobulin, 18,400; carbonic anhydrase, 29,000; ovalbumin, 45,000; bovine serum albumin, 68,000; phosphorylase b, 97,400; and myosin (H chain), 200,000. All cell lines were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5.5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cell lines were propagated as subconfluent monolayer cultures, and media were replenished 24 h prior to harvestings. HeLa S3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% calf serum. Human fibroblast cell lines (34 Lu and 18 Co) and SV40-transformed placental trophoblasts were maintained in minimal Eagle's media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 2 mm glutamine. HT29 cells were grown in McCoy's 5A media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. NIH3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. Following SDS-PAGE, segments (1.5 × 3 × 1.5 mm) corresponding to each protein band were excised from the gel. The same size segments, located directly above and below the protein group, were also excised. Individual gel segments were crushed in 0.25 ml of elution buffer (0.1% SDS; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9; 0.1 mmEDTA; 5 mm DTT; 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and the proteins were eluted for 1 h at room temperature. Protein renaturation was performed as described previously and yielded a 500-μl final volume (14Caradonna S.J. Ladner R. Hansbury M. Kosciuk M. Lynch F. Muller S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Activity assays were performed for 60 min using 5 μl of renatured protein. Uracil-DNA glycosylase assays were carried out as described by Muller and Caradonna (11Muller S.J. Caradonna S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All reactions were performed in a 100-μl volume containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.167 μm [3H]uracil containing calf thymus DNA. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated and terminated by the addition of 25 μl of salmon sperm DNA (25 μg) and 25 μl of 4 m perchloric acid. The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged. One hundred-microliter aliquots of supernatant were analyzed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 pmol of radiolabeled uracil per min at 37 °C. All assays were performed in duplicate. The Ugi-purified proteins were separated by 12.6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to ProBlott membrane (Applied Biosystems) according to Towbin et al. (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the bands were then individually excised from the membrane as directed by Proseq Inc. (Salem, MA). Protein sequence determinations were performed by Proseq Inc., using a selective o-phthalaldehyde blockade designed to minimize background and eliminate the purification of individual target peptides following cyanogen bromide digestion (24Brauer A.W. Oman C.L. Margolies M.N. Anal. Biochim. 1984; 137: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, the proteins (bound to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane) were digested with CNBr, and the resulting peptide mixture was subjected to several cycles of Edman degradation. o-Phthalaldehyde treatment was applied at cycles in which proline was the NH2 terminus of the polypeptide of interest. This reagent covalently binds to and blocks all peptides with the exception of those containing a proline at their N terminus. In this way, individual peptides are able to be sequenced from the mixture. Amino acid sequencing and quantitation of Pth derivatives were performed using an Applied Biosystems model 494 Procise protein sequencing system. Using sequence derived from an expressed sequence tag (EST) in GenBankTM, 2L. Hillier, N. Clark, T. Dubuque, K. Elliston, M. Hawkins, M. Holman, M. Hultman, T. Kucaba, M. Le, G. Lennon, M. Marra, J.

Wilson, EMBL accession number R53340; Washington University-Merck EST Project. a 5′ primer was synthesized beginning at the UDG1A translational start (5′-ATGATCGGCCAGAAGACGCTCT-3′). This primer was used in conjunction with a 3′ primer (5′-TCTCAAAGGCCACCCCTCAGCT-3′) to isolate the corresponding cDNA using an reverse transcriptase-PCR method. Reverse transcription of HeLa mRNA was carried out using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase as described by the manufacturer (Promega Corp.). PCR was then performed for 30 cycles using an annealing temperature of 60 °C. The DNA fragment was gel-purified, phosphorylated, end-filled, and ligated toSmaI-digested pGem3Z using established methods (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The resulting pGem3Z/UDG1A construct was verified by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method and Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The pGem3Z/UDG1A construct was then used as template DNA to generate the pEGFP-N2 fusion constructs. The 86-amino acid N-terminal region of UDG1A (258 bp) was isolated using specific primers and PCR as described above. Similarly, primers were designed to isolate UDG1A fragments with 20- and 25-amino acid N-terminal deletions. For these constructs, an ATG codon was added to the 5′ end of the upper primer. All of the DNA fragments were blunt end-ligated to SmaI-digested pEGFP-N2, and orientation was determined by restriction enzyme digestions. This vector produces an N-terminal fusion with a red-shifted variant of green fluorescent protein. The resulting constructs are referred to as UDG1A/pEGFP, UDG1A-Δ20/pEGFP, and UDG1A-Δ25/pEGFP. The same approach was then used to isolate the 77-amino acid N-terminal region of UDG1 (231 bp). This fragment was ligated to SmaI-digested pEGFP-N2 to generate UDG1/pEGFP. For transient transfection studies, NIH3T3 cells were seeded at 7 × 105 cells/10-cm2 dish or 2 × 105 cells/coverslip. Cells were transfected with plasmid (6 μg/10-cm2 dish or 2 μg/coverslip) using Lipofectin reagent as directed (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, the cells were incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 8 h in the presence of the DNA/Lipofectin mixture. This mixture was then removed and replaced with DMEM containing 10% calf serum. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells grown on coverslips were examined for green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression using a Ziess Axioskop fluorescent microscope. Alternatively, the cells grown in 10-cm2 dishes were harvested at 24 h post-transfection for Western blot analysis. Cellular extracts were prepared in 1 ml of lysis buffer as described (26Muller S.J. Caradonna S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed using anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies at a 1:2000 dilution as directed by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). For metabolic labeling studies, NIH3T3 cells were seeded at 7 × 105 cells/10-cm2 dish and transfected as described above. The Lipofectin mixture was removed at 8 h post-transfection and replaced with 10 ml of DMEM (minus phosphate), 10% calf serum, and 125 μCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Incubation at 37 °C was continued for another 20 h at which time the cells were collected and washed twice in cold PBS. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of GFP lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8; 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mm DTT) and left on ice at 4 °C for 15 h. The cell extracts were then centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Polyclonal GFP antisera (5 μg, CLONTECH) were added to each of the supernatants, and the supernatants were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein A-Sepharose (200 μl of a 10% (w/v) suspension) was then added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with constant agitation. The immune precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed five times (1 ml each) with GFP lysis buffer. Following the last wash, samples were resuspended in 50 μl of electrophoresis gel loading buffer and heated to 85 °C for 10 min. Proteins recovered by immunoprecipitation were resolved by 12.6% SDS-PAGE, and the radiolabeled bands were visualized by autoradiography. To determine which amino acids of the UDG1A/pEGFP fusion protein were phosphorylated, [32P]orthophosphate-labeled protein from NIH3T3-transfected cells were immunoprecipitated and fractionated by SDS-PAGE as described above. Fractionated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Protoblot membranes (Applied Biosystems). The membranes were then exposed to x-ray film to localize the radiolabeled bands. The x-ray film was used as a template to identify and excise the corresponding radioactive bands from the membrane. Protein from these bands was hydrolyzed in 5.7 nHCl at 110 °C for 1 h. The resulting amino acids were then analyzed by thin layer chromatography on SigmaCell type 100 cellulose plates in a solvent system consisting of propionic acid, 1m NH4OH, 2-propanol (45:17.5:17.5) as described by Boyle et al. (27Boyle W.J. Van Der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Tyr, phosphorylated Thr, and phosphorylated Ser standards were included in the radioactive samples prior to chromatography. The dried chromatography plates were developed to visualize the phosphoamino acid standards according to established protocol (27Boyle W.J. Van Der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) and then exposed to x-ray film to determine which amino acid residues contained phosphate groups. Total cell extracts were prepared from 1 × 109 HeLa cells as described previously (14Caradonna S.J. Ladner R. Hansbury M. Kosciuk M. Lynch F. Muller S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were resuspended in 10 packed cell pellet volumes of Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, and 5 mm EDTA) and incubated on ice for 1 h. Protease inhibitors were added to the buffer as indicated (14Caradonna S.J. Ladner R. Hansbury M. Kosciuk M. Lynch F. Muller S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cells were then disrupted by Dounce homogenization using a B-type pestle and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was considered total cell extract and used for the affinity purification of uracil-DNA glycosylases. Ugi-Sepharose (200 μl of a 10% (w/v) solution) was mixed with the extracts (7.5 × 107 cell eq in 2.5 ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. The matrix was then washed extensively with Nonidet P-40 buffer, and phosphatase treatment was performed according to the procedure of Perez et al. (29Perez L. Paasinen A. Schnierle B. Kach S. Senften M. Ballmer-Hofer K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8113-8117Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Following the last wash, the affinity precipitates were resuspended in 200 μl of phosphatase buffer (40 mm Pipes, pH 6.0; 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT); 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 units of aprotinin) containing 20 μg of potato acid phosphatase. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The precipitates were washed again, and proteins were eluted by adding an equal volume of electrophoresis gel-loading buffer and heating to 85 °C. The samples were resolved by 12.6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed using a new preparation of polyclonal antibodies that react with all forms of the highly conserved UDG (mitochondrial, UDG1, and nuclear UDG1A). These antibodies were raised against a soluble UDG1-GST fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase; pGEX, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the procedure described previously (14Caradonna S.J. Ladner R. Hansbury M. Kosciuk M. Lynch F. Muller S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This fusion protein corresponds to the full-length, non-processed UDG1 protein and thus contains regions shared by the UDG1 and UDG1A isoforms. The antibodies were used at a 1:500 dilution. DNA segments corresponding to the unique N termini of UDG1 and UDG1A were isolated using PCR. A 104-bp UDG1 fragment was amplified using the following primers: upper (5′-ATGGGCGTCTTCTGCCTTGGGCGGTGGGGGT-3′) and lower (5′-TGCAAGTGGTCCCCGCAGAGGCGGCTCAAG-3′). A 129-bp UDG1A fragment was amplified using the following primers: upper (5′-ATGATCGGCCAGAAGACGCTCT-3′) and lower (5′- CCGCATCTCCGCTTTCCTGAG-3′). These segments were ligated toSmaI digested pGem3Z and used to transcribe radiolabeled antisense RNA probes (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

We have recently shown that human G6Pase contains an odd number of transmembrane segments, supporting a nine-transmembrane helical model for this enzyme. Sequence analysis predicts the presence of three potential asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation sites, N96TS, N203AS, and N276SS, conserved among mammalian G6Pases. According to this model, Asn96, located in a 37-residue luminal loop, is a potential acceptor for oligosaccharides, whereas Asn203 and Asn276, located in a 12-residue cytoplasmic loop and helix 7, respectively, would not be utilized for this purpose. We therefore characterized mutant G6Pases lacking one, two, or all three potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Western blot and in vitro translation studies showed that G6Pase is glycosylated only at Asn96, further validating the nine-transmembrane topology model. Substituting Asn96 with an Ala (N96A) moderately reduced enzymatic activity and had no effect on G6Pase synthesis or degradation, suggesting that oligosaccharide chains do not play a major role in protecting the enzyme from proteolytic degradation. In contrast, mutation of Asn276 to an Ala (N276A) destabilized the enzyme and markedly reduced enzymatic activity.

Although the presence of a consensus glycosylation site within the amino acid sequence of a membrane protein is suggestive of a glycoprotein, not all consensus sites are necessarily utilized. A survey of mammalian multispan membrane proteins has suggested that, for a potential N-linked glycosylation site to be utilized, it must be situated on the luminal side of the ER, and the size of the hydrophilic loop must be at least 33 amino acids in length (11Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Landolt-Marticorena C. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Analysis of protein glycosylation thus provides useful topological information for membrane proteins. The nine-transmembrane topology model predicts that human G6Pase would contain four short (8–12 resides) cytoplasmic loops, and two short (7 and 8 residues) and two large (33 and 37 residues) luminal loops (4Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). According to this model, N96TS would be situated in a 37-residue luminal loop, thus it is the only glycosylation site in human G6Pase that satisfies the criteria as an acceptor for oligosaccharides. In the present study, we constructed mutant G6Pases lacking one, two, or all three potential N-linked glycosylation sites and examined G6Pase synthesis directed by wild-type (WT) or mutant G6Pase in transient expression, Western blot, andin vitro translation studies. Our data demonstrate that G6Pase is glycosylated only at Asn96, further validating the nine-transmembrane helical model. We also show that oligosaccharide side chains do not play a major role in protecting the enzyme from proteolytic degradation. Furthermore, the structural integrity of transmembrane segments in human G6Pase is essential for enzyme activity and stability. Human G6Pase (7Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y.

The eight-amino acid FLAG marker peptide, DYKDDDDK (Scientific Imaging Systems, Eastman Kodak Co.) was used to tag the C terminus of G6Pase as described previously (4Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B.

Codon 96 (AAC) mutant primers (nucleotides 356–376) contain GCC (Ala) at position 96, codon 203 (AAT) mutant primers (nucleotides 677–697) containGCT (Ala) at position 203, and codon 276 (AAC) mutant primers (nucleotides 896–916) contain GCC (Ala) at position 276. After the polymerase chain reaction, the amplified fragment was ligated either into the pSVLhG6Pase-DraIII-3′ fragment (N96A) or the pSVLhG6Pase-DraIII-5′ fragment (N203A and N276A). The primers for N203A-3′FLAG and N276A-3′FLAG mutants are I1 and nucleotides (1150–1133) of human G6Pase, followed by the 24-base pair FLAG coding sequence and a termination codon (G2–3′FLAG, antisense) using N203A or N276A, respectively, as a template. After the polymerase chain reaction, the amplified fragment was ligated into the pSVLhG6Pase-DraIII-5′ fragment. N96A-3′FLAG, D38V-3′FLAG, and P178S-3′FLAG were constructed by substituting the pSVLhG6Pase-DraIII-3′ fragment in N96A, D38V (14Parvari R. Lei K.-J. Szonyi L. Narkis G. Moses S. Chou J.Y. Euro. J.

COS-1 cells were grown at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with streptomycin, penicillin, and 4% fetal bovine serum. The G6Pase construct in a pSVL vector was transfected into COS-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1992: 9.2.1-9.2.6Google Scholar). Mock transfections of COS-1 cells with the pSVL vector alone were used as controls. After incubation at 37 °C for 2–3 days, the transfected cultures were either harvested for G6Pase assays and Western blot analysis or lysed for RNA isolation. RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate/CsCl method (17Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar), separated by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2m formaldehyde, and transferred to Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The filters were hybridized at 42 °C in the presence of the phG6Pase-1 (7Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) or β-actin probe as described previously (4Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis of the FLAG-tagged G6Pase, microsomal proteins were separated by electrophoresis through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The filters were incubated with a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope (Scientific Imaging Systems). The immunocomplex was then incubated with a second antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and visualized by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (Kirkegarrd & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Phosphohydrolase activity was determined essentially as described by Burchell et al. (18Burchell A. Hume R. Burchell B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1988; 173: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mm glucose-6-P, 2 mm EDTA, and appropriate amounts of cell homogenates and were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Sample absorbance was determined at 820 nm and is related to the amount of phosphate released using a standard curve constructed by a stock of inorganic phosphate solution. Nonspecific phosphatase activity was estimated by preincubating cell homogenates at pH 5 for 10 min at 37 °C, a condition that inactivates the thermolabile G6Pase (19Hers H.G. Adv. Metab. Disord. 1964; 1: 1-44Crossref Google Scholar). In vitrotranscription-translation of a WT or mutant cDNA construct, in a pGEM-11Zf(+) vector (Promega Biotech), was performed using the TNTTM-coupled reticulocyte lysate system obtained from Promega Biotech. l-[35S]Methionine was used as the labeled precursor. The in vitro synthesized proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 10% gel, and fluoroautoradiography. We have recently shown that human G6Pase contains an odd number of transmembrane domains with the N terminus localized in the ER lumen and the C terminus in the cytoplasm (4Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Our data support a nine-transmembrane topology for G6Pase (5Hoffman K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166-170Google Scholar), which places the three potential N-linked glycosylation sites in a 37-residue luminal loop (N96TS), a 12-residue cytoplasmic loop (N203AS), and helix 7 (N276SS) (Fig.1). According to this model, only Asn96, which satisfies the criteria as an acceptor for oligosaccharides (11Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Landolt-Marticorena C. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), would be utilized. To further evaluate the nine-transmembrane model and to determine the extent ofN-linked glycosylation in human G6Pase, we constructed a series of mutants that disrupted one (N96A, N203A, and N276A), two (N96A/N203A, N96A/N276A, and N203A/N276A), or all three (N96A/N203A/N276A) consensus glycosylation sites in human G6Pase. Phosphohydrolase activity was examined in whole homogenates after transient transfection of WT or mutant G6Pase cDNA constructs into COS-1 cells. Phosphohydrolase activities of N96A and N203A mutants, which disrupt glycosylation sites 1 and 2, respectively, were approximately 37% of WT enzymatic activity (Table I). The N276A mutant, which disrupts site 3, retained 10% of WT activity (Table I). Double glycosylation mutants, N96A/N203A, N203A/N276A, and N96A/N276A, retained 22.6, 9.7, and 2.4% of WT activity, respectively, and the triple mutant, N96A/N203A/N276A, retained only 2.3% of WT activity. Our data suggest that amino acid at position 276 plays a more critical role in G6Pase catalysis than amino acids at position 96 and 203.Table IPhosphohydrolase activity of human G6Pase glycosylation mutantsConstructsPhosphohydrolase activityConstructsPhosphohydrolase activityMock12.3 ± 0.5Mock12.3 ± 0.5WT113.6 ± 10.9 (100)aNumbers in parentheses are percent.WT-3′FLAG86.5 ± 9.1 (100)N96A50.2 ± 3.2 (37.4)N96A-3′FLAG44.8 ± 0.8 (43.8)N203A49.3 ± 0.2 (36.5)N203A-3′FLAG47.1 ± 4.3 (46.9)N276A22.3 ± 1.1 (9.9)N276A-3′FLAG23.0 ± 1.2 (14.4)N96A/N203A35.2 ± 0.2 (22.6)N96A/N203A-3′FLAG31.5 ± 3.8 (25.9)N96A/N276A14.8 ± 0.7 (2.4)N96A/N276A-3′FLAG12.9 ± 1.9 (0.8)N203A/N276A20.1 ± 2.0 (9.7)N203A/N276A-3′FLAG20.2 ± 2.2 (10.6)N96A/N203A/N276A14.6 ± 0.1 (2.3)N96A/N203A/N276A-3′FLAG12.7 ± 1.4 (0.7)Phosphohydrolase activity was assayed as described under “Materials and Methods” using two independent isolates of each construct in three separate transfections.

G6Pase synthesis in transfected cells was analyzed by Western blot using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Fig.2 A). The WT-3′FLAG construct supported the synthesis of a 36-kDa polypeptide in the absence of tunicamycin and a 32-kDa polypeptide in the presence of tunicamycin, suggesting that the apparent molecular mass of the nonglycosylated G6Pase migrated as a 32-kDa protein. The synthesis of a low level of the 32-kDa product in the absence of tunicamycin suggests that glycosylation in COS-1 cells may be incomplete. Both the N203A-3′FLAG and N276A-3′FLAG constructs supported the synthesis of polypeptides of 36 and 32 kDa in the absence and presence of tunicamycin, respectively (Fig. 2 A), indicating that Asn203 and Asn276 in human G6Pase were not utilized as acceptors for oligosaccharides. On the other hand, the N96A-3′FLAG construct supported the synthesis of a 32-kDa polypeptide, both in the absence and presence of tunicamycin (Fig. 2 A). Only 3′FLAG constructs, N96A/N203A, N96A/N276A, and N96A/N203A/N276A, that disrupted the consensus site at position 96, abolished glycosylation in G6Pase. Our data further validate the nine transmembrane topology for G6Pase with N96TS in a 37-residue luminal loop, thus satisfying the criteria of a N-linked oligosaccharide acceptor. We further performed in vitro translation assays to assess whether Asn96 is the only site that is utilized in G6Pase. Results in Fig. 3 show that WT-3′FLAG as well as the N203A-3′FLAG and N276A-3′FLAG mRNA directed the synthesis of a polypeptide of 32 kDa, which was processed to a glycopolypeptide of 36 kDa in the presence of canine microsomal membranes. On the other hand, N96A-3′FLAG mRNA supported the synthesis of only a 32-kDa polypeptide both in the absence or presence of canine microsomal membranes (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained with G6Pase constructs lacking the FLAG (data not shown). Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 A) showed that WT-3′FLAG, N96A-3′FLAG and N203A-3′FLAG constructs supported the synthesis of similar levels of G6Pase proteins that were considerably higher than the levels directed by the N276A-3′FLAG mutant. Likewise, markedly reduced levels of G6Pase synthesis were observed with double or triple glycosylation mutants harboring the N276A mutation (Fig. 2 A). Northern blot hybridization analysis of G6Pase transcripts from transfected cells showed that WT as well as mutant G6PasemRNAs were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 2 B). This suggests that the reduction in G6Pase protein levels was not due to a decrease in transfection efficiency, but due to either a decrease in enzyme synthesis or an increase in enzyme degradation. In vitro translation experiments (Fig. 3) showed that N276A and WT mRNA were able to direct the synthesis of similar amounts of G6Pase protein, suggesting that the N276A mutant enzyme is more susceptible to degradation than the WT enzyme. To investigate whether the structural integrity of transmembrane helices is important to G6Pase stability, we examined the effect of other transmembrane helical mutations on G6Pase synthesis. Asp38, located in helix 1, and Pro178, located in helix 5, were chosen because mutations (D38V and P178S) associated with these two residues have been identified in the G6Pasegene of GSD-1a patients and were shown to abolish G6Pase activity (14Parvari R. Lei K.-J. Szonyi L. Narkis G. Moses S. Chou J.Y. Euro. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,15Lei K.-J. Chen Y.-T. Chen H. Wong L.-J.C. Liu J.-L.

COS-1 cells were transfected with D38V-3′FLAG or P178S-3′FLAG constructs and G6Pase synthesis examined by Western blot analysis. COS-1 cells transfected with WT-3′FLAG, N96A-3′FLAG, N203A-3′FLAG, or N276A-3′FLAG construct were used as controls. D38V-3′FLAG and P178S-3′FLAG, like the WT construct, supported the synthesis of two polypeptides of 36 (major) and 32 kDa (minor), but at significantly lower levels than that of the WT construct (Fig.4). Our data suggest that mutations that alter the structural integrity of transmembrane helices in G6Pase destabilize the enzyme. The total absence of enzymatic activity of the D38V and P178S mutants (14Parvari R. Lei K.-J. Szonyi L. Narkis G. Moses S. Chou J.Y. Euro. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Lei K.-J. Chen Y.-T. Chen H. Wong L.-J.C. Liu J.-L. McConkie-Rosell A. Van Hove J.L.K. Ou H.C.-Y. Yeh N.J. Pan L.Y. Chou J.Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 766-771PubMed Google Scholar) raises the possibility that the low levels of mutant protein synthesized may not fold properly to perform catalytic functions. A survey of mammalian multispan membrane proteins showed thatN-linked oligosaccharides are localized to single extracytosolic segments that are at least 33 residues in length (11Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Landolt-Marticorena C. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, N-linked glycosylation is a useful topological marker for membrane proteins. In earlier studies, we showed that human G6Pase contains an odd number of transmembrane helices with the N terminus localized in the ER lumen and the C terminus in the cytoplasm (4Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Our data support a nine-transmembrane helical model proposed for G6Pase based on hydropathy analysis (5Hoffman K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166-170Google Scholar) which predicts that the three consensus glycosylation sites in human G6Pase would be located in a 37-residue luminal loop (N96TS), a 12-residue cytoplasmic loop (N203AS), and helix 7 (N276SS) (Fig. 1). In this study, we determined which one of the glycosylation sites in human G6Pase is being utilized in order to put the topology of human G6Pase on a firmer experimental basis. We show that only N96TS is an acceptor for oligosaccharide chains, further validating the nine-transmembrane model for G6Pase. The glycan moieties of glycoproteins have been shown to play important roles, including the direction of protein folding, regulation of cell-surface expression, maintenance of polypeptide conformation and solubility, and increase in the half-life of proteins (21Olden K.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The N96A mutant directed the synthesis of a 32-kDa nonglycosylated G6Pase, whereas the WT construct supported the synthesis of a glycoprotein of 36 kDa. However, Western blot analysis showed that similar levels of N96A and WT G6Pase proteins were produced, suggesting that the oligosaccharide chains in G6Pase do not affect the half-life of G6Pase. At present, over 240 G6Pase alleles have been characterized in GSD-1a patients (reviewed in Ref. 4Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that no missense or codon deletion mutations have been identified in any of the four cytoplasmic loops in human G6Pase. Asn203 is located in a cytoplasmic loop and mutation (N203A) of this residue had no adverse effects on protein synthesis, as similar amount of G6Pase were synthesized by WT or the N203A construct. Moreover, the N203A mutant retained 37% of WT activity, whereas all mutations uncovered in the G6Pase gene of GSD-1a patients abolish or markedly reduce (retaining 18% or less of WT activity) G6Pase activity (7Lei K.-J.

Eighteen amino acids were shown to be altered by missense and codon deletion mutations uncovered in the G6Pase gene of GSD-1a patients (Fig. 1). Twelve missense mutations and the codon deletion mutation (ΔF327) were further examined for G6Pase activity in transient expression assays (7Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y.

Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); D38V, V166G, P178S, G188S, G222R, G270V, R295C, ΔF327, and L345R, which are situated in the transmembrane helices 1–9; and E110Q and W236R, which are located in the two large luminal loops. It is not unexpected that R83C and R83H mutations, which account for 40% of all G6Pase mutations identified, abolish G6Pase activity. Whereas the G222R mutation, located in helix 6, greatly reduces G6Pase activity (4% of WT activity), the other eight transmembrane helical mutations, D38V, V166G, P178S, G188S, G270V, R295C, ΔF327, and L345R, totally abolish enzymatic activity. The two luminal loop mutations, E110Q and W236R, retained 18.2 and 4.2% WT enzymatic activity, respectively. Our data suggest that the structural integrity of transmembrane helices in G6Pase is vital for catalysis. We demonstrate that mutations of amino acids comprising the transmembrane helices, including N276A, D38V, and P178S, destabilize the enzyme. Significantly lower amounts of N276A, D38V, or P178S mutant proteins were synthesized compared with the WT construct. Furthermore, the total loss of enzymatic activity seen in D38V and P178S mutants (14Parvari R. Lei K.-J. Szonyi L. Narkis G. Moses S. Chou J.Y. Euro. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Lei K.-J. Chen Y.-T. Chen H. Wong L.-J.C. Liu J.-L. McConkie-Rosell A. Van Hove J.L.K. Ou H.C.-Y. Yeh N.J. Pan L.Y. Chou J.Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 766-771PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the low levels of mutant enzymes synthesized cannot even function as a phosphohydrolase. It is possible that the structural requirement of the transmembrane helices is so rigid that the mutant enzymes that survive proteolytic degradation cannot fold properly for catalysis. We thank Drs. Margaret Chamberlin, Anil Mukherjee, and Borhane Annabi for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2009507746,"The effect of nonlamellar-prone lipids, diacylglycerol (DG) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), on the ATPase activity of SecA was examined. When Escherichia coli PE of the standard vesicles composed of 60 mol% of this lipid and 40 mol% of dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) is gradually replaced with either dioleoylglycerol (DOG) or dioeloyl PE (DOPE), the ATPase activity of SecA present together increased appreciably. On the other hand, when E. coli PE of the standard vesicles was replaced with DOG analogs, the SecA ATPase activity decreased slightly, and when replaced with phosphatidylcholine the decrease in the ATPase activity was more appreciable. When DOPE or E. coli PE was added to PC vesicles, the SecA ATPase activity was enhanced only slightly, suggesting that the hexagonal II structure per se is not important for the ATPase activity increase. It was observed that DOG induced phase separation of PG, and the lamellar-hexagonal II (L-HII) transition temperature of vesicles decreased by about 10 °C. The DOG analogs had no effect on these properties, suggesting the importance of the phase separation of PG and the decrease of L-HIItransition temperature of lipid bilayers to the SecA ATPase activity. The phase separation of PG by Ca2+ also brought about increased ATPase activity of SecA, underlining the importance of phase separation of PG for the enzyme activity. The incorporation of DOG or DOPE in the vesicle also increased the amount of SecA bound to model membranes and the extent of SecA penetration into the membrane. Studies with vesicles without SecA showed increased exposure of hydrophobic acyl chains when the DOG was present. Taken together, these observations suggest that the phase separation of PG and/or the bilayer penetration of SecA are mainly responsible for the enhanced SecA-vesicle interaction with concomitant increase in SecA ATPase activity.

SecA is the central protein component of the translocation machinery for the newly synthesized proteins in Escherichia coli. This protein exists as a homodimer of a 102-kDa subunit and is distributed in vivo about equally between the inner membrane and cytosol (1Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Qian L. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein translocation is brought about by a close cooperation between SecA, an ATPase, and other Sec proteins, such as SecB and SecY/E, and hydrolysis of ATP is required for this process (2Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 3Brundage L. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 62: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). SecA was also found to have another major function, an RNA helicase activity accompanying ATP hydrolysis, which may be necessary for the regulation of protein translocation (4Park S.K. Kim D.W. Choe J. Kim H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SecA binds to various phospholipid vesicles including those of phosphatidylcholine (PC). 1The abbreviations used are: PCphosphatidylcholinepyrenePE1-palmitoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamineDGdiacylglycerolDOG1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerolpyS DHPEN-(1-pyrenesulfonyl)-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolaminePEphosphatidylethanolamineDOPE1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamineDOPG1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)]POPC1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineNBD-PE1-palmitoyl-2-[12-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzodiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamineNBD-PG1-palmitoyl-2-[12-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzodiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)]THthe lamellar to hexagonal II phase transition temperaturePGphosphatidylglycerolL-HIIlamellar-hexagonal II. In solution, SecA has only a residual ATPase activity (5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Although no discernible increase in this enzyme activity can be seen in the presence of PC vesicles, a tremendous enhancement of its activity is observed in the presence of vesicles, which has similar composition as the E. coli inner membrane, 60% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 40% phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). This differential effect of the vesicle composition seems to be related to the extent of binding and penetration of SecA to the vesicles. More SecA binds to vesicles containing E. coli lipids than those of PC (6Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24596-24600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SecA also penetrates deep into the lipid bilayer (7Ulbrandt N.D. London E. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15184-15192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we have also found that SecA traverses the lipid bilayer (8Ahn T. Kim H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 9Ahn T. Kim H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12372-12379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the nonlamellar-prone lipid, PE, in the vesicles promotes the binding and penetration of SecA into the bilayer, which enhances the ATPase activity. In this connection, it is of interest that theE. coli membrane also contains another nonlamellar-prone lipid, diacylglycerol (DG), although the precise role of this lipid is not known. DG is a neutral lipid that can lower the lamellar to hexagonal II phase transition (L-HII) temperature (TH) of PE significantly (10Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7092-7095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Das S. Rand R.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2882-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Even at low (2–3 mol%) concentrations, the DG stabilizes the HII structure of PE (11Das S. Rand R.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2882-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 12Siegel D.P. Banschbach J. Yeagle P.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5010-5019Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In E. coli, DG accounts for about 1% of total membrane lipid, which depends on the growth conditions (13Raetz C.R.H. Newman K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3882-3887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in some mutant strains, about 8% of DG is present in the inner membrane (14Raetz C.R.H. Newman K.F. J.

The nonlamellar structure of membrane has been shown to play important roles in various cell functions. Several in vivo andin vitro studies indicated the involvement of nonlamellar structure of membrane in the translocation of secretory proteins across the plasma membrane (15Rietveld A.G. Koorengevel M.C. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5506-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Also, it was shown that nonlamellar lipid structure is induced by signal peptides (16Killian J.A. de Jong A.M. Ph. Bijvelt J. Verkleij A.J. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In particular, such activities as the ATP exchange by mitochondrial proteins (17Li L. Zheng L.X. Yang F.Y. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1995; 76: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and Ca2+-ATPase activity increase with increasing PE content (18Starling A.P. Dalton K.A. East J.M. Oliver S. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting importance of nonlamellar structure. In the present investigation, the possible effect of nonlamellar structure of model membrane to the SecA-membrane interaction is examined by increasing the nonlamellar-prone lipids such as dioleoylglycerol (DOG) and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) in the lipid vesicles. For this, we gradually replaced the E. coli PE in liposomes initially consisting of 60% E. coli PE and 40% dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) with DOG or DOPE and measured the SecA ATPase activity (5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). DOPE has a lower lamellar to hexagonal II transition temperature (12 °C) than theE. coli PE (about 55 °C) and assumes the HIIconformation at room temperature. Our results show that the ATPase activity of SecA is able to recognize the nonlamellar structure of membrane and its ATPase activity increases with increasing nonlamellar-prone lipid content. However, the bulk of ATPase activity increase accompanying the enhanced SecA binding to the vesicles seems to come from the phase separation of PG present together. Phospholipids and DOG were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and were used without further purification. Fluorescence probes were from Molecular Probes. Chloroform solutions of lipids were stored in sealed ampules under argon at −20 °C. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. SecA protein was purified from a SecA-overproducing strain (RR1/pMAN400) (19Kawasaki H. Matsuyama S. Sasaki S. Akita M. Mizushima S. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as described (9Ahn T. Kim H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12372-12379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The ATPase assay was performed in 100 μl of reaction buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mmMgCl2. The sample solutions containing 1.5 μg of SecA protein and liposomes were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min prior to the analysis of the released inorganic phosphate (Pi) as described (20Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by the addition of a color reagent (0.034% malachite green and 10.5 g/liter ammonium molybdate in 1 n HCl and 0.1% Triton X-100) and 100 μl of 34% citric acid solution. After standing for 30 min at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 660 nm. One unit of ATPase activity is defined as the hydrolysis of 1 pmol of ATP per minute. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Vesicles of mixed lipid composition ofE. coli PE/DOPE/DOPG, E. coli PE/egg PE/DOPG, orE. coli PE/DOG/DOPG were used throughout these investigations. The mole percentage of DOPG was fixed at 40%, but the initial 60 mol% of E. coli PE in the standard vesicles was varied by replacing it with either upward 5 mol% of DOG, 60 mol% of DOPE, or 60 mol% of egg PE. To prepare vesicles containing extrinsic fluorophores such as pyrene-labeled PE andN-(1-pyrenesulfonyl)-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (pyS DHPE), 2 mol% of these membrane probes were incorporated into liposomes. For determining the TH of liposomes, 1 mol% of 1-palmitoyl-2-[12-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzodiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (NBD-PE) was incorporated. To investigate the phase separation of lipids in the membranes, 10 mol% of NBD-PE or NBD-PG was incorporated into lipid bilayers. After dissolving an appropriate amount of lipids in chloroform to which butylated hydroxytoluene (10 mm) was added, the solvent was evaporated under a stream of argon gas. The dry lipids were hydrated in a buffer solution (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl and/or 1 mmNa-EDTA) followed by vigorous vortexing and a brief sonication in a bath sonicator for 30 s. To obtain homogeneous large unilamellar vesicles, the dispersions were frozen and thawed five times and passed 25 times through two 100-nm pore size polycarbonate membrane in an Extruder LiposoFast (Avestin Inc., Ottawa, Canada). All large unilamellar vesicles used for this work were apparently stable for at least 2 days. The change in the light-scattering intensity measured with spectrofluorometer at 450 nm during this time was less than 10%. Nonfluorescent phospholipids were determined by phosphorus assay (22Vaskovsky V.E. Kostetsky E.Y. Vasendin I.M. J. Chromatogr. 1975; 114: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), and those of pyrene-containing probes were determined spectrophotometrically at 342 nm using 42,000 cm−1 as the molar extinction coefficient (23Galla H.J. Hartmann W. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1980; 27: 199-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To measure the TH, the fluorescence intensity of NBD-PE incorporated into liposomes was measured as a function of temperature at 534 nm, with the excitation wavelength of 460 nm (24Hong K. Baldwin P.A. Allen T.M. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a Shimazu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorometer equipped with a thermostated cuvette compartment. The phase separation of lipids was monitored at 30 °C by the fluorescence of NBD-PE and NBD-PG in the lipid bilayers at the same excitation and emission wavelengths used for the measuring TH of liposomes. When determining the excimer to monomer (E/M) ratio of pyrene-labeled phospholipids, the excitation wavelength was 342 nm, and emission was in the range of 360–500 nm. The excitation and emission bandwidths were 3 and 10 nm, respectively. One milliliter of liposome solution in a quartz cuvette was used. To prevent the oxidation of polyunsaturated phospholipids and excimer fluorescence quenching effect by oxygen (25Chong P.L. Thompson T.E. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 613-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the buffer solution was saturated with argon gas for more than 2 h. To study the effect of nonlamellar-prone lipids on the binding of SecA to the model membrane, E. coli PE was replaced with DOG (up to 5 mol% of total lipid concentration) or DOPE or egg PE (each up to 1 mol fraction of total PE concentration). The effect of phase separation of lipids on the SecA binding to model membranes was also investigated by adding CaCl2 to liposomes containing 10 mol% NBD-PE or NBD-PG as a molecular probe. The amount of SecA bound to the membrane and the extent of its penetration into the bilayer were measured by resonance energy transfer from tryptophan (Trp) residues of SecA to pyS DHPE (7Ulbrandt N.D. London E. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15184-15192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (its pyrene is labeled at the ethanolamine group of PE) or pyrene-PE (pyrene group is located at the end of decanoyl chain at thesn-2 position of PE), respectively. 2 mol% each of pyrene probes was incorporated into lipid bilayer. 0.6 μm of SecA and lipid vesicles (to be in the range 50–800 of lipid/protein ratio) were used. The reaction samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, and then the fluorescence of Trp residues at 340 nm (excitation at 295 nm) or the pyrene intensity at 375 nm (342 nm of excitation wavelength) was measured to see the extent of the energy transfer between the fluorescence of Trp residues and pyrene probes. The spectrofluorometer used and the general procedure were the same as in the phase transition and phase separation. Fig. 1 A shows that the ATPase activity of SecA increased linearly with increasing concentration of DOG in the vesicles by as much as about 50% when DOG content reached 5 mol%. Above 5 mol% of DOG, the lipid vesicle did not form. Fig. 1 B shows that the ATPase activity was enhanced by about 50% when all of the E. coli PE in the standard vesicles was replaced by DOPE in the absence of DOG. However, only a slight increase in the ATPase activity was seen when egg PE was used as the substitute instead of DOG or DOPE. This differential ATPase activity increase seems to be related to the ease with which the L-HII transition occurs because the TH of DOPE, egg PE, and E. coli PE are 12, 45, and 55 °C, respectively (26Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Next, the effect of PE on the ATPase activity of SecA in the absence of acidic phospholipid, PG, was determined. Fig. 1 C shows that, when the content of E. coli PE or DOPE in 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) vesicles is increased, the ATPase activity of SecA increased linearly but with a much smaller extent than the case of standard vesicles containing PG. Here, DOPE showed a more pronounced effect on the activity than E. coli PE, which may arise from different TH values of these PEs. This result suggests that PE, a nonlamellar-prone lipid, itself is able to increase the ATPase activity of SecA only slightly in the absence of acidic phospholipids. Also, it should be noticed that vesicles containing DOPE, which is in the HII state at the experimental temperature of 37 °C, give only a slightly higher ATPase activity than the vesicles with E. coli PE, which is in the lamellar form. The effect of DOG analogs on the ATPase activity of SecA was also examined. Fig. 2 A shows that the ATPase activity decreased slightly with increasing vesicle concentrations of DG analogs. The DG analogs used here are 2-monooleoylglycerol, 1-monooleoylglycerol, dioleoyl-1-fluoro-2,3-propanediol, and dioleoyl-d-glyceramide. The ATPase activity also decreased when E. coli PE in the standard vesicles was replaced by PC, which is known to be a bilayer-forming lipid (Fig. 2 B). It is clear, therefore, that the propensity of HII formation as well as acidic phospholipids is essential for the increased ATPase activity of SecA. Rietveld et al. found that dioleoylphosphatidylcholine or dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine, both of which prefer a lamellar structure in the membrane, could not restore protein translocation inE. coli AD93 strain, which cannot synthesize PE when these lipids were incorporated into the inner membrane; however, DOPE did (15). Diacylglycerols are known as potent promoters of nonlamellar phases in various phospholipid systems. Therefore, we also investigated the effect of DOG and its analogs on the transition temperature of vesicle systems. Fig. 3shows that DOG decreased the TH of the standard vesicles by about 10 °C when 5 mol% DOG was incorporated. This result agrees well with the published data that, upon incorporation of as little as 1 mol% diolein or dilinolenin, the TH of fully hydrated POPE is lowered by approximately 9 °C (27Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7092-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 28Epand R.M. Bottega R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 944: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 29Breukink E. Demel R.A. de Korte-Kool G. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The effect of DOG analogs on the TH was also examined, and the results are shown in the inset of Fig. 3. It is clear that the presence of these analogs in the vesicle did not affect the TH. It should be remembered that these analogs did not influence the ATPase activity of SecA. Acidic phospholipids are essential components for the ATPase activity of SecA, and they promote SecA binding and insertion into model membranes (5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar,29Breukink E. Demel R.A. de Korte-Kool G. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It may be expected, therefore, that the local concentration of acidic phospholipids is one of the important factors determining the SecA ATPase activity and that this local concentration might be regulated by nonlamellar-prone lipids. To test this possibility, we utilized the self-quenching of the fluorescence of NBD-labeled phospholipids (30Graham J. Gagné J. Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7123-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) at 30 °C. Fig. 4shows that the increased DOG concentration in lipid bilayers brought about 13% quenching of the fluorescence of liposomes containing 10 mol% of NBD-PG (A) or NBD-PE (B) as compared with the value of the sample without DOG. This suggests that DOG promotes the phospholipid clustering in lipid bilayers inducing the formation of domains enriched with either PE or PG in the membrane. This also suggests that the increase of the ATPase activity of SecA by nonlamellar-prone lipids could arise from the clustering of acidic phospholipid, PG. In fact, we measured enzyme activity at 37 °C, which is below the L-HII phase transition temperature of liposomes (Fig. 3). In other words, liposomes are still in the lamellar structure at this temperature. So, we may deduce that the effect of nonlamellar-prone lipids on the ATPase activity of SecA is because of the formation of lipid domains enriched with acidic phospholipids. However, we cannot still preclude the possibility that the “propensity” of HII phase formation is important to regulate the ATPase activity of SecA from the observation that the presence of E. coli PE in PC vesicles showed slightly higher activity than the PC vesicle without PE (Fig. 1 C). It is most interesting that the DOG analogs, which did not induce an enhanced ATPase activity of SecA (Fig. 2 A), also did not promote the clustering of either NBD-PG or NBD-PE (Fig. 4). CaCl2-induced Phase Separation and Its Effect on the SecA ATPase Activity—To confirm the effect of phase separation of PG (Fig. 4) on the ATPase activity of SecA, we examined the influence of Ca2+-induced PG clustering on the SecA ATPase activity. When CaCl2 was added to the standard liposomes (60 mol%E. coli PE, 40 mol% DOPG) containing 10 mol% of NBD-PG, the fluorescence intensities decreased as a function of CaCl2 concentration, indicating the formation of PG domains in the membrane (Fig. 5 A). Fig. 5 A also shows Ca2+-induced phase separation of PG in the vesicles containing 60 mol% DOPE or 60 mol% POPC. DOPE is the most efficient in facilitating the formation of PG domains, and POPC exerted the least effect on the phase separation. Ca2+ stimulated the ATPase activity of SecA bound to the standard vesicles as well as to the vesicles that contain 60 mol% of POPC instead of the E. coli PE in the standard vesicles (Fig. 5 B). There is an initial sharp increase in the activity reaching a plateau around 1 mm of CaCl2, the effect on the E. coli PE vesicles being greater than that on the POPC vesicles. These results confirm that increase in the local PG concentration enhances the ATPase activity of SecA. These observations also suggest that the change of local concentration of acidic phospholipid, PG, because of the presence of DOG, is directly involved in the regulation of the ATPase activity of SecA bound to membranes. The effect of nonlamellar-prone lipids and phase separation induced by Ca2+ on the binding of SecA to model membranes at 30 °C was measured by the quenching of Trp residues of SecA by pyS DHPE incorporated into the standard vesicles (7Ulbrandt N.D. London E. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15184-15192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.6 A shows that F/F0values decreased with increasing concentration of DOG, indicating the increase in the SecA bound to model membranes. Both DOPE and egg PE also increased the amounts of SecA bound to membranes, but DOPE had a greater effect than egg PE as expected from their TH (Fig.6 B). It was reported that the increase in the acidic lipid enhances the binding of SecA to vesicles as well as its ATPase activity (5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that the increased binding to vesicles containing DOG or DOPE, rather than the formation of nonlamellar structure, is responsible for the enhancement of ATPase activity. The decreased F/F0 values with increasing Ca2+concentration (Fig. 6 C) indicates the enhanced SecA binding to lipid vesicles accompanying the phase separation. When the fact that DOG and Ca2+ effectively induce the phase separation of lipids in membranes is taken into account, this result strongly supports the notion that the change of local concentration of acidic phospholipids regulates the partitioning of SecA into the membranes. In other words, the formation of lipid domains enriched with acidic phospholipids enhances the amount of SecA bound to lipid bilayers and consequently increases the SecA ATPase activity. The effect of DOG on the insertion of SecA into lipid bilayer was tested with resonance energy transfer between the fluorescence of Trp residues in SecA and pyrene-labeled PE at 30 °C. The emission of Trp fluorescence and the excitation of pyrene show strong spectral overlap. Because the pyrene group is attached to the end of the decanoyl chain at thesn-2 position of PE, it is possible to use the energy transfer between these two fluorophores to determine the extent of SecA insertion into lipid bilayers. The extent of energy transfer increased with increasing concentration of DOG in the membranes, as shown by increasing intensity of pyrene fluorescence for monomer at 375 nm (Fig.7 A). DOPE also increased the incorporation of SecA into the membrane (Fig. 7 B), but there was little change of the energy transfer when egg PE was used. These results suggest that nonlamellar-prone lipids tested here promote the insertion of SecA into membrane. As control experiments, we measured the excimer (E) and monomer (M) fluorescence of pyrene-PE and pyS DHPE in the membrane and determined the E/M ratio to examine the distribution of pyrene probes. The E/M ratio reflects the enrichment of its local concentration in the membrane (31Somerharju P.J. Virtanen J.A. Eklund K.K. Vainio P. Kinnunen P.K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2773-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The E/M ratio did not change when PE was replaced by nonlamellar-prone lipids (data not shown), which indicates there was no redistribution of the probes in the presence of nonlamellar-prone lipids. To examine possible structural change in the membranes induced by DOG, we measured the fluorescence intensity of pyrene-PE, incorporated into the membrane, at 376 nm at several temperatures. The fluorescence decreased with increasing concentration of DOG in the membrane within the temperature range studied (Fig.8 A). This result suggests that DOG induces the exposure of fatty acyl chains of lipids from the interior of the membrane to the surface. However, the fluorescence intensities at different DOG content converged at 50 °C, indicating that the extent of exposure is similar at this temperature regardless of the presence of DOG. To confirm this result, we used the E/M ratio change caused by the collision between pyrene-PE and pyS DHPE, incorporated into E. coli PE/PG and PC vesicles, respectively. Fig. 8 B shows that the E/M ratio increased with increasing amount of DOG in the membrane at all temperatures tested. SecA is an unusual water-soluble protein that readily penetrates the lipid bilayer. It shows only a basal ATPase activity in aqueous solution, but the activity increases dramatically in the presence of vesicles containing negatively charged phospholipids. In the presence of PC vesicles, however, there is no appreciable enzyme activity other than the basal activity. In the present investigation, we observed that the DOG and DOPE, which are known to have a propensity of forming nonlamellar structure, when present in the vesicles with the lipid composition similar to theE. coli membrane, enhance the ATPase activity of SecA. Similar increase in biological activity by these nonlamellar-prone lipids was observed for a number of systems, and it was generally assumed that the phase transition from lamellar to HII is responsible for the increase. That this may not be the case is apparent in Fig. 1 C, which shows only a marginal increase in ATPase activity or SecA binding when the content of E. coli PE below its phase transition temperature or DOPE above the transition temperature in PC vesicle is increased. A number of additional experimental results, such as enhancement of ATPase activity when phase separation in the standard vesicle was induced by Ca2+, suggest that the phase separation rather than phase transition is mainly responsible for the increased enzyme activity. It seems that the DOG, a nonlamellar-prone lipid, promotes phase separation, although the precise reason of this is not clear. The DOG analogs, which do not induce phase separation, also do not affect the ATPase activity of SecA. In this connection, it is of interest that the cluster formation of acidic phospholipids decreases the DnaA protein affinity for ATP, suggesting that the phase separation of anionic phospholipids regulates DnaA protein activity (32Mizushima T. Ishikawa Y. Obana E. Hase M. Kubota T. Katayama T. Kunitake T. Watanabe E. Sekimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3633-3638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). At the moment, we do not have a satisfactory explanation for the increased ATPase activity of SecA accompanying phase separation of PG. The experimental results show that SecA binding and penetration into the membrane are enhanced by the phase separation. This may mean that SecA penetration prefers the PG clusters, and the increased ATPase activity is simply the consequence of increased SecA population that penetrated the membrane. The presence of DOG also induced the exposure of phospholipid acyl chains to the surface. This may be the result of the lamellar to HII transition, but the exposure may not be directly related to the phase separation. The exposure should certainly promote the SecA binding to the vesicles. It was shown that the C-terminal end of SecA is less stable than the rest of the SecA and that this is the domain penetrating the membrane (32Mizushima T. Ishikawa Y. Obana E. Hase M. Kubota T. Katayama T. Kunitake T. Watanabe E. Sekimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3633-3638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The penetration of the C-terminal end will bring about its separation from the N-terminal region of SecA. The N-terminal two-thirds of the SecA sequence contains the ATP binding sites, and the ATPase activity is known to be inhibited by the C-terminal end (33Song M. Kim H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) when SecA assumes the native structure. The insertion of C-terminal end into the membrane eliminates this inhibiting effect. Taken together, the presence of nonlamellar-prone lipid promotes L-HIItransition, bringing about phase separation of PG that, in turn, promotes the insertion of the C-terminal end of SecA. The removal of the inhibitory effect of the C-terminal end by its membrane insertion enhances the ATPase activity of the N-terminal side of SecA. Many natural membranes are rich in lipids that have strong propensities to form HII phases or nonlamellar membrane structures. The importance of these lipids in membranes on the enzyme activities and protein functions has already been suggested for ubiquinol-cytochromec reductase and mitochondrial H+-ATPase (17Li L. Zheng L.X. Yang F.Y. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1995; 76: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), rhodopsin (34Price A. Economou A. Duong F. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31580-31584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and alamethicin conductance states (35Brown M.F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 73: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Although these observations demonstrated the important role of nonlamellar membrane structures in the enzyme activities or protein functions, it is not yet clear whether phase separation is also involved in these systems. In relation to the translocation of preproteins in E. coli, Rietveld et al. (15Rietveld A.G. Koorengevel M.C. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5506-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) provided the first direct evidence for the role of nonlamellar-prone lipids to facilitate the passage of preproteins through the cell membrane (15Rietveld A.G. Koorengevel M.C. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5506-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Another example of the involvement of nonlamellar structure in the translocation is that functional signal peptides can induce the HII structure of membrane (16Killian J.A. de Jong A.M. Ph. Bijvelt J. Verkleij A.J. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the detailed role of nonlamellar-prone lipids in the E. coli translocation has not been elucidated."

How E. histolytica regulates these events is not understood, although regulation of transcription is likely to be an important mechanism of this control. Recently two papers have described transcriptional control of a drug resistance gene in E. histolytica (1Perez D.G. Gomez C. Lopez-Bayghen E. Tannich E. Orozco E. J. Biol.

The core promoter region in metazoans is the target of a variety of regulatory proteins that work in concert to direct the complex mechanisms of transcriptional control. Transcription of mRNA relies on the assembly of RNA polymerase II and a variety of other transcription factors (TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH) into a stable and functional preinitiation complex (10Roeder R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The preinitiation complex may assemble in a sequential manner on the DNA sequence of the core promoter, or a “holoenzyme” complex may form, which then binds specifically to the core promoter region (11Pugh B.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Both the TATA box and Inr regions appear to direct the formation of the preinitiation complex, control the site of transcription initiation, and regulate activation by upstream activator proteins (12Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Recently, variations to this classic core promoter architecture have been described. A third conserved core promoter element has been identified in a subset of TATA-less promoters of Drosophila (13Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), in the human angiotensinogen gene (14Yanai K. Nibu Y. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15981-15986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and the core promoter of the hepatocyte growth factor (15Jiang J.G. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5758-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A consensus element recognized by TFIIB and immediately adjacent to and upstream of TATA has also been described (16Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Thus, there appears to be an emerging body of literature on an alternative core promoter architectural structure. We have shown recently that the E. histolytica core promoter contains three elements that control the site of transcription initiation (9Singh U. Rogers J.B. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8812-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The amebic TATA (GTATTTAAA(G/C)) and Inr (AAAAATTCA) elements appear to function in a classic manner despite their sequence divergence from metazoans (9Singh U. Rogers J.B. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8812-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A unique third core promoter element GAAC (GAACT) was identified in 31/37 protein-encoding E. histolytica genes (17Purdy J.E. Pho L.T. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has a variable location between the TATA and Inr sequences, a characteristic not defined previously for core promoter transcription elements in metazoans. Mutation of this region in the hgl5 gene promoter had a greater effect on gene expression and selection of the site of transcription initiation than mutation of either the TATA or Inr regions (9Singh U. Rogers J.B. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8812-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These characteristics of the GAAC region would seem to usurp the dominant role of the TATA element in transcriptional control in E. histolytica. Our goal was to determine how the GAAC element in the hgl5 gene of E. histolytica regulates the rate and site of transcription initiation. This was undertaken by performing positional analysis of the GAAC region. We determined that it affected the rate of transcription, did not function as an enhancer element, and was able to direct a site of transcription initiation independent of a TATA or Inr element. An amebic nuclear protein was demonstrated to specifically interact with this DNA sequence as shown by EMSA. Based on the data, we have formulated a model for the role of the GAAC region in transcriptional control in E. histolytica. E. histolytica strain HM-1:IMSS trophozoites were cultured in TYI-S-33 medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) (18Diamond L.S. Harlow D.R. Cunnick C.C. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1978; 72: 431-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar). Stable transfection was performed using two promoter vectors (5′ hgl5-luciferase-hgl 3′ and 5′ actin-neor-actin 3′) described previously (19Vines R.R. Purdy J.E. Ragland B.D. Samuelson J. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Ramakrishnan G. Vines R.R. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The trophozoites were maintained at 24 μg/ml G418, and all Northern blot and primer extension analyses were performed on RNA isolated from stably transfected parasites maintained at this drug concentration. Positional analysis of the GAAC region was undertaken on the plasmids pTP.4i and pTP.GAAC-CLA (9Singh U. Rogers J.B. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8812-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Construction of the pTP.4i plasmid was described earlier and consists of a 272-bp hgl5 upstream region fused to a luciferase reporter gene and the 5′ actin region fused to the neomycin drug selection gene (9Singh U. Rogers J.B. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8812-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Purdy J.E. Pho L.T. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Ramakrishnan G. Vines R.R. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the plasmid pTP.GAAC-CLA the 5′ core promoter region of the hgl5 gene has the GAAC region mutated to a ClaI site (GAACT to CGATT). To introduce a GAAC region in the upstream location, we used a two-round PCR technique (17Purdy J.E. Pho L.T. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Previous analysis of the 5′-noncoding region of thehgl5 promoter had revealed that the region 20 bases upstream of the TATA sequence could be replaced by an AT-rich sequence without affecting gene expression (17Purdy J.E. Pho L.T. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This region was replaced in both pTP.4i and pTP.GAAC-CLA plasmids using a primer that introduced an intact GAAC region 22 bases upstream of the beginning of the TATA region. The primer used to generate this was 5′-AAAAGAAGGAAAGGAATGAACTAGTAATAATAGGAAAGG-3′, which introduced an SpeI site (underlined) downstream of the GAAC region (bold) that was used for diagnostic digests of possible clones. The first round of PCR used the above primer with the primer 5′-CTTTCTTTATGTTTTTGGCG-3′, which hybridized with the coding region of luciferase (bases 1727–1746 of pGEM-luc, Promega). This resulted in a 150-bp fragment that was then used as a primer for the second round of PCR using the primer 5′-CTACTGAAGCTTAGTAAAGAATAGTATTGA-3′ (containing aHindIII restriction site shown underlined for cloning) that hybridized at the 5′-end of the p-TP.4i plasmid. Using the same approach, the primer 5′-AAAAGAAGGAAAGGTGATCAAGTAAAATAATAGGAAAGG-3′ was used to clone an intact but inverse orientation GAAC (bold) with aBclI restriction site (underlined) into the coding strand at a region 22 bases upstream of the TATA region. Similarly a primer was designed to generate an intact GAAC region 10 bases downstream of the initiator region (5′-GACAAAGATATGAAAAATGAACTATGGATCCAAATG-3′). This resulted in a change in the amino acid sequence of thehgl5 fusion region between the start codons of thehgl5 and luciferase genes from that of wild type, but did not generate any nonsense or stop codons. The wild type amino acid sequence is (Lys-Leu-Leu-Leu-Trp-Ile-Glu) and was changed to (Lys-Asn-Glu-Leu-Trp-Ile-Glu). Each primer had at least 14 bases of sequence homology upstream and downstream of the mutations to allow for hybridization with the backbone. These colonies were screened by restriction enzyme analysis where appropriate or by sequence analysis. All constructs used in our experiments were sequenced in their entirety to rule out PCR-induced mutations. Northern blot analysis was done as described previously (9Singh U. Rogers J.B. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8812-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 13 μg of RNA was utilized for each construct, and the blot was probed with radiolabeled denatured DNA probes. The DNA probes consisted of the coding regions of luciferase and neomycin, which were extracted by digestion of the pTP-Luc plasmid (20Ramakrishnan G. Vines R.R. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and pTCV1 plasmid (19Vines R.R. Purdy J.E. Ragland B.D. Samuelson J. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) byBamHI and SalI. These probes were labeled with random primers, the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and [α-32P]dCTP. The procedure was done as described previously (20Ramakrishnan G. Vines R.R. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, stably transfected trophozoites, maintained in TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with 24 μg/ml G418, were chilled on ice and the number of cells counted and harvested. These were then centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5), and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer with the addition of protease inhibitors E64-C and leupeptin. Lysates were assayed following serial dilution to 10−3 or 10−4. Samples were prepared in triplicate and assayed at room temperature with a Turner luminometer model TD-20E (Promega). Luciferase activity per cell was calculated as a measure of reporter gene expression. Nuclei were harvested from 5 × 107 logarithmically growing trophozoites stably transfected with the plasmid of interest and stored at −70 °C (21Bruchhaus I. Leippe M. Lioutas C. Tannich E. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 925-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These were thawed on ice, and the nuclear run on was performed as described (22Greenberg M.E. Bender T.P. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 4.10.1-4.10.11Google Scholar). RNA extraction was performed using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (RNagen kit, Promega). Approximately 1.2 pmol of DNA probes (luciferase, neomycin, and 272-bp promoter of thehgl5 gene) were purified, denatured, and dot-blotted onto Zeta-Probe GT genomic blotting membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated with the prehybridization solution at 65 °C for 20 min, denatured RNA probe was added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 65 °C. The membrane was washed at 65 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Primer extension analysis was performed as described previously using polyadenylated mRNA from stably transfected amebae (9Singh U. Rogers J.B. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8812-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Primer extension was performed using the Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and run next to the appropriate sequencing ladder on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Sequencing was performed using the circumvent thermal cycle sequencing system (New England Biolabs) using the α-35S-labeled dATP incorporation method. To rule out contaminating or nonspecific extension products, all mRNA samples were treated in DNase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol) with 10 units of RNase-free DNase at 37 °C for 60 min followed by overnight ethanol precipitation prior to primer extension experiments. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the methods described previously (23Gilchrist C.A. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2383-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assays was 5′-AAGACAATGAACTAGAATG-3′ with an intact GAAC region (bold) but with a mutated and truncated Inr region (italics). The oligonucleotide used for the gel shift assays did not contain a TATA region. An E. histolytica hgl5 promoter sequence (5′-AATTCTGTTATATGATCATTTGGTTTGTAATTACAGCTGG-3′) and an oligonucleotide (5′-AAGACCTACGATAAGAATG-3′) with a mutated GAAC region (bold) were used as double-stranded competitors for the gel shift assay. The probe was purified by a polyacrylamide gel extraction procedure (24Chory J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 2.7.1-2.7.8Google Scholar). Modifications on this method included the incubation of the polyacrylamide gel section containing the probe at 37 °C overnight in elution buffer (TE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) with 100 mm NaCl) prior to centrifugation for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was then saved and the pellet washed with an additional 400 μl of elution buffer and re-centrifuged. The two supernatants were combined, the pellet discarded, and the filtered probe was ethanol-precipitated at −70 °C. One pmol of this purified probe was labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and purified from unincorporated nucleotide by a NucTrap column (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The protein-DNA interaction occurred in band shift buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% non-fat milk powder (Carnation), 3% glycerol, 0.05 mg of bromphenol blue). To this reaction mixture 0.5 μg of salmon sperm, 25 fmol of DNA probe, and 1.2 μg of nuclear extract were added (25Miglarese M.R. Richardson A.F. Aziz N. Bender T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22697-22705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The reaction was allowed to incubate at room temperature (20 °C) for 1 h prior to the electrophoresis of the reaction mix on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel for 2–3 h (26Buratowski S. Chodosh L.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 12.2.1-12.2.11Google Scholar). The gel was then fixed, dried, and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. Previously we had shown that mutation of the GAAC region in the core promoter of the hgl5 gene of E. histolytica resulted in decreased reporter gene expression and mRNA levels (9Singh U. Rogers J.B. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8812-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since the GAAC element has been shown to have a variable location between the TATA and Inr regions, we hypothesized that it may function in a position-independent manner to control the rate of gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we performed positional analysis of the GAAC region in the hgl5 gene promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene. The GAAC region was placed upstream of the TATA region by 22 bases. Alternatively GAAC was placed downstream of the Inr by 10 bases or one helical turn (Fig.1). These plasmids were electroporated into trophozoites and selected for stable transfectants by drug (G418) selection. Northern blots were performed with total RNA harvested from the trophozoites (Fig. 2). Luciferase assays were performed on cells stably transfected with various constructs (Fig. 2). Mutation of the GAAC region in the core promoter resulted in a decrease in luciferase message to 38% of wild type, as reported previously (Fig. 2 A) (9Singh U. Rogers J.B. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8812-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Insertion of a wild type GAAC sequence upstream of a mutated core promoter, in either the native or inverse orientation, did not reconstitute luciferase message to wild type levels (Fig. 2, C and D) and in fact resulted in luciferase enzyme activity that was 17 and 7.4% of wild type. Insertion of a wild type GAAC sequence 22 bases upstream of a wild type core promoter also resulted in a marked diminution of reporter gene message levels and luciferase expression was 43% of wild type (Fig. 2 B). Insertion of a wild type GAAC sequence downstream of a wild type core promoter resulted in moderate enhancement of message accumulation and luciferase levels were 284% of wild type (Fig. 2 E). Insertion of a GAAC region downstream of a mutated core promoter resulted in decreased luciferase message and enzyme levels were 44.5% of wild type (Fig. 2 F). Thus, the GAAC element was not able to regulate the level of gene expression in a position-independent manner. In addition, it controls the transcription start site; therefore this sequence does not meet the classical definition of an enhancer element. mRNA in E. histolytica usually has a short 5′-untranslated region, and transcripts with long 5′-untranslated regions in this organism may be unstable. Thus Northern blot and primer extension data on mRNA may not accurately reflect the rate of transcription initiation from a particular site. Nuclear run on assays were done on selected constructs to determine the role of this region in regulating the rate of transcription from a particular site. Fig.3 shows the data from nuclear run on assays done on nuclei harvested from trophozoites stably transfected with the wild type construct, a core promoter with a mutated GAAC region (Fig. 3, lane A), and core promoter with a mutated GAAC region but an upstream wild type GAAC (Fig. 3, lane C). Newly transcribed RNA obtained from the run on assays was hybridized with probes for neomycin, luciferase, and the 5′-noncoding region of the hgl5 gene. Neomycin was utilized as a control message, and all exposures were developed to obtain equivalent neomycin signal. In the wild type construct, the luciferase message was evident; however, there was no measurable signal at the 5′-noncoding region of the hgl5 gene. In the construct with a core promoter with a mutated GAAC region, the luciferase message was not detected. In a construct with a core promoter with a mutated GAAC region and a GAAC region inserted in the upstream region (Fig. 3 C), RNA from both the luciferase and 5′-untranslated region regions was detected. The magnitude of these signals relative to the neomycin signal was roughly equivalent. This distribution of transcript abundance was reflected in the intensity of bands from the two transcription start sites seen in the primer extension analysis of this construct (Fig.4 C), indicating that the RNA generated from the various start sites was stable and that primer extension analysis is an accurate method for quantitating the abundance of message from a particular transcription initiation site. These data confirmed that the GAAC element controlled gene expression by regulating the rate of transcription.Figure 4Primer extension analysis of mRNA transcribed from hgl5 promoter constructs with mutated GAAC (A) and upstream and downstream positional variants of the GAAC region (B, C, D,E, and F). The lettering matches the constructs shown in Fig. 1. The extension products are located to theright of the sequencing ladders in the (+)mRNA lane. The location of each element (Inr, GAAC, TATA) is labeled on the DNA sequence. The main primer extension product is marked with alarge arrow, and minor extension products are marked withsmall arrows. Primer extension was performed using 20 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA in A, 80 μg inB, 40 μg in C, 60 μg in D, 5 μg in E, and 20 μg in F. All samples were DNase-treated before primer extension experiments. Quantitative results of the primer extension products were generated using PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics 425) and Image Quant 1.1 (Macintosh).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Northern blot data showed that addition of a wild type GAAC region upstream of a core promoter with a mutated GAAC element did not reconstitute reporter gene expression to wild type levels. Previous data has shown that mutation of the GAAC region results in a major transcription start site at the Inr and multiple minor (4% compared with the Inr start site) transcription start sites up to −90 (Fig. 4 A). We therefore wished to determine the effect of changes in position of wild type GAAC on transcription start site. Insertion of a wild type GAAC region upstream of a wild type or mutated core promoter resulted in the appearance of new transcription start sites (Fig. 4, B and C). In the wild type core promoter construct (Fig. 4 B), transcription initiated 2–7 bases downstream of the new GAAC element and at the Inr region. The new start site downstream of GAAC was quantitated to be 19% of the Inr start site in that construct. When a GAAC region was placed upstream of a mutated core promoter GAAC region (Fig. 4 C) a new transcription start site appeared 3–4 bases downstream of this element, which was relatively equal in intensity (80%) to the wild type start site in that construct. The placement of an inverse GAAC region upstream of a mutated core promoter resulted in a new transcription start site 5 bases downstream of the GAAC region, which was 56% of the wild type start site in that construct (Fig.4 D). Analysis of downstream GAAC regions showed that placement of a wild type GAAC region downstream of a wild type or mutated core promoter resulted in the generation of a new start site 2–3 bases downstream of the GAAC sequence (Fig. 4, E andF). Similar to earlier results, in the context of a mutated core promoter (Fig. 4 F), the new start sites generated by the GAAC region appeared to be of equal intensity to that of wild type (113% compared with the Inr site), whereas in the context of a wild type core promoter (Fig. 4 E), the wild type start site at the Inr was dominant (new start site was 49% of the wild type site). Thus, this data indicated that the GAAC region was capable of controlling a transcription start site independent of TATA and Inr. In eukaryotes this function had previously been assigned exclusively to the TATA and Inr regions of the core promoter. To determine whether the GAAC sequence functioned by interacting with a sequence specific amebic nuclear protein, we utilized EMSA analysis. Amebic nuclear extracts were hybridized with a double-stranded oligonucleotide with the GAAC sequence to identify DNA-protein interactions. EMSA was performed with a probe that contained no TATA region, a mutated and truncated Inr region, and a wild type GAAC region from the hgl5 gene. This oligonucleotide was constructed to prevent DNA-protein interactions with the other core promoter elements, the TATA and Inr. Incubation of the probe with crude amebic nuclear extract revealed two bands; the lane with probe alone and no amebic nuclear protein had no bands (Fig. 5). Competition experiments were done to determine the specificity of the DNA-protein interaction. The lower band (small arrow) represents a nonspecific DNA-protein interaction as its intensity is not altered by self, unrelated, or mutant competition. Since the oligonucleotide for the EMSA analysis did not contain functional TATA or Inr regions, any specific DNA-protein interaction seen in the EMSA can be ascribed to the GAAC region. Competition assays with self cold unlabeled probe at 2 × and 4 × revealed that a band (Fig. 5, large arrow) was competed by the cold competitor. An unlabeled, unrelated amebic promoter sequence and an oligonucleotide with a mutated GAAC region did not compete this specific band to the same degree. This demonstrated specificity of the DNA-nuclear protein interaction for the oligonucleotide with the GAAC sequence and indicated that the GAAC region specifically recognizes an amebic nuclear protein. The major conclusion from this study is that the third core promoter element GAAC (GAACT) in the hgl5 gene of E. histolytica (i) independently directs a new site of transcription initiation, (ii) controls the rate of transcription initiation, and (iii) interacts in a sequence-specific manner with an amebic nuclear protein (GAAC binding protein(s), GBP(s)). The role of the GAAC region in the hgl5 gene was determined by reporter gene assays, Northern blot analysis, and nuclear run on assays, all of which indicated that the GAAC region controls the rate of transcription. The GAAC element of the hgl5 gene in E. histolytica is able to control a transcription start site independent of TATA and Inr regions. We demonstrated that positional manipulation of the GAAC region, separated from the TATA and Inr core promoter, resulted in new transcription start sites 2–7 bases downstream of itself. This result occurred consistently with upstream and downstream positioning of the GAAC element and regardless of whether the core promoter region contained a wild type or mutated GAAC sequence. In the context of a wild type core promoter (i.e.wild type TATA, GAAC, and Inr regions) the dominant start site was always in the Inr region regardless of whether a GAAC region was inserted in an upstream or downstream location. However, when the core promoter contained a mutated GAAC sequence, the insertion of a wild type GAAC region in the upstream or downstream location resulted in new transcription start sites that were of equal intensity to that of the wild type Inr site. Thus, in the wild type promoter the interaction between the three regions and the proteins that bind to them are dominant in controlling the transcription initiation site. However, in the context of a mutated GAAC region, this dominance is lost, and new transcription initiation sites (directed by the GAAC region) occur. The GAAC sequence was also able to direct a new site of transcription initiation in an inverse orientation, most likely through the creation of a cryptic GAAC site. The identification of a third core promoter element that controls the site of transcription initiation is unprecedented in eukaryotes. We hypothesized that the GAAC sequence functioned to control the site of transcription initiation via a DNA-protein interaction. The results of the EMSA analysis revealed that an amebic nuclear protein(s), GBP, interacted specifically with the GAAC region. Competition assays with an unrelated hgl5 promoter sequence and an oligonucleotide with a mutated GAAC region pointed to the specificity of this interaction. In the analysis of the EMSA results, it is important to realize that the GAAC-GBP interaction apparently was not dependent on DNA-TBP or DNA-Inr binding protein interactions, since the EMSA probe did not contain functional TATA or Inr regions. The implication is, therefore, that although TBP may require GBP for DNA binding, the GBP does not require TBP or Inr binding protein(s) for accurate and specific DNA binding. Once the amebic GBP and TBP have been isolated, the specific DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions can be characterized in greater detail. The requirement for a gene or a family of genes to have three core promoter elements is unclear: why would transcription of protein encoding genes in E. histolytica be dependent on a third regulatory region? Perhaps the E. histolytica TFIID complex has multiple DNA binding regions composed of TBP, GBP, and Inr binding proteins. A variety of pre-assembled TFIID complexes could exist, containing some or all of the core promoter-binding proteins. These different TFIID complexes could differentially regulate a variety of core promoters containing all three or only one or two of these regulatory regions. A second model is based on the fact that TBP in vitro is able to bind to multiple AT-rich sequences (27Zenzie-Gregory B. Khachi A. Garraway I.P. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3841-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that the specificity of TBP binding to the TATA region is conferred in large part by its proximity to other regulatory regions (28Taylor I.C.A. Kinston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In an AT-rich organism such as E. histolytica a mechanism may have developed in which a factor such as GBP localizes TBP to the promoter. Thus a model can be hypothesized in which transcription in E. histolytica hgl5 genes may be dependent on protein-protein interactions in which GBP functions to “tether” or localize TBP/TFIID to the core promoter. Precedence for both these models can be found in the metazoan literature. It has been shown that TFIID can bind multiple regions of the core promoter, including the TATA and Inr regions (29Kaufmann J. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and Kadonaga has also demonstrated binding of this protein to another core promoter regulatory region, the distal promoter element (13Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In support of the second model is the existence of factors such as TFIIA, which stabilize the binding of TFIID to the core promoter TATA box (30Imbalzano A. Zaret K.S. Kingston R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8280-8286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both models provide for a basal complex that has multiple sites to regulate transcription in response to cellular and environmental stimuli. In conclusion, we have described, for the first time in the metazoan transcription literature, a third core promoter region, GAAC, which is independently able to direct a site of transcription initiation. This sequence from the hgl5 gene of E. histolytica has been shown to interact in a sequence specific manner with an amebic nuclear protein (GBP). The presence of this regulatory core promoter region raises intriguing questions regarding transcriptional control in this primitive protozoan parasite. It is important to consider the possible presence of similar yet to be identified regulatory proteins in other eukaryotes. The isolation of the GAAC-binding protein and characterization of its role in transcriptional control are the next steps in elucidating the role of GBP in the transcriptional machinery of E. histolytica. We thank Barbara Mann, David Auble, and William A. Petri, Jr. for excellent discussions and scientific input."
https://openalex.org/W2103772349,"The substitution of a glycine for glutamic acid at position 89 in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) (E89G) confers resistance to several nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors of RT. As residue 89 contacts the template strand, it has been suggested that this mutation may modulate the conformation of the RT·template/primer complex. In addition, certain mutations in RT that confer resistance to nucleoside analogs, such as M184V, are located near the polymerase active site. To characterize further these substitutions, we performed processivity assays alongside an analysis of pausing profiles with wild-type (wt) RT and recombinant RTs containing substitutions at E89G, M184V, or both. We now show that E89G RT has higher processivity than wt enzyme as well as a different pattern of pausing sites. Similar findings were obtained with the doubly mutated RT, although enzyme containing only the M184V mutation had lower processivity than wt. Consistent with these observations, and from a mechanistic standpoint, both E89G-containing as well as doubly mutated RT had decreased dissociation constants from a complex consisting of RT and template-primer, in comparison with either wt RT or M184V-containing RT. No significant differences were observed among the various enzymes in regard to Km values for the heteropolymeric RNA template used in these studies. Viruses containing the E89G mutation synthesized longer strand DNA products than either wt viruses or viruses containing only the M184V mutation in endogenous RT assays. Thus, the E89G substitution is a dominant determinant in regard to each of the koffvalues from an RT·template/primer complex, RT processivity, and specific patterns of pausing during DNA polymerization."

In the present study, we report identification and characterization of a novel sequence motif residing in the 5′-flanking region of the human DBH gene, which mediates transcriptional induction by TPA. Deletional analyses indicated the promoter region between −223 and −187 base pairs to be critical. Whereas this region does not contain any putative regulatory motifs with significant sequence homology to the AP-1 motif, extensive deletional and site-directed mutational analyses indicated that a sequence between −210 and −199 base pairs, 5′-ATCCGCCTGTCT-3′, may represent a novel TPA-response element (TRE). In addition, alteration of the YY1-binding site decreased TPA-mediated induction of the DBH promoter activity, suggesting that contiguouscis-regulatory element(s) cooperate with this novel sequence motif. Furthermore, insertional mutation analyses between the YY1-binding site and the cyclic AMP-responsive element indicated that the stereospecificity of these motifs is important for intact transcriptional induction by TPA. Taken together, these data suggest that transcriptional up-regulation of the human DBH gene in response to TPA requires coordination of a novel TRE (human DBH TRE, hDTRE), cyclic AMP-responsive element, and the YY1-binding site.

Analysis of the human and rat DBH promoters have identified several cis-acting DNA elements that may play a role in regulation of DBH transcription. Several consensus sequences such as the cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE; −181 bp to −174 bp), activator protein 2 element (+2 bp to +9 bp and −666 bp to −659 bp), glucocorticoid-responsive element (−473 bp to −459 bp), AP-1-like sequence (−172 bp to −166 bp), and neuron-restrictive silencer element-like sequence (−390 bp to −388 bp) are reported to be present in the promoter region of the human DBH gene (1Kobayashi K.

CRE is a well known DNA element that exists in the promoter region of many genes, involved in the signal transduction pathway via protein kinase A (PKA) (5Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A.

Nature. 1988; 336: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). When the Ser-133 amino acid residue of the CRE-binding protein (CREB) is phosphorylated by the PKA pathway, transcriptional up-regulation of genes occurs (7Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). The role of CRE in human DBH gene function was initially demonstrated in human SK-N-SH-TFM and SK-N-BE(2)C neuroblastoma cell lines (2Lamouroux A. Houhou L. Biguet N.F. Serck-Hanssen G. Guibert B.

It was found not only to enhance transcription with PKA activators such as cAMP plus 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, dibutyryl cAMP, or forskolin, but also to be an essential element for the constitutive transcription. Phosphorylation of CREB by PKA directly affects the transcriptional level of the human DBH gene as proved by experiments using co-expression of the catalytic subunit of PKA or its specific inhibitors, as well as in PKA-deficient PC12 cell lines (8Kim K.S.

A negative regulatory element of the human DBH gene functions as a silencer at the transcriptional level in neuronal and non-neuronal cells (4Ishiguro H. Kim K.S. Joh T.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 34: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This negative regulatory element of the human DBH gene has a sequence similar to that of the neuron-restrictive silencer element in many neuronal genes (9Kraner S.D. Chong J.A. Tsay H.J. Mandel G. Neuron. 1992; 9: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 10Mori N. Schoenherr C. Vandenbergh D.J. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). However, the neuron-restrictive silencer element-like sequence of the human DBH promoter fails to bind recombinant neuron-restrictive silencer factor (11Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). YY1 and activator protein 2 in the nuclear fraction of SK-N-BE(2)C cells specifically bind to the human DBH promoter, but the nuclear protein fraction of HeLa cells does not make a complex with these elements (12Seo H. Yang C. Kim H.S. Kim K.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4102-4112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that multiple proteins bind to the DBH promoter region interacting co-operatively for cell type-specific transcriptional activation. Functional analyses of the elements in the rat DBH promoter region have involved the use of cell culture systems. Although the identified CREs have unusual sequences, i.e. CGTCA (−232 bp to −228 bp) and TGCGTCA (−173 bp to −167 bp), the DNA fragment DB-1 (−180 bp to −151 bp) of the rat promoter region has an enhancer function (13Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnani L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Afar et al. (14Afar R. Silverman R. Aguanno A. Albert V.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) reported that one CRE (−174 bp TCCTGCGTCATTA −161 bp) binds the activating transcription factor 1. Transcriptional enhancement of the rat DBH gene by treatment of PC12 cells with dibutyryl cAMP has been reported. In addition, Arix, which is a homologue of the mouse homeodomain protein Phox2, binds to the DB1 enhancer element of the rat DBH promoter (15Zellmer E. Zhang Z. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8109-8120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Phox2a knockout mice provided evidence that Phox2a plays a key role in the development of noradrenergic neural traits (16Morin X. Cremer H. Hirsch M.R. Kapur R.P. Goridis C. Brunet J.F. Neuron. 1997; 18: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Analyses indicated that a negative regulatory region (−282 bp to −232 bp) that controls the tissue-specific expression of the rat DBH gene exists upstream of the DB-1 enhancer and that the activator protein 2 (−129 bp to −120 bp) element plays a role in maintaining basal levels of rat DBH transcription (17Shaskus J.

In many cases, the regulation is negative, but positive control may also be exerted depending on the promoter sequences (42Hariharan N. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2497-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar,44Kim J. Shapiro D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In certain cases, YY1, TFIIB, and RNA polymerase II function to transcribe the DNA directly without a TATA-binding protein (45Usheva A. Shenk T. Cell. 1994; 76: 1115-1121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). YY1 interacts with TATA-binding protein, CREB-binding protein, TFIIB, and TAFII55 (46Austen M. Luscher B. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1709-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), implying that these basal transcriptional factors may interact with one other in offering the human DBH promoter. In the present study, we identified a TPA-responsive element (TRE) in the promoter region of the human DBH gene (hDTRE) and a hDTRE-binding protein. The response to TPA stimulation was determined and characterized using combinations of the DNA element with hDTRE-binding protein, YY1, and CREB (or CREB-binding protein). The mechanism of the TPA response in the hDTRE was found to differ from that of AP-1 (TGA(C/G)TCA) in many other genes. SK-N-SH cells (RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba Science City) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For optimization of cell growth for experiments, fresh medium was supplied every 3 days, and cultures were split at intervals of 3–5 days. Cells were treated with 162 nm TPA or 10 μm forskolin for 6 or 18 h before harvesting. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared by oligo(dT)-cellulose affinity column chromatography, electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel, transferred to the Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary diffusion, and then hybridized with human DBH or glyceroaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes. Hybridized membranes were placed in contact with BAS1000 plates (type BAS-IIIs) and analyzed with a BAS1000 Bio-Imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo). Sequences of OLI-63 and OLI-42 cover the DNA regions of human DBH promoter from −224 to −162 bp and from −224 to −183 bp, respectively. OLI-A (−224 to −199 bp), OLI-B (−206 to −181 bp), OLI-C (−186 to −161 bp), and OLI-D (−213 to −183 bp) completely cover the region of the OLI-63 sequence. OLI-Cm1, OLI-Cm2, OLI-Cm3, OLI-Cm4, and OLI-Cm5 are changed from OLI-C, and OLI-Dm1 and OLI-Dm2 from OLI-D, in the sites indicated in Fig.2 A. OLI-Cm1 has CRE, YY1 binding, and E-box sequences. OLI-Cm2 has CRE and YY1 binding sequences. OLI-Cm3 has the CRE and E-box sequences. OLI-Cm4 has only the CRE sequence. OLI-Cm5 has YY1 binding, E-box, and AP-1-like sequences, but not the CRE sequence. OLI-hTH/C, OLI-hSOM/C, OLI-hTH/AP, and OLI-mo/Y are the respective DNA elements for CRE of human tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), CRE of human somatostatin, AP-1 of human TH, and the YY1 binding sequence of the mouse c-fos gene. Sense and antisense strands of oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase and used as probes. Nuclear protein fractions (10-μg aliquots) were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (47Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) and mixed with approximately 10,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe (0.15 ng) in binding buffer (4 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)2 at room temperature for 20 min. Complexes of oligonucleotides and nuclear protein fractions were resolved on nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the phosphoramidite method with an Applied Biosystems model 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Perkin-Elmer) and their sequences confirmed with a 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) (see Fig. 2 A) using luciferase constructs or plasmid vectors. Competition experiments were performed by adding appropriate amounts of cold oligonucleotide to the nuclear protein fraction before admixture of the probe. For antibody experiments, anti-c-Fos or anti-YY1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were preincubated with nuclear protein fraction for 30 min at room temperature. After a 20-min incubation of this mixture with radiolabeled probe, the complete mixture was electrophoresed in a 6% nondenatured acrylamide gel. Anti-c-Fos antibody reacts with c-Fos and c-Fos-related proteins such as Fos B, Fra-1, and Fra-2. Anti-YY1 antibody reacts specifically with YY1 protein of the mouse, rat, and human. Construction of 604Luc and other luciferase fusion plasmids containing shorter upstream sequences of the human DBH gene (604Luc, 486Luc, and 262Luc plasmids) were constructed by subcloning the KpnI-XhoI DNA fragment (−604 to +10 bp), ApaI-XhoI DNA fragment (−486 to +10 bp), and PstI-XhoI DNA fragment (−262 to +10 bp) from the human 4.3CAT construct (3Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17987-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into a PGVB plasmid vector (PicaGene, Toyoink). Other deletion plasmids were constructed by Bal-31 nuclease deletion using PstI-digested 604Luc. For construction of 604 m2Luc, 604Cm1Luc, 604Cm2Luc, 604Cm3Luc, 604Cm4Luc, 604+5Luc, and 604+10Luc, mutated plasmid vectors were generated by the PCR technique using the primers shown in Figs. 2 A and 6. Mutated sense and antisense oligonucleotides of these PCR primers, and 5′ (GGTACTGTAACTGAGCTAACA, sense) and 3′ (CCATTTTACCAACAGTACCGGA, antisense) primers of the PGVB, were prepared. The PCR was carried out using 604Luc as a template DNA and the combination of either sense mutated oligonucleotide and the 3′ primer (antisense) or antisense mutated oligonucleotide and the 5′ primer (sense). PCR products were extracted and mixed with each other. The 5′ (sense) and 3′ (antisense) primers of PGVB synthesize the human DBH promoter with mutated oligonucleotides. These DNAs were cloned into the pT7Blue vector (Novagen), and the sequences were confirmed with a 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). They were then recloned into the PGVB vector, and luciferase constructs were purified for transient transfection assays. Insertion of multiple oligonucleotides upstream of the tk promoter attached to the PGVB at the site of XhoI was also performed. A 1000 molar excess of phosphorylated oligonucleotides was incubated with SmaI-digested PGVB vector, T4 DNA ligase, andSmaI at 16 °C for 3 h. After heat inactivation of the ligase activity, these vectors were again digested withSmaI, and the host bacteria were transformed with the DNAs. The sequences of the DNA samples were confirmed, and the DNAs were prepared for the transient transfection assay. To compare the promoter activities of different constructs, we introduced plasmid DNAs into SK-N-SH cells by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (48Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar) as described earlier (49Kim K.S. Lee M.K. Carroll J. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15689-15695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All transfection experiments were repeated three to five times, utilizing plasmid constructions that were independently prepared at least twice. When cells reached approximately 60% confluence, an equimolar (0.7 pmol) amount of each plasmid construct was used with 1 μg of pRSV-β-galactosidase (pRSV-βGal) to transfect SK-N-SH cells. Cells in a 60-mm dish received a total of 5 μg of DNA. When required, cells were treated with 162 nmTPA or 10 mm forskolin for 6 h before the cell extraction. Because the transfection efficiencies were different among DNA precipitates, luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase activity was measured by the method by Williams et al. (50Williams T.M. Burlein J.E. Ogden S. Kricka L.J. Kant J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using Lumat (Berthold, LB-9501) and β-galactosidase activity as described previously (51An G. Hidaka K. Siminovitch L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results were expressed as luciferase units calculated by luciferase activity (100 μl/h)/β-galactosidase activity (100 μl/h). Northern blot analyses were performed to analyze transcriptional regulation of the human DBH gene in response to addition of forskolin or TPA to culture of the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH. The steady state level of DBH mRNA dramatically increased following treatment with either forskolin or TPA (Fig.1 A), confirming that the SK-N-SH cell line is a good experimental system to study molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional induction of the human DBH gene under these conditions. To identify the TPA-responsive DNA region of the human DBH promoter, we examined a series of deletional constructs containing different lengths of the upstream DBH region fused to the reporter luciferase gene in transient transfection assay. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the 187Luc construct caused a significantly lower level of induction of luciferase activity (4-fold the control) by TPA than the 223Luc construct (24-fold the control). Whereas these results indicate that the upstream region between −223 and −187 bp may contain sequence information that mediates transcriptional induction by TPA, this region does not contain nucleotide sequences with sequence homology with the AP-1 motif (5′-TGA(C/G)TCA-3′) (Fig. 1 C). To investigate DNA-protein interactions of the TPA-responsive region, we performed EMSA using an oligonucleotide (OLI-63) that encompasses the novel TPA-response DNA domain as well as the contiguous CRE- and YY1-binding motifs as a probe (Fig.2 A). As shown in Fig.2 B, OLI-63 produced two major DNA-protein complexes with slow (band A) and fast mobility (band B). Molar excess of cold OLI-63 diminished both, indicating that these bands represent specific DNA-protein complexes. OLI-42 encompassing the 5′ side of the OLI-63 was able to compete for formation of band A. In contrast molar excesses of shorter oligonucleotides containing the CRE of human TH or human somatostatin genes, the AP-1 motif of the human TH gene, or the YY1 binding sequence of the mouse c-fos gene were without effect. To determine the DNA subdomain within the OLI-63 sequence, which is critical for interacting with nuclear protein, we prepared four additional oligonucleotides (OLI-A, OLI-B, OLI-C, and OLI-D) covering different subdomains. As shown in Fig.3 A, competition assay showed that OLI-D was extremely effective at eliminating bands A and B, but OLI-A, OLI-B, and OLI-C failed to affect their formation. In addition, we used different versions of OLI-D (OLI-Dm1 and OLI-Dm2; Fig.2 A) containing base substitutions. Whereas a molar excess of OLI-Dm1 eliminated both complexes as efficiently as OLI-D, OLI-Dm2 was without influence (Fig. 3 B). We next used the oligonucleotide OLI-D comprising nucleotides between −213 and −183 bp as the probe for EMSA. As shown in Fig.4 A, several prominent complexes were formed with nuclear extracts. Competition assays indicated two bands (band C and band D) to be sequence-specific DNA-protein complexes. Whereas cold OLI-Dm1 completely eliminated both of these, OLI-Dm2 did not affect their formation. To directly address whether nucleotides at −210 to −199 bp are important for the TPA responsiveness, we introduced base substitutions (ATCCGCCTGTCT to GATTCGACAAGC) in the context of the 604 bp upstream region of the human DBH gene. In transient transfection assays, base substitutions diminished most, if not all, of the TPA-mediated induction of the DBH promoter activity (from 11.6- to 3.8-fold; Fig.4 B). Taken together, the results suggest that a subdomain of the DBH promoter at −210 to −199 bp appears critical not only for forming specific DNA-protein complexes but also for intact TPA responsiveness. We designate this novel sequence motif as the hDTRE (for human DBH-TPA response element). Given the possibility that the specific complexes formed with OLI-D, e.g. band C and band D, may be because of transcription factors or regulators, which mediate TPA-inducible transcription of the human DBH gene, we tested nuclear extracts prepared following treatment of TPA. When the AP-1 oligonucleotide was used as the probe, DNA-protein complexes were formed more robustly with TPA-treated samples and were supershifted by co-incubation with anti-c-Fos antibody (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, when the OLI-D probe was used, nuclear extracts prepared in the absence or in presence of TPA produced DNA-protein complexes without any apparent differences (Fig. 4 C). Downstream of the hDTRE motif of the human DBH promoter, there resides a composite promoter that encompasses four characterized DNA elements,i.e. CRE, a YY1 binding sequence (CCAT, −175 to −172 bp), an E-box (CATGTG, −174 to −169 bp), and an AP-1-like sequence (TGTGTCA, −172 to −166 bp), as shown in Fig.5 A. The CRE sequence of the human DBH gene has one base pair change from A to C as compared with consensus CRE sequence. CCAT and CATGTG are consensus sequences for the binding site of the transcriptional regulatory protein YY1 and basic helix-loop-helix DNA-binding protein, respectively. The AP-1-like sequence has a single base pair change from the consensus sequence TGA(C/G)TCA to TGTGTCA. To investigate whether this region is involved in TPA-responsive induction of DBH transcription, we first analyzed DNA-protein interactions in this region using nuclear proteins prepared from SK-N-SH cells. As shown in Fig. 5 B, our EMSA, using the oligonucleotide OLI-C encompassing this promoter area as the probe, produced multiple bands with either slow (bands E) or fast (band F) mobility. To further analyze these complexes, we tested five mutant oligonucleotides (OLI-Cm1, OLI-Cm2, OLI-Cm3, OLI-Cm4, and OLI-Cm5 shown in Fig. 2 A) as competitors in EMSA. These bands E were eliminated by cold oligonucleotides containing a CRE sequence (OLI-C, OLI-Cm1, OLI-Cm2, OLI-Cm3, and OLI-Cm4), and band F was competed by the CCAT sequence-containing oligonucleotides (OLI-C, OLI-Cm1, OLI-Cm2, and OLI-Cm5). These data suggest that these bands E were formed by CRE-binding proteins, and band F may contain YY1 protein (Fig.5 B). To further examine the possibility, we tested oligonucleotides containing the human tyrosine hydroxylase CRE (OLI-hTH/C), the human somatostatin CRE (OLI-hSOM/C), and the YY1-binding site from the mouse c-fos promoter (OLI-mo/Y). As shown in Fig. 5 C, molar excesses of OLI-C, OLI-hTH/C, and OLI-hSOM/C eliminated the E bands, whereas OLI-C and OLI-mo/Y eliminated band F. Furthermore, a specific antibody against YY1 protein factor also diminished band F (Fig. 5 D). To investigate whether these cis-elements may contribute to TPA-induced transcription of the DBH gene, we prepared mutant DBH-luciferase fusion constructs and examined them by transient transfection assays (Fig.6 A). All the mutant constructs exhibited similar induction (2.1–3.6-fold the control level) of reporter gene expression in response to forskolin treatment. The reporter gene activities driven by 604Cm1Luc and 604Cm2Luc, which contain base substitutions within the AP1-like motif, were induced by TPA (10.5–13.7-fold the control) similarly to the wild type 604Luc. In contrast, fusion constructs containing mutations within the YY1-binding site, i.e. 604Cm3Luc and 604Cm4Luc, showed lower levels (5.8-fold the control) of transcriptional induction in response to TPA treatment. To elucidate the structure/function relationship of the CRE and YY1-binding site in DBH transcriptional regulation, we prepared and examined two insertional fusion constructs containing 5 or 10 base pairs of unrelated DNA sequences between these two motifs (Fig. 6 B). When 5 nucleotides were inserted between the CRE and CCAT sequences (604+5Luc), which would add a half-helical turn and change the phasic interaction of the cognate protein factors, TPA-mediated induction of the reporter activity was significantly attenuated compared with that with the wild type construct (from 7.0- to 2.8-fold). Interestingly, when 10 nucleotides were inserted (604+10Luc), adding a full helical turn between the CRE and YY1-binding site, an intact response to TPA treatment was obtained in line with a role for stereospecific alignment between these cis-regulatory elements.

In addition to these common motifs, TSP1 and TSP2 contain a cysteine-rich α1(I) procollagen homology domain and three type I (TSP or properdin) repeats, separating the amino-terminal domain and the type II repeats.

The divergently transcribed mouse Mtx and Thbs3 genes are also closely linked to the glucocerebrosidase (Gba) and episialin (Muc1) genes (15Vos H.L. Mockensturm-Wilson M. Rood P.M.L. Maas A.M.C.E.

Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 820-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The Mtx and Gba genes, on the other hand, are transcribed convergently so that their major polyadenylation sites are separated by only 431 nucleotides (17Bornstein P. McKinney C.E. LaMarca M.E.

The human GBA gene is of considerable clinical interest, since mutations in the gene are responsible for the lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher disease (19Beutler E. Adv. Genet. 1995; 32: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the Thbs3 and Mtx genes share a common promoter region, transient transfection experiments inThbs3- and Mtx-expressing rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) and NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated that the Mtx gene is regulated by elements within a short, unidirectional, proximal promoter region (16Collins M. Bornstein P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3661-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The ubiquitous transcriptional activator, Sp1, and the transcriptional repressor, Sp3, bind to clustered GC boxes within the proximal promoter, but their role in regulation of Mtx is uncertain (16Collins M. Bornstein P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3661-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate by transient transfection experiments in RCS and NIH-3T3 cells that the Thbs3 gene is regulated in a cell type-specific manner by a far upstream orientation- and position-independent enhancer element located within intron 6 of the divergently transcribed Mtx gene. This upstream enhancer, when included in a 6-kb promoter sequence, was able to direct specific expression of the E. coli lacZ gene in transgenic mice. RCS cells (20Choi H.U. Meyer K. Swarm R. Proc.

The samples were analyzed with an Applied Biosystems PRISM™ 377 DNA sequencer, and the resulting sequences were analyzed with the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) or GENEPRO (Riverside Scientific, Seattle) programs. Nuclear proteins were isolated from RCS and NIH-3T3 cells using the method of Lee and Green (25Lee K.A.W. Green M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and their concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar), with chymotrypsin as a standard. Various DNA fragments of theThbs3 enhancer (see Fig. 4) were radiolabeled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase or T4 DNA kinase and were used as probes in electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA), competition, and supershift assays, as described previously (16Collins M. Bornstein P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3661-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The 6.0- and 2.0-kbThbs3 promoter-β-galactosidase reporter gene constructs were prepared by cloning the ApaI–CelII andHindIII–CelII Thbs3 promoter fragments, respectively, upstream from the translation start site of the placF vector (see Fig. 1 B; Ref. 27Mercer E.H.

The 6.0- and 2.0-kbThbs3-β-gal inserts were released from the plasmid vector sequences, gel-purified with a Prep-A-Gene® DNA Purification Matrix Kit (Bio-Rad), resuspended in 10 mmTris (pH 7.6) and 0.25 mm EDTA, and clarified through Ultrafree®-MC 0.45-μm filter units (Millipore Corp.). The purified DNA was microinjected into fertilized C57BL/6 × C3H F1 mouse oocytes, and the oocytes were transplanted into the oviducts of pseudopregnant female mice (Jackson Laboratories) using standard procedures (28Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Founder mice were identified by slot blot analysis of tail DNA. Briefly, DNA was prepared from tail biopsies (29Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar), and 5 μg was transferred to Zetabind® Transfer Membranes (CUNO). After UV cross-linking and prehybridization, the membranes were hybridized with a β-galactosidase gene probe (825-bpNcoI–ClaI fragment of placF), washed, and exposed to x-ray film. Transgenic lines were established by breeding positive founders with negative siblings. The transgene copy number in each transgenic line was determined by probing a Southern blot ofNcoI-digested DNA with a radioactively labeled 310-bpEco47III–CelII DNA fragment of theThbs3 proximal promoter (see Fig. 2). Tissues were stained for β-galactosidase activity as described previously, with some modifications (27Mercer E.H. Hoyle G.W. Kapur R.P. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Neuron. 1991; 7: 703-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues were fixed at 4 °C for 30 to 45 min in fresh ice-cold 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mmEGTA, 0.1 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.3). The fixed tissues were then rinsed three times for 30 min each in 0.1 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.3), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and stained in the rinse buffer containing 1 mg/ml X-Gal, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, and 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, in the dark at room temperature for 48 h. The stained tissues were rinsed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and stored in 70% ethanol. Although the mouseThbs3 and Mtx genes share a common promoter region, we previously showed that Mtx is regulated by a short, unidirectional, proximal promoter region containing clustered Sp1-binding motifs (16Collins M. Bornstein P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3661-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The Mtx-Thbs3 intergenic region, on the other hand, was virtually inactive when assayed in theThbs3 direction in Thbs3-expressing RCS cells. Northern blot analysis showed that the endogenous Thbs3 gene was expressed at relatively high levels in these cells, while the gene was expressed at much lower levels in NIH-3T3 cells (Fig.1 A). These findings suggest that additional element(s), not contained in the intergenic region, contribute to the expression of the Thbs3 gene. Some eukaryotic genes encoding extracellular matrix components contain enhancers within their first introns. A 2.2-kb BamHI fragment, extending from the 5′-region of intron A into exon D of theThbs3 gene (22Bornstein P. Devarayalu S. Edelhoff S. Disteche C.M. Genomics. 1993; 15: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), was therefore cloned upstream from the −2034 bp Thbs3 promoter-luciferase gene in the negative orientation and assayed in both RCS and NIH-3T3 cells. There was no significant difference in luciferase activity when the activity of this construct was compared with that of the promoter construct lacking the intragenic segment (data not shown), suggesting that sequences within the 5′ portion of the Thbs3 gene do not contribute to its expression in these cells. Similar results were obtained when intron A of the human THBS3 gene was assayed for enhancer activity inTHBS3-expressing small cell carcinoma cells. 2J. Silver and P. Bornstein, unpublished observations. To test whether far upstream sequences might contribute to the expression of the mouse Thbs3 gene, a 6.0-kbThbs3 promoter and several of its 5′-deletion fragments were cloned upstream from the luciferase reporter gene, and each was co-transfected with the β-galactosidase reporter gene into RCS and NIH-3T3 cells. The 6.0-kb Thbs3 promoter includes the 1.4-kb intergenic region and most of the Mtx gene. As shown in Fig.1 B, the 6.0-kb Thbs3 promoter was 10 times more active than the 2.0-kb promoter in RCS cells, but the two constructs were equally active in NIH 3T3 cells. Estimates of the relative expression of −6.0 Thbs-LUC in RCS and NIH-3T3 cells also indicated a 10-fold higher expression in RCS cells (data not shown), a finding consistent with the relative expression of the endogenousThbs3 gene in the two cell lines (Fig. 1 A). There was a 5-fold decrease in luciferase activity in RCS cells when the activity of the 5.4-kb (SacI) Thbs3 promoter construct was compared with that of the 5.5-kb (PstI) construct. In contrast, similar luciferase activities were obtained for all 5′ deletions of the 6.0-kb construct, up to an RsaI site at −1346 bp, when these constructs were transfected into NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 1 B and Table I). A gradual decrease in luciferase activity was noted when additional 5′-deletion constructs of the −1346 bp Thbs3 promoter were assayed in the latter cells (Table I; Ref. 16Collins M. Bornstein P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3661-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the 6.0-kb Thbs3 promoter demonstrated that additional factors bound within other regions of the promoter, but apparently they play only a minor role in the constitutive regulation of the gene. These findings suggest that a cis-acting element(s), located between −5.4 and −5.5 kb in the 3′-region of intron 6 of theMtx gene, together with its associated transcription factor(s), serves as a cell-specific enhancer of Thbs3 in RCS cells and that its activity correlates with the cellular expression of the endogenous Thbs3 gene (Fig. 1 B). Additional evidence that the Thbs3 enhancer functions in a cell-specific manner was provided by the finding that the −5.7 (−5.1/0.5)Thbs3-LUC construct containing theThbs3 enhancer (see Fig. 3) was unable to activate theThbs3 basal promoter when transfected into NIH-3T3 cells (data not shown).Table IDeletion analysis of the −2 kb Thbs3 promoterConstructLuciferase activityaAdjusted to a value of 100% for the 6-kbThbs3 promoter (see Fig. 1 B).

Open table in a new tab The major polyadenylation sites of the convergently transcribedMtx and glucocerebrosidase (Gba) genes are only 431 bp apart (17Bornstein P. McKinney C.E. LaMarca M.E. Winfield S. Shingu T. Devarayalu S. Vos H.L. Ginns E.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because of the close proximity of theThbs3 enhancer to the Gba gene, it was possible that elements within the body of the Gba gene could also participate in regulation of the Thbs3 gene. To test this hypothesis, a KpnI site within exon 7 of the Gbagene was used to clone a 9.0-kb Thbs3-promoter luciferase construct (Fig. 1 C). As shown in Fig. 1 C, there was a 35% decrease in luciferase activity when the 9-kb promoter was assayed in RCS cells and compared with the −6.0 kb promoter construct. This finding indicates that no net positive regulatory elements for theThbs3 gene are located within the 3′ two-thirds of theGba gene. All of the elements responsible for Thbs3 gene expression in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were located within theMtx-Thbs3 intergenic region (Table I; Ref. 16Collins M. Bornstein P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3661-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Three positive regulatory regions, each of which contributed equally to the luciferase activity in the fibroblasts, were identified. The first region contains the TATA-less 311-bp proximal Thbs3promoter. Since a unique transcription start site for theThbs3 gene has not been determined and several sites may exist, the promoter is numbered from the translation start site. Two INR sequences, 5′-YYANWYY-3′, were identified upstream from the translation start site, generating 5′-untranslated regions of 57 and 96 nucleotides, respectively (Fig. 2B; 30Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The lengths of both potential 5′-untranslated regions are within the average length of between 20 and 100 nucleotides for most eukaryotic mRNAs (31Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4181) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the 311-bp promoter also contains an inverted CCAAT box and two inverted GC boxes. A 513-bp sequence between nucleotides −976 and −463 formed the second region, while the third region, extending from −1346 to −1150, contained the 196-bp GC-rich Mtx minimal promoter. These data confirm our initial findings that the Mtx minimal promoter, which is located upstream from −1150, does not play a major role in the regulation of the Thbs3 gene. To test whether the enhancer element located in intron 6 of the metaxin gene could function in a position-independent manner, a 344-bp SmaI–SacI fragment, which was expected to contain the enhancer based on the experiments described in Fig. 1 B, was cloned upstream from the SnaBI site at −463 bp to produce the −5.7 (−5.4/−0.5)Thbs3-promoter luciferase construct. To our surprise, only basal luciferase activity was detected when this construct was assayed in RCS cells (Fig.3). There are at least three possible explanations for this finding: 1) the 463-bp basal Thbs3promoter is incomplete; 2) the Thbs3 enhancer functions in a position-dependent manner so that part or all of the intervening sequences are required, or specific sequences in the intervening region function coordinately with the enhancer; or 3) theSacI site and its flanking sequences form part of the enhancer element. To test the third possibility, a 4-bp internal deletion was generated within the SacI site of the −6.0 kbThbs3 promoter by SacI cleavage, blunt-ending with DNA polymerase I, and ligation. The deletion was confirmed by DNA sequencing. There was a 75% decrease in luciferase activity when the 4-bp deletion construct was assayed (Fig. 3; −6.0 (ΔSacI, 4bp)). The activity of the 4-bp deletion construct, 23.9 ± 1.4%, was similar to that of the −5.4 kb (SacI) 5′ deletion construct, 17.0 ± 4.7% (Fig. 1 B). To test whether the sequences flanking the SacI site could activate the Thbs3 promoter, several fragments c"

MUNC18-1 (n-Sec1) protein, the mammalian counterpart of the Unc-18 protein originally discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans (1Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a brain-specific protein with a molecular mass of 67 kDa, which associates with synaptic membranes through interaction with syntaxin, one of the synaptic membrane proteins (2Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 3Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MUNC18-1, by forming a complex with syntaxin, is believed to play a role in neurotransmitter release through mediating docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles to presynaptic membranes. Upon docking of the vesicles to the membrane, however, MUNC18-1 protein dissociates from the complex. Phenotypes of mutants (unc-18) defective for the protein in C. elegans and its homolog (rop) in Drosophila melanogaster include, in addition to impairment of neurotransmitter release at synapses, uncoordinated movement (unc-18), retardation of postembryonic development (unc-18,rop), abnormal accumulation of acetylcholine (unc-18), and others (5Hosono R.

Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). Although munc18-1 gene is highly expressed in brain, it is also expressed in pancreatic endocrine cells (10Jacobsson G. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Juntti-Berggren L. Deeney J.T. Berggren P-O. Meister B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12487-12491Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) along with other genes responsible for fusion of synaptic vesicles, suggesting that the role played by MUNC18-1 protein is not limited to neurotransmitter release but includes the excretion of biologically active substances such as hormones. In fact, mutants in yeast defective in sec1, a counterpart of munc18-1 in yeast, are known to have an impaired secretion pathway, which is involved in trafficking of secretory vesicles (11Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In this paper we report the organization of mouse munc18-1 gene as well as characterization of the 5′-regulatory sequence of the gene. A mouse genomic DNA library was constructed inEscherichia coli LE392 after ligating partialSau3AI DNA digests of mouse genomic DNA (strain 129/Sv) at the BamHI site of a phage vector (EMBL3). For screening clones carrying munc18-1 gene, phage plaques were transferred to Hybond-N+ filters and (after alkaline treatment) hybridized with two [α-32P]dCTP-labeled ratmunc18-1 cDNA probes (one covering nucleotides 1–1363 and the other nucleotides 1291–3488), which were isolated in this laboratory. The hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C in a hybridization buffer that contained 500 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 7% SDS, and 1 mmEDTA (12Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). After hybridization, the filters were washed with 0.1 × SSC and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak XAR-5). Among approximately 6 × 105 phage plaques examined, 19 clones were reactive to the munc18-1 cDNA probes. DNA of the 19 phage clones was digested withSacI, and their restriction fragment patterns indicated that 4 clones (M-7:18kb, M-9:18kb, M-16:17kb, and M-1/1:20kb) could represent the whole DNA sequences covered by the 19 clones. Because preliminary experiments by hybridization of restriction fragments of the 4 clones described above with munc18-1cDNA suggested the presence of a considerably large number of exons in the gene, we adopted the following sequencing strategy for themunc18-1 gene. Plasmid (pBluescript SK−) subclones were obtained from each of the 4 clones after SacI digestion, and hybridization experiments indicated that all of theSacI subclones carried a DNA insert with at least one exon for munc18-1 gene. The DNA sequence at the termini of the subclones was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (13Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52768) Google Scholar) using a sequencing kit (BcaBEST Dideoxy Sequencing Kit, Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) employing [α-32P]dCTP. After sequencing the terminal, the DNA was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and subjected to a series of further plasmid subcloning and sequencing. We sequenced the DNA (total of over 40 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)PIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsEUCIBEuropean Collaborative Interspecific BackcrossDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase. ) from the 4 clones. All the sequence of the munc18-1 cDNA was included in the determined sequence, thus having identified 19 exons.

The genomic fragments covered all potential introns except for a part of the intron between the first and second exons. The missing sequence of the intron was recovered by PCR using whole genomic mouse DNA as a template using primers (EL sense primer, 5′-GTGACCGAGCCTTTGCCCTTAACTCGC-3′; A7 primer, 5′-CCTTCCACTCGCCCTTCTTCTTCACC-3′) and a kit (Expand Long Template PCR System, Boehringer Mannheim). After having confirmed the authenticity of the product by sequencing, the size of the intron was calculated by gel electrophoresis. S1 nuclease analysis was performed as described (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A single-stranded DNA probe for S1 nuclease mapping was prepared as follows. A 206-bp SmaI genomic DNA fragment (see Fig. 2), which covers the potential transcription initiation site suggested from the 5′-terminal sequence ofmunc18-1 cDNA, was cloned at theEcoRV site of pBluescript SK−, excised from the vector (double digestion by PstI/EcoRI), treated with alkaline phosphatase, heat-denatured, and separated by polyacrylamide (6%)/urea (7 m) gel electrophoresis. A smaller single-stranded DNA band corresponding to the 186-bp antisense strand was recovered from the gel. The DNA was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and (after purification) incubated with total mouse brain RNA (10 μg) in a buffer (20 μl) containing 40 mm PIPES (pH 6.4), 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, and 80% (v/v) formamide for 10 min at 85 °C and then overnight at 30 °C. 200 μl of S1 nuclease analysis buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 280 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm ZnSO4, 20 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) was then added with S1 nuclease (200 units) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction products were precipitated with ethanol, subjected to polyacrylamide (6%)/urea (7m) gel electrophoresis, and autoradiographed. 3′-RACE was performed using a kit (3′-RACE System, Life Technologies, Inc.). In essence, the first cDNA strand was synthesized from total mouse brain RNA employing a 3′-RACE general primer supplied by the manufacturer. PCR was then performed using the cDNA as template and munc18-1 gene-specific deoxyoligonucleotides (5′-CTGTATGTATCCCACAG-3′ corresponding to nucleotides 2110 to 2126 of rat cDNA) and a universal amplification primer (5′-CUACUACUACUAGGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′) supplied by the manufacturer. An amplified band (∼1.4 kb), which was hybridized with a genomic DNA probe covering the putative polyadenylation site, was sequenced, and the site was determined. Chromosomal mapping of themunc18-1 gene was carried out by interspecific backcross analysis. The large backcross panel in the European Collaborative Interspecific Backcross (EUCIB) was employed for the analysis. The backcross was produced by backcrossing F1 (C57BL/6 × Mus spretus) females with C57BL/6 or M. spretus males. Restriction fragment length polymorphism was identified by Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNAs. The DNA probe used for the hybridization was a 1768-bp BamHI genomic fragment corresponding to bp 2203–3970 (GenBank accession numberAB012588). Randomly picked 67 backcross DNAs from the panel were analyzed for the mapping of munc18-1 gene. Rat PC12D cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% horse serum plus 5% fetal calf serum. Mouse L cells were cultured in ES medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%). These cells were incubated at 37 °C in a CO2(5%) incubator. For PC12D cells, DNA constructs (2 μg) to be examined were first mixed with 1 μg of pCMVβ (a reference DNA construct carrying β-galactosidase gene), precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 100 μl of DMEM. The solution was then mixed with 100 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) solution (18 μl in 100 μl of DMEM) and left for 30 min at room temperature to form a DNA cationic lipid complex. 200 μl of the sample was then mixed with 800 μl of DMEM and poured onto the recipient cells (7 × 105 cells) in a 3.5-cm (diameter) dish. The cells continued to be incubated at 37 °C with medium replacement at 5 and 24 h. After 48 h of incubation after transfection, the cells were collected by a scraper, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 100 μl of 250 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), and subjected to repeated freezing and thawing (three times). After centrifugation (15,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C), the supernatant fractions were subjected to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and β-galactosidase assays. For L cells, essentially the same protocol was employed except that ES medium and Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) solution (12 μl in 100 μl of ES medium) were used instead of DMEM and LipofectAMINE, respectively. The assays were performed as described (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For CAT assay, cell extracts (100 μg of protein) in 80 μl of 250 mmTris·HCl (pH 8.0) were heat-treated for 10 min at 65 °C, and supernatant fractions after centrifugation (2 min at 4 °C) were incubated with 10 μl of 10 mm acetyl-CoA and 20 μl of [14C]chloramphenicol (ICN, 0.2 μCi, specific activity 2.22 GBq/mmol) for 2 h at 37 °C and further incubated overnight at 37 °C after addition of 10 μl of fresh acetyl-CoA (10 mm). The reaction mixture was vigorously mixed with 200 μl of ethyl acetate, and 180 μl of ethyl acetate fraction was subjected to TLC (CHCl3:CH3OH, 95:5) after concentration. The TLC plates were exposed to x-ray films (Kodak XAR-5), and the CAT activity (expressed as percent conversion) of each sample was quantitated by an image analyzer (Fuji, BAS2000). To correct transfection efficiency, β-galactosidase activities derived from co-transfected pCMVβ in the same sample were also assayed by incubating 2 μg of cell extracts in a reaction mixture (200 μl), which contained 7.5 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 75 mm NaCl, 0.75 mm MgCl2, 0.075% NaN3, 0.075% bovine serum albumin, and 0.225 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-galactoside for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 600 μl of 0.1 m glycine-NaOH (pH 10.3), and fluorescence at 450 nm (excitation at 360 nm) was measured. The organization of mousemunc18-1 gene was determined based upon information obtained from genomic DNA sequences. We first screened for genomic munc18-1 DNA fragments from a library constructed from partial restriction enzyme (Sau3AI) digests of mouse genomic DNA. By employing two ratmunc18-1 cDNA sequences as probes (see “Experimental Procedures”), we isolated 19 clones that were reactive to the probes. Restriction fragment analysis of the clones revealed that each of the clones carried at least a part of themunc18-1 cDNA sequences, and as a whole they covered the total munc18-1 cDNA sequence. We selected 4 clones by which the entire munc18-1cDNA sequence could be covered and sequenced the DNA (total, over 40 kb). As all of the sequence of the munc18-1cDNA was included in the determined sequence, we identified 19 exons for munc18-1 gene. As for the introns, the genomic fragments covered all potential introns except for a part of the intron between the first and second exons. The missing part of the intron was recovered by PCR using whole genomic DNA as a template, and the size was calculated to be approximately 15 kb. Thus, munc18-1 gene comprises 19 exons, whose sizes range from 50 bp (2nd exon) to 1676 bp (19th exon) with the total gene size of 56 kb. The organization of mousemunc18-1 gene is shown in Fig.1. The precise locations of the exon/intron boundaries were primarily determined from observed sequence discrepancies between genomic DNA and cDNA. For cases in which the locations could not be determined from sequence discrepancy alone, positions of gt and ag-splicing specific dinucleotides (15Mount S.M. Science. 1996; 271: 1690-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in the introns were taken into consideration. The positions for transcription initiation site and polyadenylation site were determined by S1 nuclease analysis and 3′-RACE, respectively, as described below. The precise location of the transcription initiation site ofmunc18-1 gene was determined by S1 nuclease analysis (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Conventional primer extension was first tried, but despite a series of experiments performed under various conditions, the extension was not sufficient to determine the site, probably because of the presence of significantly GC-rich sequences (82% between +1 and +150 nucleotides) just downstream of the putative transcription initiation site. For S1 nuclease analysis, an antisense single-stranded DNA was prepared from one of the genomic DNA fragments, which was thought to cover the potential transcription initiation site and further extend up to 65 bp upstream of the site (underlinedin Fig. 2). The labeled antisense single-stranded DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”) was first hybridized with total RNA from mouse brain, followed by S1 nuclease digestion. After electrophoresis, two closely mobilizing bands at positions 116 and 117 bp were detected (Fig.3). The protected sequences contained the consensus sequence for the CAP site (CA and pyrimidine-rich sequence) without the consensus sequence for splicing. The 116-bp band was apparently produced by overdigestion of S1 nuclease (16Green M.R. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1980; 22: 231-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and we concluded that the transcription initiation site of mousemunc18-1 gene is located 117 bp upstream of the terminus of the antisense single-stranded DNA (nucleotide 1 shown in Fig. 2). The identification of the transcription initiation site by S1 nuclease analysis confirmed that exon 1, designated from the sequence analysis, is in fact the first exon of mousemunc18-1 gene. The size of exon 19 along with the polyadenylation site of munc18-1gene was determined by 3′-RACE and subsequent sequencing of the product. cDNA primed at the polyadenylation site was synthesized from rat brain RNA and then subjected to PCR using a primer specific to the munc18-1 gene sequence. The PCR product was sequenced, and the size of exon 19 (1676 bp) and the polyadenylation site were determined (see Table I).Table ISplice donor and acceptor sequences of munc18–1 geneAdjacent exons (uppercase letters) and introns (lowercase letters) are given for each junction.

Characteristics of the sequence will be discussed below (see “Discussion”). We attempted to mapmunc18-1 gene on mouse chromosomes by interspecific (M. spretus and C57BL/6) backcross analysis. An informative restriction fragment length polymorphism was obtained following digestion with TaqI, yielding a 3.2-kb hybridizing band in M. spretus and a 2.8-kb band in C57BL/6. We concluded that munc18-1 gene is located on mouse chromosome 2 between two anchor markers D2Mit6 and D2Mit242. The order and distance (±1 S.E.) are: Cen–D2Mit6-(15.4 ± 4.5 centimorgans)-munc18-1–(10.5 ± 4.1 centimorgans)-D2Mit242. Haplotype analysis between above two anchor markers revealed that one recombinant between D2Mit152 andmunc18-1 existed and the order is: Cen-D2Mit6-D2Mit152-munc18-1-D2Mit242. According to the Mouse Genome data base (Mouse Genome Informatics Project, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME; URL:http://www.informatics.jax.org. April, 1998), D2Mit152 and D2Mit242 are mapped at 21 and 29 centimorgans from the centromere, respectively. Because this region is syntenic to human chromosome 9q33-q34, the human homologue of munc18-1 is likely mapped to human chromosome 9q33-q34. To examine whether sequences essential for the expression of munc18-1 gene, in addition tomunc18-1 promoter, are present upstream of the gene, we constructed a series of composite constructs, in which 5′-upstream sequences as far as −3900 bp upstream ofmunc18-1 gene were placed at the proximal position of a reporter CAT gene. Rat PC12D cells, as well as mouse L cells, were transfected with the constructs, and CAT activities in extracts of the transfected cells were assayed. PC12D cells, a cell line established from rat adrenal pheochromocytoma, differentiate to form neuron-like cells in vitro after the addition of nerve growth factor to medium (17Katoh-Semba S. Kitajima S. Yamazaki Y. Sano M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1987; 17: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and have been used extensively as a model for neuronal differentiation. Results of the transfection experiments are shown in Fig. 4, A andB). As seen in the figure, CAT activity in PC12D cells gradually increased to a maximum of approximately 2-fold of control, as the upstream sequence was truncated from −3911 to −292 bp, suggesting the presence of a motif or sequence in that region, which negatively affects expression of the gene. As also shown in Fig. 4 (Aand B), the CAT activities in mouse L cells after transfection were much lower than those observed in PC12D cells, and the activities were relatively constant regardless of all the constructs examined. This suggests that the sequence(s) necessary for expression of munc18-1 gene or regulation of expression is not playing an active role in mouse L cells. When the upstream sequence was further truncated, CAT activity was decreased drastically in both PC12D and L cells with a significant drop in activities in the constructs truncated beyond −195 bp, indicating that the munc18-1 promoter is located downstream of nucleotide −195. We have studied the structure of mousemunc18-1 gene, whose product (MUNC18-1) is implicated in neurotransmitter release and the cellular excretion process in mammalian cells and yeasts. The gene consists of 19 exons with a total gene size of approximately 56 kb. There are several interesting characteristics in the sequence of the 5′-flanking region. First, the immediate upstream sequence of the gene from the cap site is characterized by significantly high GC content, as we observed 78% GC content between nucleotides −1 and −150. Also, there is no apparent TATA or CAAT box in this region. These may be unique features of some genes expressed in neural tissues. On the other hand, we were able to identify several specific sequences known as binding sites for transcription factors. For example, motifs for HSF2 (18Kroeger P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7592-7603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Lyf-1 (19Lo K. Landau N.R. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5229-5243Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), c-Rel (20Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MZF1 (21Morris J.F. Hromas R. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1786-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and Sp1 (22Thiesen H.J. Bach C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3203-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) are located at −287 to −278, −262 to −254, −201 to −192, −162 to −155, and −84 to −75, respectively (see Fig. 4), suggesting that transcription factors that bind to these motifs are involved in the expression ofmunc18-1 gene. Besides these, we examined whether the 5′-flanking sequence (8.9 kb), the introns, and the sequence downstream of the polyadenylation site (1.5 kb) include possible coding sequences or sequences with any biological significance by searching for homologous sequences in DDBJ/EBI/GenBank data bases. No sequences that are homologous to them were hit in the data bases. Furthermore, Northern hybridization against mouse brain RNA using blocks of the sequences from the 5′-flanking region (6.3 and 2.6 kb) as probes failed to give any signals. These results suggested that any genes are localized in the immediate vicinity of munc18-1gene. In transfection experiments using rat PC12D cells and composite DNA constructs, in which upstream sequences ofmunc18-1 gene were placed at the proximal position of a reporter CAT gene, we obtained evidence for the presence of a motif or sequence that negatively affects expression of the gene. Furthermore, because observed CAT activities were constant and much lower among all the constructs examined in mouse L cells than those observed in rat PC12D cells, the sequence(s) necessary for expression of munc18-1 gene or regulating of expression in PC12D cells are inactive. At present, it is not clear how the enhancer (silencer)-like motif or sequence in this upstream region functions in neural and other cells in which munc18-1 gene is expressed, but the presence of a similar silencer-like sequence has been reported in other genes, including those for neuron-restrictive silencer factors (23Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Michael Rhodes for help using EUCIB."
