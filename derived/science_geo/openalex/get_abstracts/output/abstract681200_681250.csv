https://openalex.org/W3200172023,"Although mutations leading to a compromised nuclear envelope cause diseases such as muscular dystrophies or accelerated aging, the consequences of mechanically induced nuclear envelope ruptures are less known. Here, we show that nuclear envelope ruptures induce DNA damage that promotes senescence in non-transformed cells and induces an invasive phenotype in human breast cancer cells. We find that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated exonuclease TREX1 translocates into the nucleus after nuclear envelope rupture and is required to induce DNA damage. Inside the mammary duct, cellular crowding leads to nuclear envelope ruptures that generate TREX1-dependent DNA damage, thereby driving the progression of in situ carcinoma to the invasive stage. DNA damage and nuclear envelope rupture markers were also enriched at the invasive edge of human tumors. We propose that DNA damage in mechanically challenged nuclei could affect the pathophysiology of crowded tissues by modulating proliferation and extracellular matrix degradation of normal and transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W3198940765,"Throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, countries have relied on a variety of ad hoc border control protocols to allow for non-essential travel while safeguarding public health, from quarantining all travellers to restricting entry from select nations on the basis of population-level epidemiological metrics such as cases, deaths or testing positivity rates1,2. Here we report the design and performance of a reinforcement learning system, nicknamed Eva. In the summer of 2020, Eva was deployed across all Greek borders to limit the influx of asymptomatic travellers infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and to inform border policies through real-time estimates of COVID-19 prevalence. In contrast to country-wide protocols, Eva allocated Greece's limited testing resources on the basis of incoming travellers' demographic information and testing results from previous travellers. By comparing Eva's performance against modelled counterfactual scenarios, we show that Eva identified 1.85 times as many asymptomatic, infected travellers as random surveillance testing, with up to 2-4 times as many during peak travel, and 1.25-1.45 times as many asymptomatic, infected travellers as testing policies that utilize only epidemiological metrics. We demonstrate that this latter benefit arises, at least partially, because population-level epidemiological metrics had limited predictive value for the actual prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic travellers and exhibited strong country-specific idiosyncrasies in the summer of 2020. Our results raise serious concerns on the effectiveness of country-agnostic internationally proposed border control policies3 that are based on population-level epidemiological metrics. Instead, our work represents a successful example of the potential of reinforcement learning and real-time data for safeguarding public health."
https://openalex.org/W3199783982,"Background The burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru has led to people seeking alternative treatments as preventives and treatment options such as medicinal plants. This study aimed to assess factors associated with the use of medicinal plants as preventive or treatment of respiratory symptom related to COVID-19 during the pandemic in Cusco, Peru. Method A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted on general public (20- to 70-year-old) from August 31 to September 20, 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire via Google Forms, it consisted of an 11-item questionnaire that was developed and validated by expert judgment using Aiken’s V (Aiken’s V &gt; 0.9). Both descriptive statistics and bivariate followed by multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess factors associated with the use of medicinal plants for COVID-19 prevention and respiratory symptom treatment during the pandemic. Prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI), and a P-value of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Results A total of 1,747 respondents participated in the study, 80.2% reported that they used medicinal plants as preventives, while 71% reported that they used them to treat respiratory symptoms. At least, 24% of respondents used medicinal plants when presenting with two or more respiratory symptoms, while at least 11% used plants for malaise. For treatment or prevention, the multivariate analysis showed that most respondents used eucalyptus (p &lt; 0.001 for both), ginger (p &lt; 0.022 for both), spiked pepper (p &lt; 0.003 for both), garlic (p = 0.023 for prevention), and chamomile (p = 0.011 for treatment). The respondents with COVID-19 (p &lt; 0.001), at older ages (p = 0.046), and with a family member or friend who had COVID-19 (p &lt; 0.001) used more plants for prevention. However, the respondents with technical or higher education used less plants for treatment (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion There was a significant use of medicinal plants for both prevention and treatment, which was associated with several population characteristics and whether respondents had COVID-19."

https://openalex.org/W3200799815,"To fight the spread of COVID-19, many countries implemented social distancing policies. This is the first paper that examines the effects of the German social distancing policies on behavior and the epidemic’s spread. Exploiting the staggered timing of COVID-19 outbreaks in extended event-study models, we find that the policies heavily reduced mobility and contagion. In comparison to a no-social-distancing benchmark, within three weeks, the policies avoided 84% of the potential COVID-19 cases (point estimate: 499.3K) and 66% of the potential fatalities (5.4K). The policies’ relative effects were smaller for individuals above 60 and in rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W3201146441,"I nnovation and green are the directions to promote the circular economy and environmental sustainability at the corporate level. This paper examines the impact of environmental regulation (pollution charge) on green technology innovation and the mediating role of corporate environmental responsibility. Our results indicate that: (1) Environmental regulations stimulate manufacturing enterprises’ environmental responsibility and green technology innovation. It is worth noting that corporate environmental responsibility strengthens the relationship between environmental regulation and green technology innovation. (2) Further investigation reveals that R&amp;D expenditure and environmental investment have greatly strengthened the positive effect of environmental regulation on green technology innovation. (3) With more detailed disclosure about enterprises’ environment-related information, the more outstanding stimulation effects of environmental regulation. Discussions on the features of enterprise location have revealed that, if the goal of environmental protection is set too high or if the fiscal decentralization is too strong, implementation of environmental regulation would not achieve desirable results. Accordingly, we need to optimize the collection of environmental taxes, strengthen the enterprises’ environmental responsibility, and increase investment in R&amp;D and environment protection. Meanwhile, the execution of environmental regulation should also take into account the institutional environment and governance features of the enterprise locations."
https://openalex.org/W3201122855,"Neural circuit assembly features simultaneous targeting of numerous neuronal processes from constituent neuron types, yet the dynamics is poorly understood. Here, we use the Drosophila olfactory circuit to investigate dynamic cellular processes by which olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) target axons precisely to specific glomeruli in the ipsi- and contralateral antennal lobes. Time-lapse imaging of individual axons from 30 ORN types revealed a rich diversity in extension speed, innervation timing, and ipsilateral branch locations and identified that ipsilateral targeting occurs via stabilization of transient interstitial branches. Fast imaging using adaptive optics-corrected lattice light-sheet microscopy showed that upon approaching target, many ORN types exhibiting ""exploring branches"" consisted of parallel microtubule-based terminal branches emanating from an F-actin-rich hub. Antennal nerve ablations uncovered essential roles for bilateral axons in contralateral target selection and for ORN axons to facilitate dendritic refinement of postsynaptic partner neurons. Altogether, these observations provide cellular bases for wiring specificity establishment."
https://openalex.org/W3199152231,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) transfer complex biologic material between cells. However, the role of this process in vivo is poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that osteoblastic cells in the bone marrow (BM) niche elaborate extracellular vesicles that are taken up by hematopoietic progenitor cells in vivo. Genotoxic or infectious stress rapidly increased stromal-derived extracellular vesicle transfer to granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. The extracellular vesicles contained processed tRNAs (tiRNAs) known to modulate protein translation. 5'-ti-Pro-CGG-1 was preferentially abundant in osteoblast-derived extracellular vesicles and, when transferred to granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, increased protein translation, cell proliferation, and myeloid differentiation. Upregulating EV transfer improved hematopoietic recovery from genotoxic injury and survival from fungal sepsis. Therefore, EV-mediated tiRNA transfer provides a stress-modulated signaling axis in the BM niche distinct from conventional cytokine-driven stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W3201360646,"Macrophages are the principal innate immune cells that populate all major organs and provide the first line of cellular defense against infections and/or injuries. The immediate and early-responding macrophages must mount a robust pro-inflammatory response to protect the host by eliminating deleterious agents. The effective pro-inflammatory macrophage response requires the activation of complex transcriptional programs that modulate the dynamic regulation of inflammatory and metabolic gene expression. Therefore, transcription factors that govern pro-inflammatory and metabolic gene expression play an essential role in shaping the macrophage inflammatory response. Herein, we identify the basic helix-loop-helix family member e40 (BHLHE40), as a critical transcription factor that promotes broad pro-inflammatory and glycolytic gene expression by elevating HIF1α levels in macrophages. Our in vivo studies revealed that myeloid-BHLHE40 deficiency significantly attenuates macrophage and neutrophil recruitment to the site of inflammation. Our integrated transcriptomics and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) studies show that BHLHE40 deficiency broadly curtails inflammatory signaling pathways, hypoxia response, and glycolytic gene expression in macrophages. Utilizing complementary gain- and loss-of-function studies, our analyses uncovered that BHLHE40 promotes LPS-induced HIF1α mRNA and protein expression in macrophages. More importantly, forced overexpression of oxygen stable form of HIF1α completely reversed attenuated pro-inflammatory and glycolytic gene expression in BHLHE40-deficient macrophages. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BHLHE40 promotes macrophage pro-inflammatory gene expression and functions by elevating HIF1α expression in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W3199584984,"When approaching thyroid gland tumor classification, the differentiation between samples with and without “papillary thyroid carcinoma-like” nuclei is a daunting task with high inter-observer variability among pathologists. Thus, there is increasing interest in the use of machine learning approaches to provide pathologists real-time decision support. In this paper, we optimize and quantitatively compare two automated machine learning methods for thyroid gland tumor classification on two datasets to assist pathologists in decision-making regarding these methods and their parameters. The first method is a feature-based classification originating from common image processing and consists of cell nucleus segmentation, feature extraction, and subsequent thyroid gland tumor classification utilizing different classifiers. The second method is a deep learning-based classification which directly classifies the input images with a convolutional neural network without the need for cell nucleus segmentation. On the Tharun and Thompson dataset, the feature-based classification achieves an accuracy of 89.7% (Cohen’s Kappa 0.79), compared to the deep learning-based classification of 89.1% (Cohen’s Kappa 0.78). On the Nikiforov dataset, the feature-based classification achieves an accuracy of 83.5% (Cohen’s Kappa 0.46) compared to the deep learning-based classification 77.4% (Cohen’s Kappa 0.35). Thus, both automated thyroid tumor classification methods can reach the classification level of an expert pathologist. To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing feature-based and deep learning-based classification regarding their ability to classify samples with and without papillary thyroid carcinoma-like nuclei on two large-scale datasets."
https://openalex.org/W3199412530,"Background Hypertension and its consequent end-organ damage including Hypertensive Heart Disease (HHD) are a major concern that impact health, resulting into impairment and reduced quality of life (QOL). The purpose of this study was to describe the burden of HHD in Iran and comparing it with the World Bank upper middle-income countries (UMICs) in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALY), mortality and prevalence. Methods Using data from the Global Burden of Disease study 2017, we compared the number of DALYs, deaths and prevalence trends for HHD from 1990 to 2017 in all age groups for both sex in Iran, and compared the epidemiology and trends with UMICs and globally. Results The age-standardized DALY rate for HHD increased by 51.6% for men (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 305.8 to 436.7 per 100,000) and 4.4% for women (95% UI 429.4 to 448.7 per 100,000) in Iran. The age-standardized prevalence of HHD in Iran was almost twice times higher than globally and 1.5-times more than the World Bank UMICs. The age-standardized death rate for HDD increased by 60.1% (95% UI 17.3 to 27.7% per 100,000) for men and by 21.7% (95% UI 25.85 to 31.48 per 100,000) for women from 1990 to 2017. Age-standardized death rate in Iran was 2.4 and 1.9 times higher than globally and UMICs, respectively. Conclusions The higher prevalence and death rate in Iran in comparison with UMICs and globally should encourage health care provider to perform intensive screening activities in at risk population to prevent HHD and mitigate its mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3199697310,"Background Sarcopenia is among the most prevalent and serious cancer-related symptom, and is strongly correlated with a poor prognosis. Moreover, it reportedly predicts poor prognosis after surgery in patients with lung cancer. However, it is unclear whether sarcopenia directly affects post-operative recurrence. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether sarcopenia can be a risk indicator for post-operative recurrence, and whether it suppresses anti-tumor immunity, in a cohort of patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer. Methods This study retrospectively reviewed the data of 256 consecutive patients who underwent curative lobectomy and lymph node dissection for non-small cell lung cancer at our institution. The psoas muscle mass index was calculated as the total psoas muscle area at the third lumbar vertebral level/height 2 (cm 2 /m 2 ). Sarcopenia was defined by a psoas muscle mass index of under 5.03 cm 2 /m 2 and 3.17 cm 2 /m 2 in male and female patients, respectively. Post-operative prognosis and cumulative incidence of recurrence rates were calculated. Results The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates post-surgery were 59.5% and 38.6%, respectively, in patients with sarcopenia versus 81.1% and 72.1%, respectively, in patients without sarcopenia ( p &lt; 0.001). The 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence rate in patients with sarcopenia was significantly higher than those without sarcopenia (49.9% versus 22.4%, respectively) in every pathological stage. Pathological stages II and III (hazard ratio, 3.36; p = 0.004), histological type (hazard ratio, 2.31; p = 0.025), and sarcopenia (hazard ratio, 2.52; p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for post-operative recurrence according to multivariate analysis. Conclusion Sarcopenia is a risk indicator for post-operative recurrence in patients with non-small cell lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3199398188,"Micro-CT technique poses significant applications in characterizing the microstructure of materials. Based on the CT three-dimensional(3D) reconstruction technology and “Avizo” 3D visualization software, the microscopic pore-throat structure of porous media can be quantitatively characterized. This paper takes the carbon fiber reinforced resin matrix composites as an example to introduce the operation process of “Avizo” in details, which mainly covers the following modules: Volume Edit, Interactive Thresholding, Fill Holes, Mask, Separate Objects and Generate Pore Network Model, then further discuss the difficult problems when the “Avizo” is employed to analyze. The microstructures of carbon fiber reinforced resin matrix composites illustrate that pores in the upper part of sample are dramatically dispersed, and mainly concentrated in the lower part of sample. The porosity of adopted cuboid is 3.6%, accordingly the numbers of pores and throats reach 268 and 7, respectively. The equivalent radius of pores seems mainly distributed in the range of 0.7–0.8μm, accounting for 28.73% of the total pore number. The surface area of pore ranges from 5 to 10μm 2 , accounting for 14.16% of the total pore number. The pore volume concentrates in the range of 1–20μm 3 , accounting for 57.46% of the total pore number. In addition, the equivalent radius of throat mainly concentrates in the range of 1–5μm, the overall length of throat is distributed in the range of 37–60μm, and the equivalent area of throat is distributed non-uniformly in the range of 5–75μm 2 . This work provides a basis for the further investigation of fluid migration mechanism and law in the composite materials by the numerical simulation methodology."
https://openalex.org/W3201107275,"Background Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent diseases in women. Prevention and treatments have lowered mortality; nevertheless, the impact of the diagnosis and treatment continue to impact all aspects of patients’ lives (physical, emotional, cognitive, social, and spiritual). Objective This study seeks to explore the experiences of the different stages women with breast cancer go through by means of a patient journey. Methods This is a qualitative study in which 21 women with breast cancer or survivors were interviewed. Participants were recruited at 9 large hospitals in Spain and intentional sampling methods were applied. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview that was elaborated with the help of medical oncologists, nurses, and psycho-oncologists. Data were processed by adopting a thematic analysis approach. Results The diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer entails a radical change in patients’ day-to-day that linger in the mid-term. Seven stages have been defined that correspond to the different medical processes: diagnosis/unmasking stage, surgery/cleaning out, chemotherapy/loss of identity, radiotherapy/transition to normality, follow-up care/the “new” day-to-day, relapse/starting over, and metastatic/time-limited chronic breast cancer. The most relevant aspects of each are highlighted, as are the various cross-sectional aspects that manifest throughout the entire patient journey. Conclusions Comprehending patients’ experiences in depth facilitates the detection of situations of risk and helps to identify key moments when more precise information should be offered. Similarly, preparing the women for the process they must confront and for the sequelae of medical treatments would contribute to decreasing their uncertainty and concern, and to improving their quality-of-life."
https://openalex.org/W3201178345,"Background Biobanks ensure the long-term storage and accessibility of biospecimens and corresponding data sets. Thus, they form the foundation for many research projects which may contribute to improving medical care. With the establishment of the German Biobank Node and Alliance, expertise in biobanking is bundled and strengthened. An important component within this research infrastructure is the set-up of an information technology (IT) network for allowing feasibility requests across individual biobanks. Objective We aim to describe relevant aspects that have shaped the journey to interconnect biobanks, to enhance their visibility within the research-community, to harmonize data, and to enable feasibility searches to support access to available data and biosamples. Methods To achieve this task, we resorted to a wide variety of methods: we ran a requirement analysis, decided on the mode of operation for the federated team of IT-developers and on the development approach itself, took related national and international initiatives into account, and concluded with evaluations of the developed software artefacts and the operation of the entire chain of applications. Results We drew an IT framework including all heterogeneous data aspects derived from our requirement analysis and developed a comprehensive IT infrastructure. The successful implementation benefited from a smooth interaction of a federated IT team distributed across all participating sites that was even able to manage a major technology change mid-project. Authentication and project management services from associated partners could be integrated and the graphic user interface for an intuitive search tool for biospecimens was designed iteratively. The developed code is open source to ensure sustainability and the local implementation is concluded and functioning. The evaluation of the components was positive. Conclusions The entire project had given ample opportunity for challenges, predictable and unpredictable—from the mode of operation to changing some of the initial ideas. We learned our lessons concerning personnel, budget planning and technical as well as manual monitoring as well as some requirements arising only during the process of the project. Nevertheless, we can here report a success story of a network infrastructure, highly agile and much easier in local installation than initially anticipated."
https://openalex.org/W3200191442,"Background This study aimed to use a concept mapping methodology to develop a European framework of the needs of parents/guardians (P/G) for supporting athletes combining sport and education (dual career, DC). Methods By means of a concept mapping methodology, 337 French, Irish, Italian, Portuguese, and Slovenian parents sorted and rated 80 potential statements associated to parenting DC athletes. Results Five distinct clusters emerged: 1. P/G’ roles, needs and awareness to support athletes, including 22 statements (mean:3.7; range: 3.2–4.2 pt); 2. Requirements for effective planning of DC pathway, including 19 statements (mean:3.7; range: 3.2–4.5 pt); 3. Educational opportunity, including 13 statements (mean:3.5; range: 3.1–4.0 pt); 4. Policy and provision for DC, including 19 statements (mean:3.7; range: 3.1–4.2 pt); and 5. Athletes’ lifestyle &amp; self-management, including 7 statements (mean:4.0; range: 3.5–4.5 pt). Estimates of effect size (Partial eta-squared) were calculated for ANOVAs to assess the degree of variability on the statement importance ranking as the dependent variable accounted for by the demographic data. The concept mapping showed good validity (stress value: 0.11) and high reliability (rSHT: 0.99, rSHM: 0.98; rRR:0.98). One-third of the statements indicated differences (p&lt;0.05) in relation to the P/Gs’ gender and the athletes’ education level, competition level and sport typology. Conclusion In synthesizing the opinions, experience and needs of P/Gs of DC athletes the present framework provided sound theoretical underpinnings to inform the development of an online educational programme for empowering parenting DC athletes ( https://edu.empatiasport.eu/eng/ ), as well as be a foundation for future Pan-European DC research on how these statements interact with each other, in different European contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3200512440,"Detail is a double edged sword in epidemiological modelling. The inclusion of mechanistic detail in models of highly complex systems has the potential to increase realism, but it also increases the number of modelling assumptions, which become harder to check as their possible interactions multiply. In a major study of the Covid-19 epidemic in England, Knock et al. (2020) fit an age structured SEIR model with added health service compartments to data on deaths, hospitalization and test results from Covid-19 in seven English regions for the period March to December 2020. The simplest version of the model has 684 states per region. One main conclusion is that only full lockdowns brought the pathogen reproduction number, R , below one, with R ≫ 1 in all regions on the eve of March 2020 lockdown. We critically evaluate the Knock et al. epidemiological model, and the semi-causal conclusions made using it, based on an independent reimplementation of the model designed to allow relaxation of some of its strong assumptions. In particular, Knock et al. model the effect on transmission of both non-pharmaceutical interventions and other effects, such as weather, using a piecewise linear function, b ( t ), with 12 breakpoints at selected government announcement or intervention dates. We replace this representation by a smoothing spline with time varying smoothness, thereby allowing the form of b ( t ) to be substantially more data driven, and we check that the corresponding smoothness assumption is not driving our results. We also reset the mean incubation time and time from first symptoms to hospitalisation, used in the model, to values implied by the papers cited by Knock et al. as the source of these quantities. We conclude that there is no sound basis for using the Knock et al. model and their analysis to make counterfactual statements about the number of deaths that would have occurred with different lockdown timings. However, if fits of this epidemiological model structure are viewed as a reasonable basis for inference about the time course of incidence and R , then without very strong modelling assumptions, the pathogen reproduction number was probably below one, and incidence in substantial decline, some days before either of the first two English national lockdowns. This result coincides with that obtained by more direct attempts to reconstruct incidence. Of course it does not imply that lockdowns had no effect, but it does suggest that other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) may have been much more effective than Knock et al. imply, and that full lockdowns were probably not the cause of R dropping below one."
https://openalex.org/W3200758320,"Deciphering the molecular and cellular processes involved in foam cell formation is critical for us to understand the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is a transcription factor originally identified as a key player in the differentiation of T cells and maturation of immune system. Nowadays it has been brought into attention that NFAT also regulates multiple pathophysiological processes and targeted intervention in NFAT may be effective in the treatment of some cardiovascular diseases. However, whether NFAT is involved in foam cell formation remains elusive. NFAT in human monocyte-derived macrophage was activated by ox-LDL and translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. NFAT then directly bound to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in the nucleus and negatively regulated its transcriptional activity. NFATc2 knockdown or NFAT inhibitor 11R-VIVIT increased cholesterol efflux (by activating PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1 cascade) and reduced the uptake of modified lipoprotein (in a PPARγ-independent way) in macrophage, thus prevented foam cell formation. Besides, 11R-VIVIT also exerted a protective role in the development of atherosclerosis in western diet-fed ApoE-/- mice. These results suggest NFAT inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W3201370679,"Introduction Improved hygiene and sanitation practices in educational settings are effective for the prevention of infections, controlling the transmission of pathogens, and promoting good health. Bangladesh has made remarkable advances in improving higher education in recent decades. Over a hundred universities were established to expand higher education facilities across the country. Hundreds of thousands of graduate students spend time in university settings during their studies. However, little is known about the sanitation and hygiene practice of the university-going population. This study aims to understand and uncover which factors influence students’ sanitation and hygiene behavior in university settings. Methods This study was conducted in a public university named Shahjalal University of Science and Technology located in a divisional city of Bangladesh. Based on the Integrated Behavioral Model for Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (IBM-WASH), we adopted an exploratory qualitative study design. We developed semi-structured interview guides entailing sanitation and hygiene behavior, access, and practice-related questions and tested their efficacy and clarity before use. We conducted seventeen in-depth interviews (IDIs), and four focus group discussions (FGDs, [6–8 participants per FGD]) with students, and seven key informant interviews (KIIs) with university staff. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Triangulation of methods and participants was performed to achieve data validity. Results Despite having reasonable awareness and knowledge, the sanitation and hygiene practices of the students were remarkably low. A broad array of interconnected factors influenced sanitation and hygiene behavior, as well as each other. Individual factors (gender, awareness, perception, and sense of health benefits), contextual factors (lack of cleanliness and maintenance, and the supply of sanitary products), socio-behavioural factors (norms, peer influence), and factors related to university infrastructure (shortage of female toilets, lack of monitoring and supervision of cleaning activities) emerged as the underpinning factors that determined the sanitation and hygiene behavior of the university going-population. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that despite the rapid expansion of on-campus university education, hygiene practices in public universities are remarkably poor due to a variety of dynamic and interconnected factors situated in different (individual, contextual, socio-phycological) levels. Therefore, multi-level interventions including regular supply of WASH-related materials and agents, promoting low-cost WASH interventions, improving quality cleaning services, close monitoring of cleaning activities, promoting good hygiene behavior at the individual level, and introducing gender-sensitive WASH infrastructure and construction may be beneficial to advance improved sanitation and hygiene practices among university students."
https://openalex.org/W3199464080,"Multisensory experience is crucial for developing a coherent perception of the world. In this context, vision and audition are essential tools to scaffold spatial and temporal representations, respectively. Since speed encompasses both space and time, investigating this dimension in blindness allows deepening the relationship between sensory modalities and the two representation domains. In the present study, we hypothesized that visual deprivation influences the use of spatial and temporal cues underlying acoustic speed perception. To this end, ten early blind and ten blindfolded sighted participants performed a speed discrimination task in which spatial, temporal, or both cues were available to infer moving sounds’ velocity. The results indicated that both sighted and early blind participants preferentially relied on temporal cues to determine stimuli speed, by following an assumption that identified as faster those sounds with a shorter duration. However, in some cases, this temporal assumption produces a misperception of the stimulus speed that negatively affected participants’ performance. Interestingly, early blind participants were more influenced by this misleading temporal assumption than sighted controls, resulting in a stronger impairment in the speed discrimination performance. These findings demonstrate that the absence of visual experience in early life increases the auditory system’s preference for the time domain and, consequentially, affects the perception of speed through audition."
https://openalex.org/W3199612976,"Circadian heart rate (HR) is influenced by hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors particularly smoking, obesity and dyslipidemia. Until now, to evaluate the HR changes due to presence of these risk factors, a single HR office measure or a mean evaluated on day time or night time or 24h was used. However, since HR shows a circadian behavior, a single value represents only a rough approximation of this behavior. In this study, we analyzed the influence of smoking, obesity and dyslipidemia on the circadian rhythm in normotensive and hypertensive subject groups presenting only one of these risk factors. The 24h HR recordings of 170 normotensive (83 without risk factors, 20 smokers, 44 with dyslipidemia, 23 obese) and 353 hypertensive (169 without risk factors, 32 smokers, 99 with dyslipidemia, 53 obese) subjects were acquired using a Holter Blood Pressure Monitor. Results highlighted a specific circadian behavior with three characteristic periods presenting different HR means and rates of HR change in the eight subject groups. The slopes could be used both to estimate the morning HR surge associated with acute cardiovascular effects in the awakening and to evaluate the decline during the night. Moreover, we suggest to use three HR mean values (one for each identified period of the day) rather than two HR values to better describe the circadian HR behavior. Furthermore, smoking increased and dyslipidemia decreased mean HR values from 10:00 to 04:00, both in normotensive and hypertensive subjects in comparison with subjects without risk factors. In this time interval, hypertensive obese subjects showed higher values while normotensive ones presented quite similar values than subjects without risk factors. During the awakening (05:00–10:00) the slopes were similar among all groups with no significant difference among the mean HR values."
https://openalex.org/W3199722401,"Besides stimulus intensities and interstimulus intervals (ISI), the electric field (E-field) orientation is known to affect both short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (SICF) in paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). However, it has yet to be established how distinct orientations of the conditioning (CS) and test stimuli (TS) affect the SICI and SICF generation. With the use of a multi-channel TMS transducer that provides electronic control of the stimulus orientation and intensity, we aimed to investigate how changes in the CS and TS orientation affect the strength of SICI and SICF. We hypothesized that the CS orientation would play a major role for SICF than for SICI, whereas the CS intensity would be more critical for SICI than for SICF. In eight healthy subjects, we tested two ISIs (1.5 and 2.7 ms), two CS and TS orientations (anteromedial (AM) and posteromedial (PM)), and four CS intensities (50, 70, 90, and 110% of the resting motor threshold (RMT)). The TS intensity was fixed at 110% RMT. The intensities were adjusted to the corresponding RMT in the AM and PM orientations. SICI and SICF were observed in all tested CS and TS orientations. SICI depended on the CS intensity in a U-shaped manner in any combination of the CS and TS orientations. With 70% and 90% RMT CS intensities, stronger PM-oriented CS induced stronger inhibition than weaker AM-oriented CS. Similar SICF was observed for any CS orientation. Neither SICI nor SICF depended on the TS orientation. We demonstrated that SICI and SICF could be elicited by the CS perpendicular to the TS, which indicates that these stimuli affected either overlapping or strongly connected neuronal populations. We concluded that SICI is primarily sensitive to the CS intensity and that CS intensity adjustment resulted in similar SICF for different CS orientations."

https://openalex.org/W3199422312,"Pleiotrophin is a pleiotropic cytokine that has been demonstrated to have a critical role in regulating energy metabolism, lipid turnover and plasticity of adipose tissue. Here, we hypothesize that this cytokine can be involved in regulatory processes of glucose and lipid homeostasis in the liver during pregnancy. Using 18-days pregnant Ptn-deficient mice, we evaluated the biochemical profile (circulating variables), tissue mRNA expression (qPCR) and protein levels of key enzymes and transcription factors involved in main metabolic pathways. Ptn deletion was associated with a reduction in body weight gain, hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. Moreover, we observed an impairment in glucose synthesis and degradation during late pregnancy in Ptn-/- mice. Hepatic lipid content was significantly lower (73.6%) in Ptn-/- mice and was associated with a clear reduction in fatty acid, triacylglycerides and cholesterol synthesis. Ptn deletion was accompanying with a diabetogenic state in the mother and a decreased expression of key proteins involved in glucose and lipid uptake and metabolism. Moreover, Ptn-/- pregnant mice have a decreased expression of transcription factors, such as PPAR-α, regulating lipid uptake and glucose and lipid utilization. Furthermore, the augmented expression and nuclear translocation of glycerol kinase, and the decrease in NUR77 protein levels in the knock-out animals can further explain the alterations observed in hepatic glucose metabolism. Our results point out for the first time that pleiotrophin is an important player in maintaining hepatic metabolic homeostasis during late gestation, and further highlighted the moonlighting role of glycerol kinase in the regulation of maternal glucose homeostasis during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3201129915,"Our recent studies have shown that haspin, a protein kinase imperative for mitosis, is engaged in the interphase progression of HeLa and U2OS cancer cells. In this investigation, we employed the Fucci reporter system and time-lapse imaging to examine the impact of haspin gene silencing on cell cycle progressions at a single-cell level. We found that the loss of haspin induced multiple cell cycle defects. Specifically, the S/G2 duration was greatly prolonged by haspin gene depletion or inhibition in synchronous HeLa cells. Haspin gene depletion in asynchronous HeLa and U2OS cells led to a similarly protracted S/G2 phase, followed by mitotic cell death or postmitotic G1 arrest. In addition, haspin deficiency resulted in robust induction of the p21CIP1/WAF1 checkpoint protein, a target of the p53 activation. Also, co-depleting haspin with either p21 or p53 could rescue U2OS cells from postmitotic G1 arrest and partially restore their proliferation. These results substantiate the haspin's capacity to regulate interphase and mitotic progression, offering a broader antiproliferative potential of haspin loss in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3201314263,"Background Cannabis has been used worldwide for centuries for industrial, recreational and medicinal use, however, to date no successful attempts at editing genes involved in cannabinoid biosynthesis have been reported. This study proposes and develops an in silico best practices approach for the design and implementation of genome editing technologies in cannabis to target all genes involved in cannabinoid biosynthesis. Results A large dataset of reference genomes was accessed and mined to determine copy number variation and associated SNP variants for optimum target edit sites for genotype independent editing. Copy number variance and highly polymorphic gene sequences exist in the genome making genome editing using CRISPR, Zinc Fingers and TALENs technically difficult. Evaluation of allele or additional gene copies was determined through nucleotide and amino acid alignments with comparative sequence analysis performed. From determined gene copy number and presence of SNPs, multiple online CRISPR design tools were used to design sgRNA targeting every gene, accompanying allele and homologs throughout all involved pathways to create knockouts for further investigation. Universal sgRNA were designed for highly homologous sequences using MultiTargeter and visualised using Sequencher, creating unique sgRNA avoiding SNP and shared nucleotide locations targeting optimal edit sites. Conclusions Using this framework, the approach has wider applications to all plant species regardless of ploidy number or highly homologous gene sequences. Significance statement Using this framework, a best-practice approach to genome editing is possible in all plant species, including cannabis, delivering a comprehensive in silico evaluation of the cannabinoid pathway diversity from a large set of whole genome sequences. Identification of SNP variants across all genes could improve genome editing potentially leading to novel applications across multiple disciplines, including agriculture and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3201517441,"Black bears ( Ursus americanus ) are an iconic and common species throughout much of the United States and people regularly interact with these large predators without conflict. However, negative interactions between people and bears can manifest in conflicts that can hinder conservation efforts. Black bears are highly attracted to anthropogenic sources of food, and negative interactions with people are primarily a product of trash mismanagement. In the Catskills region of New York State, home to a large population of black bears, over 400 such conflicts are reported each year. While the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) has seen progress recently in educating residents of the region on how to reduce unwanted interactions with bears, they have had less success educating the 12 million tourists that visit the Catskills each year. Understanding where conflict may occur in the future, and the environmental and anthropogenic factors that precede it, may help guide management strategies to reduce these unwanted interactions. Therefore, we designed resource selection probability functions (RSPFs) to examine the relationship between human-black bear conflicts in the Catskills with a suite of landscape and anthropogenic data, using conflicts reported to the DEC across the state of New York in 2018–2019. We found that human-black bear conflicts were more likely to occur in the residential areas of the Catskills on the urban-wildland interface; areas with relatively higher human population densities, away from dense forest, and further from heavily urbanized areas. While future work is needed to continuously validate our model predictions, our results will provide the DEC and other conservation managers in the Catskills the ability to create more targeted plans for mitigating unwanted human-black bear interactions, and provide a better understanding of the mechanisms driving human-carnivore interactions at an urban-wildland interface more generally."
https://openalex.org/W3199230474,"In this study, we seek to perform macro analysis of fertility in a panel of 6 selected Pacific Island Countries (PICs, hereafter). The macro analysis with secondary data, mostly obtained from World Bank database, stretched over the period 1990–2019 was stacked randomly in a balanced panel set-up, within which the most preferred fixed effect model is used for multivariate analysis. Pooled OLS and Random effect estimation techniques were applied for comparing results. Categories such as women’s empowerment, health, connectivity and cost of living were used to classify proxy variables as regressors for fertility determination. The results indicate variables such as contraceptive prevalence rate, female labour force participation rate and consumer price index (inflation) are negatively correlated with fertility at 1% level, while urbanisation is negatively correlated with fertility rate only at 10% significance level. Real GDP has negative relationship with fertility, however it is not statistically significant. Variables that are positively correlated with fertility but hold limited to no significance effects are female secondary enrolment, female population, mobile subscription and infant mortality rate. It is implied that those variables that are negatively associated with fertility, as well as Real GDP will be the major drivers for achieving replacement level fertility in the long run."

This study examined whether the seroprevalence of measles antibody differed between children with and without allergic diseases in the general pediatric population. Methods The cross-sectional study was performed within a prospective general birth cohort (a pilot study of the Japan Environment &amp; Children’s Pilot Study [JECS]) of children aged 8 years. The clinical history of allergic diseases, measles, and the concentration of measles immunoglobulin G titers in serum enzyme immunoassay were examined. Fisher’s exact tests were used to assess the relationships between the allergic characteristics of the children and their measles antibody positivity rates. Results This study included 162 children. Any allergic disease was reported in 75 (46.3%). The measles antibody positivity rate was 94.7% among children with any allergic diseases and 92.0% among children without allergic diseases. Our results revealed no differences in measles antibody seropositivity between children with allergies and controls. Conclusions Children with allergies mount and maintain a comparable immune response to the measles vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W3200262976,"Aims To compare the biometric data from partial coherence interferometry (PCI) and swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) in patients with age-related cataract and epiretinal membrane (ERM): ERM, ERM with foveoschisis and macular pseudohole. Methods 49 eyes of 49 subjects including 36 ERM, 9 ERM foveoschisis and 4 macular pseudohole were analysed to evaluate the axial length (AL) measurements and the presence of AL measurement errors, defined basing on the shape of the biometric output graphs and on the concordance of AL values between instruments. Eyes with ERM were divided in four stages according to OCT features (i.e. presence/absence of the foveal pit, presence of ectopic inner foveal layers, disrupted retinal layers). Results The devices provided similar mean AL measurements in all subgroups, with differences &lt;0.1 mm in 41/49 cases (83.6%). AL measurement errors were observed in ERM stages 3 and 4, characterized by ectopic inner foveal layers, and were significantly more frequent with the PCI (8/17, 47%) as compared with the SS-OCT device (2/17, 12%), p = 0.02. The refractive prediction error in cases with AL measurement errors was significantly greater using the PCI compared to the SS-OCT device (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion Both devices provide reliable biometric data in the majority of patients and can be used in the preoperative assessment of patients with age-related cataract and ERM. In eyes with ectopic inner foveal layers, attention should be paid as AL measurement and refractive prediction errors may occur, more frequently with the PCI device."

Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), right ventricular index of myocardial performance (RIMP), plasma concentrations of mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) and C-terminal pro-endothelin-1 (CT-proET1) were measured on day 7 of life.RIMP was significantly increased (median [IQR] 0.3 [0.23-0.38] vs 0.22 [0.15-0.29]), TAPSE decreased (median [IQR] 5.0 [5.0-6.0] vs 6.0 [5.4-7.0] mm), MR-proANP increased (median [IQR] 784 [540-936] vs 353 [247-625] pmol/L), and CT-proET1 increased (median [IQR] 249 [190-345] vs 199 [158-284] pmol/L) in infants who developed BPD or died, as compared to controls. All variables showed significant but weak correlations with each other (rS -0.182 to 0.359) and predicted BPD/death with similar accuracy (areas under receiver operator characteristic curves 0.62 to 0.77). Multiple regression revealed only RIMP and birth weight as independent predictors of BPD or death.Vasoactive peptide concentrations and echocardiographic assessment employing standardized measures, notably RIMP, on day 7 of life are useful to identify preterm infants at increased risk for BPD or death."
https://openalex.org/W3200953119,"Exaggerated inflammatory response results in pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF) is a multi-functional pro-inflammatory cytokine regulating a wide spectrum of physiological, biological, and cellular processes. TNF induces Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) for various activities including induction of pro-inflammatory response. The mechanism of FAK activation by TNF is unknown and the involvement of cell surface integrins in modulating TNF response has not been determined. In the current study, we have identified an oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) as a soluble extracellular lipid amplifying TNF mediated innate immune pro-inflammatory response. Our results demonstrated that 25HC-integrin-FAK pathway amplifies and optimizes TNF-mediated pro-inflammatory response. 25HC generating enzyme cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (C25H) was induced by TNF via NFκB and MAPK pathways. Specifically, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay identified binding of AP-1 (Activator Protein-1) transcription factor ATF2 (Activating Transcription Factor 2) to the C25H promoter following TNF stimulation. Furthermore, loss of C25H, FAK and α5 integrin expression and inhibition of FAK and α5β1 integrin with inhibitor and blocking antibody, respectively, led to diminished TNF-mediated pro-inflammatory response. Thus, our studies show extracellular 25HC linking TNF pathway with integrin-FAK signaling for optimal pro-inflammatory activity and MAPK/NFκB-C25H-25HC-integrin-FAK signaling network playing an essential role to amplify TNF dependent pro-inflammatory response. Thus, we have identified 25HC as the key factor involved in FAK activation during TNF mediated response and further demonstrated a role of cell surface integrins in positively regulating TNF dependent pro-inflammatory response."

In this study, its impact in Ecuador is described, with data collected during the first phase of the pandemic. The objective of this study was to analyse the level of psychological distress in the population of Ecuador during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and findings Cross-sectional observational study. The questionnaires were collected through an online self-developed questionnaire, between April 2 and May 17, 2020, using the non-probabilistic sampling methodology: snowball method. The variables considered were sociodemographic variables, physical symptoms, health status, COVID-19 contact history, preventive measures, and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The percentage with high psychological distress (PD) (GHQ-12 ≥ 3) has been somewhat lower than that found in Europe, being women, young people, people with higher level of education, living without a partner, not living with children or children under 16 years of age, and with worse perception of health the groups with the highest PD. Differences have been observed with European studies regarding common symptoms, preventive measures to avoid contagion, percentage of infected relatives, or diagnostic tests performed. Conclusions The use of the same research instrument, validated in Europe and adapted to Ecuador, has facilitated the comparison of the found results and differences, which can be explained by socio-economic or cultural variables, the health system, level of information, or by preventive measures put in place to prevent the pandemic."

In this study, we model the trajectories of technical skill development in young basketball players and investigate the effects of training experience, training volume, body composition, maturity status, physical performance, and club characteristics on skill development. A total of 264 male basketballers from five age-cohorts (11 to 15 years of age) were followed consecutively over three years using a mixed-longitudinal design. Technical skills, training experience and volume, basic anthropometrics, body composition, biological maturation and physical performance were assessed bi-annually. A multilevel hierarchical linear model was used for trajectory analysis. Non-linear trends ( p &lt; 0.01) were observed in speed shot shooting, control dribble, defensive movement, slalom sprint, and slalom dribble. Being more experienced and physically fitter had a significant ( p &lt; 0.05) positive effect on technical skill development; greater fat-free mass negatively affected skills demanding quick running and rapid changes of direction with or without the ball ( p &lt; 0.05). Training volume and biological age did not explain differences in technical skill development ( p &gt; 0.05). Moreover, belonging to different clubs had no significant influence on the technical skills trajectories of players. Our findings highlight the important role that individual differences play, over and beyond club structure, in developing skills. Findings improve our understanding on how technical skills develop during adolescence through training, growth, and biological maturation."

The endogenous process of reactive oxygen species generation which leads to various degenerative diseases, can be broken down using these exogenous moieties from plant origin, herein this study we sought to evaluate the antioxidant potential of the DAM-1 compound using Caenorhabditis elegans (C . elegans) , which is the primary model to study the antioxidant activity of compounds. Cytotoxicity assay results showed that DAM-1 treatment in the concentration of 10, 25 and 50 μg/ml has shown 100%, 91%, and 50% survival respectively with overall p &lt;0.0001 (treatment v/s control group). 3-(4,5- di methyl thiazol -2-yl)-2,5-di phenyl tetrazolium bromide–Formazan (MTT) assay results showed that treatment had better survival rates than the control group at different time intervals i.e. 48 h, and 72 h with p &lt;0.01. Mechanosensation (behavioral study) as well as in vivo study results showed that at 0 h, 10 μg/ml of DAM-1 treatment showed a better anti-oxidative activity than the control group, 25 and 50 μg/ml of DAM-1 treated groups with p &lt;0.001 but at 2.5 h incubation with 10, 25, 50 μg/ml of DAM-1 showed an increased anti-oxidative activity than the control group with p &lt;0.001.

The study aim was to describe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and cut-offs for defining long COVID in primary care follow-up patients. Methods A retrospective observational study in primary care in Madrid, Spain, was conducted. Data was collected during 6 months (April to September) in 2020, during COVID-19 first wave, from patients ≥ 18 years with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia diagnosed. Variables: sociodemographic, comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms and complications, laboratory test and chest X-ray. Descriptive statistics were used, mean (standard deviation (SD)) and medians (interquartile range (IQR)) respectively. Differences were detected applying X 2 test, Student’s T -test, ANOVA, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis depending on variable characteristics. Results 155 patients presented pneumonia in day 7.8 from the onset (79.4% were hospitalized, median length of 7.0 days (IQR: 3.0, 13.0)). After discharge, the follow-up lasted 54.0 median days (IQR 42.0, 88.0) and 12.2 mean (SD 6.4) phone calls were registered per patient. The main symptoms and their duration were: cough (41.9%, 12 days), dyspnoea (31.0%, 15 days), asthenia (26.5%, 21 days). Different cut-off points were applied for long COVID and week 4 was considered the best milestone (28.3% of the sample still had symptoms after week 4) versus week 12 (8.3%). Patients who still had symptoms &gt;4 weeks follow-up took place over 81.0 days (IQR: 50.5, 103.0), their symptoms were more prevalent and lasted longer than those ≤ 4 weeks: cough (63.6% 30 days), dyspnoea (54.6%, 46 days), and asthenia (56.8%, 29 days). Embolism was more frequent in patients who still had symptoms &gt;4 weeks than those with symptoms ≤4 weeks (9.1% vs 1.8%, p value 0.034). Conclusion Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia recovered during the first 4 weeks from the beginning of the infection. The cut-off point to define long COVID, as persisting symptoms, should be between 4 to 12 weeks from the onset of the symptoms."

In order to assess the impact of this ""hot-spotting"" proposal we model the spread of disease using percolation theory, a collection of analytical techniques from statistical physics. Furthermore, we introduce a novel measure which we call the efficiency, defined as the percentage decrease in the reproduction number per percentage of the population vaccinated. We find that optimal implementations of the proposal can achieve herd immunity with as little as half as many vaccine doses as a non-targeted strategy, and is attractive even for relatively low rates of app usage."

https://openalex.org/W3201050000,"Introduction Quality of medicines in both developed and developing countries is sometimes compromised due to infiltration of counterfeit, substandard or degraded medicines into the markets. It is a public health concern as poor quality medicines endanger public health where patients are exposed to chemical toxins and/or sub-therapeutic doses. This could lead to reduced treatment efficacy and promote development of drug resistance. Co-trimoxazole, a fixed dose combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, is a broad spectrum for bacterial diseases and is also used as a prophylaxis for opportunistic infections in HIV infected individuals. This study evaluated quality of selected co-trimoxazole suspension brands marketed in Nairobi County, Kenya. Methods A total of 106 samples were collected, categorized into 15 brands and evaluated for active pharmaceutical ingredient content (API) and pH following United States Pharmacopeia. Assay for API was conducted using High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Results were compared with pharmacopeia references. Visual examination of labels and confirmation of retention status of the brands with Pharmacy and Poisons Board retention register was carried out. Results The samples were primarily of local origin (86.7%). On October 23, 2019, retention status of six of the fifteen brands documented were no longer listed in the Pharmacy and Poisons Board retention register. Of the 106 samples tested 70.6% and 86.8% were compliant with United States Pharmacopeia (USP) specifications for pH and API respectively while 84.0% adhered to packaging and labelling requirements. Conclusion This study has demonstrated that majority of co-trimoxazole suspensions tested were compliant with USP requirements. Additionally, it has provided evidence of poor quality co-trimoxazole medicines that could compromise treatment of infectious diseases in children. This emphasizes the need for regular quality assurance tests to ensure only quality medicines are in the market."
https://openalex.org/W3201472561,"Background Despite several intervention programs, the Bedouin population living in the Southern District of Israel has the highest mortality rate among children and adolescents from unintentional injuries. Our research questions asked: (1) How does increasing the involvement and participation of Bedouin community members influence the issue of unintentional injuries among children? (2) How does reframing of the technical issue of safety into security influence community involvement and cooperation? Objectives 1) To identify effective and efficacious positive deviance practices through community-based participatory research with adults, children, and professionals in the Bedouin community. 2) To create wider and deeper connections and cohesion between and among diverse Bedouin communities by seeding and sparking opportunities for social networking and cross-learning. Methods The study used a qualitative multi-method approach to generate a hybrid intervention model for reducing unintentional childhood injuries among the Bedouins. To frame the issue of unintentional injuries from the lived perspective of the Bedouins, we employed the Positive Deviance (PD) and Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach. Drawing upon theatrical traditions, entertainment-education (EE), was employed as a way to narratively engage and persuade the Bedouins. Results Our research resulted in: (1) the emergence of several PD ideas and practices for preventing and avoiding children’s injuries; (2) the actual creation of a safe and secure playroom for children at a neighborhood mosque; and (3) the creation of cascading and cross-learning social networks between and among members of the Bedouin community spread across various locations. Conclusion This study helped in reframing the technical issue of accidents and safety into the notion of sacredness and security, enhanced the association between emotions and cognition by means of experiential and EE methods, and stimulated creative thinking and the emergence of new culturally and contextually relevant ideas and practices through the PD process. It demonstrated the synergistic power of using a hybrid model that combined the rigor and vigor of different health communication approaches to address a significant disparity in the burden of child accidents faced by the Bedouins. Our study generated solutions that emerged from, and directly benefitted, Bedouin children—those, who face overwhelming risk of injury and death from preventable accidents."
https://openalex.org/W3199132618,"In the present work, non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to investigate the flow of liquid water between two metallic solid atomistic smooth walls. The present work focuses on the combined effect of external electric field and driving force on the slip behaviour and structure of liquid water at the solid-water interface. The upper wall of the set model is positively charged, and the lower wall of the model is negatively charged. The simulation results show that as the driving force increases, the slip length also increases. At a given driving force, no matter how the electric field intensity changes, there is almost no change in the slip length, so the slip length is independent of the electric field strength. In addition, the results found that there is a linear relationship between the slip length and the normalised main peak of the static structure factor under different driving forces."

This study aimed to measure the gap between pregnant women expectations of PMTCT services and perceptions of the actual PMTCT services and the relationship between their service gap scores and socio-demographic characteristics. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study design was conducted from August to September 2020 on a sample of 105 participants. A pre-tested SERVIQUAL questionnaire was used to collect data and paired sample t-test, independent one-sample t-test, and one–way ANOVA was used to compare mean service gap scores. A p-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The overall mean gap score was (+ 0.31) indicating pregnant women perceived value of the quality of care of PMTCT services. The gap score in the 5 service dimensions was as follows: empathy (+0.49), tangibles (+0.43), assurance (+0.22), responsiveness (+0.20), and reliability (+0.19). Marital status (p-value 0.031) was the only social demographic characteristic associated with pregnant women service gap scores. Conclusion Overall, pregnant women perceptions of PMTCT services provided in the RCH clinic at KCMC were meet. Marital status was associated with the overall pregnant women service gap scores and perceived quality of care with PMTCT services. Pregnant women who were married had small service gap scores compared to either divorced or widowed or cohabiting women."

https://openalex.org/W3200391309,"Larval dispersal and juvenile survival are crucial in determining variation in recruitment, stock size and adult distribution of commercially important fish. This study investigates the dispersal of early-life stages of common sole ( Solea solea L.) in the southern North Sea, both empirically and through modeling. Age at different life-history events of juvenile flatfish sampled along the coasts of Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom in 2013, 2014 and 2016, was determined through the counting of daily growth rings in the otoliths. Juveniles captured between August and October were estimated to be on average 140 days old with an average pelagic larval duration of 34 days. The hatching period was estimated between early April and mid-May followed by arrival and settlement in the nurseries between May and mid-June. Growth rates were higher off the Belgian coast than in the other nursery areas, especially in 2013, possibly due to a post-settlement differentiation. Empirical pelagic larval duration and settlement distributions were compared with the Larvae&amp;Co larval dispersal model, which combines local hydrodynamics in the North Sea with sole larval behavior. Yearly predicted and observed settlement matched partially, but the model estimated a longer pelagic phase. The observations fitted even better with the modelled average (1995–2015) distribution curves. Aberrant results for the small juvenile sole sampled along the UK coast in March 2016, led to the hypothesis of a winter disruption in the deposition of daily growth rings, potentially related to starvation and lower food availability. The similarities between measured and modelled distribution curves cross-validated both types of estimations and accredited daily ageing of juveniles as a useful method to calibrate biophysical models and to understand early-life history of fish, both important tools in support of efficient fisheries management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3200689932,"Synaesthesia refers to a diverse group of perceptions. These unusual perceptions are defined by the experience of concurrents; these are conscious experiences that are catalysed by attention to some normally unrelated stimulus, the inducer . In grapheme-colour synaesthesia numbers, letters, and words can all cause colour concurrents , and these are independent of the actual colour with which the graphemes are displayed. For example, when seeing the numeral ‘3’ a person with synaesthesia might experience green as the concurrent irrespective of whether the numeral is printed in blue, black, or red. As a trait, synaesthesia has the potential to cause both positive and negative effects. However, regardless of the end effect, synaesthesia incurs an initial cost when compared with its equivalent example from normal perception; this is the additional processing cost needed to generate the information on the concurrent . We contend that this cost can be reduced by mirroring the concurrent in the environment. We designed the Digital-Colour Calculator (DCC) app, allowing each user to personalise and select the colours with which it displays its digits; it is the first reported example of a device/approach that leverages the concurrent. In this article we report on the reactions to the DCC for a sample of fifty-three synaesthetes and thirty-five non-synaesthetes. The synaesthetes showed a strong preference for the DCC over its normal counterpart. The non-synaesthetes showed no obvious preference. When using the DCC a subsample of the synaesthete group showed consistent improvement in task speed (around 8%) whereas no synaesthete showed a decrement in their speed."

However, few studies have examined the effects of microorganism inoculation on higher trophic levels in natural conditions. We examined how the diversity of phytophagous insects and their natural enemies responded to the field-inoculation of soybean with a model arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), Rhizophagus irregularis , combined with a nitrogen-fixing bacterium, Bradyrhizobium japonicum , and a plant growth-promoting bacterium, Bacillus pumilus . We also investigate if the absence or presence of potassium fertilizer can affect this interaction. We found an increase in the abundance of piercing-sucking insects with the triple inoculant irrespective of potassium treatment, whereas there were no differences among treatments for other insect groups. A decrease in the abundance of the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines , with the double inoculant Rhizophagus + Bradyrhizobium was observed in potassium enriched plots and in the abundance of Empoasca spp. with potassium treatment independent of inoculation type. Although it was not possible to discriminate the mycorrhization realized by inoculum from that of the indigenous AMF in the field, we confirmed global negative effects of overall mycorrhizal colonization on the abundance of phytophagous piercing-sucking insects, phytophagous chewing insects, and the alpha diversity of phytophagous insects. In perspective, the use of AMF/Rhizobacteria inoculants in the field should focus on the identity and performance of strains to better understand their impact on insects."
