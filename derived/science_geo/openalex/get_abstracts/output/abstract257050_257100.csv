https://openalex.org/W2117734893,"We show that the Quantum Spin Hall Effect, a state of matter with topological properties distinct from conventional insulators, can be realized in HgTe/CdTe semiconductor quantum wells. By varying the thickness of the quantum well, the electronic state changes from a normal to an ""inverted"" type at a critical thickness $d_c$. We show that this transition is a topological quantum phase transition between a conventional insulating phase and a phase exhibiting the QSH effect with a single pair of helical edge states. We also discuss the methods for experimental detection of the QSH effect."
https://openalex.org/W2050338614,"A semi-empirical relation is presented that connects global sea-level rise to global mean surface temperature. It is proposed that, for time scales relevant to anthropogenic warming, the rate of sea-level rise is roughly proportional to the magnitude of warming above the temperatures of the pre–Industrial Age. This holds to good approximation for temperature and sea-level changes during the 20th century, with a proportionality constant of 3.4 millimeters/year per °C. When applied to future warming scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this relationship results in a projected sea-level rise in 2100 of 0.5 to 1.4 meters above the 1990 level."

https://openalex.org/W2145598654,"The Stardust spacecraft collected thousands of particles from comet 81P/Wild 2 and returned them to Earth for laboratory study. The preliminary examination of these samples shows that the nonvolatile portion of the comet is an unequilibrated assortment of materials that have both presolar and solar system origin. The comet contains an abundance of silicate grains that are much larger than predictions of interstellar grain models, and many of these are high-temperature minerals that appear to have formed in the inner regions of the solar nebula. Their presence in a comet proves that the formation of the solar system included mixing on the grandest scales."
https://openalex.org/W1987062630,"Cells must amplify external signals to orient and migrate in chemotactic gradient fields. We find that human neutrophils release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from the leading edge of the cell surface to amplify chemotactic signals and direct cell orientation by feedback through P2Y2 nucleotide receptors. Neutrophils rapidly hydrolyze released ATP to adenosine that then acts via A3-type adenosine receptors, which are recruited to the leading edge, to promote cell migration. Thus, ATP release and autocrine feedback through P2Y2 and A3 receptors provide signal amplification, controlling gradient sensing and migration of neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1963728435,"The cross-plane thermal conductivity of thin films of WSe 2 grown from alternating W and Se layers is as small as 0.05 watts per meter per degree kelvin at room temperature, 30 times smaller than the c -axis thermal conductivity of single-crystal WSe 2 and a factor of 6 smaller than the predicted minimum thermal conductivity for this material. We attribute the ultralow thermal conductivity of these disordered, layered crystals to the localization of lattice vibrations induced by the random stacking of two-dimensional crystalline WSe 2 sheets. Disordering of the layered structure by ion bombardment increases the thermal conductivity."
https://openalex.org/W2001187576,"Controlled self-assembly of a trinitrofluorenone-appended gemini-shaped amphiphilic hexabenzocoronene selectively formed nanotubes or microfibers with different photochemical properties. In these nanotubes, which are 16 nanometers in diameter and several micrometers long, a molecular layer of electron-accepting trinitrofluorenone laminates an electron-donating graphitic layer of pi-stacked hexabenzocoronene. The coaxial nanotubular structure allows photochemical generation of spatially separated charge carriers and a quick photoconductive response with a large on/off ratio greater than 10(4). In sharp contrast, the microfibers consist of a charge-transfer complex between the hexabenzocoronene and trinitrofluorenone parts and exhibit almost no photocurrent generation."
https://openalex.org/W2047481433,"We developed a simple approach to combine broad classes of dissimilar materials into heterogeneously integrated electronic systems with two- or three-dimensional layouts. The process begins with the synthesis of different semiconductor nanomaterials, such as single-walled carbon nanotubes and single-crystal micro- and nanoscale wires and ribbons of gallium nitride, silicon, and gallium arsenide on separate substrates. Repeated application of an additive, transfer printing process that uses soft stamps with these substrates as donors, followed by device and interconnect formation, yields high-performance heterogeneously integrated electronics that incorporate any combination of semiconductor nanomaterials on rigid or flexible device substrates. This versatile methodology can produce a wide range of unusual electronic systems that would be impossible to achieve with other techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2111490211,"The bulk of the comet 81P/Wild 2 (hereafter Wild 2) samples returned to Earth by the Stardust spacecraft appear to be weakly constructed mixtures of nanometer-scale grains, with occasional much larger (over 1 micrometer) ferromagnesian silicates, Fe-Ni sulfides, Fe-Ni metal, and accessory phases. The very wide range of olivine and low-Ca pyroxene compositions in comet Wild 2 requires a wide range of formation conditions, probably reflecting very different formation locations in the protoplanetary disk. The restricted compositional ranges of Fe-Ni sulfides, the wide range for silicates, and the absence of hydrous phases indicate that comet Wild 2 experienced little or no aqueous alteration. Less abundant Wild 2 materials include a refractory particle, whose presence appears to require radial transport in the early protoplanetary disk."
https://openalex.org/W2153891637,"Organics found in comet 81P/Wild 2 samples show a heterogeneous and unequilibrated distribution in abundance and composition. Some organics are similar, but not identical, to those in interplanetary dust particles and carbonaceous meteorites. A class of aromatic-poor organic material is also present. The organics are rich in oxygen and nitrogen compared with meteoritic organics. Aromatic compounds are present, but the samples tend to be relatively poorer in aromatics than are meteorites and interplanetary dust particles. The presence of deuterium and nitrogen-15 excesses suggest that some organics have an interstellar/protostellar heritage. Although the variable extent of modification of these materials by impact capture is not yet fully constrained, a diverse suite of organic compounds is present and identifiable within the returned samples."
https://openalex.org/W1993484262,"The majority of known Toxoplasma gondii isolates from Europe and North America belong to three clonal lines that differ dramatically in their virulence, depending on the host. To identify the responsible genes, we mapped virulence in F 1 progeny derived from crosses between type II and type III strains, which we introduced into mice. Five virulence ( VIR ) loci were thus identified, and for two of these, genetic complementation showed that a predicted protein kinase (ROP18 and ROP16, respectively) is the key molecule. Both are hypervariable rhoptry proteins that are secreted into the host cell upon invasion. These results suggest that secreted kinases unique to the Apicomplexa are crucial in the host-pathogen interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2015293161,"Toxoplasma gondii strains differ dramatically in virulence despite being genetically very similar. Genetic mapping revealed two closely adjacent quantitative trait loci on parasite chromosome VIIa that control the extreme virulence of the type I lineage. Positional cloning identified the candidate virulence gene ROP18, a highly polymorphic serine-threonine kinase that was secreted into the host cell during parasite invasion. Transfection of the virulent ROP18 allele into a nonpathogenic type III strain increased growth and enhanced mortality by 4 to 5 logs. These attributes of ROP18 required kinase activity, which revealed that secretion of effectors is a major component of parasite virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2052465889,"We report a signaling mechanism in rats between mother and fetus aimed at preparing fetal neurons for delivery. In immature neurons, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter. We found that, shortly before delivery, there is a transient reduction in the intracellular chloride concentration and an excitatory-to-inhibitory switch of GABA actions. These events were triggered by oxytocin, an essential maternal hormone for labor. In vivo administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist before delivery prevented the switch of GABA actions in fetal neurons and aggravated the severity of anoxic episodes. Thus, maternal oxytocin inhibits fetal neurons and increases their resistance to insults during delivery."

https://openalex.org/W2166258821,"Hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopic compositions are heterogeneous among comet 81P/Wild 2 particle fragments; however, extreme isotopic anomalies are rare, indicating that the comet is not a pristine aggregate of presolar materials. Nonterrestrial nitrogen and neon isotope ratios suggest that indigenous organic matter and highly volatile materials were successfully collected. Except for a single 17 O-enriched circumstellar stardust grain, silicate and oxide minerals have oxygen isotopic compositions consistent with solar system origin. One refractory grain is 16 O-enriched, like refractory inclusions in meteorites, suggesting that Wild 2 contains material formed at high temperature in the inner solar system and transported to the Kuiper belt before comet accretion."
https://openalex.org/W2050234624,"Particles emanating from comet 81P/Wild 2 collided with the Stardust spacecraft at 6.1 kilometers per second, producing hypervelocity impact features on the collector surfaces that were returned to Earth. The morphologies of these surprisingly diverse features were created by particles varying from dense mineral grains to loosely bound, polymineralic aggregates ranging from tens of nanometers to hundreds of micrometers in size. The cumulative size distribution of Wild 2 dust is shallower than that of comet Halley, yet steeper than that of comet Grigg-Skjellerup."
https://openalex.org/W2041654773,"Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan involved in a wide variety of cellular functions. However, its turnover in living cells remains largely unknown. In this study, CD44, a receptor for HA, and hyaluronidase-1, -2, and -3 (Hyal-1, -2 and -3) were stably expressed in HEK 293 cells and the mechanism of HA catabolism was systematically investigated using fluorescein-labeled HA. CD44 was essential for HA degradation by both endogenous and exogenously expressed hyaluronidases. Hyal-1 was not able to cleave HA in living cells in the absence of CD44. Intracellular HA degradation was predominantly mediated by Hyal-1 after incorporation of HA by CD44. Although Hyal-1 was active only in intracellular space in vivo, a certain amount of the enzyme was secreted to extracellular space. This extracellular Hyal-1 was found to be incorporated by cells and such uptake of Hyal-1 was, in part, involved in the intracellular degradation of HA. Hyal-2 was involved in the extracellular degradation of HA. Hyal-2 activity was also dependent on the expression of CD44 in both living cells and enzyme assays. Immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated that both Hyal-2 and CD44 are present on the cell surface. Without CD44 expression, Hyal-2 existed in a granular pattern, and did not show hyaluronidase activity, suggesting that localization change could contribute to Hyal-2 function. A convenient and quantitative enzyme assay was established for the measurement of Hyal-2 activity. Hyal-2 activity was detected in the membrane fraction of cells co-expressing Hyal-2 and CD44. The pH optimum for Hyal-2 was 6.0–7.0. The membrane fraction of cells expressing Hyal-2 alone did not show hyaluronidase activity. Hyal-3 did not show any hyaluronidase activity in our experimental conditions. Based on these findings, Hyal-1 and -2 contribute to intracellular and extracellular catabolism of HA, respectively, in a CD44-dependent manner, and their HA degradation occurs independently from one another.

It is the simplest of the glycosaminoglycans, the only one not covalently linked to core protein, and is unbranched and composed of repeating alternating units of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. Despite the simplicity of its composition, HA has a great number of biological functions. It not only functions as a biological glue that participates in lubricating joints or holding together gel-like connective tissues, but also functions as a microenvironmental cue that co-regulates cell behavior during embryonic development and morphogenesis (1Toole B.P.

In the skin, which contains 50% of the total body HA, the half-life of HA is about 1 day, and even in as seemingly inert a tissue as cartilage, HA turns over with a half-life of 1–3 weeks (10Stern R. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In the bloodstream, the half-life of HA is 2–5 min (11Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Pertoft H. Baxter E. Biochem. J. 1981; 200: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). All such catabolism is presumably the result of hyaluronidases. Hyaluronidases and their attendant control mechanisms are apparently of critical importance in normal and abnormal biology. There are six hyaluronidase-like sequences in the mammalian genome. All are transcriptionally active with unique tissue distributions. In humans, three genes, HYAL1, HYAL2, and HYAL3 are clustered on chromosome 3p21.3, coding for Hyal-1, Hyal-2, and Hyal-3, respectively. Another three genes, HYAL4, PHYAL1, and SPAM1, are clustered similarly on chromosome 7q31.3. They code for Hyal-4, a pseudogene transcribed but not translated in humans, and PH-20, the sperm enzyme, respectively (12Csoka A.B. Scherer S.W. Stern R. Genomics. 1999; 60: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 13Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Among them, Hyal-1, Hyal-2, and Hyal-3 are somatically expressed hyaluronidases. Hyal-1, known as serum hyaluronidase, is an acid-active lysosomal enzyme (14Afify A.M. Stern M. Guntenhoener M. Stern R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Frost G.I. Csoka T.B. Wong T. Stern R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) that is able to utilize HA of any size as a substrate, and which predominantly generates tetrasaccharides. Hyal-2 (16Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Kreil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22466-22470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 17Lepperdinger G. Mullegger J. Kreil G. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) is also supposed to be an acid-active enzyme and is linked to plasma membranes by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (18Rai S.K. Duh F.M. Vigdorovich V. Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Lerman I. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4443-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This hyaluronidase has unique substrate specificity, cleaving high molecular mass HA polymers to intermediate size fragments of ∼20 kDa, or about 50 disaccharide units. Little is known about Hyal-3, whose strong hybridization expression patterns are found in mammalian testis and bone marrow (12Csoka A.B. Scherer S.W. Stern R. Genomics. 1999; 60: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These two tissues retain a fetal and stem cell-like state for the life of the animal, suggesting that Hyal-3 may have an important function in vivo. However, it has not been conclusively shown to possess hyaluronidase activity in vitro to date. Several studies have shown that the HA is endocytosed by cells (chondrocytes, macrophages, keratinocytes, etc.) for degradation and that the endocytosis is mediated via cell surface HA receptors. Endocytosis and degradation of HA was inhibited by the anti-CD44 antibody, suggesting that CD44 has a critical role in HA turnover (19Hua Q. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Culty M. Nguyen H.A. Underhill C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 21Tammi R. Rilla K.

A model was proposed based on observations in breast cancer cells (22Bourguignon L.Y. Singleton P.A. Diedrich F. Stern R. Gilad E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26991-27007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 23Stern R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The high molecular weight HA is tethered to the cell surface by the combined efforts of CD44 and Hyal-2. HA is cleaved by Hyal-2 to the 20-kDa limited sized products corresponding to about 50 disaccharide units in a specialized microenvironment. The Hyal-2-generated HA fragments are internalized, delivered to endosomes, and ultimately to lysosomes, where Hyal-1 degrades the 20-kDa fragments to small tetrasaccharides. However, the relationships and differences between these mammalian hyaluronidases have not been clearly demonstrated. In this study, various kinds of cell lines stably expressing human Hyal-1, Hyal-2, Hyal-3, and/or CD44 were established for systematic characterization of mammalian hyaluronidases, and for better understanding the HA catabolism in somatic tissues. HA catabolism in these cell lines was analyzed in detail using HA conjugated with fluorescein. In addition, an efficient and quantitative enzyme assay method was developed for the measurement of Hyal-2 activity. Hyal-1 and -2 was revealed to contribute to intracellular and extracellular catabolism of hyaluronic acid, respectively, in a CD44-dependent manner. Establishment of Cell Lines Expressing HYAL1, HYAL2, HYAL3, and CD44—HEK 293 (293) cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cDNA of human CD44 was amplified by a PCR using a Human Lymph Node cDNA Library (Takara) as a template, and inserted into the expression vector pRK5 (BD Pharmingen). HEK 293 cells were transfected with pRK5/CD44 and pSV2neo (Clontech) by a calcium phosphate transfection method. A cell lineage expressing CD44 was selected using 500 μg/ml of Geneticin (Invitrogen) and was named CD44/293. The cDNAs of human HYAL1, HYAL2, and HYAL3 were amplified by PCR and inserted, respectively, into the expression vector pIREShyg (Clontech). Each vector was transfected into 293 and CD44/293 cells. The transfectants were selected using 500 μg/ml of hygromycin B (Invitrogen). For example, CD44/293 cell lineage transfected with pIREShyg/HYAL1 was named Hyal-1/CD44/293. In some experiments, cDNA of human HYAL2 was inserted into the expression vector pRK5. CD44/293 cells were transfected with pRK5/HYAL2 and pTKhyg (Clontech) by a calcium phosphate transfection method. A cell lineage expressing Hyal-2 was selected using 500 μg/ml of hygromycin B (Invitrogen) and was named prkHyal-2/CD44/293. The coding region in the expression plasmids was checked for accuracy via complete sequencing. The accession numbers for the cDNAs are as follows: CD44, NM000610; HYAL1, U96078; HYAL2, U09577; and HYAL3, NM003549. Antibody—Anti-human CD44 monoclonal antibody (V6034) was purchased from Biomeda. Anti-human Hyal-2 polyclonal antibody was raised in a rabbit against the amino acid sequence CFYRDRLGLYPRFDSAGRSV. The specific antibodies were affinity purified using the immunizing peptide. Anti-human Hyal-3 polyclonal antibody was raised in a rabbit against amino acid sequences CAQQVFPDLDPQEQLYKA and CQEPRPGPKEAV. These antibodies were used in subsequent Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Western Blotting—Cells (5 × 106) were washed and collected with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was removed and 500 μl of lysis buffer (Bio-Rad) was added to the cells. The cells were lysed by sonication. The lysate was incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, and then 40 μg of total proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunoblotted with specific antibodies for human CD44, Hyal-2, or Hyal-3. After which they were detected using an ECL Plus Western blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Hyal-1 Activity—Cells were cultured in the medium for 3 days. Then, the conditioned medium was collected, and the cells were detached and harvested by washing 2 times with PBS. The cells were washed again with PBS and then disrupted in PBS by sonication. After centrifugation at 1300 × g, the supernatant (20 μg of total proteins) and the conditioned medium (5 μl) from each cell line was incubated with 40 μgof HA (800 ∼ 1200 kDa, Seikagaku Kogyo) in 50 μl of 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm formic acid, pH 3.7, at 37 °C for 24 h. In another experiment, conditioned medium was incubated with HA in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 24 h. An aliquot of the reaction solution was electrophoresed on 0.5% agarose gel and stained with Stains-all (Polysciences, Inc.). Preparation of Fluorescein-labeled HA and Biotin-conjugated HA—Fluorescein-labeled HA (fl-HA) was prepared as described by de Belder and Wik (24de Belder A.N. Wik K.O. Carbohydr. Res. 1975; 44: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, 50 mg of HA (800–1200 kDa, Seikagaku Kogyo) was dissolved in 40 ml of water, and mixed with 20 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Fluorescein amine, isotype I (25 mg, Aldrich) in Me2SO (0.5 ml) containing acetaldehyde (25 μl, Fluka) and cyclohexyl isocyanide (25 μl, Fluka) was added to the mixture. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 5 h, and then poured into 240 ml of ethanol saturated with NaCl. The precipitated fl-HA was collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g and air-dried in a chemical hood. The fl-HA was then dissolved in water and re-precipitated using NaCl-saturated ethanol twice. The fl-HA was further purified by exhaustive dialysis against distilled water. Biotin-conjugated HA was prepared similarly using biotin ethylenediamine (25 mg, Molecular Probes) instead of fluoresceinamine, isotype I. Characterization of fl-HA Degradation by Intact Cells Using Size Exclusion Chromatography—Cells (5 × 106) were plated in 10-cm type I collagen-coated dishes and cultured for 24 h. The cells were then cultured in 10 ml of medium containing fl-HA. After incubation, the conditioned medium was collected, and the cells were detached and harvested by washing 2 times with PBS. Then, the cells were washed again with PBS and incubated in 1 ml of 0.05% trypsin at 37 °C for 5 min followed by a 5-min centrifugation at 1300 × g. This supernatant was defined as the cell surface pool. The cell pellets were washed again 3 times with PBS and then incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 400 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) at 37 °C for 24 h to solubilize the cells and release the total intracellular material. The solubilized fraction was termed the intracellular pool. The fl-HA in 1 ml of conditioned medium, total cell surface pool, and the total intracellular pool was characterized by size exclusion chromatography using a Sepharose CL-2B (1.6 × 25 cm) column equilibrated with PBS. Fractions of 2.5 ml were collected at 0.5 ml/min and the fluorescence (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 535 nm) was determined by an ARVO Fluoroscan (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The column void volume was determined as the elution volume for blue dextran 2000 (Amersham Biosciences). Endocytosis of Hyal-1 by Cells—Cells (5 × 105) were plated on a 24-well type I collagen pre-coated plate and cultured for 24 h. The cells were then cultured for various periods of time in 1 ml of medium containing 50% conditioned medium from a 24-h confluent culture of Hyal-1/293 or 293 cells. After incubation, the cells were washed 3 times with PBS, and incubated in 1 ml of 0.05% trypsin at 37 °C for 5 min, followed by a 5-min centrifugation at 1300 × g. The cell pellets were washed again 2 times with PBS and disrupted in 500 μl of PBS by sonication. After centrifugation at 1300 × g, Hyal-1 activity in the supernatant (6.4 μg of total protein) was measured as described above. In another experiment, cells (5 × 106) were plated in 10-cm type I collagen-coated dishes and cultured for 24 h. The cells were then cultured in 10 ml of medium containing fl-HA (10 μg/ml) and 20% conditioned medium from a 24-h confluent culture of Hyal-1/293 or 293 cells. Then the medium, the cell surface pool, and the intracellular pool were prepared and analyzed by the Sepharose CL-2B column as described above. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence for Hyal-2 was basically performed according to the protocol for glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (25Ghiran I. Klickstein L.B. Nicholson-Weller A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21024-21031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (5 × 104) plated on a 96-well poly-d-lysine pre-coated plate were washed with PBS and blocked in a blocking solution (PBS supplemented with 5% normal goat serum) for 15 min at room temperature. After removing the blocking solution, the cells were incubated in primary antibodies, mouse anti-human CD44 antibody, and rabbit anti-human Hyal-2, in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature. After subsequent washings, the cells were stained with Cy5-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), Alexa Fluor 350-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes), and fl-HA in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Then the cells were washed and fixed in 10% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and immunofluorescence microscopy was done using an IN Cell Analyzer 1000 (GE Healthcare). Measurement of Hyal-2 Activity—Cells were washed and harvested with PBS, and disrupted by sonication in PBS. The suspensions of the disrupted cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. Then, the supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 1 h. The membrane fractions were washed 2 times and resuspended and adjusted to 1 mg/ml of total protein in 150 mm GTA (50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutaric acid, 50 mm Tris, 50 mm 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol)-HCl/NaOH buffer in a range of pH from 4.5 to 8.0 or in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 50 mm NaCl. A mixture of 1 ml of the membrane fractions (0.1 or 1 mg/ml of total protein) and fl-HA (1 or 3 μg) was incubated at 37 °C for various periods of time in the presence of various concentrations of NaCl, and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was applied to a Sepharose CL-2B column and eluted with PBS. The enzyme assay was further modified for more quantitative analysis in a microplate format. Biotin-conjugated HA (30 μl, 2 μg/ml in PBS) was immobilized onto 384-well, black, and high binding microplate (Greiner Bio-One) by incubation at 4 °C overnight. Then the plate was washed 3 times with 100 μl of 50 mm NaCl, 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The membrane fractions (40 μl, 0–100 μg/ml of total protein in 50 mm NaCl, 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5) were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for various periods of time. Then, each well was washed 3 times with 100 μl of 50 mm NaCl, 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The biotin-conjugated HA remaining on the plate was detected using DELFIA assay solutions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In brief, the plates were incubated with europium-labeled streptavidin for 1 h at room temperature and washed 3 times with the washing solution. Enhancement solution was added, mixed for 5 min, and the time-resolved fluorescence was determined by an ARVO Fluoroscan (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All these solutions were prepared and used according to the manufacturer’s directions. Establishment of 293 Cells Stably Expressing Hyal-1, Hyal-2, Hyal-3, and/or CD44—Various cells endogenously express hyaluronidases, but their expression level is relatively low, and several types of hyaluronidases are expressed simultaneously (12Csoka A.B. Scherer S.W. Stern R. Genomics. 1999; 60: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), resulting in difficulty in clear characterization of each hyaluronidase. In addition, the expression level of CD44 should be also taken into account for their characterization. These facts led us to establish various cell lines stably expressing CD44 and/or Hyal-1, -2, and -3 for functional analysis of each hyaluronidase in living cells. First, CD44-overexpressing cell lineage, named CD44/293, was established from 293 cells by transfection with human CD44 cDNA. Next, 293 and CD44/293 cells were transfected with the constructs for expressing human HYAL1, HYAL2, and HYAL3. The internal ribosome entry site (IRES) system was utilized for this purpose, as the system enabled us to establish multiple cell lines efficiently without cell cloning and to minimize the difference in background among various stably transfected cell lines for comparative studies. Consequently, hyaluronidase-expressing cell lines (Hyal-1/293, Hyal-2/293, and Hyal-3/293) and CD44-hyaluronidase co-expressing cell lines (Hyal-1/CD44/293, Hyal-2/CD44/293, and Hyal-3/CD44/293) were established. The total cell lysates were extracted from each cell line and Western blot analyses were performed using anti-human CD44, Hyal-2 and Hyal-3 antibodies to assess whether each protein was expressed appropriately (Fig. 1). Lysates from CD44-transfected 293 cells revealed a band with the same level of intensity at ∼96 kDa (Fig. 1A) that corresponds to the molecular mass of the standard form of human CD44. Similarly, Hyal-2 (Fig. 1B) and Hyal-3 (Fig. 1C) were detected at the corresponding molecular masses of 55 and 46 kDa, respectively. Because we could not raise specific anti-Hyal-1 antibodies, Hyal-1 expression was assessed by the hyaluronidase activity at pH 3.7, the pH optimum of Hyal-1 (15Frost G.I. Csoka T.B. Wong T. Stern R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), instead of Western blotting. Conditioned media were collected from the confluent cultures of each cell line and incubated with high molecular weight HA. HA incubated with the conditioned media from Hyal-1/293 and Hyal-1/CD44/293 cells was degraded to a low molecular weight (Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained when HA was incubated with the lysates from the cell lines (Fig. 1E). On the other hand, the acid-active hyaluronidase activity was not detected in conditioned media or lysates from the other cells. It should be noted that neither the conditioned media nor the lysates from any of the types of cells showed hyaluronidase activity at pH 7.4 (Fig. 1F). These results clearly indicate that only Hyal-1/293 and Hyal-1/CD44/293 cells were stably overexpressing Hyal-1 and that the expressed Hyal-1 was not only accumulated intracellularly, but was also secreted to the outside of the cells. Degradation of Fl-HA Incubated with Cells Expressing Hyal-1, Hyal-2, Hyal-3, and/or CD44—Fl-HA, high molecular mass HA conjugated with fluoresceinamine, was prepared and used for sensitive and quantitative analysis of HA catabolism by intact cells. The eight cell lines with different expression profiles in CD44 and hyaluronidases were cultured in the presence of fl-HA (10 μg/ml) for 48 h. After incubation, the conditioned medium (hereafter medium) was collected, and then the cells were treated with trypsin to remove pericellular-associated fl-HA (cell surface pool). The remaining cell pellets were further subjected to exhaustive protease digestion to solubilize the cells and liberate intracellular fl-HA (intracellular pool). The sizes of fl-HA in these three fractions were analyzed by a size exclusion chromatography. Fig. 2 shows fluorescence derived from fl-HA in each fraction of the Sepharose CL-2B chromatography. Without CD44 expression, none of Hyal-1, Hyal-2, and Hyal-3 affected catabolism of fl-HA. Most of the fl-HA in the medium remained intact and was eluted in the void volume of the Sepharose CL-2B column (Fig. 2, A–D). Only trace amounts of fl-HA were detected in the cell surface (Fig. 2, I–L) and intracellular pools (Fig. 2, Q–T). Whereas, even the HA turnover derived from the endogenous hyaluronidase was accelerated when CD44 was expressed. The high molecular weight fl-HA in the medium of the CD44/293 cells was decreased and the partially degraded products were increased (Fig. 2E). Taken together with the fact that the conditioned medium from CD44/293 cells did not show hyaluronidase activity at neutral pH (Fig. 1E), this result indicates that the fl-HA that bound to the cells with the aid of CD44 was degraded by endogenous hyaluronidase within or on the surface of the cells, and then released into the medium. Fl-HA was also incorporated into CD44/293 cells and partially degraded fl-HA was accumulated in intracellular pools (Fig. 2U). In Hyal-1/CD44/293 cells, only fl-HA incorporated into cells by CD44 was degraded by Hyal-1 to a low molecular weight (Fig. 2, F, N, and V). In the intracellular pool, fl-HA was eluted in the total volume of the Sepharose CL-2B column, whereas the elution profiles of fl-HA from the medium and the cell surface pool were similar to those of CD44/293 cells. In contrast, almost all the fl-HA in the medium of Hyal-2/CD44/293 cells was degraded, with the majority eluted in fractions 15–18 (Fig. 2G). This result indicates that Hyal-2 was responsible for the turnover of fl-HA accumulated in the extracellular space. The presence of CD44 is critical for the Hyal-2 activity. Accumulation of degraded fl-HA was not observed in the medium from the Hyal-2/293 cells (Fig. 2C). Although fl-HA degraded by Hyal-1 had a lower molecular weight than the products in the medium by Hyal-2, it was found only in the intracellular pool. The amount of fl-HA incorporated into the cells and degraded by Hyal-1 was ∼4% of fl-HA added to the dishes, whereas more than 90% of fl-HA added to the dish was degraded by Hyal-2, according to the calculation based on the fluorescence counts. Furthermore, the intracellular degradation of fl-HA was not up-regulated in the presence of Hyal-2. These observations suggest that HA degradation mediated by Hyal-2 occurs on the surface of the cells and the products were released into the medium, and that the intracellular catabolism by Hyal-1 is independent of the HA degradation on the cell surface mediated by Hyal-2. No significant fl-HA turnover mediated Hyal-3 was detected under our experimental conditions, even though the enzyme was co-expressed with CD44 (Fig. 2, H, P, and X). Hyal-3 does not appear to possess a hyaluronidase activity. Otherwise, at least, additional components other than CD44 might be necessary for Hyal-3 to display its activity. Incorporation of Extracellular Hyal-1 into Cells—Although Hyal-1 is believed to be an acid-active and a lysosomal hyaluronidase, it is well known as a plasma hyaluronidase (15Frost G.I. Csoka T.B. Wong T. Stern R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Our observation as described above also showed that a large amount of expressed Hyal-1 was found to be secreted into the medium although Hyal-1 is functional only in the intracellular space in the presence of CD44 (Fig. 1). It is possible that extracellularly secreted Hyal-1 is incorporated secondarily by cells like other lysosomal enzymes (26Sly W.S. Kaplan A. Achord D.T. Brot F.E. Bell C.E. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1978; 23: 547-551PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, 293, CD44/293, and Hyal-2/CD44/293 cells were incubated with Hyal-1 by adding the conditioned medium of Hyal-1/293 cells. After incubation, cells were treated with trypsin to remove pericellular-associated Hyal-1, and then the presence of Hyal-1 in the intracellular pools was determined by the acid-active hyaluronid"

https://openalex.org/W2109278119,"Fisheries have removed at least 50 million tons of tuna and other top-level predators from the Pacific Ocean pelagic ecosystem since 1950, leading to concerns about a catastrophic reduction in population biomass and the collapse of oceanic food chains. We analyzed all available data from Pacific tuna fisheries for 1950–2004 to provide comprehensive estimates of fishery impacts on population biomass and size structure. Current biomass ranges among species from 36 to 91% of the biomass predicted in the absence of fishing, a level consistent with or higher than standard fisheries management targets. Fish larger than 175 centimeters fork length have decreased from 5% to approximately 1% of the total population. The trophic level of the catch has decreased slightly, but there is no detectable decrease in the trophic level of the population. These results indicate substantial, though not catastrophic, impacts of fisheries on these top-level predators and minor impacts on the ecosystem in the Pacific Ocean."

https://openalex.org/W2122076034,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α is a major cytokine produced by alveolar macrophages in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharide. TNF-α secretion is regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Post-transcriptional regulation occurs by modulation of TNF-α mRNA stability via the binding of tristetraprolin (TTP) to the adenosine/uridine-rich elements found in the 3′-untranslated region of the TNF-α transcript. Phosphorylation plays important roles in modulating mRNA stability, because activation of p38 MAPK by lipopolysaccharide stabilizes TNF-α mRNA.

In these disease states, macrophages are widely recognized as cells that play a central role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory activities. In response to a variety of stimuli, for example LPS, macrophages generate pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, and oxidants. TNF-α is an important alveolar macrophage secretory product, and depletion of alveolar macrophages reduces TNF-α production, thereby neutralizing and attenuating LPS-induced lung inflammation (1Berg J.T. Lee S.T. Thepen T. Lee C.Y. Tsan M.F. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 74: 2812-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding all potential regulatory pathways of TNF-α expression is an important goal. LPS-induced production of TNF-α by monocyte/macrophages is regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Transcriptional activation of TNF-α occurs primarily through the binding of NF-κB to the TNF-α promoter (2Shakhov A.N. Collart M.A. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S.A. Jongeneel C.V. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Post-transcriptional regulation of TNF-α occurs by modulation of its mRNA stability. This mRNA stability is dependent on a class II AU (adenosine/uridine)-rich element (ARE) found in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of many cytokines, growth factors, and inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, MIP-1α (macrophage inflammatory protein-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor, and granulocyte-macrophage metalloproteinase-13 (3Caput D.

Regulation of dephosphorylation of TTP, and its upstream pathway, is incompletely understood. PP2A is a serine-threonine protein phosphatase involved in the regulation of signal transduction, cell growth, and apoptosis (31Yang J. Fan G.H. Wadzinski B.E. Sakurai H. Richmond A. J. Biol.

The core heterodimer of PP2A consists of a 36-kDa catalytic subunit (PP2A-C) and a 65-kDa regulatory subunit (PR65 or PP2A-A). This heterodimer interacts with a variable third subunit (PP2A-B isoforms) that influences cellular substrate specificity (35Lechward K. Awotunde O.S. Swiatek W. Muszynska G. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2001; 48: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The role of PP2A in the cellular response to inflammatory stimuli that causes cytokine expression has been increasingly investigated. In monocytes, inhibition of PP2A resulted in increased JNK activity and subsequent enhanced IL-1β secretion (36Shanley T.P. Vasi N. Denenberg A. Wong H.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the role of PP2A in the regulation of LPS-induced TNF-α production remains unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that PP2A is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of TNF-α. Our data showed that inhibition of PP2A increased TNF-α mRNA stability. This effect was accompanied by increased p38 and MK-2 activity as well as increased phosphorylation of TTP. Interestingly, binding of TTP to 14-3-3 appeared to protect phosphorylated TTP from access by PP2A, thereby preventing its dephosphorylation.

Full-length mouse TNF-α cDNA was amplified from the total RNA of mouse lung using one-step reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen) and inserted into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen) to obtain pcDNA3.1-TNFα-V5His. Control siRNA (D-001210-02) and the PP2A-siRNA (M-040657-00), PP1-siRNA (M-040960-00) targeting the catalytic subunit of mouse PP2A and PP1 were purchased from Dharmacon. PP2A Phosphatase Assay—A non-radioactive, malachite green-based immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) was used to measure PP2A activity. MHS cells were either pretreated with OA or siRNA as described. Total cellular proteins were then extracted in Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with no phosphatase inhibitors. Subunit C (catalytic) of PP2A was immunoprecipitated by anti-PP2A antibody. The precipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with phosphatase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm CaCl2). The pellets were resuspended in assay buffer and incubated with 750 μm phosphopeptide for 15 min at 30 °C. Reactions (25 μl) were then transferred to a microtiter plate and incubated with 100 μl of malachite green reagent. Color was developed for 5 min, and changes in absorbance were measured at 650 nm in a Spectra-MAX 250 (Molecular Devices plate reader). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from subconfluent 6-well plate using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). A total of 10 μg of RNA was resolved by 1% agarose/6% formaldehyde phosphate-buffered gel electrophoresis, blotted onto Nytran membranes using 10 × SSC. Full-length 32P-labeled TNF-α antisense RNA was synthesized in vitro using plasmid pcDNA3.1-TNFα-V5His linearized with XhoI, T7 polymerase and Maxiscript reagents and purified with Megaclear columns (Ambion). The 32P-labeled β-actin probe was synthesized by the same method using the linearized plasmid provided by the Maxiscript kit.

After washing twice at room temperature and twice at 65 °C with 2× SSC/1% SDS, the membranes were apposed to Kodak BioMax MR film and exposed at -80 °C for 3 h. Luciferase Assay—MHS cells were transiently transfected with pMT2-luc-UTR using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, cells were either pretreated with or without 1 μm OA for 1 h, washed once with cell culture medium, and then stimulated with 200 ng/ml LPS. For PP2A-siRNA silencing experiments, 0.3 × 106 cells plated in 12-well plates were first transfected with control siRNA or mouse PP2A-siRNA for 48 h and then cotransfected with pMT2-luc-UTR and siRNA for another 24 h. Cells harvested at different LPS treatment times were lysed in Reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and luciferase activity was measured using a Berthold Autolumat Plus LB 953 system with the protocol of a 2-s measurement delay followed by a 10-s measurement read. p38 MAPK and MAPKAPK2 Kinase Assay—4 × 106 MHS cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 500 μg of cell lysates was incubated with 20 μl of immobilized phospho-p38 antibody overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with 1× kinase buffer and then incubated with 8 μg of recombinant ATF-2 (Cell Signaling) in 40 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 200 μm ATP, and 8 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was then boiled in an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed at -80 °C for 5 h. MK-2 kinase assay was performed using a non-radioactive immunoprecipitation kinase assay kit from Upstate. Briefly, 1 mg of cell lysates was incubated with 10 μl of anti-MK-2-agarose conjugate at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Immunoprecipitated MK-2 was then incubated with 0.5 μg of recombinant Hsp27 in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 100 μm ATP for 45 min at 30 °C. One-fifth of the sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the phospho-Hsp27 antibody and a secondary antibody for enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Gel Shift—Gel-shift analysis was performed as described previously (30Stoecklin G. Stubbs T. Kedersha N. Wax S. Rigby W.F. Blackwell T.K. Anderson P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). ARE-RNA (32P-labeled) was synthesized in vitro using the same method as described in Northern blot analysis. 1 × 108 MHS cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). 10 μg of cell lysate was incubated with 5 × 105 cpm of ARE-RNA in 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol) at room temperature for 15 min. RNase T1 (Ambion) was then added at a concentration of 10 units/μl, and the reaction was incubated for another 15 min. Prior to non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the following antibodies were added for 15 min: 4 μg of goat anti-TTP (sc-8458, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1 μg of rabbit anti-14-3-3 (sc-629, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Gels were then fixed in 12% MetOH/10% acetic acid, dried for 1 h at 60 °C, and exposed to x-ray film at -80 °C for 3–5 h. RNA Immunoprecipitation—COS7 cells were transfected with pTet-Off, pTet-7B-ARE (TNF), and either pcDNA3 vector, pcDNA3-TTP-wt-MycHis, pcDNA3-TTP-m1,2-MycHis, or pcDNA3-TTP-AA-MycHis. After 24 h, cytoplasmic lysates were prepared in 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm NaF, 20 nm OA, 1 mg/ml heparin, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). RNA was extracted from the cytoplasmic lysate using RNAqueous (Ambion). MycHis-tagged TTP was immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc (9E10) antibody and protein A/G beads (Ultralink, Pierce). After eight washes with lysis buffer, RNA was isolated from the immunoprecipitated material by phenol/chloroform extraction and analyzed by Northern blot analysis as described earlier (30Stoecklin G.

HEK293 Cell Transfection and Immunoprecipitation Assays— HEK293 cells in 35-mm dishes (0.5 × 106 cells/dish) were transfected with MycHis-tagged TTP constructs using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 600 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed by incubating cell lysates with Myc-probe-agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed twice in lysis buffer before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis. siRNA Transfection—COS7 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 100 nm of either a control siRNA duplex (D0) or an siRNA duplex targeting MK-2 (M2). The sequences (sense strand) were: D0, 5′-GCAUUCACUUGGAUAGUAA-3′; M2, 5′-UCACCGAGUUUAUGAACCA-3′ (from Ambion). After 48 h, cells were re-seeded and transfected again with the same siRNA duplexes together with either pcDNA3 (vector) or pcDNA3-TTP-wt-MycHis. Cells were cultured for an additional 48 h in serum-free medium. Where indicated, cells were treated for 30 min with 10 μg/ml anisomycin (Sigma) prior to lysis in SDS-sample buffer. HEK293 cells were transfected with control siRNA or human PP2A-siRNA using the same method as COS7 cell transfection. Control siRNA (D-001210-02) and PP2A-siRNA (L-003598-00), targeting the catalytic subunit of human PP2A, were purchased from Dharmacon. PP2A Inhibition by OA or siRNA Increased LPS-induced TNF-α Secretion in MHS Cells—To investigate the role of PP2A in regulating LPS-induced TNF-α secretion from alveolar macrophages OA was used to examine the effect of phosphatase inhibition on TNF-α production. MHS cells representative of mouse alveolar macrophages were treated with varying concentrations of OA. The catalytic unit of PP2A was immunoprecipitated from MHS cell lysates and subjected to an in vitro phosphatase assay. OA inhibited PP2A specific activity in a dose-dependent manner with nearly 90% inhibition of phosphatase activity achieved at 1 μm OA (Fig. 1A). As a result, subsequent studies used a standard protocol of 1-h pretreatment with 1 μm OA followed by culture medium change prior to LPS stimulation. This OA dose achieved PP2A inhibition with only modest affects on PP1-specific activity (data not shown). MHS cells were pretreated with OA and then stimulated with 200 or 500 ng/ml LPS for 2, 4, and 6 h. OA treatment significantly augmented TNF-α secretion. At 2- and 4-h time points (Fig. 1B), the amount of TNF-α secreted into culture supernatants approximately doubled in the OA-treated group. By 6 h of stimulation, the augmentation of TNF-α produced in the presence of OA was less but remained significant (Fig. 1B). Although stimulation with 500 ng/ml LPS increased the absolute value of TNF-α, the relative amount of OA-mediated augmentation, while significant, was not further enhanced. Therefore, 200 ng/ml LPS were used in all subsequent experiments. Moreover, OA treatment alone did not change the basal level of TNF-α secretion, so that the enhancing effects were only observed following LPS stimulation. To demonstrate that the augmented TNF-α secretion by OA was specifically attributable to PP2A inhibition instead of PP1, silencing of PP2A and PP1 was achieved by transfecting MHS cells with either PP2A- or PP1-siRNA (Fig. 2). Western blot showed that the endogenous expression of PP2A and PP1 in MHS cells were both reduced by siRNA transfection (Fig. 2A). Similar to OA treatment, PP2A-siRNA silencing significantly increased TNF-α secretion after LPS stimulation (Fig. 2B). Compared with control siRNA-transfected cells, the amount of secreted TNF-α was nearly doubled in the PP2A-silencing group at all time points (Fig. 2B). Of note, no increase in TNF-α secretion was observed following PP1 silencing at any time (Fig. 2B). As expected on the basis of transfecting less confluent cell cultures with siRNA, the overall level of TNF-α secretion was slightly less with control siRNA transfection (Fig. 2B) as compared with non-transfected cells (see Fig. 1). Thus, attributing the OA-induced augmentation of TNF-α secretion to PP2A inhibition was corroborated by PP2A-siRNA silencing experiments. When feasible, siRNA was used as a complimentary strategy to confirm results from OA treatment studies. Because recent studies suggested that PP2A positively regulated I kappa kinase (IκK) and subsequently activated the NF-κB pathway (40Kray A.E. Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Gomez R.J. Sanders L.E.

Chem. 2005; 280: 35974-35982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we surmised the effect of OA was largely independent of transcription. Instead we hypothesized that post-transcriptional regulation was being affected. PP2A Inhibition Prevents Decay of TNF-α mRNA—Post-transcriptional regulation of TNF-α involves the mRNA stability of its transcript. To examine the role of PP2A in the regulation of the TNF-α mRNA stability, MHS cells pretreated with or without OA were stimulated with LPS for 2 h and then treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D to block further transcription. Total RNA was extracted at the indicated time intervals. Northern blot analysis revealed that the decay of TNF-α mRNA was significantly prevented by OA pretreatment (Fig. 3). This re"

The view is emerging that deregulation of translation contributes importantly to cancer development, a role not generally appreciated before. Eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3 contains at least thirteen non-identical subunits, named from eIF3a to eIF3m, and plays an essential role in the rate-limiting initiation phase of translation. Increased mRNA and protein levels of the eIF3a, -3b, -3c, -3h, and -3i subunits have been detected in a wide variety of human tumors and are frequently identified as prognostic biomarkers for poor clinical outcome. However, it remains to be established whether up-regulation of eIF3 subunits is a consequence or a cause of the malignant phenotypes. Here we report that ectopic expression of eIF3a, -3b, -3c, -3h, or -3i in stably transfected NIH3T3 cells leads to a number of oncogenic properties: decreased doubling times, increased clonogenicity and viability, facilitated S-phase entry, attenuation of apoptosis, formation of transformed foci, and anchorage-independent growth. Only overexpression of the transforming subunits results in a stimulation of initiation and global protein synthesis rates and enhanced translation of poorly translated mRNAs that encode growth-regulating proteins, including cyclinD1, c-Myc, fibroblast growth factor-2, and ornithine decarboxylase, which may be responsible for oncogenic malignancy in the transformed cell lines. Based on these results, we hypothesize that eIF3 contributes to hyperactivation of the translation initiation machinery and thereby may play an important role in neoplasia. Cancer cells appear to require an aberrantly activated translational state to survive, suggesting that the initiation factors may be promising therapeutic targets for treating cancer.

Malignant transformation also follows the expression of a dominant negative mutant form of protein kinase R (9Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), a protein kinase that phosphorylates the α-subunit of eIF2 and inhibits protein synthesis by reducing the binding of the initiator methionyl-tRNA (8Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. 2000: 33-88Google Scholar). Malignancy caused by reducing eIF2 inhibition also occurs by overexpression of a mutant form of eIF2 that cannot be phosphorylated by protein kinase R (10Donze O. Jagus R. Koromilas A.E. Hershey J.W.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4382-4386PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have led to the hypothesis that failure to down-regulate protein synthesis results in a malignant phenotype. Mechanisms leading to the regulation of protein synthesis most frequently affect the initiation phase of translation. Initiation involves the binding of initiator methionyl-tRNA and mRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, followed by junction with the 60 S subunit to form an 80 S initiation complex competent to enter the elongation phase of protein synthesis (8Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. 2000: 33-88Google Scholar). The initiation pathway is promoted by at least 12 proteins called initiation factors (eIFs) that transiently interact with the components of protein synthesis.

In contrast, decreased expression of eIF3e/Int6 mRNA, frequently associated with loss of heterozygosity at the int6 locus, is seen in human breast and lung carcinomas (34Miyazaki S. Imatani A.

The correlation of abnormal eIF3 subunit levels and cancer suggests that eIF3 regulation also may be important in determining the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis. We hypothesize that overexpression of some eIF3 subunits will induce oncogenic transformation of immortal NIH3T3 cells. To test the hypothesis, we constructed an Flp-In-3T3 expression system to express individually each of twelve eIF3 subunits (all but eIF3m) from the same chromosomal site in the host cell. We find that the individual overexpression of subunit a, b, c, h, or i of eIF3 results in a malignant phenotype. This unexpected result suggests (but does not prove) that eIF3 may play a causal role in neoplasia, consistent with misregulation of translation being a contributory factor to cancer pathology. eIF3 subunit overexpression not only results in a modest increase in the global rate of protein synthesis but also selectively enhances translation of several malignancy-associated mRNAs, which may be responsible for the oncogenic properties of the transformed cells. Cell Lines and Plasmid Constructs—cDNAs encoding full-length eIF3 subunits were altered to provide a unique NdeI site at the initiator AUG: eIF3a (D50929), eIF3b (U78525), eIF3c (U46025), eIF3d (U54558), eIF3e (U54562), eIF3f (U94855), eIF3g (U96074), eIF3h (U54559), eIF3i (U39067), eIF3j (U97670), eIF3k (NM013234) and eIF3l (BC029265); eIF3m was not yet identified when this work began, so it was not incorporated into the study. Each cDNA was inserted into the NdeIXhoI sites of pAMV-pA-HA (37Fraser C.S. Lee J.Y. Mayeur G.L. Bushell M. Doudna J.A. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8946-8956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which was engineered to include a hemagglutinin (HA) tag downstream of a HindIII site followed by an in-frame ATG within the NdeI site. The resulting HA-tagged sequences were moved into pcDNA5/FRT to build pcDNA5/eIF3x expression vectors (Invitrogen), and the correctness of constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. NIH3T3 cells from the American Type Culture Collection were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All cell culture materials were obtained from Mediatech Inc. We constructed the twelve Flp-In-3T3-eIF3x expression cells and Flp-In-3T3-pcDNA5 control cells following the manufacturer’s instructions (Flp-In system, Invitrogen). Protein Extraction, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Cells (1 × 107) were lysed in NIH3T3 cell lysis buffer (ProSci Inc., Poway, CA). Immunoprecipitates were prepared by incubating the lysates either with anti-HA-agarose resin (Sigma) or with monoclonal anti-eIF3a (gift of J. T. Parsons, University of Virginia) and Dynabeads protein-A (Dynal Biotech). The following primary antibodies were used in immunoblotting: monoclonal anti-HA and anti-β-actin (Sigma); polyclonal anti-eIF2α and monoclonal anti-phospho-eIF2α (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); polyclonal anti-eIF3 (38Brown-Luedi M.L.

Fraser, UC Berkeley); polyclonal anti-eIF3b, anti-eIF3e, anti-eIF3f, and anti-eIF3h (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and polyclonal anti-PARP (Cell Signaling Technology). The blots were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma), developed in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphatenitro blue tetrazolium solution (Sigma), scanned with a photoscanner, and analyzed with AlphaEaseFC Image software. Analysis of Specific mRNAs in Polysome Fractions—3T3-eIF3x cells were lysed and subjected to centrifugation on 10-30% sucrose gradients containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 90 min, scanned at A254 and collected into nine fractions. Escherichia coli rRNA (1 μg, Roche Applied Science) was added to each fraction, and total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and adjusted to the same volume. An identical volume of each RNA fraction was used to make cDNA with the SuperScript III cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Specific TaqMan primers and probes for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, cyclinD1, c-Myc, fibroblast growth factor 2, and ornithine decarboxylase (Applied Biosystems) were used for real-time PCR in 25-μl triplicates with 2× Taq-Man master mix (Applied Biosystems). Amplification was monitored by using the ABI-7300 detection system. The E. coli rRNA alone did not generate any background signal. Relative mRNA levels were quantified by calculating ΔCt, and the value for each gradient fraction is reported as the percent of the total amount in all nine fractions. Statistical Analyses—Statistical significance of the data presented as the mean ± S.E. was analyzed by Student’s t test. A p value below 0.05 was considered to be significant. Overexpression of Twelve eIF3 Subunits in a Flp-In-3T3-eIF3x Expression System—To determine whether or not overexpression of individual eIF3 subunits leads to cellular transformation, we constructed twelve Flp-In-3T3-eIF3x expression cell lines (for subunits a-l) and one Flp-in-3T3-pcDNA5 control cell line (v) (supplemental Fig. S1) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, we stably transfected pFRT/lacZeo into early-passage immortal NIH3T3 fibroblast cells to generate cells containing an integrated Flp-recombination target. A cell clone that expresses β-galactosidase at a high level was chosen as the Flp-In-3T3 host cell line. Subsequently, we cotransfected the host cells with a pcDNA5/eIF3x expression vector containing an HA-tagged eIF3x cassette and pOG44. The Flprecombinase expressed from pOG44 catalyzes a site-specific homologous recombination between the Flp-recombination target sites in the host cell genome and in the pcDNA5/eIF3x vector. Therefore, each of the eIF3 subunit cDNAs is integrated into the same locus in the chromosome, allowing comparative analysis of the effects of their expression. To demonstrate that the expression constructs produce the predicted protein products, we treated each cell lysate with anti-HA-agarose and analyzed the HA-eIF3x immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with anti-HA. A single major band was detected in each eIF3x immunoprecipitate, whereas 3T3-pcDNA5 cells exhibited no anti-HA band (Fig. 1A). For each subunit, the apparent molecular weight as determined by migration in SDS-polyacrylamide gels was identical to that of the corresponding subunit derived from eIF3 purified from HeLa cells (data not shown), indicating that full-length subunits are being produced. The extent of subunit overexpression relative to endogenous eIF3 levels was calculated from anti-HA immunoblots of eIF3x lysates (Fig. 1, B (lower panel) and C) as described in the figure legend. The b, c, f, g, j, and k subunits accumulate to ∼4-fold or greater above the endogenous eIF3 level, the d, e, h, and l subunits are 2.5- to 3.0-fold higher, whereas eIF3i is only ∼1.5-fold higher (Fig. 1B, top panel). The immunoblot signal for HA-eIF3a is too weak to be detected, although a low level is seen when the cell immunoprecipitate is examined (Fig. 1A). The different levels of accumulation of the HA-eIF3x proteins are likely due to variable degradation or insolubility, especially because each overexpressed subunit likely exists in large part as a free protein outside the eIF3 complex. Similar instability/insolubility is seen when eIF3a is expressed in recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells (37Fraser C.S. Lee J.Y. Mayeur G.L. Bushell M. Doudna J.A. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8946-8956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or when eIF3i is overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells (27Joseph P. Lei Y.X. Whong W.Z. Ong T.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 703-707PubMed Google Scholar, 28Joseph P. Lei Y.X. Ong T.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2004; 255: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ectopic Expression of eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3h, or eIF3i Stimulates Cell Growth and Induces Neoplastic Transformation—The growth characteristics of the twelve eIF3x cell lines were compared with those of the control 3T3-pcDNA5 cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, the growth curves can be grouped into three categories: the fast growing cells (a, b, c, h, and i) have doubling times of 19.2-21.8 h; normal growing cells (d, g, j, k, and l) have doubling times of 23.1-25.3 h comparable to 26.4 h for the control 3T3-pcDNA5 cells; and slow growing cells (e and f) have doubling times of 31.0-31.8 h. Although 3T3-pcDNA5 cells become confluent on day 5 after plating, saturation densities (the plateau values shown in Fig. 2A) of the fast growing cells are 1.7- to 1.9-fold greater than those of the normal growing cells, whereas those of the slow growing cells are 1.5-fold lower. Thus, the fast growing cells grow faster in exponential phase and reach higher saturation densities. The fast growing cells also exhibit superior colony-forming ability when plated at very low density. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2, the colony density of cells expressing the a, b, c, h, or i subunit is much greater than the control cells, whose colonies resemble those from cells expressing the g or j subunits. The d, k, and l subunits display slightly greater clonogenicity than the control cells but not nearly as great as the a, b, c, h, and i group. The slow growing cells expressing the e or f subunits show even lower colony densities. Colony densities were quantitated and are reported in Fig. 2B. A second method to assess cell proliferation is to use the MTT assay to measure the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity indicative of metabolically active cells. The MTT assay results are plotted in Fig. 2B and closely resemble those from the colony formation assay. Lastly, cell proliferation rates in the eIF3x cell lines were assessed by determining the percentage of cells residing in the S-phase and undergoing dynamic DNA synthesis (bromodeoxyuridine-positive) by using flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. S3). We found a larger proportion (49-56%) of the fast growing cells to be bromodeoxyuridine-positive and reside in S-phase, compared with 36-42% of the normal growing cells and 33-34% of the slow growing cells (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the fast growing cells expressing the a, b, c, h, or i subunit proliferate faster, are more active metabolically, and form denser colonies than normal cells. These data also suggest that these cells may have been malignantly transformed. Loss of contact inhibition and loss of anchorage-dependent growth are hallmarks of malignant cells and are considered to be two of the general phenotypes of an oncogene. We assayed foci formation using the fifth passage of pooled clones from eIF3x cells. The fast growing cells (columns a, b, c, h, and i) give rise to foci 2-3 weeks after inoculation (Fig. 3A, row 1), whereas no foci are observed at 3 weeks for the control 3T3-pcDNA5 cells (column v) nor for the normal and slow growing cells (results not shown). The number of foci in the fast growing cells is ∼20-fold higher when tested at passage 10, indicating the selective advantage of transformed cells (Fig. 3A, row 2). Microscopic examination of the foci reveals multilayered growth and a disoriented morphology (Fig. 3A, row 3). The malignant transformants are highly refractile, have spindle-like projections, and displayed reduced contact inhibition, resulting in a piling up of cells (Fig. 3A, row 4) with a 2- to 2.5-fold increase in saturation density as compared with the vector control. In contrast, 3T3-pcDNA5 control cells grow in a monolayer, show contact inhibition and morphologically resemble normal fibroblast cells (Fig. 3A, vector (v) column). All of the fast growing cells show the anchorage-independent phenotype and grow in 0.3% agar (Fig. 3A, row 5), whereas the other cell lines do not (column v and results not shown). The colony formation efficiency of the fast growing cells is 40- to 50-fold higher than the normal and slow growing cells, as quantitated in Fig. 3B. Immunoblot analysis of protein extracts derived from the soft agar colonies of the fast growing cells reveal high levels of the corresponding eIF3 subunits (supplemental Fig. S4), confirming that the colonies comprise overproducing cells. The results from both the foci and soft agar assays demonstrate that overexpression of either the a, b, c, h, or i subunits of eIF3 is associated with malignant transformation of cultured immortal cells. Transformed Cell Lines Resist Apoptosis and Show a Reduced Growth Factor Requirement—Programmed cell death (apoptosis) also is closely affiliated with the rate of protein synthesis, and many cancerous cells are resistant to induction of apoptosis. To assess this characteristic in the cell lines that overexpress eIF3x, we treated cells with camptothecin to induce apoptosis. Apoptosis was measured by annexin-V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) double staining. Annexin-V is a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding protein and has a high affinity for membrane phosphatidylserine, which is exposed to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane during apoptosis. Thus, viable cells are annexin-V-FITC- and PI-negative, early apoptotic cells are annexin-V-FITC-positive and PI-negative, and late apoptotic and dead cells are double stained. The normal growing cells (d, g, j, k, l, and v) and slow growing cells (e and f) display dynamic migration to the apoptotic window at 8 h after induction, whereas the transformed cells (a, b, c, h, and i) show strong resistance (Fig. 4A). The transformed cells exhibit ∼6- to 7-fold fewer apoptotic cells than the normal and slow growing cells (Fig. 4B). A second method to assess caspase-3-mediated apoptosis is to measure proteolytic cleavage of the 116-kDa poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) to an 85-kDa digestion fragment. The 85-kDa PARP cleavage product is detected in all of the normal and slow growing cells at 8 h after induction, whereas the transformed cells did not show appreciable proteolysis of PARP at the same time point (Fig. 4C). Morphological changes also were examined under the light microscope at 4, 8, and 12 h after induction (Fig. 4D, row LM). At 4 h, the control cells (v) begin to shrink and undergo chromatin aggregation to form cap-like regions under the nuclear membrane; at 8 h, they show cytoplasmic blebs characteristic of apoptotic cells; and at 12 h, most cells are rounded or fragmented into smaller bodies. However, the resistant cells (eIF3h) are able to maintain normal NIH3T3 morphology at 12 h after induction. 4′, 6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and fluorescence microscope inspection show chromatin condensation in sensitive control cells, and distributed chromosome in the resistant eIF3h cells at the various times (Fig. 4D, row FM). To assess the growth dependence on serum of the cell lines overproducing eIF3x, cells were grown in medium containing 0.1% serum to induce apoptosis. Under conditions of serum depletion, the normal and slow growing cells rapidly undergo growth arrest, but the transformed cells (a, b, c, h, and i) continue to proliferate (Fig. 4E). Morphological changes indicative of apoptosis were observed in the normal and slow growing cells after 48 h (data not shown). We conclude that the malignantly transformed cells have a reduced requirement for serum growth factors and resist entry into apoptosis. How Do the Five Overexpressed eIF3 Subunits Cause Malignant Transformation?—The finding that overexpression of any of 5 of the 12 eIF3 subunits of eIF3 results in transformation is surprising and suggests that regulation of protein synthesis through eIF3 is critical for growth control. To better understand how such regulation occurs, we first asked whether or not each of the overexpressed HA-tagged subunits is incorporated into the endogenous eIF3 complex. 3T3-eIF3x cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA resin, followed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting analysis of the precipitated proteins"

Similarly, the Stardust samples contain abundant amorphous silicates in addition to crystalline silicates such as olivine and pyroxene. The presence of crystalline silicates in Wild 2 is consistent with mixing of solar system and interstellar matter. No hydrous silicates or carbonate minerals were detected, which suggests a lack of aqueous processing of Wild 2 dust."

However, it is not clear how subthreshold stimuli are processed in the brain. We found that a task-irrelevant subthreshold coherent motion led to a stronger disturbance in task performance than did suprathreshold motion. With the subthreshold motion, activity in the visual cortex measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging was higher, but activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex was lower, than with suprathreshold motion. These results suggest that subthreshold irrelevant signals are not subject to effective inhibitory control."

The plume itself, which has a discharge rate comparable to Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National Park, probably represents small leaks from this massive advective system."

Macosko J. Cai S. Amzel M. Ross C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41032-41037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The pathogenic length of the polyQ stretch within the N-terminal segment of htt is ∼38Q or greater, and correlates with its ability to form detergent-insoluble fibrillar aggregates (4Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E. Wanker E.E. Mangiarini L. Bates G.P.

N-terminal fragments containing the pathogenic polyQ stretch have been detected in inclusions in HD brain tissue, and their generation is considered to be a critical step in both fibril formation and toxicity (4Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E. Wanker E.E. Mangiarini L. Bates G.P.

Cell. 2002; 10: 259-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulations of polyQ fragments suggest that the core structure of a htt fibril is composed of peptides arranged in a triangular β-helical structure (8Stork M. Giese A. Kretzschmar H.A. Tavan P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 2442-2451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Such fibrillar structures would grow by the attachment of further coils at the top and bottom ends of the β-helix. Although inclusion bodies are closely associated with neurodegenerative disease, there has been considerable debate about the role of aggregates in pathogenesis. Increasing evidence suggests that inclusion bodies, and the fibrillar aggregates therein, may not represent the primary neurotoxic agent (1Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 9Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J.

Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). Instead, soluble intermediates in the aggregation pathway are likely to be the key toxic species, giving rise to neurodegeneration through various mechanisms including inactivation of essential transcription factors and inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system (12Schaffar G. Breuer P. Boteva R. Behrends C. Tzvetkov N. Strippel N. Sakahira H. Siegers K. Hayer-Hartl M. Hartl F.U. Mol.

Much attention has therefore been focused on identifying means to disrupt or alter the polyQ aggregation pathway (14Di Prospero N.A. Fischbeck K.H. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 756-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and several compounds with anti-aggregation activity have been identified in vitro and in cell-based assays (15Heiser V. Engemann S. Brocker W. Dunkel I. Boeddrich A. Waelter S. Nordhoff E. Lurz R. Schugardt N. Rautenberg S. Herhaus C. Barnickel G. Bottcher H. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We set out to develop a zebrafish HD model system suitable for whole organism validation of candidate compounds identified as aggregation inhibitors in vitro. The zebrafish has several key advantages over other in vivo models of HD. It is a vertebrate organism and contains homologues to many human genes, including the htt gene (17Karlovich C.A. John R.M. Ramirez L. Stainier D.Y. Myers R.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 217: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), making it a valuable tool to model human diseases such as HD. Additional important advantages include: the ease and cost efficiency with which in vivo drug tests can be performed; the transparency of zebrafish embryos allowing for visualization of morphological and physiological features in the live embryo; and the aqueous environment of the zebrafish, which facilitates drug administration (18Zon L.I. Peterson R.T. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Importantly, the zebrafish model system allows for the evaluation of drug effectiveness in a whole organism, taking into account the stability and cellular targeting of the tested compound, as well as the assessment of potential side effects of the drug at active concentrations. Here, we describe the characterization of a newly established zebrafish model of HD. Mutant htt expressed in zebrafish embryos accumulated in large SDS-insoluble inclusions, recapitulating a cardinal feature of HD pathology. Mutant htt also increased the frequency of embryos with abnormal morphology and dead embryos, as well as the occurrence of apoptosis. As in nonvertebrate polyQ disease models, the molecular chaperones, Hsp40 and Hsp70, suppressed both polyQ aggregation and toxicity. Using this zebrafish model, two anti-prion compounds of the N′-benzylidene-benzohydrazide class were identified as novel inhibitors of polyQ aggregation, suggesting that polyQ aggregates and prions may share common structural epitopes. We also address, for the first time in a vertebrate model system, the controversial question of whether inclusion bodies of polyQ-expanded htt directly contribute to toxicity. Our observation that the majority of apoptotic cells were devoid of visible inclusions suggests that polyQ toxicity is not primarily caused by insoluble aggregates but is more likely caused by soluble aggregation intermediates. Animal Husbandry—All of the experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines of the German Council on Animal Care. The zebrafish were maintained, mated, and raised as described (19Mullins M.C. Hammerschmidt M. Haffter P. Nusslein-Volhard C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 189-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The embryos were kept at 28 °C and staged as described (20Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8862) Google Scholar). The wild type line AB was used for all experiments. Constructs and Embryo Injection—pCS2+Q25GFP and pCS2+Q102GFP were generated by subcloning the inserts from pYES2-htt(25 or 102Q)-GFP (21Meriin A.B. Zhang X. He X. Newnam G.P. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) into the AflII and XbaI sites of the pCS2+-AflII vector. PCR mutagenesis of pCS2+Q25GFP was used to generate a Q4GFP fragment, which was cloned into NdeI and BstAPI cut pCS2+Q25GFP backbone. To generate pCS2+Hsp70-YFP, an Hsp70-YFP fragment derived from pEYFP-N1-Hsp70 (22Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) was cloned into EcoRI, XbaI cut pCS2+. The construct used for transcription of human Hdj1 (Hsp40) was a kind gift from A. Haacke; the β-galactoside construct was purchased from Invitrogen. In vitro transcription of all of these constructs was performed with the MessageMachine Kit (Ambion, TX), and the resulting mRNA was injected at a concentration of 1 μg/μl into the yolk of embryos at the first or second cell stage. Co-injections were performed with 1 μg/μl polyQ-GFP mRNA and either 1 μg/μl β-Gal mRNA as a control or 0.5 μg/μl Hdj1 and 0.5 μg/μl Hsp70-YFP mRNA. The embryos were cultured at 28.5 °C in E3 (5 mm NaCl, 0.17 mm KCl, 0.33 mm CaCl2 0.33 mm MgSO4, and 0.1% methylene blue), the unfertilized eggs were removed, and the embryos were scored 24 h post-fertilization according to their appearance. Microscopy—Injected zebrafish embryos were dechorionated, anesthetized with Tricaine (0.016% w/v), and orientated in 3% methyl cellulose on coverslips. Fluorescence was visualized with an LSM510 META inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The images were captured digitally with a Zeiss MRM AxioCam camera and assembled in Photoshop 8.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). For nuclear staining, the embryos were immersed in 1:1000 dilution of TOPRO-3 stain (monomeric cyanine nucleic acid stain; Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature and washed three times with E3. To assess apoptotic cell death, the embryos were additionally immersed in 3 μg/ml acridine orange (acridinium chloride hemi[zinc chloride]; Molecular Probes) for 15 min and washed three times with E3. For three-dimensional imaging, a stack of 10 frames was collected at intervals of 10-24 μm between adjacent slices, and the images were assembled to obtain a three-dimensional projection. To dissociate the GFP/acridine orange or GFP/YFP fluorescence signals, analysis was performed by emission fingerprinting in confocal lambda mode. A stack of two or three frames of the embryonic tail region 24 h post-fertilization was collected at intervals of 20 μm, and the number of acridine orange-stained cells was counted to estimate the amount of apoptotic cells. For the time lapse analysis of the living cells, zebrafish embryos 24 h post-fertilization were orientated in 1.2% low melting agarose (1.2% in E3 with Tricaine 0.09% w/v) and covered with E3. Images taken 24, 28, and 32 h post-fertilization were corrected for photobleaching effects, which reduced the signal ∼22.4% over the course of the experiment. Cell Fractionation, Western Blot Analysis, and the Filter Trap Assay—Injected embryos were resuspended in cold lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) in phosphate-buffered saline) and lysed by passing through a 0.6-mm needle. After freezing and thawing the extracts, benzonase was added (75 units), and the extracts were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation. The extracts were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C in the presence of glass beads to facilitate separation of the chorion debris. The supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). For the detection of Hsp70-YFP (and Q102-GFP in Fig. 4b), the embryos were first dechorionated, and yolk was dissected, as previously described (23Evans T.G. Yamamoto Y. Jeffery W.R. Krone P.H. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2005; 10: 66-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For subcellular fractionation, the extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to obtain the supernatant and pellet fractions. The pellet was washed once with lysis buffer, centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min, and either dissolved in SDS sample buffer or 100% formic acid. The latter was incubated for 3 h at 37°C with agitation, vacuum-dried, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer, as previously reported (24Hazeki N. Tukamoto T. Goto J. Kanazawa I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The fractions were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (anti-GFP, anti-Hsp40, or anti-β-galactosidase), according to the standard procedure. For the filter trap assay, an equal volume of 4% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol was added to embryo extracts, and the mixture was heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Several dilutions of between 25 and 1000 μg were filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane (pore size, 0.2 μm), according to protocol (6Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Aggregates retained on the filter were detected with an anti-GFP antibody. In all cases, the extracts were analyzed in parallel via SDS-PAGE and Western analysis to ensure equal expression levels among all conditions. For quantitating the results of Western blotting or the filter trap assay, an LAS-3000 imager (Fujifilm Image Reader) was used. Chemical Treatments—Chemicals from the DIVERSet library (313B02, 293G02, and 306H03) were obtained from ChemBridge Corporation (San Diego, CA). Isoproterenol hydrochloride was dissolved in H2O, and the other compounds were dissolved in Me2SO, at the indicated concentrations. After the injection, the embryos were randomly split into two groups; one group was transferred into E3 supplemented with 1% Me2SO and the indicated concentration of compound, and the other group was transferred into E3 supplemented with 1% Me2SO as a control. The chorion was carefully disrupted using fine forceps to facilitate penetration of the compound through the chorion, and unfertilized eggs were removed several hours post-fertilization. The embryos were cultured at 28.5 °C for 24 h post-fertilization, and extracts were prepared and analyzed as described above. The filter trap assay signal associated with extracts derived from Me2SO- or H2O-treated embryos was set to 100%. In Vitro Aggregation Reactions—In vitro aggregation reactions were performed essentially as described (12Schaffar G. Breuer P. Boteva R. Behrends C. Tzvetkov N. Strippel N. Sakahira H. Siegers K. Hayer-Hartl M. Hartl F.U. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified glutathione S-transferase-htt exon 1 fusions (3 μm) were mixed with 3 or 30 μm Congo red, 313B02 (3Poirier M.A. Li H. Macosko J. Cai S. Amzel M. Ross C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41032-41037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), 293G02 (4Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E.

Vonsattel J.P. Aronin N. Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar), or Me2SO. To initiate the aggregation reaction, 2.5 units of PreScission Protease in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mm KCl) was added. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 8 h and then stopped by adding an equal volume of 4% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol. The amount of SDS-insoluble aggregates per reaction was analyzed using the filter trap assay (anti-HA), as described above. Statistical Analyses—The data were compared using Bonferroni's post hoc test and one-way analysis of variance (α-level was set to 0.05), as indicated. Docking of Compounds to a Triangular PolyQ Dimer—Using the program AutoDock Version 3.0 (25Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9301) Google Scholar), we simulated the docking of models for the examined compounds (293G02, 306H03, 313B02, isoproterenol, mycophenolic acid, PGL-135, and Congo red) to a specific β-helical model for a polyQ proto-fibril. The structural model of a polyQ protofibril was adopted from the work of Stork et al. (8Stork M. Giese A. Kretzschmar H.A. Tavan P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 2442-2451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), who had suggested a left-handed triangular β-helix as the secondary structure motif for polyQ amyloid fibers. More specifically, a dimer of two β-helical polyQ peptides, each covering 36 residues, was selected. Five structural snapshots of the dimer solvated in water were taken at a temporal distance of 50 ps from the molecular dynamics trajectory, which served for equilibration of the modeled dimer structure with its aqueous environment at room temperature and ambient pressure in the quoted paper. The polyQ dimer snapshots were prepared for the AutoDock simulations using respective AutoDockTools, which assigned partial charges and solvation parameters to the atoms of the receptor peptides. Structural models for the ligand molecules were generated, and partial charges were assigned using the quantum chemistry program MNDO (26Dewar M.J.S. Thiel W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 4899-4907Crossref Scopus (6024) Google Scholar). Rotatable bonds within the ligands were defined through AutoDockTools. AutoDock applies an inter-polation scheme to evaluate the energy of a ligand in the vicinity of a receptor using grid maps that are precalculated over the receptor for each atom type in the ligand. We calculated the grid maps with 127 × 127 × 127 points and a grid spacing of 0.375 Å centered at the polyQ dimers using the AutoGrid tool within AutoDockTools. For each of the five polyQ dimer snapshots, we simulated the docking of the seven compounds using the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm available in AutoDock. For each receptor-ligand pair, 100 separate dockings were performed and sorted by ascending free energy. The 20 docking structures of lowest free energy were visualized for each ligand using the software VMD (27Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39882) Google Scholar). PolyQ-expanded htt Is Deposited into Inclusions of SDS-insoluble Aggregates in Danio rerio—We first evaluated whether we could reproduce key features of HD in zebrafish. Embryos at the first or second cell stage were injected with mRNA encoding an N-terminal fragment of htt containing 4, 25, or 102 Q fused to green fluorescent protein (Q4-GFP, Q25-GFP, and Q102-GFP, respectively). Q4-GFP and Q25-GFP fusion proteins were diffusely distributed, whereas the mutant polyQ-expanded htt fusion protein, Q102-GFP, accumulated in inclusion body-like aggregates throughout most embryos after 24 h (Fig. 1A). Higher magnification images of the hatching gland indicated that Q102-GFP, but not the shorter polyQ variants, accumulated in large, cytoplasmic inclusions adjacent to the nuclei (Fig. 1, B and C). Analysis of embryos at later time points using time lapse microscopy showed that Q102-GFP inclusions grew in size by efficient incorporation of soluble Q102-GFP, resulting in its depletion from the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D and supplemental Video S1). When total cellular extracts of injected embryos 24 h post-fertilization were subjected to high speed centrifugation, both Q4- and Q25-GFP remained exclusively in the soluble supernatant fraction, whereas a significant portion of Q102-GFP was found in the SDS-insoluble pellet fraction and could only be dissolved by formic acid treatment (Fig. 2A) (24Hazeki N. Tukamoto T. Goto J. Kanazawa I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Analysis of total embryo extracts by an established filter trap assay (6Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E.

A, analysis of the solubility of the polyQ-GFP fusions.

The embryos were scored as visibly normal, abnormal, or dead. Q102-GFP expression was associated with increased numbers of dead or morphologically abnormal embryos when compared with Q4- or Q25-GFP expression (Fig. 3A). Acridine orange staining of embryos indicated that Q102-GFP expression caused increased apoptosis (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S1). Low levels of apoptosis and abnormal phenotypes in embryos expressing Q4-GFP and Q25-GFP were also observed, which was likely due to background toxicity caused by these fusion proteins (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, further analyses showed that nearly all (∼95%) of the apoptotic cells were devoid of visible inclusions, which must be more than ∼0.5 μmin diameter for detection in our experimental setup. On the other hand, almost all cells containing detectable inclusions were nonapoptotic (∼99%), suggesting that prefibrillar Q102-GFP may instead be the toxic agent (Fig. 3C, top panels). Indeed, apoptotic cells containing diffusely distributed Q102-GFP were detected (Fig. 3C, bottom panels). Thus, our results indicate that expression of polyQ-expanded htt is toxic to the zebrafish embryo, but toxicity is not associated with the presence of visible inclusions. Hsp70 and Hsp40 Suppress Both PolyQ Aggregation and Toxicity—Molecular chaperones are known to modulate both polyQ aggregation and toxicity (28Barral J.M. Broadley S.A. Schaffar G. Hartl F.U. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We next evaluated whether we could reproduce this important feature by testing the effect of the human chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp40 on Q102-GFP aggregation and toxicity in the zebrafish embryo. Co-expression of Hsp40 and Hsp70 fused to YFP (Hsp70-YFP) reduced the amount of SDS-insoluble aggregates of Q102-GFP, as judged by the filter trap assay, whereas total protein levels of Q102-GFP were not detectably altered (Fig. 4, A and B). Fluorescence microscopy revealed that Hsp70-YFP associated with inclusions of Q102-GFP (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the chaper-one machinery recognized Q102-GFP as an aberrantly folded species. Expression of Hsp40 and Hsp70-YFP reduced the number of detectable inclusions (∼41.8% of control; data not shown), apoptotic cells (∼80% of control; data not shown), and dead embryos (Fig. 4D) while increasing the number of phenotypically normal embryos expressing Q102-GFP. Thus, aggregation and toxicity associated with Q102-GFP expression in zebrafish is partially suppressed by Hsp40 and Hsp70. Identification of Compounds That Inhibit PolyQ Aggregation—We next tested the effect of several classes of compounds on the aggregation of Q102-GFP in the zebrafish embryo (Fig. 5). First, we evaluated the capacity of known inhibitors of the polyQ aggregation process to suppress Q102-GFP aggregation in this vertebrate system. PGL-135 and Congo red (16Hockly E. Tse J. Barker A.L. Moolman D.L. Beunard J.L. Revington A.P. Holt K. Sunshine S. Moffitt H. Sathasivam K. Woodman B. Wanker E.E. Lowden P.A. Bates G.P. Neurobiol.

Nature. 2003; 421: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) reduced Q102-GFP aggregation in zebrafish, as judged by the filter trap assay (Fig. 6A). In contrast, isoproterenol HCl did not alter Q102-GFP aggregation in the zebrafish embryo, consistent with a recent study in a cell culture model (30Wang W. Duan W.Z. Igarashi S. Morita H. Nakamura M. Ross C.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 20: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, mycophenolic acid, a compound known to suppress htt inclusion formation in cell culture (30Wang W. Duan W.Z. Igarashi S. Morita H. Nakamura M. Ross C.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 20: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), had no effect on Q102-GFP aggregation in zebrafish at the maximum tolerated dose. Thus, in the case of PGL-135, Congo red, and isoproterenol HCl, our results substantiate observations in other HD models. However, in contrast to data obtained in cell culture (30Wang W. Duan W.Z. Igarashi S. Morita H. Nakamura M. Ross C.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 20: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that mycophenolic acid is not an effective inhibitor of polyQ aggregation in the vertebrate system.FIGURE 6N′-benzylidene-benzohydrazides inhibit Q102-GFP aggregation in vitro and in D. rerio.

https://openalex.org/W2032184521,"A subset of Alzheimer disease cases is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in genes encoding the amyloid β-protein precursor or presenilins. Whereas some amyloid β-protein precursor mutations alter its metabolism through effects on Aβ production, the pathogenic effects of those that alter amino acid residues within the Aβ sequence are not fully understood. Here we examined the biophysical effects of two recently described intra-Aβ mutations linked to early-onset familial Alzheimer disease, the D7N Tottori-Japanese and H6R English mutations. Although these mutations do not affect Aβ production, synthetic Aβ(1-42) peptides carrying D7N or H6R substitutions show enhanced fibril formation. In vitro analysis using Aβ(1-40)-based mutant peptides reveal that D7N or H6R mutations do not accelerate the nucleation phase but selectively promote the elongation phase of amyloid fibril formation. Notably, the levels of protofibrils generated from D7N or H6R Aβ were markedly inhibited despite enhanced fibril formation. These N-terminal Aβ mutations may accelerate amyloid fibril formation by a unique mechanism causing structural changes of Aβ peptides, specifically promoting the elongation process of amyloid fibrils without increasing metastable intermediates. A subset of Alzheimer disease cases is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in genes encoding the amyloid β-protein precursor or presenilins. Whereas some amyloid β-protein precursor mutations alter its metabolism through effects on Aβ production, the pathogenic effects of those that alter amino acid residues within the Aβ sequence are not fully understood. Here we examined the biophysical effects of two recently described intra-Aβ mutations linked to early-onset familial Alzheimer disease, the D7N Tottori-Japanese and H6R English mutations. Although these mutations do not affect Aβ production, synthetic Aβ(1-42) peptides carrying D7N or H6R substitutions show enhanced fibril formation. In vitro analysis using Aβ(1-40)-based mutant peptides reveal that D7N or H6R mutations do not accelerate the nucleation phase but selectively promote the elongation phase of amyloid fibril formation. Notably, the levels of protofibrils generated from D7N or H6R Aβ were markedly inhibited despite enhanced fibril formation. These N-terminal Aβ mutations may accelerate amyloid fibril formation by a unique mechanism causing structural changes of Aβ peptides, specifically promoting the elongation process of amyloid fibrils without increasing metastable intermediates. Alzheimer disease (AD) 3The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; FAD, familial AD; Aβ, amyloid β-protein; APP, amyloid β-protein precursor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TFE, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol; LMW, low molecular weight; wt, wild type; ThT, thioflavin T. is characterized pathologically by deposition of the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in the form of amyloid plaques in the brain (1.Selkoe D.J.

Aβ is produced through proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid β-protein precursor (APP) through sequential cleavages by two proteases, β- and γ-secretase (2.Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A.

Missense mutations in presenilin 1, presenilin 2, or APP generally increase the proportion of the 42-residue form of Αβ, Aβ(1-42), relative to the 40-residue form of the peptide, Aβ(1-40). Αβ(1-42) is the species initially deposited in the brain in AD and has been shown to aggregate more readily than Aβ(1-40) (7.Borchelt D.R. Thinakaran G. Eckman C.B. Lee M.K. Davenport F. Ratovisky T.

A Swedish APP double mutation increases the overall production of Aβ by enhancing β-secretase cleavage of the Αβ N terminus. In contrast, the pathological phenotypes caused by mutations that alter amino acid residues within the Aβ sequence are variable, and the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are not fully understood. Recent data support the notion that intra-Aβ amino acid substitutions affect peptide self-association. For example, the Arctic mutation that causes an E22G substitution and early-onset FAD enhances the formation of protofibrils (9.Nilsberth C. Westlind-Danielsson A. Eckman C.B. Condron M.M. Axelman K.

Taken together, the intra-Aβ mutations appear to enhance the deposition of Aβ by increasing the propensity of Aβ to aggregate. In vitro studies have revealed that fibril formation of Aβ is a complex process in which nucleation of assembly is the rate-limiting step (18.Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

Two novel mutations that alter amino acid residues in the N-terminal region of Aβ recently were reported in early-onset FAD pedigrees from Tottori-Japan (D7N) (26.Wakutani Y. Watanabe K. Adachi Y. Wada-Isoe K. Urakami H. Ninomiya H. Saido T.C. Hashimoto T. Iwatsubo T. Nakashima K. J. Neurol. Neurosurg.

The probands in both of the families were clinically diagnosed as “probable AD.” The ages of onset of two affected sisters in the Tottori kindred were 60 and 65 years (26.Wakutani Y. Watanabe K. Adachi Y. Wada-Isoe K. Urakami H. Ninomiya H. Saido T.C. Hashimoto T. Iwatsubo T. Nakashima K. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2004; 75: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The proband in the English family was diagnosed at 55 years of age (25.Janssen J.C. Beck J.A. Campbell T.A. Dickinson A. Fox N.C. Harvey R.J. Houlden H. Rossor M.N. Collinge J. Neurology. 2003; 60: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the N-terminal region of Aβ around residues His-6 and Asp-7 was a “hot spot” of intra-Aβ mutations that facilitated Aβ deposition and the development of AD. In this study, we studied the aggregation properties of Aβ containing either the D7N or H6R substitution. We found that the substitutions selectively accelerated the elongation phase of Aβ fibril formation. Unexpectedly, the process occurred without significant formation of protofibrils. Peptides and Reagents−Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) peptides, and analogues containing the H6R, D7N, or E22G amino acid substitutions, were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and characterized by mass spectroscopy and amino acid analysis as described (27.Lomakin A.

Peptides were solubilized in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (Kanto Chemical) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, dried, and resolubilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% (v/v) Me2SO (Kanto Chemical) and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter immediately prior to use, as described (28.Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M.A. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol (TFE) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical. In Vitro Aβ Fibrillization and Thioflavin T Fluorescence Assays−In vitro Aβ fibrillization assays were performed as described (29.Osada Y. Hashimoto T. Nishimura A. Matsuo Y. Wakabayashi T. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8596-8605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, synthetic Aβ(1-42) peptides were solubilized at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times in a PCR thermal cycler (TaKaRa). For the analysis of the nucleation phase, synthetic Aβ(1-40) peptides were solubilized at 0.3 mg/ml and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. For the analysis of the elongation phase, synthetic Aβ(1-40) peptides were solubilized at 0.1 mg/ml in 20% (v/v) TFE and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. For analysis of the effects of addition of fibril seeds, Aβ(1-40) peptides were solubilized at 0.1 mg/ml in the presence of prefibrillized Aβ(1-42) that had been fragmented by sonication and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. After incubation, 50-μl aliquots were put immediately on ice to prevent further fibril formation, followed by addition of 500 μl of 3 μm thioflavin T (ThT, Tokyo Chemical) in 0.1 m glycine-NaOH (pH 8.5). Fluorescence levels were then assayed using an Hitachi F2500 fluorometer (λex = 443 nm and λem = 484 nm). Placement of samples on ice does not cause structural changes or fibril dissociation, as assessed by ThT fluorescence, because samples maintained on ice for up to 7 days produced constant ThT fluorescence (data not shown). Evaluation of the Kinetics of Fibril Elongation−The kinetic properties of Aβ fibril formation can be described by the first-order kinetic model as in Reaction 1,[P]+[M][P] where [P] is the number concentration of nuclei, [M]isthe concentration of monomeric Aβ, and the constants for polymerization and depolymerization are k2 and k-1, respectively (30.Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar). When F(t) represents the concentration of Aβ in the form of fibrils quantitated by ThT fluorescence for the incubation time (t), the model can be described as in Equation 1.F’(t)=k2[P][M]-k-1[P] If [M]0 represents the initial Aβ concentration, [M] can be described as in Equation 2.[M]=[M]0-F(tq) The insertion of Equation 2 into Equation 1 is then arranged as in Equation 3.F’(t)=k2[P]([M]0-k-1/k2)-k2[P]F(t) When t is infinity, the reaction reaches an equilibrium between polymerization and depolymerization. Then Equation 4 is introduced,k2[P][M]∞=k-1[P] giving [M]∞ = k-1/k2, and if b = k2[P], then Equation 3 can be described as Equation 5,F’(t)=b([M]0-[M]∞)-bF(t) where ([M]0 - [M]∞) gives the value F(∞). Then Equation 5 can be arranged as Equation 6.F’(t)=bF(∞)-bF(t) Equation 6 can be also rewritten by integration as Equation 7.log[F(∞)-F(t)]=a-btanda=logF(∞) Following Equation 7, log[F(∞) - F(t)] is approximated by a linear function in the elongation phase. The velocity of fibrillization in the elongation phase thus is determined by the slope of this linear function, i.e. the value of b. When the concentrations of seeds are equal among samples, b is also proportional to k2 (the constant for polymerization), and then the evaluation of fibril elongation by b values is justified. The ThT fluorescence levels of samples are then fit to a sigmoidal curve, and F(∞) was calculated by using KaleidaGraph version 3.6 (r2 > 0.95). Using calculated F(∞), the data of ThT fluorescence levels were re-plotted in a semi-logarithmical plot, and b values were estimated by using Microsoft Excel 2004 for Mac (r2 > 0.95). Isolation and Quantitative Analysis of Protofibrils and LMW Aβs−To monitor protofibril formation, Aβ(1-42) peptides were dissolved at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and incubated for the indicated times at 30 °C. Following incubation, the solution was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 5 min, and then the supernatants were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) attached to a series 1100 high-performance liquid chromato- graph (Hewlett-Packard) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, as described (13.Walsh D.M.

Protofibrils and LMW Aβ were detected and recovered at elution times of ∼16 min and ∼27 min, respectively, by UV absorbance at 214 nm. Negative Stain Electron Microscopy−Samples were spread on 400-mesh collodion-coated grids, negatively stained with 2% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.0 (Wako Pure Chemical), and viewed in an electron microscope (JEOL 1200EXII), as described (29.Osada Y.

The length and diameter of fibrils were determined by averaging those of 150 fibrils viewed in three independent visual fields. DNA Constructs, Cell Culture, Transfection, Immunoblot Analysis, and Quantitation of Aβ−A cDNA encoding human APP695 was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), as described (8.Tomita T.

H6R and D7N mutations were introduced into the human APP695 cDNA by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis using the following oligonucleotides: H6R, 5′-GATGCAGAGTTCCGACGTGACTCAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTGAGTCACGTCGGAACTCTGCATC-3′ (reverse); D7N, 5′-GCAGAATTCCGACATAACTCCGGATATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATATCCGGAGTTATGTCGGAATTCTGC-3′ (reverse).

The immunoblots were visualized using Immunostar reagent (Wako Pure Chemical) and LAS-1000 plus (Fujifilm). The expression levels of APP were quantitated by densitometry using Image Gauge (Fujifilm). Mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells were cultured as described (8.Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Kume H. Shinozaki K. Tokuhiro S. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Haass C. Iwatsubo T. Obata K. Proc. Natl.

Expression of transfected proteins was enhanced by treatment with 10 mm butyric acid for 24 h prior to harvesting cells or culture supernatants. Two-site ELISAs that specifically detect the C terminus of Aβ were used as described (8.Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Kume H. Shinozaki K. Tokuhiro S. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Haass C. Iwatsubo T. Obata K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2025-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Culture media were collected after 24-h incubation and subjected to BNT77/BA27 or BNT77/BC05 ELISAs. The levels of secreted Aβ were normalized by the expression levels of APP. ELISA data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance using StatView-J4.11. D7N and H6R Mutant Aβ(1-42) Show Enhanced Fibril Formation in Vitro−To determine the effects of D7N and H6R substitutions on fibril formation, we used a well characterized assay of β-sheet formation, ThT binding (36.Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 37.LeVine III H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). Prior to doing so, we confirmed that equal amounts of fibrils formed by each peptide bound comparable levels of ThT (data not shown). We found that the H6R, D7N, and E22G Aβ(1-42) peptides exhibited accelerated fibril formation compared with wild-type (wt) peptide (Fig. 1). The Elongation Phase, but Not the Nucleation Phase, of Aβ(1-40) Fibril Formation Is Accelerated by D7N or H6R Substitution−To further determine the effects of D7N and H6R mutations on Aβ fibrillization, we analyzed the nucleation and elongation phases of the process using Aβ(1-40) (Fig. 2A). The rapidity with which Aβ(1-42) assembled precluded similar analyses with this alloform. We evaluated the nucleation rate by monitoring the time lag prior to the rapid rise in ThT fluorescence (38.O'Nuallain B. Williams A.D. Westermark P. Wetzel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17490-17499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The E22G peptide formed fibrils most rapidly with no lag phase. In contrast, wt, H6R, and D7N peptides displayed significantly longer lag phases. wt Aβ(1-40) had a lag phase of ∼225 h, determined by extrapolation of a line fitted to the linear portion of the ThT binding curve to the baseline of the binding curve (Fig. 2B). Both H6R and D7N peptides had slightly longer lag periods, of ∼238 h and ∼247 h, respectively (Fig. 2B). To determine if these altered assembly rates correlated with altered fibril morphologies, we performed negative-stain electron microscopy after 338 h. Each of the peptides formed straight fibrils of ∼3.5- to 4-nm diameter. No significant difference in the shape was observed (Fig. 2C). We next studied the effects of the substitutions on fibril elongation. To eliminate fibril nucleation from our consideration of elongation kinetics, we monitored fibril formation in Aβ solutions to which had been added preformed Aβ(1-42) fibril seeds (29.Osada Y.

For the Tottori and Arctic peptides, the lag phase was eliminated. For the English and wt peptides, the lag phase was diminished by greater than two orders of magnitude (cf. Figs. 2B and 3A). Data from the linear and plateau regions of the progress curves were incorporated into a first-order kinetic model to determine elongation rates (“b values”; see “Experimental Procedures”) (30.Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar), which were 8.94 × 10-2 h-1 (wt), 3.30 × 10-1 h-1 (H6R), 1.44 × 10-1 h-1 (D7N), and 2.62 × 10-1 h-1 (E22G) (Fig. 3B). We further examined the rates of fibril elongation by inclusion of 20% (v/v) TFE in the assembly reactions. TFE has been shown to facilitate the conformational conversion of random coil conformers of Aβ into α-helix forms that rapidly assemble into fibrils (29.Osada Y. Hashimoto T. Nishimura A. Matsuo Y. Wakabayashi T. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8596-8605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the presence of TFE, fibril formation and elongation of Aβ(1-40) were observed immediately. The elongation rates were found to be 2.59 × 10-2 h-1 (wt), 5.04 × 10-2 h-1 (H6R), 1.07 × 10-1 h-1 (D7N), and 2.44 × 10-1 h-1 (E22G), again supporting the notion that the H6R, D7N, and E22G mutations accelerate the elongation phase of Aβ fibril formation (supplemental Figs. S1, A and B). H6R or D7N Mutant Aβ Exhibit Accelerated Fibril Formation without Accumulation of Protofibrils−During the fibrillogenesis of Aβ in vitro, protofibrillar intermediates form (13.Walsh D.M. Lomakin A.

To determine whether D7N or H6R mutations affect the formation of protofibrils, we monitored Αβ assembly using size exclusion chromatography. Two peaks, one at ∼16 min corresponding to protofibrils and one at ∼27 min corresponding to low molecular weight (LMW) Aβ, were observed (data not shown). We simultaneously measured the ThT fluorescence of the samples after incubation, but prior to centrifugation (total fraction), and the supernatant after centrifugation (supernatant fraction). A previous report showed that protofibrils bound ThT with slightly lower affinity compared with fibrils (40.Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25945-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar), indicating that the ThT fluorescence of total fraction represents the sum of protofibrils and fibrils, whereas that of supernatant fraction reflects the amount of protofibrils. Thus, the difference between the ThT levels of total fraction and supernatant fraction accounts for the amount of fibrils. As reported previously (40.Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25945-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar), wt Aβ(1-42) rapidly formed protofibrils, which coincided with the decrease in the LMW Aβ peak (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S2A). However, the formation of fibrils from wt Aβ(1-42) was not observed until 240 min (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. 2A). Formation of protofibrils from E22G Aβ(1-42) peptide started at 10 min, which was faster than that of wt (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. 2D) and was consistent with prior published results (9.Nilsberth C. Westlind-Danielsson A. Eckman C.B. Condron M.M. Axelman K. Forsell C. Stenh C. Luthman J. Teplow D.B. Younkin S.G. Lannfelt L. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). In contrast, few protofibrils were formed by H6R or D7N Aβ(1-42) (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. 2B, C). Instead, immediate fibril formation was observed (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. 2, B and C). To confirm these results, we studied the samples after 30-min incubation by negative-stain electron microscopy. In the supernatants of wt or E22G peptides, abundant short and curved fibrils, showing morphology of typical protofibrils, were observed (Fig. 4C). However, the supernatants from H6R or D7N Aβ peptides did not contain any observable protofibrils or fibrils, whereas the pellets contained long, straight fibrils (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that the H6R and D7N mutations enhance the fibril formation of Aβ without increasing protofibrils, whereas the E22G mutation enhances form"
https://openalex.org/W2026283708,"A water-soluble chlorophyll-binding protein (WSCP) is the single known instance of a putative chlorophyll (Chl) carrier in green plants. Recently the photoprotective function of WSCP has been demonstrated by EPR measurements; the light-induced singlet-oxygen formation of Chl in the WSCP tetramer is about four times lower than that of unbound Chl. This paper describes the crystal structure of the WSCP-Chl complex purified from leaves of Lepidium virginicum (Virginia pepperweed) to clarify the mechanism of its photoprotective function. The WSCP-Chl complex is a homotetramer comprising four protein chains of 180 amino acids and four Chl molecules. At the center of the complex one hydrophobic cavity is formed in which all of the four Chl molecules are tightly packed and isolated from bulk solvent. With reference to the novel Chl-binding mode, we propose that the photoprotection mechanism may be based on the inhibition of physical contact between the Chl molecules and molecular oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1974360297,"Antibody class switching in activated B cells uses class switch recombination (CSR), which joins activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-dependent double-strand breaks (DSBs) within two large immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus switch (S) regions that lie up to 200 kilobases apart. To test postulated roles of S regions and AID in CSR, we generated mutant B cells in which donor Smu and accepter Sgamma1 regions were replaced with yeast I-SceI endonuclease sites. We found that site-specific I-SceI DSBs mediate recombinational IgH locus class switching from IgM to IgG1 without S regions or AID. We propose that CSR evolved to exploit a general DNA repair process that promotes joining of widely separated DSBs within a chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1967707279,"Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) can be catabolized by many microorganisms using intra- or extracellular PHA depolymerases. Most of our current knowledge of these intracellular enzyme-coding genes comes from the analysis of short chain length PHA depolymerases, whereas medium chain length PHA (mcl-PHA) intracellular depolymerization systems still remained to be characterized. The phaZ gene of some Pseudomonas putida strains has been identified only by mutagenesis and complementation techniques as putative intracellular mcl-PHA depolymerase. However, none of their corresponding encoded PhaZ enzymes have been characterized in depth. In this study the PhaZ depolymerase from P. putida KT2442 has been purified and biochemically characterized after its overexpression in Escherichia coli. To facilitate these studies we have developed a new and very sensitive radioactive method for detecting PHA hydrolysis in vitro. We have demonstrated that PhaZ is an intracellular depolymerase that is located in PHA granules and that hydrolyzes specifically mcl-PHAs containing aliphatic and aromatic monomers. The enzyme behaves as a serine hydrolase that is inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. We have modeled the three-dimensional structure of PhaZ complexed with a 3-hydroxyoctanoate dimer. Using this model, we found that the enzyme appears to be built up from a coreα/β hydrolase-type domain capped with a lid structure with an active site containing a catalytic triad buried near the connection between domains. All these data constitute the first biochemical characterization of PhaZ and allow us to propose this enzyme as the paradigmatic representative of intracellular endo/exo-mcl-PHA depolymerases.

These compounds are accumulated as reserve granules (carbon and energy storage material) in the cytoplasm when the environmental conditions are not optimal for growth due to the limitation of a required nutrient and an excess of a carbon source (1.Anderson A.J. Dawes E.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 450-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Madison L.L. Huisman G.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 21-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Steinbuchel A.

Microbiol. 2003; 6: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). When growing conditions turn to carbon starvation, accumulated PHA can be biodegraded to monomers and/or oligomers, which are then reutilized by microorganisms as carbon and energy sources (6.Jendrossek D. Handrick R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 403-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). PHAs are built from 3-hydroxyfatty acid monomers where the carboxyl group of one monomer forms an ester bond with the hydroxyl group of the neighboring monomer (2.Madison L.L. Huisman G.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 21-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the hydroxyl-substituted carbon atoms are of the R configuration conferring chirality to the biopolymer (7.Prieto M.A. Kellerhals M.B. Bozzato G.B. Radnovic D. Witholt B. Kessler B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 3265-3271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PHAs have been proposed as a source for the production of chiral (R) hydroxyalkanoic acids, scaffolds for the synthesis of value added products (8.de Roo G. Kellerhals M.B. Ren Q. Witholt B. Kessler B. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2002; 77: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The R moiety that can vary from 1 to 11 carbon atoms is also present at this 3 position (Fig. 1), and, thus, short chain length PHAs (scl-PHAs) contain monomers consisting of 4-5 carbon atoms, whereas medium chain length PHAs (mcl-PHAs) are formed of monomers of 6-14 carbon atoms (2.Madison L.L. Huisman G.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 21-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PHAs can be catabolized by many microorganisms through extracellular or intracellular processes depending on the PHA localization (6.Jendrossek D. Handrick R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 403-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In extracellular degradation, exogenous PHA is utilized as a carbon and energy source. Extracellular PHA is released by producer microorganisms after death, and the granules spread into the environment are further hydrolyzed by secreted enzymes into water-soluble oligomers and monomers. The ability to degrade extracellular scl-PHAs is widespread among bacteria in comparison to that of mcl-PHAs. Thus, many extracellular scl-PHA depolymerases have been characterized in depth over the last decade, and >20 genes have been identified (6.Jendrossek D. Handrick R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 403-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 9.Behrends A. Klingbeil B. Jendrossek D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 143: 191-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Abe H.

The prototype of extracellular mcl-PHA depolymerases is that of Pseudomonas fluorescens GK13, and only its coding gene and its homologous genes in other strains have been isolated and characterized (6.Jendrossek D.

On the other hand, when a producer microorganism requires a carbon source, intracellular PHA can be hydrolyzed by intracellular depolymerases, which seem to be anchored to the PHA granule (6.Jendrossek D. Handrick R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 403-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 15.Foster L.J. Stuart E.S. Tehrani A. Lenz R.W. Fuller R.C. Int. J. Biol.

In contrast to extracellular depolymerases, intracellular degradation of previously accumulated PHAs is poorly understood. However, during the last years, the analysis of the genomes of a paradigmatic polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) producer bacteria like Ralstonia eutropha strain H16 and other related strains as well as the cloning and characterization of several PHB depolymerases and oligomer hydrolases have revealed the existence of a very complex PHB hydrolytic system for this model microorganism (17.Handrick R.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5129-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). At least four types of enzymes and some enzyme paralogs have been proposed as putative components of this complex hydrolytic system (21.Potter M. Muller H. Reinecke F. Wieczorek R. Fricke F. Bowien B. Friedrich B. Steinbuchel A. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Depending on the depolymerase isoenzymes synthesized by the cell, the end reaction products can be oligomers, monomers, dimers, or a mixture of oligomers, but the function of each depolymerase isoenzyme has not yet been clearly determined (17.Handrick R. Reinhardt S. Jendrossek D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5916-5918Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18.Saegusa H. Shiraki M. Kanai C. Saito T. J.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5129-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, the expression of these isoenzymes should be tightly regulated to guarantee the hydrolysis of the biopolymer when required for its complete assimilation, but the characterization of such complex regulatory system is just at the preliminary stages (24.Prieto M.A. Buhler B. Jung K. Witholt B. Kessler B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 858-868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Kessler B. Witholt B. J. Biotechnol. 2001; 86: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The only example of intracellular mcl-PHA degradation described so far is that of the mcl-PHA mobilization in different bacterial species belonging to the genera Pseudomonas. The pha genes involved in mcl-PHA metabolism in these strains have been cloned and sequenced (see Fig. 2). This pha cluster is composed of two synthase-coding genes (phaC1 and phaC2), a putative regulatory gene (phaD), two coding phasin genes having structural and regulatory functions (phaF and phaI) (24.Prieto M.A. Buhler B. Jung K. Witholt B. Kessler B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 858-868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Huisman G.W. Wonink E. Meima R. Kazemier B. Terpstra P. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2191-2198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the phaZ gene located between the synthase-coding genes whose product is similar to members of the family V of bacterial lipolytic enzymes containing a potential lipase box (27.Arpigny J.L. Jaeger K.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the first report describing a process of mcl-PHA mobilization demonstrated the existence of self-hydrolysis of the granules in a strain of Pseudomonas oleovorans (15.Foster L.J. Stuart E.S. Tehrani A. Lenz R.W. Fuller R.C. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1996; 19: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28.Foster L.J. Lenz R.W. Fuller R.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 118: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas an mcl-PHA intracellular depolymerase activity was ascribed to the phaZ gene firstly in Pseudomonas putida GPo1 (formerly known as P. oleovorans GPo1) (26.Huisman G.W. Wonink E. Meima R. Kazemier B. Terpstra P. Witholt B. J. Biol.

In this work the PhaZ from P. putida KT2442 has been purified and characterized after its overexpression in a heterologous host. Therefore, we presented the first formal biochemical evidence that PhaZ is certainly an intracellular mcl-PHA depolymerase, becoming the prototype of this relevant enzyme family. Materials−n-Phenylalkanoic acids and n-alkanoic acids were supplied by Lancaster Synthesis or by Sigma. [1-14C]Octanoic acid (50 mCi/mmol) was from Americans Radiolabeled Chemicals. All other products were of analytical quality or high-performance liquid chromatography grade. Bacterial Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions−The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. P. putida KT2442 is a derivative strain of the parental strain KT2440 whose complete genome nucleotide sequence of the genome is accessible in the data bank. Unless otherwise stated, Escherichia coli and P. putida strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (34.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed.

The appropriate selection antibiotics, gentamicin (10 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), or ampicillin (100 μg/ml) were added when needed. For poly(hydroxyoctanoate-co-hydroxyhexanoate) (P(HO-co-HX)) and poly(hydroxynonanoate-co-hydroxyheptanoate) (P(HN-co-HP)) productions, P. putida GPo1 strain was grown in 0.1 n M63, which is a nitrogen-limited minimal medium (13.6 g of KH2PO4/liter, 0.2 g (NH4)2SO4/liter, 0.5 mg FeSO4·7H2O/liter, adjusted to pH 7.0 with KOH), plus 15 mm octanoic acid (P(HO-co-HX) production) or 10 mm nonanoic acid (P(HN-co-HP) production), for 24 h as previously described (37.Moldes C. Garci´a P. Garci´a J.L. Prieto M.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 3205-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To study the induction of PhaZ enzyme production in growing cells, M63 medium (38.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

DNA Manipulations and Plasmid Constructions−DNA manipulations and other molecular biology techniques were essentially performed as described previously (34.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Transformation of E. coli cells was carried out by using the RbCl method or by electroporation (GenePulser, Bio-Rad) (40.Dower W.J. Miller J.F. Ragsdale C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). Plasmid transference to the target Pseudomonas strains was done by the filter-mating technique (35.Herrero M. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6557-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were purified by standard procedures using Gene Clean (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA). Plasmids and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table 1. To construct pPAZ1, the 904-bp DNA fragment coding for the PhaZ depolymerase was PCR-amplified by using the oligonucleotides PHAZ1 and PHAZ2 using the total DNA of the strain P. putida KT2442 as template. For PCR amplifications, we used 2 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1 μg of DNA template, 1 μg of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and 2.5 mm MgCl2 in the buffer recommended by the manufacturer. Conditions for amplification were chosen according to the G + C content of the corresponding oligonucleotides. The PCR product was digested with the engineered endonucleases (Table 1) and cloned in pUC18 or in the corresponding expression vector. Similar procedures were applied to generate the plasmids pPAZ2 and pPAZ3 (Table 1). In the case of pPAZ2, the oligonucleotides applied were PHAZ3 and PHAZ4, and the resulting PCR product was of 891 bp. For pPAZ3 construction, the primers PHAZQE and PHAZ2 were used, and the PCR amplification product was of 884 bp. Nucleotide sequences were determined directly with the same oligonucleotides used for cloning. Standard protocols of the manufacturer for TaqDNA polymerase-initiated cycle sequencing reactions with fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotide terminators (Applied Biosystems Inc.) were used. All these constructions were confirmed by sequencing using an ABI Prism 3730 DNA Sequencer. Purification of PhaZ Depolymerase−A preculture of E. coli M15 (pREP4, pPAZ3) cells was incubated overnight in LB medium plus ampicillin and kanamycin. Culture was diluted until an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of 0.1. When A600 reached 0.5 the culture was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cells were further incubated for 4 h. 500 ml of culture was resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl). Cells were broken by a 4-fold passage through a French press (1,000 p.s.i.) and centrifuged at 27,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto 2 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with the washing buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 75 mm imidazole) at 0.5 ml/min. After loading, the column was washed with ten volumes of the same washing buffer and then eluted with the elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole) at 0.25 ml/min. All the purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Electrophoretic and Immunological Techniques−SDS-PAGE was performed routinely as described before (34.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed with the ECL Western Blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol described by the manufacturer. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against PhaZ was generated by using SDS-PAGE-separated PhaZ depolymerase material as the antigen. Protein band quantifications were carried out by using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Characterization of the Biopolyesters PHAs and PHPhAs−PHAs and PHPhAs were isolated following the procedure reported before (41.Lageveen R.G. Huisman G.W. Preusting H. Ketelaar P. Eggink G. Witholt B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 2924-2932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from cells grown in the described media (see above). The PHPhA and PHA compositions were analyzed by NMR and gas chromatography as indicated previously (39.Abraham G.A. Gallardo A. San Roman J. Olivera E.R. Jodra R. Garci´a B. Minambres B. Garci´a J.L.

PHA Depolymerase Radioactive Assay−To prepare the substrate for the radioactive assay P. putida GPo1 strain was cultured in 200 ml of defined medium as described for P(HO-co-HX) production (see above), in the presence of 10 μCi of [14C]octanoic acid. After 24 h of incubation, cells were harvested and resuspended in 3 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) plus 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) and equal volume of glass beads (150-212 μm, Sigma). The mixture was kept at 37 °C for 60 min and disrupted by shaking in a vortex mixer. The pellet fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 25 min and suspended on 2 ml of saline solution. To eliminate nucleic acids, 2 mg of DNase (2,000 units/mg, Sigma) and 0.1 mg of RNase (100 units/mg, Sigma) were added and incubated 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, the mixture was incubated overnight at 60 °C in the presence of 1 mg of proteinase K (30 units/mg, Sigma). The solution was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 25 min, and the pellet fraction was dissolved in 10 ml of chloroform. To extract water-soluble cell components, 2 ml of water was added and the organic and aqueous phases were mixed by vortexing and then separated by centrifugation at 5,000 × g. The organic phase was transferred into a new tube. The procedure was repeated by adding 10 ml of chloroform to the aqueous phase. The chloroform solution was precipitated in ice-cold methanol (10-fold excess) under vigorous stirring. After decanting the methanol/chloroform solvent mixture, the resulting polymer was air-dried overnight and stored at room temperature. The yield was 80 mg of [14C]P(HO-co-HX) (18 nCi/mg). This labeled polymer, hereafter named PHA*, was used to prepare a polymer/water emulsion (PHA* latex) as previously described (14.Schirmer A. Jendrossek D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7065-7073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was applied as substrate to assay the depolymerase activity of the PhaZ enzyme. To avoid unspecific binding of the PhaZ to the polymer substrate, 25 μl of PHA* latex (6 μg/μl) was preincubated in the presence of 0.02 mg/ml lysozyme for 10 min at room temperature. The assay mixture of 250 μl contained 0.6 mg/ml lysozyme-preincubated PHA* latex, 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, and 5 μl of crude extract (10 μg/μl) or purified enzyme (0.1 μg/μl). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of formaldehyde. The samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C, and the radioactivity in 200-μl portions of the supernatant was determined in a scintillation counter. One unit of depolymerase activity by this method (units*) was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis (solubilization) of 1 μg of PHA* in 1 min. This assay was used to determine optimum pH and temperature as well as to study the thermal stability of PhaZ. For this latter determination, purified PhaZ was incubated from 20 to 65 °C at time intervals from 5 to 60 min. PHA Depolymerase Turbidimetric Assay−Native granules of P(HO-co-HX) (P(HO-co-HX)n) were prepared from crude extracts of P. putida GPo1 strain cultured in 200 ml of defined medium as described for (P(HO-co-HX)) production (see above) by glycerol density gradient centrifugation (37.Moldes C. Garci´a P. Garci´a J.L. Prieto M.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 3205-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Artificial cholate-coated granules ((P(HO-co-HX)s) were prepared by emulsifying 300 μl of a PHA or PHPhAs solution in chloroform (12.5% (w/v)) in 3 ml of 50 mm sodium cholate by ultrasonication and subsequent evaporation of the solvent following the method described previously (43.Horowitz D.M. Sanders J.K.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 2695-2702Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These artificial granules were further purified by glycerol density gradient centrifugation. Artificial granules of (P(HO-co-HX) were also prepared in the absence of cholate (P(HO-co-HX)w) as described previously (14.Schirmer A. Jendrossek D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7065-7073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A turbidimetric assay method was performed as described elsewhere (11.Handrick R. Reinhardt S. Focarete M.L. Scandola M. Adamus G. Kowalczuk M. Jendrossek D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36215-36224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A reaction mixture of 500 μl contained 1.8 μg of PhaZ, 250 μg of substrates, 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl. One unit of depolymerase activity by turbidimetric assay (unitsA) is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the decrease of one A650 unit per min. Alternatively, one unit of depolymerase activity (unitsPHA) is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis (solubilization) of 1 μg of PHA in 1 min. Lipolytic and Esterase Activity Assays−Rhodamine B-1,2,3-tri-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-sn-glycerol and 1,2,3-tributyryl-sn-glycerol plates were used to test PhaZ lipolytic activity as described elsewhere (44.Kouker G. Jaeger K.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 211-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity assays against other triacylglycerols were carried out by both rhodamine B plates and turbidimetric methods. Esterase activity against p-nitrophenylhydroxyalkanoates with a chain length of the fatty acid moiety of 2-16 carbon atoms was performed according to the procedure described previously (11.Handrick"
https://openalex.org/W2073458421,"Appropriate trafficking of the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) after agonist-promoted internalization is crucial for the resensitization of its signaling pathway. Efficient recycling of the β1-AR required the binding of the protein kinase A anchoring protein-79 (AKAP79) to the carboxyl terminus of the β1-AR (Gardner, L. A., Tavalin, S. A., Goehring, A., Scott, J. D., and Bahouth, S. W. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 33537-33553). In this study we show that AKAP79 forms a complex with the type 1 PDZ-binding sequence (ESKV) at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the β1-AR, which is mediated by the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein SAP97. Thus, the PDZ and its associated SAP97-AKAP79 complex are involved in targeting the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to the β1-AR. The PDZ and its scaffold were required for efficient recycling of the β1-AR and for PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β1-AR at Ser312. Overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA or mutagenesis of Ser312 to the phosphoserine mimic aspartic acid both rescued the recycling of the trafficking-defective β1-ARΔ PDZ mutant. Thus, trafficking signals transmitted from the PDZ-associated scaffold in the carboxyl terminus of the β1-AR to Ser312 in the 3rd intracellular loop (3rd IC) were paramount in setting the trafficking itinerary of the β1-AR. The data presented here show that a novel β1-adrenergic receptosome is organized at the β1-AR PDZ to generate a scaffold essential for trafficking and networking of the β1-AR.

Among these receptors is the β1-AR, which is coupled to the Gs-cyclic AMP axis and plays a major role in transmitting sympathetic regulation to cardiac, renal, vascular, and other organs (2.Lohse M.J.

Characterization of the players involved in these distinct outcomes is the purpose of this study.Recycling and resensitization of the β1-AR are dependent upon two motifs; one is the ESKV sequence in the carboxyl-terminal tail, and the other is the region surrounding Ser312 in the 3rd IC of the β1-AR (10.Gage R.M.

The ESKV tetrapeptide conforms to a type I (PSD-95/DLG/ZO1) PDZ ligand (i.e. X(S/T)XΦ, where X at positions -1 and -3 is any amino acid, and Φ at position 0 is a hydrophobic amino acid) (12.Kim E.

Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the type 1 PDZ or Ser312 to alanine prevented the recycling and resensitization of the β1-AR (10.Gage R.M. Matveeva E.A. Whiteheart S.W. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2205-3313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11.Gardner L.A. Delos Santos N.M. Matta S.G. Whitt M.A. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol.

Concerning Ser312, we determined that this residue is specifically phosphorylated by PKA and that the activity of PKA was required for recycling and resensitization of the human β1-AR (11.Gardner L.A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 21135-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).These results indicate that two distinct motifs are involved in recycling of the β1-AR, but they do not explain how they cross-talk to one another to coordinate the sequence of events involved in recycling of this GPCR. A major breakthrough in identifying the mechanism of cross-talk between these two motifs was the identification of AKAP79 as the AKAP involved in recycling of the β1-AR in HEK-293 and other cell lines (1.Gardner L.A. Tavalin S.J. Goehring A.S. Scott J.D. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33537-33553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). AKAP79 promoted the targeting of PKA to the β1-AR by binding to the carboxyl-terminal 53 amino acids (between residues 425 and 477) of the β1-AR (1.Gardner L.A. Tavalin S.J. Goehring A.S. Scott J.D. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33537-33553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here we report that the binding domain of AKAP79 to the β1-AR overlaps with its type 1 PDZ motif. However, the binding between the PDZ and AKAP79 is indirect and involves the MAGUK protein SAP97 that simultaneously binds to AKAP79 and type 1 PDZ to target PKA to the β1-AR. By scaffolding PKA to the β1-AR, SAP97 facilitates PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ser312, which is critical for trafficking of the internalized β1-AR to membranes. These results indicate that a novel β1-adrenergic receptosome is involved in recycling and resensitization of the β1-AR as well as in its other physiological effects.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of FLAG- or Myc-tagged Full-length and Truncated β1-AR−To allow rapid assessment of cell surface expression of the β1-AR, the amino-terminal initiator methionine was replaced either by the FLAG tag sequence (DYKDDDDK) or by the Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) sequence, resulting in N-FLAG/Myc-tagged WT β1-AR or the S312D mutant in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) (14.Delos Santos N.M. Gardner L.A. White S.B. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12896-12907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To generate the β1-AR(Δ425-441) and β1-AR(Δ425-463) constructs, the full-length β1-AR cDNA was cut with SmaI, and the resulting 1.3-kb cDNA encoding β1-AR-(1-424) was cloned into pcDNA3.1. The 162-bp SmaI-EcoRI cDNA between bases 1272 and 1434 was used as a template for PCRs that generated cDNAs encoding the sequences between amino acids 441-477 and 463-477, which were then ligated in-frame into the β1-AR-(1-424). The WT β1-AR or S312D was used as PCR templates with the sense primer described in Gardner et al. (1.Gardner L.A. Tavalin S.J. Goehring A.S. Scott J.D. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol.

Sequences of all the epitope-tagged β1-AR constructs were verified by automated dideoxy sequencing.Construction of Fluorescently Tagged β1-AR, SAP97, AKAP79, and RIIα Subunit−Amino-terminal fusions of the WTβ1-AR and AKAP79 to CFP and YFP were described (1.Gardner L.A.

CFP- or YFP-β1-ARΔPDZ was generated using the forward primer described earlier and the reverse primer (5′-TGGATCCGCTGCTGCTGCCGAGGCGAAGCCGGGGCGGCAC). For SAP97, the coding sequence of rat myc-SAP97 in GW1-CMV was amplified by PCR using a forward primer (5′-AAGCTTATGCCGGTCCGGAAGCAAGATACC) and a reverse primer (5′-CGGTACCGTTAATTTTTCTTTTGCTGGGACCCAG) to generate the 2.8-kb HindIII-KpnI cDNA, which was fused in-frame into pECFP-N1 and pEYFP-N1. Expression of these fusion proteins was confirmed by sequencing, fluorescence microscopy, and Western blot analysis.Cell Cultures and Radioligand Binding Parameters−HEK-293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum until they were ∼90% confluent. The WT β1-AR or its point mutants in pcDNA 3.1 were transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells using the Cytofectene reagent (Bio-Rad) as follows. Plasmid DNA (1 μg) was diluted into 200 μl of DMEM and then mixed with an equal volume of DMEM containing 12 μl of Cytofectene at room temperature for 20 min. Then 4 ml of DMEM was added, and the DNA-lipid complex was layered over the cells for 5 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of an equal volume of DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum. G-418-stable cell lines for the constructs described in Table 1 were generated and used where indicated. Binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) to 0.5 μg of membranes prepared from the cells described in Table 1 was measured in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, plus 10 mm MgCl2 binding buffer containing 0.1 mm ascorbic acid for 2 h at 25 °C. For saturation binding experiments, ICYP concentrations ranging between 5 and 300 pm were used to calculate the KD and the Bmax values for ICYP binding by parametric fitting of the data by using the Prism 4 software (GraphPad Corp.).TABLE 1Ligand binding properties of [125I] iodocyanopindolol to wild-type and mutated β1-AR stably expressed in HEK-293 cellsConstructBmaxKD for ICYPEC50 value for isoproterenol-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclasepmol β1-AR/mgpMμMFLAG-tagged WT β1-AR1.05 ± 0.1221 ± 10.46 ± 0.08FLAG-tagged β1-ARΔPDZ1.2 ± 0.129 ± 20.7 ± 0.1Myc-tagged WT β1-AR1.4 ± 0.324 ± 10.5 ± 0.1Myc-tagged β1-ARΔPDZ0.9 ± 0.1529 ± 20.7 ± 0.1β1-AR-CFP0.8 ± 0.130 ± 21 ± 0.2β1-AR-YFP1.1 ± 0.231 ± 20.8 ± 0.2FLAG-tagged S312D1.85 ± 0.127 ± 20.7 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Antibodies, siRNA, Peptides, and Additional Reagents−The monoclonal antibodies against FLAG (M2) and Myc (9E-10) epitopes were purchased from Sigma and Upstate (Charlottesville, VA), respectively. The antibodies to human AKAP79 and to the various subunits of PKA were from Clontech; anti-human SAP97 monoclonal antibody was from StressGen (VAM-PS005, Nventa Corp., San Jose, CA); anti-SAP97 polyclonal antibody was from Novus Biologicals (NB 600-1229); anti-human β1-AR antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and anti-PSD-95 antibodies (anti-pan-PDZ monoclonal antibody 05-427 directed against the PDZ domain (residues 77-299) of human PSD-95 and anti-PSD-95 antibody 05-494) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The siRNA to AKAP79 5′-AAgagaucagcagaagguagu-3′ and its scrambled control AAggcaacaaaggcuaaguca were described (1.Gardner L.A. Tavalin S.J. Goehring A.S. Scott J.D. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol.

The siRNA sequence to human SAP97, 5′-GATATCCAGGAACATAAAT-3′, or its control, 5′-CCATAATACAAGGTATAA-3′, were cloned into the pSuper™ plasmid (OligoEngine Corp., Seattle, WA).Acid Strip Confocal Recycling Microscopy Protocol−HEK-293 cells expressing the FLAG- or Myc-tagged WT β1-AR or β1-ARΔPDZ were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and serum-starved at 37 °C for 1 h in DMEM supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The receptors were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 IgG (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were treated with 10 μm isoproterenol for 30 min at 37 °C to promote agonist-mediated β1-AR internalization. Then the cells were chilled to stop endocytosis and exposed to 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2 m acetic acid, pH 3.5, for 4 min on ice to remove antibody bound to extracellular β1-AR (1.Gardner L.A. Tavalin S.J.

Cultures were then incubated with culture medium supplemented with 100 μm of the β-antagonist alprenolol at 37 °C for 10, 20, 30, or 45 min to establish the recycle time. After each time period, the coverslips were rinsed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with 4% sucrose in PBS, pH 7.4, for 10 min at room temperature. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed on coded slides using a Zeiss Axiovert LSM 510 (100 × 1.4 DIC oil immersion objective), and the immunocytochemical data were analyzed to determine the recycle time (1.Gardner L.A.

The cells were exposed to 10 μm isoproterenol for 30 min, acid-washed, and then exposed to 100 μm alprenolol for 10, 20, 30, or 45 min. The coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and stained with Cy-3 conjugated to anti-Myc 9E-10 monoclonal antibody and visualized by dual confocal microscopy (YFP, λex = 514 nm, λem = 530LP; Cy3, λex = 543 nm, λem = 560 BP) using the LSM-510 multitracking configuration.FRET Microscopy−Double stable cell lines expressing AKAP79-CFP and β1-AR-YFP or SAP97-CFP and β1-AR-YFP were established. In some cases, HEK-293 cells were transfected with the desired plasmids using the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) for 24-36 h. After transfection, cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-covered coverslips for 24 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, and mounted onto glass slides in Fluoromount G mounting media (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Coverslips were sealed with clear nail polish and imaged using the sensitized emission or the acceptor photobleaching methods described in Gardner et al. (1.Gardner L.A. Tavalin S.J. Goehring A.S. Scott J.D. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33537-33553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After image acquisition, the LSM 510 FRET macro tool was used to calculate FRETN values. FRETN is a measure of FRET that is normalized for the concentrations of donor and acceptor fluorophores and therefore represents a fully corrected measure of FRET (17.Oliveria S.F. Gomez L.L. Dell'Acqua M.L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18.Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levin B. Herman B. Biophys.

In this method the corrected FRET value for each pixel is calculated and then divided by concentration values for donor and acceptor (18.Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levin B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 19.Kenworthy A.K. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 24: 289-296Google Scholar, 20.Nakagawa T. Futai K. Lashuel H.A.

FRETN was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis for the entire image.In addition to FRETN microscopy, we performed acceptor photobleaching FRET microscopy. This method measures changes in the intensity of the donor channel that are observed upon complete photobleaching of the acceptor (YFP) by a 514 nm argon laser (1.Gardner L.A. Tavalin S.J.

From each photobleaching session, an image set consisting of time-lapse recordings of donor and acceptor channel intensities was obtained. FRET was recorded by examining the loss of quenching of CFP during YFP photobleaching, followed by an analysis of these images by the LSM FRET tool version 1.5 (AIM software release 3.2) to calculate the FRET efficiencies using selected area averages for donor CFP before and after bleaching. FRET efficiencies (%) are presented as the means ± S.E. from 3 to 10 separate acquisition experiments on 5-10 images per experiment.Co-immunoprecipitations and Pulldown Assays−Co-immunoprecipitations between FLAG- or Myc-tagged β1-AR, SAP97, AKAP79, or the RII α-subunit of PKA were performed as follows. Cells stably expressing the indicated FLAG-tagged or Myc-tagged β1-AR were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1.Gardner L.A. Tavalin S.J. Goehring A.S. Scott J.D. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33537-33553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the insoluble cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × gav for 15 min at 4 °C. After equalizing protein concentrations across all samples, lysates were added to M2 anti-FLAG- or anti-Myc-agarose beads at 4 °C with gentle rotation for 4 h. Control experiments were performed by incubating lysates with preimmune IgG at the same concentration for 4 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed three times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and eluted from the beads with 40 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing 20 mm dithiothreitol. Resolved proteins and lysate inputs were separated by SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions and electroblotted to nitrocellulose. Identical gels were run and transferred for separate detection of receptor, AKAP79, SAP97, or the RIIα subunit of PKA by Western blotting.Pulldown Assays−The human β1-AR cDNA was digested with SmaI and XhoI to isolate the carboxyl-terminal fragment encoding the amino acids between 425 and 477. This fragment and the corresponding carboxyl-terminal tail fragment of the β2-AR were cloned into the pGEX-4T-2 GST vector (GE Healthcare) and amplified in BL-21 Escherichia coli cells. HEK-293 cells that were transfected either with empty or with myc-SAP97 expressing vector were lysed with in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors. After 16,000 × gav centrifugation of cell lysates, GST orβ1-ARc-tail orβ2-ARc-tail-GST fusion proteins were added to aliquots of the supernatants. Twenty μl of glutathione-agarose beads (50% slurry in H2O) were added after mixing for 30 min at 4 °C. The mixture was mixed for another 2 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with the same lysis buffer, the proteins were eluted from beads with sample buffer (containing 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol). Eluates were separated on a 4-15% gel and analyzed for SAP97 by immunoblotting. Far Western blots were performed to detect the interaction between FLAG-β1-AR (WT and ΔPDZ) and SAP97 according to Hall (21.Hall R.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 261: 167-174PubMed Google Scholar) with a few modifications. In brief, the purified receptor was slot-blotted onto a dry nitrocellulose membrane in a volume of 100 μl (20 μl at a time was added) under vacuum (manifold II). The membrane was wetted in 5 ml of Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 (TBST) and then blocked with TBST containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (TBST-BSA) for 1 h at 22 °C by gentle shaking. Affinity purified Myc-SAP97 was hybridized with the membranes in TBST-BSA for 16 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The membrane was washed five times (5 min each with TBST) and probed with 1:1000 dilution of anti-Myc IgG (9E-10 monoclonal antibody) for 1 h at 22 °C in TBST-BSA. After washing the blot five times with TBST, it was probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) in TBST-BSA for 20 min at room temperature. The blot was washed five times in TBST (5 min each) and then developed using enhanced chemiluminescence.Cyclic AMP Accumulation and Adenylyl Cyclase Assays−HEK-293 cells stably expressing the various β1-AR constructs in 6-well plates were switched to DMEM + 25 mm HEPES for 2 h. Appropriate drugs in DMEM/HEPES, supplemented with 300 μm of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine, were added to the cells for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped, and 1 ml of 0.1 n cold HCl was added followed by freezing of the entire plate in liquid nitrogen. Frozen plates were quickly thawed at 65 °C to break the cells, and the cell extract was lyophilized. The dry pellet was resuspended in assay buffer, and cyclic AMP was quantified by radioimmunoassay (RIANEN Assay System; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For the determination of adenylyl cyclase activity, membranes were prepared from cells without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the activity of adenylyl cyclase in response to increasing concentrations of isoproterenol was determined (14.Delos Santos N.M.

Bahouth S.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 838-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The concentration-response curves to isoproterenol were fitted by nonlinear regression using Prism 4.1 software (GraphPad Corp.) in order to determine the concentration of isoproterenol that generated 50% of the maximal response (EC50) for each β1-AR construct.Adenylyl Cyclase Assays for β-AR Desensitization and Resensitization−HEK-293 cells stably expressing the various β1-AR constructs were divided into four sets. The first and second sets were used as control for desensitization and the third and fourth sets for resensitization assays. Cells for desensitization were exposed to 1 mm ascorbic acid (control) or 10 μm isoproterenol for 10 min at 37 °C and then processed for the preparation of membranes. The third set was used as the control for resensitization and the fourth set for resensitization assays. Cells for resensitization were exposed either to 1 mm ascorbic acid (control) or to 10 μm isoproterenol for 3 h at 37 °C and then incubated with 100 μm alprenolol for 1.5 h at 37 °C, followed by the preparation of membranes. Adenylyl cyclase activities in these membranes were determined (14.Delos Santos N.M. Gardner L.A. White S.B. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 838-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and the Kact ± S.E. for each β1-AR was calculated using the Prism 4 program, and statistical comparisons were analyzed using Prism 4 and Instat programs (GraphPad Corp.).Phosphorylation and Phosphopeptide Mapping of the β1-AR−To determine the effect of disrupting the β1-AR PDZ or down-regulation of SAP97 on isoproterenol-mediated phosphorylation of the β1-AR, HEK-293 cells expressing the WT β1-AR were transfected with the SAP97 siRNA vector or its scrambled control. On the day of the experiment, the ATP pools were labeled with 200 μCi of 32PO4/ml for 1.5 h, and the cells were stimulated with either 1 mm ascorbic acid or 10 μm isoproterenol in 1 mm ascorbic acid for 10 min at 37 °C. After cell lysis, equivalent amounts of proteins in each supernatant were incubated with M2 anti-FLAG-agarose beads at 4 °C for 5 h. The resins were washed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and the eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose, and amounts of 32P incorporated into the β1-AR were determined by electronic counting with Packard Instantimager™. The bands corresponding to phosphorylated β1-AR protein on the filter were cut out and submerged in 70% (v/v) formic acid containing 100 mg per ml of cyanogen bromide (Science Lab Chemicals, Kingswood, TX) for 1.5 h at room temperature (1.Gardner L.A.

At the end of the digestion, the samples were lyophilized and dissolved in Tricine sample buffer. Then 5 μl from each sample was spotted onto a GF/C filter pre-moistened with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The filters were mounted on a filtration manifold and washed three times with 5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid to remove the free 32P. After drying, the counts/min of 32P/filter were determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Equal counts/min (1,200 ± 50) of 32P were loaded per lane and subjected to electrophoresis on 16% acrylamide gels in Tricine cathode buffer. At the end of the run the gel was electroblotted to nitrocellulose, and the filters were counted by the Instantimager™ and then exposed to an x-ray film overnight.Biotinylation Assay of β1-AR Recycling with Cleavable Biotin−Cells expressing the WT β1-AR with siRNA to SAP97 or its control were surface-biotinylated with 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHSSS-biotin (Pierce) in Hanks’ balanced salt solution with Ca2+ and Mg2+ at 4 °C (1.Gardner L.A.

Currently, it is based on repeated administration of allergen extracts. To improve the safety and efficacy of allergen extract-based immunotherapy, application of hypoallergens, i.e. modified allergens with reduced IgE binding capacity but retained T-cell reactivity, has been proposed. It may, however, be difficult to predict how to modify an allergen to create a hypoallergen. Directed molecular evolution by DNA shuffling and screening provides a means by which to evolve proteins having novel or improved functional properties without knowledge of structure-function relationships of the target molecules. With the aim to generate hypoallergens we applied multigene DNA shuffling on three group 2 dust mite allergen genes, two isoforms of Lep d 2 and Gly d 2. DNA shuffling yielded a library of genes from which encoded shuffled allergens were expressed and screened. A positive selection was made for full-length, high-expressing clones, and screening for low binding to IgE from mite allergic patients was performed using an IgE bead-based binding assay. Nine selected shuffled allergens revealed 80-fold reduced to completely abolished IgE binding compared with the parental allergens in IgE binding competition experiments. Two hypoallergen candidates stimulated allergen-specific T-cell proliferation and cytokine production at comparable levels as the wild-type allergens in patient peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures. The two candidates also induced blocking Lep d 2-specific IgG antibodies in immunized mice. We conclude that directed molecular evolution is a powerful approach to generate hypoallergens for potential use in allergen-specific immunotherapy.

We conclude that directed molecular evolution is a powerful approach to generate hypoallergens for potential use in allergen-specific immunotherapy. The large increase in allergic diseases observed during the past decades has urged the development of safe and efficient treatments of allergy. Many new concepts based on targeting the underlying immunological causes of IgE-mediated allergy have been suggested (1Spiegelberg H.L. Horner A.A. Takabayashi K. Raz E. Curr. Opin. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 2: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 2Robinson D.S. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2003; 36: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 3Till S.J. Francis J.N.

However, the only treatment that causes a long-lasting relief of symptoms is allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT). 3The abbreviations used are: ASIT, allergen-specific immunotherapy; HTP, high-throughput; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PPD, tuberculin-purified protein derivate; SI, stimulation index; TT, tetanus toxoid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin. Today ASIT is based on the repeated administration of allergen extracts prepared from the allergen source. Although successful clinical outcomes are well documented, several problems are associated with allergen extract-based ASIT, including the risk of inducing local and systemic side effects and induction of new sensitizations (6Ball T. Sperr W.R. Valent P. Lidholm J. Spitzauer S. Ebner C. Kraft D. Valenta R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2026-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7Moverare R. Elfman L. Vesterinen E. Metso T. Haahtela T. Allergy. 2002; 57: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Large batches of well defined single allergen components can be produced using recombinant techniques, making it feasible to solve problems linked to allergen extract-based ASIT. The most severe side effects of ASIT are caused by the binding of injected allergen to allergen-specific IgE on high affinity FcϵRI receptor-bearing effector cells, leading to cross-linking of the FcϵRI receptors, degranulation, and release of anaphylactogenic mediators. Therefore, allergens with reduced IgE binding capacity have been proposed to improve the safety of ASIT (8Akdis C.A. Blaser K.

Recently birch pollen allergic patients were treated with such hypoallergenic molecules for the first time (10Niederberger V. Horak F. Vrtala S. Spitzauer S. Krauth M.T. Valent P. Reisinger J.

The most straightforward approach is to target specific IgE-binding B-cell epitopes and disrupt them by site-directed mutagenesis (11Beezhold D.H. Hickey V.L. Sussman G.L. J. Allergy Clin.

However, this requires knowledge of the most important IgE epitopes, which is seldom available. Another problem is that even when B-cell epitopes of an allergen have been thoroughly analyzed, mutations at the critical sites do not necessarily lead to reduced IgE reactivity in all patients (16Neudecker P.

These approaches have proven successful for many allergens, but it is often difficult to predict modifications that result in hypoallergenic properties while retaining proper conformational structure and T-cell epitopes that are important for induction of allergen-specific IgG. Directed molecular evolution by DNA shuffling and screening offers a way of introducing a desired property to a protein without detailed structural or functional knowledge of the protein (26Stemmer W.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar, 27Stemmer W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 28Crameri A. Raillard S.A. Bermudez E. Stemmer W.P. Nature. 1998; 391: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). These techniques enable the generation of large libraries of genes from which encoded proteins can be selected on the basis of acquisition or improvement of a certain quality. In a common format, DNA from two or more homologous genes are fragmented and then reassembled by primerless PCR resulting in a large pool of chimeric genes. The variants in the resulting library are then screened for candidate genes with a given biochemical or structural property, often based upon functional assays. To improve a desired property, multiple rounds of DNA shuffling and screening may be carried out to select highly improved variants of the starting genes (29Punnonen J. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2000; 121: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This approach has previously been successfully applied on, for example, cytokines, antibodies, co-stimulatory molecules, promoters, viruses, and viral antigens (30Chang C.C. Chen T.T. Cox B.W.

Given the difficulties in predicting how to construct hypoallergens, directed molecular evolution provides promising approaches to create modified allergens for use in ASIT (29Punnonen J. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2000; 121: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study we applied multigene recombination to three group 2 mite allergen genes, two isoforms of the major allergen from the dust mite Lepidoglyphus destructor, Lep d 2 (36Schmidt M. Olsson S. van der Ploeg I. van Hage-Hamsten M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and a group 2 allergen from the related dust mite Glycyphagus domesticus, Gly d 2 (37Gafvelin G. Johansson E. Lundin A. Smith A.M. Chapman M.D. Benjamin D.C. Derewenda U. van Hage-Hamsten M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 107: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The two Lep d 2 isoforms, Lep d 2.01 and Lep d 2.02, share 89.6% identity at the amino acid level and Gly d 2 share 79.2% identity with Lep d 2.01 and 78.4% with Lep d 2.02. Thus, these three dust mite group 2 allergens are well suited as model genes to test the concept of directed molecular evolution for generating hypoallergens. Sera and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC)— Blood samples were drawn from eight patients who had earlier participated in a study on storage mite allergy (38Kronqvist M. Johansson E. Pershagen G. Johansson S.G. van Hage-Hamsten M. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1999; 29: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). They all had IgE to Lep d 2 (39Johansson E. Eriksson T.L. Olsson S. Kronqvist M. Whitley P. Johansson S.G. Gafvelin G. van Hage-Hamsten M. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1999; 120: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and positive skin prick tests to recombinant (r) Lep d 2.01 (40Kronqvist M. Johansson E. Magnusson C.G. Olsson S. Eriksson T.L. Gafvelin G. van Hage-Hamsten Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2000; 30: 670-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ImmunoCAP values for L. destructor (Pharmacia CAP System, Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden) ranged between 0.35–12.6 kUA/liter, median 2.1 kUA/liter. In addition, all eight patients had been shown to respond to rLep d 2 in lymphoproliferation tests (41Eriksson T.L. Gafvelin G. Elfman L.H. Johansson C. Van Hage-Hamsten M. Olsson S. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2001; 31: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PBMC from seven of these patients were prepared by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) gradient centrifugation as earlier described (41Eriksson T.L. Gafvelin G. Elfman L.H. Johansson C. Van Hage-Hamsten M. Olsson S. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2001; 31: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The PBMCs were frozen at 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen), 50% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), initially 1 °C/min in freezing containers (Nalgene Cryo 1o, Nalge Company) to -80 °C and then transferred to -150 °C where the cells were stored until use. A serum pool was prepared for screening, consisting of sera from all eight patients, and a ninth patient (27.8 kUA/liter to L. destructor and positive to rLep d 2 in immunoblotting). The study was approved by the regional ethics committee at the Karolinska Institute, and informed consent was given by each patient. Animals—Female AJ mice (12 weeks of age) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed with food and water ad libitum. The experiments were approved by the Swedish local ethics committee for animal welfare (N348/05). DNA Shuffling of Allergen Genes—DNA encoding the two isoforms of Lep d 2, Lep d 2.01, and Lep d 2.02 (36Schmidt M. Olsson S. van der Ploeg I. van Hage-Hamsten M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and Gly d 2 (37Gafvelin G. Johansson E. Lundin A. Smith A.M. Chapman M.D. Benjamin D.C. Derewenda U. van Hage-Hamsten M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 107: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) served as templates for the DNA shuffling of Group 2 mite allergens. The allergen genes were originally cloned into pET vectors (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) including His6 tag-encoding sequences at the 3′-ends. The three allergen genes were subsequently cloned into the lac promoter construct pCK200P comprising a pelB leader fused to the N terminus of the allergen inserts and a His6 tag at the C terminus. A chimeric construct was made, which carries the first 20 codons of Gly d 2 and codons 21–125 of Lep d 2.01. The resulting chimeric gene was shuffled with full-length Lep d 2.02 and Gly d 2 genes using multigene recombination as previously described (28Crameri A. Raillard S.A. Bermudez E. Stemmer W.P. Nature. 1998; 391: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 30Chang C.C. Chen T.T. Cox B.W. Dawes G.N. Stemmer W.P. Punnonen J. Patten P.A. Nat.

A. 2003; 100: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The shuffled library of DNA inserts was cloned into pCK200P. Parental constructs and selected clones were sequenced on an ABI DNA sequencer (ABI, Foster City, CA). Protein Expression and Purification—Escherichia coli harboring pCK200P containing wild-type allergens or shuffled clones were induced to express soluble protein. Briefly, overnight cultures grown at 37 °C in 2× YT medium with chloramphenicol (100 μg/ml) were diluted 5-fold into fresh 2× YT, chloramphenicol 100 μg/ml, soluble protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 22 °C, and bacteria were grown for 4 h with vigorous shaking. The cells were pelleted, and soluble proteins were released from the periplasm by incubation with lysozyme and DNase I. Cells, cellular debris, and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation and filtration in a Steriflip® filtration device (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Recombinant proteins in the soluble extracts were purified on cobalt-Sepharose (Talon®, Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Wild-type genes and shuffled inserts were also cloned into vector pCK700i, a lac promoter construct for cytoplasmic expression, which lacks a leader sequence at the N terminus and carries a His6 tag at the C terminus. Recombinant proteins were induced at 37 °C, cells lysed as above, and the insoluble fraction dissolved in extraction buffer (8 m urea, 25 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl). Extracts were loaded on nickel-Sepharose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), washed with extraction buffer, and eluted in extraction buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Fractions were diluted 10-fold in PBS and refolded overnight at 4 °C. Proteins were dialyzed in PBS, clarified by centrifugation, and passed over a Detoxi-gel® endotoxin removal column (Pierce). The endotoxin levels were analyzed using a Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Endochrome assay (Charles River Endosafe, Charleston, SC). High Throughput (HTP) Expression—For HTP screening, E. coli harboring the plasmid were picked with a Q-BOT robotic colony picker (Genetix Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY) into 96-deep well plates containing 800 μl of 2× YT, chloramphenicol 100 μg/ml per well, and grown at 37 °C. Overnight cultures were diluted 10-fold into fresh 2× YT, chloramphenicol 100 μg/ml, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and soluble protein expression was induced at 22 °C and grown for 4 h with vigorous shaking. The cells were pelleted, and soluble proteins were released from the periplasm by incubation with lysozyme. Cells, cellular debris, and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation, and filtration of the soluble material through a Multiscreen® 96-well filter plate (Millipore). Protein Quantification in Crude Lysates—The quantity of soluble, recombinant protein in crude extracts from HTP expression was indirectly estimated using a competitive immunoassay that detects the His6 tag on each protein. Briefly, a previously determined optimal concentration of biotinylated His6 peptide was preincubated with crude extracts for 30 min. A previously determined optimal quantity of anti-His6 antibody-HRP conjugate (Serotec, Raleigh, NC) was added and incubated for 45 min. The mixture was transferred to streptavidin-coated microtiter plates (Sigma) and incubated for 15 min. Following six washes with phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4/0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), the captured complex was detected with Supersignal® chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and read on a Luminskan Ascent plate reader (Thermo Electron, Waltham, MA). Increasing amounts of purified His6-tagged rLep d 2.02 were added to compete with the peptide for binding by the antibody, to prevent the capture of the antibody-HRP conjugate to the plate and to calibrate the competition assay with a standard curve of known protein concentrations. For HTP screening, 100 μl of soluble, crude lysate from cells expressing rLep d 2.02 or shuffled allergens were preincubated with a fixed concentration of biotinylated peptide, and the assay was performed as described above. In addition, each 96-well plate in the HTP screening carried a standard curve of purified His6-tagged rLep d 2.02 for comparison. IgE Bead-based Binding Assay—Purified rLep d 2.02 was biotinylated using Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions and purified by gel filtration. Mouse monoclonal anti-human IgE-antibodies (Accurate Chemical, Westbury, NY) were cross-linked to 4.5 micron-activated magnetic beads (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Beads were blocked with bovine serum albumin and then incubated with a serum pool of sera from nine patients with storage mite allergy (as described above). Beads were washed five times with PBS-T to remove nonspecifically bound serum proteins and other antibody isotypes. The resulting “IgE beads” were incubated with a fixed concentration of biotinylated rLep d 2.02 for 1 h in 96-well round bottom plates, washed on a magnetic plate washer, incubated with streptavidin HRP (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) for 15 min, and washed on a plate washer. The captured allergen was detected with Supersignal® chemiluminescent substrate and read on a Luminskan Ascent plate reader (Thermo Electron). Increasing concentrations of purified rLep d 2.02 (not biotinylated) were preincubated with a fixed concentration of biotinylated rLep d 2.02 to compete for binding to IgE beads and to generate a standard curve reflecting the maximum IgE binding of the wild-type Lep d 2.02. HTP screening was performed on crude lysates of cells expressing wild-type rLep d 2.02 or shuffled allergens as described above. For characterization of shuffled proteins, the pattern of IgE binding over a large concentration range was performed and compared with wild-type rLep d 2.02. Purified shuffled allergens or wild-type rLep d 2.02 were diluted 5-fold starting at 80–120 μg/ml, preincubated with a fixed concentration of biotinylated rLep d 2.02, and assayed as described above. Lymphoproliferation Assay—Lymphoproliferation of PBMCs was assayed by incorporation of [3H]thymidine essentially as previously described (41Eriksson T.L. Gafvelin G. Elfman L.H. Johansson C. Van Hage-Hamsten M. Olsson S. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2001; 31: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cells were thawed, and 2 × 105 cells in 200 μl (>90% viability, as determined by trypan blue exclusion) were cultured per well in 96-well flat-bottomed plates (Falcon®, Becton Dickinson) in complete RPMI (cRPMI) consisting of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine growth serum (HyClone), gentamicin (25 μg/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 international units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml; all from Invitrogen), and 2-mercaptoethanol (20 μm; Kebo-lab, Spånga, Sweden). Cells from each of seven donors were stimulated for 7 days with two concentrations (1 and 10 μg/ml) of rLep d 2.01, rLep d 2.02, rGly d 2, rGly d 2-Lep d 2 fusion protein, nine expressed shuffled allergens (L4 (cytoplasmic and periplasmic protein), L1, L2, L3, R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5) and as positive controls with 10 μg/ml tetanus toxoid (TT, Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen, Denmark), 1 μg/ml tuberculin-purified protein derivate (PPD, Statens Seruminstitut), or 1 μg/ml phytohemeagglutinin (PHA, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.; 3 days stimulation) with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well, Amersham Biosciences) present during the last 18 h of culture. Stimulation index (SI) was calculated as mean (of triplicates) cpm for antigen-stimulated PBMC divided by mean cpm for nonstimulated PBMC cultured in medium alone. Presented are the highest SI values obtained, regardless of the stimulating antigen concentration used. Cytokine Analysis—Stimulation of cytokine production was analyzed in long term PBMC cultures essentially as earlier described (41Eriksson T.L. Gafvelin G. Elfman L.H. Johansson C. Van Hage-Hamsten M. Olsson S. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2001; 31: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml rLep d 2.01, rLep d 2.02, shufflant L4 (cytoplasmic and periplasmic fraction), R2, TT, PPD (1 μg/ml), or left unstimulated in cRPMI only. After 5 and 8 days of culture, interleukin 2 (IL-2, 20 units/ml; Proleukin, Chiron, Emeryville, CA) was added and at day 12, cell supernatants were collected for cytokine measurements by ELISA (Diaclone, Besançon, France). Interferon γ (IFN-γ), IL-5, and IL-13 were measured, and the detection limits for the assays were 12.5, 7.8, and 3.2 pg/ml, respectively. Immunization of Mice—Female AJ mice were immunized in groups of 8–9, with either 10 μg of the wild-type rLep d 2.01, or 10 μg of one of the two shuffled allergens L4 (periplasmic) or R2 (adsorbed to 1 mg of aluminum hydroxide hydrate, Sigma-Aldrich). Control mice were immunized with PBS and aluminum hydroxide hydrate only. Three injections were administered intraperitoneally every 2 weeks. One week after the last immunization (day 35), mice were sacrificed, and blood was drawn by cardiac puncture. Sera were collected and stored at -20 °C until analysis. Detection of Allergen-specific Mouse Antibodies—Immunoglobulin G1(IgG1) and IgG2a antibodies to rLep d 2.01 or rGly d 2 was analyzed in the mouse serum samples by ELISA (42Parvaneh S. Johansson E. Elfman L.H. van Hage-Hamsten M. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2002; 32: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In brief, 96-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 5 μg/ml rLep d 2.01 or rGly d 2 in 0.1 m carbonate buffer pH 9.6 at 4 °C overnight. To reduce nonspecific binding, plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The mouse sera were diluted 1:5000 for IgG1- and 1:1000 for IgG2a-detection and added to plates for 1 h. IgG1-levels were detected with a rat anti-mouse IgG1 (BD Biosciences) diluted 1:1000, and a biotinylated rabbit anti-rat IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:2000 followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:3000. IgG2a-levels were detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2a (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) diluted 1:4000. Phosphatase substrate (Sigma) was used as substrate, and the color reaction was monitored at 405 nm. Blocking Capacity of Mouse Sera—The blocking capacity of the sera from immunized mice was investigated using inhibition ELISA. Plates were coated as for the direct ELISA described above. The mouse sera were diluted 1:100, 1:1000, and 1:10000 and added to rLep d 2.01 or rGly d 2-coated plates for 1 h. A pool of human sera from eight patients allergic to L. destructor or serum from a single patient having high levels of IgE to L. destructor (27.8 kUA/liter) was used to te"
https://openalex.org/W2060297364,"We have determined the activity of all ARSs on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VI as chromosomal replication origins in premeiotic S-phase by neutral/neutral two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The comparison of origin activity of each origin in mitotic and premeiotic S-phase showed that one of the most efficient origins in mitotic S-phase, ARS605, was completely inhibited in premeiotic S-phase. ARS605 is located within the open reading frame of MSH4 gene that is transcribed specifically during an early stage of meiosis. Systematic analysis of relationships between MSH4 transcription and ARS605 origin activity revealed that transcription of MSH4 inhibited the ARS605 origin activity by removing origin recognition complex from ARS605. Deletion of UME6, a transcription factor responsible for repressing MSH4 during mitotic S-phase, resulted in inactivation of ARS605 in mitosis. Our finding is the first demonstration that the transcriptional regulation on the replication origin activity is related to changes in cell physiology. These results may provide insights into changes in replication origin activity in embryonic cell cycle during early developmental stages.

These results may provide insights into changes in replication origin activity in embryonic cell cycle during early developmental stages. Eukaryotic chromosomes consist of multiple replication units. Each origin of DNA replication is strictly controlled to fire only once in the cell cycle in the fixed sequential order (1.Friedman K.L. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 2.Yamashita M. Hori Y. Shinomiya T. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Shirahige K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This temporal program for origin firing is utilized for the maintenance of genome integrity through DNA replication checkpoint mechanism (3.Shirahige K. Hori Y. Shiraishi K. Yamashita M. Takahashi K. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Nature. 1998; 395: 618-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 4.Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). It was shown that a checkpoint effector kinase Rad53 repressed firing of late origins when replication was perturbed by hydroxy urea or methyl methane sulfonate. Furthermore, recent genome-wide studies of eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication using Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided us with a kinetic map of progression of DNA replication along the chromosome (5.Raghuraman M.K. Winzeler E.A. Collingwood D. Hunt S. Wodicka L. Conway A. Lockhart D.J. Davis R.W. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Science. 2001; 294: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 6.Katou Y. Kanoh Y.

However, these studies were restricted to DNA replication during mitotic cell cycle and little is known about how these multiple replication origins behave under different cell cycle, i.e. meiotic cell cycle. The decision to enter the meiotic cell cycle is made in G1 phase and this affects the way in which the G1/S transition is controlled. In budding yeast (S. cerevisiae), poor nutrient conditions are the cue to embark on the meiotic cell cycle, which culminates in the production of spores (7.Kupiec M. Byers B. Esposito R.E. Mitchell A.P. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces.Vol. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 889-1036Google Scholar). The replication of chromosome is the first detectable cytological event in meiosis. The coordinated synthesis of genomic DNA requires multiple levels of regulation and a large number of gene products. Genetic analysis in S. cerevisiae indicates that the replicative machinery used to synthesize DNA in vegetative cells is also required for the duplication of chromosome in meiosis (8.Budd M.E. Wittrup K.D. Bailey J.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9.Murakami H. Nurse P. Nat.

Cell. 2004; 15: 2230-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, mitotic S-phase and premeiotic S-phase appear to be differently regulated. For example, premeiotic S-phase is 1.5–2 times longer than mitotic S-phase (11.Collins I. Newlon C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3524-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, replication kinetics as measured by neutral/neutral two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of 100-kb segment of chromosome III of S. cerevisiae in premeiotic S-phase are similar to those measured in mitotic S-phase (12.Williamson D.H. Johnston L.H. Fennell D.J. Simchen G. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 145: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the same study showed that DNA replication of chromosome III initiates at the same origins in meiosis and mitosis. These two conflicting results should be resolved by studying replication of chromosomes other than chromosome III. Several lines of evidence suggest that premeiotic DNA replication links to the initiation of meiotic recombination events. Borde et al. (13.Borde V. Goldman A.S. Lichten M. Science. 2000; 290: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) showed that delaying the replication of a chromosome segment specifically delays the formation of the break at that segment. Cha et al. (14.Cha R.S. Weiner B.M. Keeney S. Dekker J. Kleckner N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 493-503PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Spo11, which is required for interhomolog interaction, and Rec8, a meiosis-specific cohesin subunit, are negative and positive regulators for the progression of premeiotic S-phase, respectively. These results suggest that there are many other possible regulations of replication at each chromosomal level that affect the progression of S-phase in meiotic cell cycle. The chromosome VI of S. cerevisiae is 270 kb in length and the best-characterized chromosome for replicon structure in mitotic cell cycle. It contains ten ARSs, ARS601–609, of which nine ARSs are active as replication origins that comprise five active replicons in mitotic S-phase (1.Friedman K.L. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 2.Yamashita M. Hori Y. Shinomiya T. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Shirahige K.

Thus, three origins (ARS605, 606, and 607) are used in high frequency, four (ARS601/2, 603, 603.5, and 609) are in intermediate frequency, and two (ARS604 and 608) are in low frequency, less than 5% of cell cycles. Replication of each arm of chromosome starts from one major origin (ARS605 and 607 on the left and the right arm, respectively) and extends sequentially in both directions (1.Friedman K.L. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 2.Yamashita M. Hori Y. Shinomiya T. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Shirahige K.

The aim of this study is to determine the replicon structure of the chromosome VI of S. cerevisiae in the premeiotic S-phase and to understand the difference from that of the S-phase replicon at molecular level. Interestingly, we found that activity of one origin ARS605, an efficient origin during mitotic cell cycle, was completely inhibited during premeiotic S-phase. As ARS605 resides within the open reading frame (ORF) 2The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; HA, hemagglutinin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; SPM, sporulation medium; N/N two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, neutral/neutral two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis; RT, reverse transcriptase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; WCE, whole cell extract; ARS, autonomously replicating sequence; ORC, origin recognition complex. of a meiosis-specific gene, MSH4, we tested the possibility that ARS605 was inhibited by transcription. We found that transcription of MSH4 by RNA polymerase II removed ORC from ARS605 during premeiotic S-phase. This is the first demonstration of origin inactivation by transcription that changes depending on the physiology of the cell.

In short, a single colony from the YPG (3% glycerol, 2% Bacto peptone, 1% yeast extract) plate was inoculated into 5 ml of SPS presporulation medium (0.5% yeast extract, 1% Bacto peptone, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate and amino acids, 0.05 m potassium phthalate, 1% potassium acetate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, pH 5.0), and cells were cultured at 30 °C overnight. Small amounts of the preculture suspension were then inoculated into 0.5 liter of SPS, and cells were cultured at 30 °C to a density of 4–7 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice in sterile water and were inoculated into 1 liter of SPM (sporulation medium) (1% potassium acetate, 0.001% polypropylene glycol 2000 in 5-liter flasks), and cells were cultured at 30 °C with vigorous aeration. FACS (Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter)−The flow cytometric determination of cellular DNA content was performed on FACS calibur (BD Biosciences) as described previously (21.Epstein C.B. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). For each histogram, 25,000 cells were analyzed. Neutral/neutral (N/N) Two-dimensional Agarose Gel Electrophoresis−Mitotic cells were grown to 3 × 107 cells/ml at 30 °C in YPD and then mixed with an equal volume of the toluene stop solution (95% EtOH, 3% toluene, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5), and meiotic cells were taken every 15 min from 60–225 min after cells were transferred to SPM and pooled them. Samples for N/N two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were prepared as described previously (22.Hori Y. Shirahige K. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and N/N two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out by the method of Brewer and Fangman (23.Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)−Mitotic cells were grown to 1 × 107 cells/ml at 23 °C in 100 ml of YPD and then fixed with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min. Synchronous cultures induced for meiosis were withdrawn every 1 h at 0–5 h and fixed in the same way. Orc1-tagged strains undergo meiosis normally. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out essentially as described previously (18.Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Four primer sets that cover ARS605, ARS607, ARS1, and a region 4 kb away from ARS1 (non-ARS) were designed to analyze Orc1 association at these regions semi-quantitatively by PCR. Primer sets were as follows: ARS607 5′-GACTTACACATTATTCGGC and 5′-TTCTCTCGTTATTATTGGTTCG (279 bp); ARS605 5′-AGTGCGTCTTTCAATGAC and 5′-CCGTCAGAGGTTTAGAAC (323 bp); ARS1 5′-TGGTGTTGATGTAAGCGGAG and 5′-AAAGTCAACCCCCTGCGATG (270 bp); non-ARS 5′-AGTGCCCTAGAAGGTGCTAC and 5′-GGAAACACCACCGGCAAACT (228 bp). Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR−Total RNA was extracted from yeast cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed using the TaKaRa RNA PCR kit (AMV) version 3.0 (TaKaRa) by following the manufacturer’s instructions. Regions of MSH4 and ACT1, cDNAs were amplified using the following primer sets: MSH4 5′-TTGGCAGTAACTGAACATTTAC and 5′-CGCTACAAGATTGTGTATTC (359 bp); ACT1 5′-TGTTTTGGGTTTGGAATCTG and 5′-CCACTTTCGTCGTATTCTTG (302 bp). Origin Activities of ARSs on Chromosome VI in Premeiotic S-phase−Fig. 1, A and B show S. cerevisiae cell growth during the transfer from mitotic to meiotic cell cycle. In response to nitrogen starvation, mitotic cells enter the meiotic cell cycle synchronously at the point in G1 phase called “Start” to undergo premeiotic DNA synthesis, which is followed by recombination, twice of chromosome division and finally spore formation. To determine the period of the premeiotic S-phase precisely, we assessed the progression of meiotic cell cycle by FACS and by microscopic observation of nuclear division. We used the SK1 strain as a wild type because of its efficient sporulation properties compared with other strains (24.Williams R.M. Primig M. Washburn B.K. Winzeler E.A. Bellis M. Sarrauste de Menthiere C. Davis R.W. Esposito R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13431-13436Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We determined that 90% of cells entered premeiotic S-phase between 1–2 h and finished around 4–5 h after induction, judging from the FACS profile and kinetics of meiotic divisions (Fig. 1A). The spore formation rate reached 99% (Fig. 1B) 10 h after induction, suggesting that DNA synthesis observed by FACS indeed occurred in the premeiotic S-phase. To determine the activity of 10 ARSs on chromosome VI as replication origins, we pooled cells every 15 min from 1–4 h after the induction of sporulation and performed the N/N two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1C). Because the SK1 strain is genetically distant from the S288C strain, the genomic sequence of which has been determined (24.Williams R.M. Primig M. Washburn B.K. Winzeler E.A. Bellis M. Sarrauste de Menthiere C. Davis R.W. Esposito R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13431-13436Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); we newly measured the activity of all ARS during mitotic growth in the SK1 and compared with that of the premeiotic S-phase. Origin activity of nine ARSs in the SK1 is almost same as that of W303 and S288C (2.Yamashita M. Hori Y. Shinomiya T. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Shirahige K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). One exception was that we did not detect the restriction fragment corresponding to ARS601/2, a weak late, firing origin in other two strains. This may be because of a DNA sequence polymorphism between the SK1 and S288C strains. The activity of origins was similar between the mitotic and premeiotic S-phase except for ARS605 (Fig. 1C). The strong bubble arc detected in the ARS605 region in the mitotic S-phase completely disappeared in the premeiotic S-phase. This result indicated that ARS605 was inactivated in the premeiotic S-phase. ARS605 is located within the ORF of MSH4 (a MutS homolog) and transcribed in early meiosis (25.Chu S. DeRisi J. Eisen M. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Herskowitz I. Science. 1998; 282: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 26.Ross-Macdonald P. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1069-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We assumed that the loss of ARS605 activity was because of the MSH4 transcription because it is known that transcription from a strong galactose inducible promoter interferes with origin functions on plasmid (27.Snyder M. Sapolsky R.J. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2184-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Transcription of MSH4 Interferes with Origin Activity of ARS605 in Meiosis−To confirm our hypothesis, we examined the relationships between MSH4 transcription and ARS605 origin activity in the premeiotic S-phase (Fig. 2). The transcription of MSH4 was induced at between one and two hours and reached the level of 10-fold of time 0 at three hours after the induction of meiosis, which is in good agreement with the previous data (24.Williams R.M. Primig M. Washburn B.K. Winzeler E.A. Bellis M. Sarrauste de Menthiere C. Davis R.W. Esposito R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13431-13436Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The level of MSH4 transcripts at 3 h was maintained at the same level up to 5 h (data not shown), suggesting that MSH4 was transcribed actively during the premeiotic S-phase. It was reported previously that the origin function of an ARS1 was inactivated by strong transcription that run through it (27.Snyder M. Sapolsky R.J. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2184-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear how the origin function is actually perturbed by transcription at the molecular level. One possible mechanism of inactivation of ARS605 is that transcription disturbs the assembly of prereplication complex, which is the binding of ORC and mini-chromosome maintenance complexes to DNA sequence of the ARS. We therefore examined whether the ORC binding was affected by transcription using the conventional ChIP method (18.Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Three primer sets that cover ARS605, ARS607, and a region 4 kb away from ARS1 (non-ARS) were designed. We examined the binding of Orc1, the largest subunit of ORC, during the premeiotic S-phase. Fig. 2B shows that binding of Orc1 to ARS605 was comparable to ARS607 until 1.5 h after the induction but decreased gradually starting from 2 h and reached one tenth of the binding level to ARS607 by 4 h. We further confirmed the decreased binding of Orc1 to ARS605, using ARS1 as a positive control (Fig. 2C) because ARS1 was an active origin in the premeiotic S-phase (28.Hollingsworth R.E. Sclafani Jr., R.A. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The decrease in Orc1 binding to ARS605 paralleled negatively with the increase in the transcription of MSH4, suggesting strongly that the removal of Orc1 by transcription had disrupted the origin function of ARS605. Transcription of MSH4 Interferes with Origin Activity of ARS605 in Mitosis−Induction of the early meiosis-specific gene family including MSH4 is dependent on the transcription factors Ime1 and Ume6 (29.Washburn B.K. Esposito R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2057-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In an ume6 deletion mutant, early meiosis-specific genes are derepressed during vegetative growth (24.Williams R.M. Primig M. Washburn B.K. Winzeler E.A. Bellis M. Sarrauste de Menthiere C. Davis R.W. Esposito R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13431-13436Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29.Washburn B.K. Esposito R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2057-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore we further confirmed the relationships between MSH4 transcription and ARS605 origin activity by introducing a deletion mutation of ume6 to the cell. We assumed that derepression of MSH4 transcription by the ume6 mutation would inhibit ARS605 activity even in the mitotic S-phase. Fig. 3A shows that MSH4 was transcribed at the level comparable to that in the meiosis in the absence of the ume6 function. As expected, N/N two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that activity of ARS605 as indicated by bubble arc disappeared completely in the ume6 deletion mutant during mitotic cell cycle (Fig. 3B). The binding of Orc1 to ARS605 was reduced and hardly detectable by ChIP analysis (Fig. 3C). These results confirm that MSH4 transcription interferes with ARS605 activity by removing ORC from its binding site. Mutation in RNA Polymerase II Can Restore Origin Activity−To investigate whether or not the removal of ORC from the origin, ARS605, was because of the actual elongation of transcription through it, we have examined the effect of a temperature sensitive mutation of RNA polymerase II, rpb1-1 (30.Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 5: 1602-1611Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar), on the derepression of MSH4 transcription by ume6 deletion mutation. Surprisingly, the MSH4 transcription in Δume6 mutant cells in the mitotic phase was reduced by the introduction of rpb1-1 even at permissive temperatures (Fig. 3A). Therefore we analyzed the ARS605 activity in a Δume6/rpb1-1 double mutant at permissive temperatures and found that the origin activity of ARS605 was recovered (Fig. 3B). The Orc1 binding to ARS605 was also restored under the same condition (Fig. 3C). These results indicated that the inactivation of the replication origin was caused by the removal of ORC from its binding site, possibly by collision with RNA poymerase II. Through the chromosome-wide investigation of replicon dynamics during the mitotic and premeiotic S-phase, we found that the activity of an efficient origin in the mitotic S-phase, ARS605, was completely lost in the premeiotic S-phase (Fig. 1C). The inhibition was correlated with the induction of transcription of a meiosis-specific gene MSH4 after the onset of presporulation cell growth (Fig. 2). We have also demonstrated that Orc1 binding to ARS605 origin was reduced specifically in parallel with the increase in MSH4 transcription. Because ARS605 is located within the ORF of MSH4, we tested the possibility that the origin activity is inversely correlated with the transcription that runs through the origin region and removes ORC complex that is essential for the origin activity. As expected, the activity of ARS605 was completely dependent on the UME6 gene function that regulated MSH4 negatively during mitotic cell and positively during meiotic cell cycle (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we showed that RNA polymerase was required for the origin inactivation (Fig. 3). A similar result has been reported by an artificial system, where the gal promoter fused to ARS1 does abolish origin activity when transcription is induced by galactose, although no molecular mechanism is indicated (27.Snyder M. Sapolsky R.J. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2184-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated clearly that replication origin activity was negatively regulated through transcription, which interfered the binding of ORC complex to the replication origin either directly by running of RNA polymerase or indirectly by transcription-associated events like changes in DNA topology or chromatin structure. Based on these results, we propose a model for the inactivation of ARS activity by transcription (Fig. 4). Previous studies have shown that the length of S-phase is different between the mitotic and meiotic cell cycle, whereas elongation rate of replication as well as initiation activity of all ARS on the chromosome III is invariable between the two cell cycles. Present finding of the loss of one of the three active origins on the chromosome VI may reduce the rate of replication of the chromosome specifically in meiotic cycle. If inverse relationships between transcription of genes and initiation of replication are general features of the replication origins of the eukaryotic cells, origins located within the transcription units should affect the S-phase progression, dependent on physiological conditions, that affects transcription of those particular genes. It is therefore interesting to determine replication origins that are located within the transcription units. In particular, transcriptions specific for the meiotic cell cycle should be examined carefully for the presence of ORC binding sites, ACS, as possible origins of replication that affect S-phase progression during meiotic cell growth. Chromosomes in the pre-blastula Xenopus embryonic cells initiate replication at many evenly spaced sites distributed at random throughout the chromosomes (31.Hyrien O. Maric C. Mechali M. Science. 1995; 270: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). And it was shown that reduction in number and specifications of origins are first observed at the time of the mid-blastula transition (32.Mahbubani H.M. Paull T. Elder J.K. Blow J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 33.Hyrien O. Mechali M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4511-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The mechanisms behind the origin specification remain poorly understood. However, it is well known that mid-blastula is accompanied by the increases in transcription of zygotic genes. Similar inverse correlation between origin activation and induction of transcription proposed in Fig. 4 may explain the origin specification during early development of Xenopus embryonic cells.

Schulze-Specking A. Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Bukau B. Nature. 1999; 400: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DnaK is essential under various stress conditions like heat, oxidative stress, and nutritional deprivation (6.Paek K.H. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 283-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Rockabrand D. Arthur T. Korinek G. Livers K. Blum P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3695-3703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Spence J. Cegielska A. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7157-7166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli cells lacking DnaK, heat shock treatment at 42 °C causes strong protein aggregation comprising 150–200 different protein species and ∼10% of the amount of pre-existing E. coli proteins (9.Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rudiger S. Roder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). During infection pathogens encounter stress conditions generated by the host defense mechanisms to eliminate the infection. They respond by the rapid acceleration in the rate of expression of heat shock and other stress proteins (10.Garbe T.R. Experientia. 1992; 48: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The DnaK/DnaJ chaperone machinery of Salmonella enterica has been shown to be involved in bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, and the DnaK/DnaJ-depleted mutant could not survive or proliferate at all within macrophages (11.Takaya A. Tomoyasu T. Matsui H. Yamamoto T. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1364-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the case of the pathogen Brucella suis it was shown that DnaK but not DnaJ is required for intracellular multiplication (12.Kohler S. Teyssier J. Cloeckaert A. Rouot B. Liautard J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 701-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). DnaK of Listeria monocytogenes is essentially required for survival under high temperatures and acidic conditions, and it is essential for the efficient phagocytosis of the facultative intracellular pathogen with macrophages (13.Hanawa T. Fukuda M. Kawakami H. Hirano H. Kamiya S. Yamamoto T. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 118-128PubMed Google Scholar). The DnaK homologues HscA and HscC seem to have more specialized functions in the cell; HscA appears to be involved in the assembly of Fe/S proteins (14.Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 15.Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Tapley T.L. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and HscC seems to play a role in the response to special types of stress (16.Kluck C.J. Patzelt H. Genevaux P. Brehmer D. Rist W. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. Mayer M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41060-41069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It has been already shown that proline-rich cationic oligopeptides such as pyrrhocoricin appear to kill responsive bacteria by binding to DnaK (17.Kragol G. Lovas S. Varadi G. Condie B.A. Hoffmann R. Otvos Jr., L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3016-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Dimeric analogues of pyrrhocoricin showed improved features with respect to broad applicability and stability in mammalian sera (18.Cudic M. Condie B.A. Weiner D.J. Lysenko E.S. Xiang Z.Q. Insug O. Bulet P. Otvos Jr., L. Peptides. 2002; 23: 2071-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between the formation of the DnaK/pyrrhocoricin and the antibacterial action remained unexplained. From gene deletion studies, the potential of small molecule inhibitors of the APIase activity of DnaK to act as antimicrobial agents can be inferred. However, no small molecule inhibitors or even non-peptidic binders for the APIase site of DnaK have been reported so far. The existence of a distinct APIase site in DnaK serving the catalysis of the cis/trans isomerization of secondary amide peptide bonds opened up the new possibility of assaying compounds for inhibiting this essential DnaK function. Here we report that the fatty acylated benzamido derivatives such as Nα-[fatty-acyl-(4-aminoalkylbenzoyl)]-l-α-amino acids reversibly block the APIase site of DnaK, inhibit DnaK-mediated refolding of firefly luciferase, increase protein aggregation in the cell, and exhibit antibacterial activity against E. coli MC4100 strain. To examine structure-activity relationships, we modified the α-amino acid residue, the benzoic acid linker, as well as the fatty acid part of the compounds (see Fig. 1). Materials−Monoclonal anti-DnaK antibody was purchased from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada). Kool™ NC-45™ Universal RNA polymerase templates and E. coli RNA polymerase core enzyme were purchased from Epicenter (Madison, WI). E. coli MC4100 cells (araD139 Δ(argF-lac)205 flb-5301 pstF25 rpsL150 deoC1 relA1) were obtained from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). The E. coli MC4100 ΔdnaK52::cat sidB1 (ΔdnaK) cells were provided by B. Bukau (BB1553), pET11DnaK was provided by F. U. Hartl, and pPL900-GrpE and pPL871-DnaJ were provided by N. Dixon. DnaK was purified as described by Zylicz et al. (19.Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8820-8825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As an additional purification step DnaK has been treated with alkaline phosphatase and subsequently applied to a gel-filtration column as described by Theyssen et al. (20.Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). DnaJ and GrpE were purified according to already published procedures by Zylicz et al. (21.Zylicz M. Ang D. Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Synthesis−The fatty acylated benzamido derivatives were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis with the synthesizer Syro II (MultiSynTech GmbH, Witten, Germany) using 0.15 mmol of amino acid pre-loaded Wang resins (compounds 1–18) and 0.15 mmol of Rink amide resin for the peptide amide 19. All resins were obtained from NovaBiochem (Läufelfingen, Switzerland). Synthesis was done by Fmoc strategy with Fmoc amino acids as building blocks and PyBOP (NovaBiochem) and N-methylmorpholine as coupling reagents in dimethylformamide. Piperidine/N,N-dimethylformamide (20%) was the standard cleavage mixture used for Fmoc detachment. The resin was treated twice for 10 min. All couplings were performed using a 4-fold excess of Fmoc amino acid derivative, PyBOP, and N-methylmorpholine (eight equivalents) in N,N-dimethylformamide. For all amino acid derivatives a 1.5-h double coupling protocol was used. The activation reagent HATU (AB Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used instead of PyBOP for coupling of the fatty acids in fatty acylated benzamido derivatives 11 and 16. After detachment of the fatty acylated benzamido derivatives from the resin and site-chain deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid/water (95:5) at room temperature for 12 h, the fatty acylated benzamido derivatives were purified by reversed-phase-HPLC on a Gilson 306 equipment with a column SP 250/10 Nucleosil 100-7 C8 (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) using a water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid)/ acetonitrile gradient. The purified fatty acylated benzamido derivatives were than lyophilized. Conditions for analytical HPLC were: column LiChro-CART® (LiChrospher® 100, RP8, 5 μm) 125 × 4 mm (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using a water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid)/acetonitrile gradient 5–100% in 30 min; flow rate 1 ml/min; detection at 220 nm. The identity of the fatty acylated benzamido derivatives were verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a VG-BIO-Q Triple Quadrupole Tandem Electrospray mass spectrometer (Fisons Instruments, San Carlos, CA). All 1H NMR spectra were obtained at 500.13 MHz on a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer (Bruker Biospin Fällanden, Switzerland). The measurements were carried out in CD3OD. Two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy and two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra were recorded at 25 °C. Identification of Compound 1 in E. coli Cytosol−E. coli MC4100 cells were incubated with 100 μg/ml 1 for 12 h at 42 °C in Mueller-Hinton broth. The cells were washed extensively with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) ethanol until no compound 1 could be detected in the buffer after washing. Cells were lysed by sonication. After centrifugation (4300 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C) cell lysate was subjected to analytical HPLC (column LiChroCART® (LiChrospher® 100, RP8, 5 μm) 125 × 4 mm (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using a water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid)/acetonitrile gradient 5–100% in 30 min; flow rate 1 ml/min; detection at 220 nm). The identity of compound 1 was verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Pure compound 1 was used as the reference. As a control, E. coli MC4100 cells without treatment with compound 1 were subjected to the described procedure. Luciferase Refolding Assay−Refolding experiments were done essentially as described by Szabo et al. (22.Szabo A. Langer T. Schroder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Briefly, luciferase from Photinus pyralis (Promega) was incubated for 1 h in denaturation buffer (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 6.0 m guanidinium chloride) at 10 °C at a final concentration of 2.08 μm. Refolding was initiated by dilution of denatured luciferase into renaturation buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2,1 μm bovine serum albumin, 436 nm DnaK, 160 nm DnaJ, and 436 nm GrpE) to a final concentration of 10.4 nm at 10 °C and 30 °C. Before the refolding reaction was started, compounds 1–18 at different concentrations were incubated in renaturing buffer for 10 min. After 1 h of refolding, luciferase activity was determined with a luminometer (Luminoskan, Ascent) using luciferase assay buffer (20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3.3 mm dithiothreitol, 270 μm coenzyme A, 500 μm d-luciferin, 500 μm ATP). The IC50 values have been calculated for a one site competition model with SPSS Sigmaplot 8.0. Enzymatic Measurements−The APIase activity of DnaK was determined using RNaseT1 P39A variant as substrate as described in Schiene-Fischer et al. at 15 and 30 °C (1.Schiene-Fischer C. Habazettl J. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Steadystate ATPase measurements were performed as described in Montgomery et al. (23.Montgomery D.L. Morimoto R.I. Gierasch L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 915-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Compound 1 at 150 μm has been incubated with 1 μm DnaK for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was started with 330 μm ATP. The time course was followed for at least 10 min. Determination of MIC Values−All compounds were dissolved in ethanol/10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, to 2 mg/ml (final ethanol concentration, 13% (v/v)). After incubation for 12 h at 37 °C insoluble particles were separated by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The final concentration was determined UV-spectrometrically by using the characteristic absorption at 236 nm. MICs were determined in triplicate in Mueller-Hinton medium by a liquid growth inhibition assay. In a sterile microtitration plate, 100 μl of the compound in varying concentrations, or 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 13% (v/v) ethanol as a control, were added to 50 μl of a mid-logarithmic growth phase culture of E. coli MC4100 cells. Plates were incubated for 24 h at 42 °C. Samples were spread on agar plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The number of colony forming units was counted, and the MIC value was determined as the concentration of substance that causes a 99.9% inhibition of cell growth (NCCLS criteria (24.Amsterdam D. Lorian V. Antibiotics in Laboratory Medicine. 4th Ed. Lippincott, Williams, & Wilkins, Baltimore1996: 52-111Google Scholar)). Erythrocyte Hemolysis−The hemolytic activity of fatty acylated benzamido derivatives was determined by spectrometric analysis as described before (25.Dathe M. Schumann M. Wieprecht T. Winkler A. Beyermann M. Krause E. Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Bienert M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12612-12622Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) using human erythrocytes. Freshly isolated human erythrocytes were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) prior to the assay. The erythrocytes (2.5 × 108 cells/ml) were treated with fatty acylated benzamido derivatives at final concentrations ranging from 3.1 to 50 μg/ml and incubated under gently shaking at 42 °C for 30 min. The samples were subjected to ice for 2 min and centrifuged at 380 × g for 5 min. The amount of hemoglobin released from the cells was determined by measuring the absorbance of the supernatants at 550 nm after 10-fold dilution with 0.5% NH4OH. Saponin (100 mg/liter) was used to obtain a positive control hemolysis value (100% hemolysis), and 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, was used as a negative control. Inhibitor concentrations causing 50% hemolysis (EC50) were derived from the dose-response curves with SPSS SigmaPlot 8.0. Heat Shock Experiments−E. coli MC4100 ΔdnaK pTrc99A-DnaK cells were grown to mid-exponential growth at 30 °C in Terrific Broth. Cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence of 0, 0.2, 0.5, or 1.0 mm IPTG. Cells were subjected to 57 °C for 210 s in the absence or additional presence of 1.35 mm compound 1 added immediately before heat shock. Immediately afterward heat shock cells were cooled on ice for 2 min. Serial dilutions were plated onto LB plates with selection marker supplemented with the indicated IPTG concentrations. The plates were incubated for 12 h at 30 °C. For analysis of DnaK produced by E. coli MC4100 ΔdnaK pTrc99A-DnaK, cells were lysed by sonification after 1-h induction in the presence of varying IPTG concentrations, and samples were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-DnaK antibody. Aggregation Assay−E. coli MC4100 wild type were grown to mid-exponential growth at 30 °C. 0.13 mg/ml or 0.066 mg/ml compound 1 or 2, respectively, was added, and the cells were cultured further for 15 min. Cells were subjected to heat shock at 45 °C for 30 min and subsequently grown at 30 °C for 3 h. E. coli MC4100 ΔdnaK cells in the absence of inhibitors was treated equally and thus used as a control for protein aggregation in the absence of DnaK. Aggregated proteins were isolated and separated from contaminating membrane proteins as described. Briefly, cells were harvested by 10-min centrifugation at 5000 × g and 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in buffer A (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 15% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mg/ml lysozyme) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Cell lysis was performed by adding a 7-fold excess of buffer B (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA), followed by sonification. After centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, an insoluble cell fraction was isolated by subsequent centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellets were frozen, resuspended in 400 μl of buffer B by sonification, and centrifuged (15,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The washed pellets were again resuspended in 320 μl of buffer B by sonification, subsequently 80 μl of 10% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 was added, and aggregated proteins were isolated by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). This washing procedure was repeated. Nonidet P-40-insoluble pellets were washed with buffer B and resuspended in 50 μl of buffer B by sonification (26.Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Langen H. Goloubinoff P. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Fractions corresponding to identical cell numbers were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Pull-down Assay of DnaK with Compound 19−MC4100 cells were grown overnight in LB medium at 42 °C. 200 μl of streptavidin beads was washed with buffer C (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2) and blocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 4 °C. MC4100 cells were lysed by sonification and incubated with 0.7 mm compound 19 for 1 h at room temperature in 1200 μl of buffer C. Streptavidin beads were added, and the mixture was further incubated for an additional hour at room temperature. Streptavidin beads were pelleted and washed twice with buffer C. DnaK was eluted from beads by adding compound 1 with a final concentration of 1.92 mm.5 μl of the different samples was analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-DnaK antibody. Controls showed 0.1 μlof E. coli lysate and 0.2 μg if recombinant DnaK. Characterization of the Interaction of DnaK with Nα-[Tetradecanoyl-(4-aminomethylbenzoyl)]-l-isoleucine−As exemplified by Nα-[tetradecanoyl-(4-aminomethylbenzoyl)]-l-isoleucine (1) compounds were synthesized by stepwise solid-phase synthesis using the Fmoc strategy on Wang resin preloaded with isoleucine. After deprotection myristic acid was coupled using PyBOP as reagent. Type 1 anionic compounds consisted of three building blocks, a fatty acid moiety, an aromatic linker, and an α-amino acid residue covering a free carboxylate group (Fig. 1A). Compound 1 inhibited the APIase activity of DnaK with an IC50 value of 2.7 μm as determined by DnaK-catalyzed RNase T1 P39A refolding assay (Fig. 2A) (1.Schiene-Fischer C. Habazettl J. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Similarly, it decreased the yield of native protein from the guanidinium chloride-denatured firefly luciferase in a DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE-assisted refolding assay in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 9.5 μm (Fig. 2B). According to the refolding pathway, inhibition of the APIase function of DnaK translates into reduction of final folding yield (27.Schiene-Fischer C. Habazettl J. Tradler T. Fischer G. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1865-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of DnaK remained unaffected up to a concentration of 150 μm of 1. To ascertain the specificity of the refolding assay for APIase function the effect of 2 was examined. Its inhibitory potency was low in both the RNase T1 P39A variant and the luciferase refolding assay. In both assays, compound 2 up to concentrations of 20 μm and 200 μm, respectively, had no effect. Reversibility of inhibition was examined by dialysis of the DnaK-1 complex formed by incubation of DnaK (0.56 μm) and 1 (10.5 μm). The refolding activity of DnaK completely recovered from the inhibited enzyme when dialyzed against 10 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, regardless of whether the incubation time was prolonged or the concentration of 1 was further increased. Next we analyzed if 1 binds to DnaK at the peptide binding site of DnaK, which constitutes a channel defined by loops from the beta sandwich structure of the C-terminal substrate-binding domain (28.Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Therefore, our competition assay correlated with the decrease in fluorescence at 460 nm in the presence of increasing amounts of 1 when administered to a solution of a DnaK-bound σ32-derived peptide (σ32-132QRKLFFNLRKTKQ142-C-IAANS) that was labeled with the fluorescent probe IAANS. This 14-mer oligopeptide represented a segment of the transcription factor σ32, which was shown to specifically bind to the peptide binding site of DnaK with a substantial increase in fluorescence emission upon DnaK binding (29.McCarty J.S. Rudiger S. Schonfeld H.J. Schneider-Mergener J. Nakahigashi K. Yura T. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The concentration-dependent decrease of fluorescence signal upon addition of compound 1 indicated the ability of 1 to displace the fluorescent labeled peptide from the DnaK-peptide complex by competitive binding to the same site of the protein (Fig. 3, A and B). Competition by 1 revealed an IC50 value of 29.1 μm, which translates into a Kd value of 2.6 μm for the DnaK-1 complex as was calculated according to the equation described by Craig (30.Craig D.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 89-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This value is close to the Ki-value directly measured using the APIase assay. Competition assays were repeated with the peptide NRLLLTG, controlling for method of σ32-Q132-Q144-C-IAANS displacement. Displacement of σ32-Q132-Q144-C-IAANS by NRLLLTG from DnaK resulted in an IC50 of 1.3 μm indicating a slightly higher affinity for DnaK of this peptide when compared with those of 1. To determine whether the enzymatically inactive DnaK-1 complex is still able to serve as a holding chaperone and thus can sequester unfolded proteins, the influence of 1 on the formation of DnaK complexes with reduced carboxymethylated lactalbumin (RCMLA) was investigated. Already under native conditions this protein variant is in its unfolded state (2.Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Again, the peptide NRLLLTG was utilized as a control, because it was already shown by x-ray crystallography to cover a considerable part of the peptide binding cleft of DnaK (32.Stevens S.Y. Cai S. Pellecchia M. Zuiderweg E.R. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2588-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After incubating DnaK with RCMLA in the absence or presence of different concentrations of 1 (Fig. 3C) or NRLLLTG (Fig. 3D) at 37 °C, DnaK-RCMLA complexes were separated from free DnaK and free RCMLA by native PAGE. The peptide NRLLLTG completely prevented DnaK-RCLMA complex formation at concentrations higher than 25 μm. However, up to a 500 μm concentration 1 was not able to inhibit the formation of this complex. Attempts were made to directly identify the cellular targets of fatty acylated benzamido derivatives in cell lysate. Cell lysates were prepared from E. coli MC4100 cells grown at 42 °C and were incubated with compound 19, a biotinylated derivative of 1 in which the Ile residue was replaced by a C-terminally biotinylated Glu residue. Complexes of 19 with cell proteins were extracted by streptavidin beads, washed extensively, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-DnaK antibody. Evidence for a DnaK-19 interaction in the cell was established by detection of DnaK in the eluate after washing the beads with a buffer solution containing 1.92 mm of 1 (Fig. 4). Because under heat shock conditions DnaK was described to have important functions in preventing or reversing thermally induced protein damage (3.Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2799) Google Scholar, 9.Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rudiger S. Roder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 33.Schroder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), we analyzed the influence of 1 on bacterial growth at 42 °C. Antibacterial activity was detected characterized by a MIC of 380 ± 50 μg/ml against E. coli MC4100 cells at 42 °C (Table 1). At 37 °C, bacterial growth was unaffected at concentrations up to 1.4 mg/ml. The analysis of the bactericidal effect of 1 at 30 °C revealed a MIC of 860 ± 100 μg/ml using E. coli MC4100 Δtig cells and a MIC ≫ 5 mg/ml toward wild-type E. coli MC4100 cells at 30 °C. Uptake studies of 1 by reversed-phase HPLC separation of the cytosol combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis verified its intracellular availability. The inability of E. coli cells to regrow on agar plates after application of compound 1 in concentrations above MIC for 12 h in LB medium at 42 °C shows that the inhibitor is bactericidal for E. coli. To exclude membrane effects of 1 on E. coli cell viability, membrane permeability in the presence of 200 μm 1 or 2 was assayed by measuring the activity of β-lactamase released to the medium in comparison to the total activity (supplemental Table S1). No significant difference in the amount of extracellular β-lactamase compared with the total β-lactamase activity was observed after growth of the cells in the presence of buffer or in the presence of compounds 1 or 2.TABLE 1Antibacterial and hemolytic activities of compound 1 and its analogues with substituted fatty acids in position 1CompoundFatty acidInhibition of assisted refolding IC50aCompound concentrations causing 50% (IC50) inhibition of assisted refolding of luciferase.Hemolytic activity EC50bCompound concentrations causing 50% (EC50) hemolysis determined with fresh human erythrocytes.MC4100 MICcMinimal inhibitor"

https://openalex.org/W2007095936,"The spin-polarized superfluid $^3$He A$_1$ phase, which forms below 3 mK in external magnetic field, serves as a material in which theoretical notions of fundamental magnetic processes and macroscopic quantum spin phenomena may be tested. Conventionally, the superfluid component of the A$_1$ phase is understood to contain only the majority spin condensate having energetically-favoured paired spins directed along the external field and no minority spin condensate having paired spins in the opposite direction. We have developed a novel mechanical spin density detector to measure the spin relaxation in the A$_1$ phase as functions of temperature, pressure and magnetic field. The mechanical spin detector is based in principle on the unique magnetic fountain effect occurring only in the A$_1$ phase (occurring between two transition temperatures, T$_{c1}$ and T$_{c2}$). Unexpectedly, the spin relaxation rate increases rapidly as the temperature is decreased towards T$_{c2}$. Our measurements, together with Leggett-Takagi and Monien-Tewordt theories, demonstrate that a minute presence of minority spin pairs is responsible for the unexpected spin relaxation phenomena in A$_1$ phase."
https://openalex.org/W2002329448,"The primate GnRH receptor (GnRHR) is a GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptor) that transduces both amplitude- and frequency-modulated signals; each modality conveys information that regulates primate reproduction. Slower GnRH pulses favor release (and higher circulating levels) of pituitary FSH, while faster pulses favor LH release. We used radioligand binding and inositol phosphate production (a measure of G-protein coupling) in association with mutational analysis to identify the impact of evolved sequence specializations that regulate receptor concentration at the plasma membrane and Kd in primate GnRHRs. Our results show that mutations appear to provide a mechanism that allows independent adjustment of response sensitivity and squelching (suppression) of low-level signals (noise), both desirable features for recognition of frequency-modulated signals. We identify specific amino acid residues that appear to be involved in these processes. This investigation occurred in light of recent observations that restriction of GnRHR plasma membrane expression developed under strong convergent pressure and concurrently with the complex pattern of cyclicity associated with primate reproduction. The findings present an evolved means for increased effectiveness of detection of a frequency-modulated signal and provide a strategy to identify similar mechanisms in other receptors."
