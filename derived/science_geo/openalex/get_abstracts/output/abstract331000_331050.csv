https://openalex.org/W2001382215,"Supramolecular chemistry is the study of the structures and functions of the supermolecules that result from binding substrates to molecular receptors. Macropolycyclic receptors and coreceptors have been designed that form cryptate inclusion complexes and display molecular recognition towards spherical, tetrahedral, and linear substrates of various kinds (metal cations, inorganic anions, and organic or biological cations or anions). Anion binding has led to the development of anion coordination chemistry. Metalloreceptors simultaneously bind organic molecules and metal ions; speleands combine polar and nonpolar binding subunits. Receptors bearing reactive functional groups may act as molecular reagents or catalysts, performing a chemical transformation on the bound substrates (by such reactions as hydrogen transfer, ester cleavage, and protoadenosinetriphosphatase and protokinase activities). Receptors fitted with lipophilic groups can operate as molecular carriers, translocating bound species through a membrane; this transport can be coupled to chemical potentials (proton and redox gradients)."
https://openalex.org/W2014392338,"The isotopic ratio of strontium-87 to strontium-86 shows no detectable variation in present-day ocean water but changes slowly over millions of years. The strontium contained in carbonate shells of marine organisms records the ratio of strontium-87 to strontium-86 of the oceans at the time that the shells form. Sedimentary rocks composed of accumulated fossil carbonate shells can be dated and correlated with the use of high precision measurements of the ratio of strontium-87 to strontium-86 with a resolution that is similar to that of other techniques used in age correlation. This method may prove valuable for many geological, paleontological, paleooceanographic, and geochemical problems."
https://openalex.org/W2007823215,"The design, synthesis, and study of electrically conductive molecular and polymeric substances constitute a new scientific endeavor involving the interaction of chemists, physicists, and materials scientists. The strategies, developments, and challenges in these two closely related fields are analyzed via a class of materials that bridges both: assemblies of electrically conductive metallomacrocycles. It is seen that efforts to rationally synthesize tailored, ""metal-like"" molecular arrays lead logically to structure-enforced polymeric assemblies of linked molecular subunits such as metallophthalocyanines. The properties of these assemblies and fragments thereof provide information on the relationship between atomic-level local architecture, electronic structure, and macroscopic transport properties. Electrically conductive, processable polymeric materials also follow from these results."
https://openalex.org/W2082704099,"During the last decade, advances in computational techniques and in the extraction of chemically useful concepts from electronic wave functions have put theorists into the mainstream of chemistry. Some recent examples of the prediction of spectroscopic quantities and the elucidation of catalytic processes for homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions from theoretical calculations are used to illustrate how theory and experiment are now full partners in chemical research. It is expected that during the next decade the thrust of theoretical chemistry will be to combine the knowledge of fundamental chemical steps and fundamental interactions with advances in chemical dynamics and irreversible statistical mechanics and in computer technology to produce simulations of chemical systems with competing reactions taking place simultaneously at various reaction sites. The promise of such simulation is illustrated by a study of the enzyme thermolysin."
https://openalex.org/W1971453231,"During the last 20 years, surface scientists have developed a variety of techniques that make it possible to study, on the molecular level, the structure, composition, and chemical bonding in the surface monolayer. Both single-crystal model catalysts and real catalyst systems that are active in important chemical processes have been investigated by a combination of ultrahigh-vacuum surface science techniques and high-pressure kinetic techniques in an effort to determine the relation between the structure and composition of the surface and the rates of reaction and selectivities. The structure of the atomic surface, a strongly adsorbed overlayer, and the oxidation states of surface atoms are the important molecular features of an active catalyst. As a consequence of modern surface science, the design and preparation of catalysts has developed from an art into a high technology."
https://openalex.org/W2029179301,"Studies of chemisorption phenomena, the cornerstone of heterogeneous catalysis, have become the central part of contemporary surface science. As a result of the great variety of the available experimental techniques, a backlog of information, some of which conflicts with current theoretical constructs, has accumulated. New models that combine analytical and computational facets have now begun to appear, revealing intrinsic relations among seemingly disparate chemisorption phenomena. Among the major findings are (i) the crucial role of antibonding adsorbate orbitals in bond activation and in the heat of chemisorption, (ii) adsorbate-induced surface polarization leading to a decrease of the metal work function and to an increase of the surface core binding energy, and (iii) important differences between atomic and molecular adsorbate modes of bonding and surface migration."
https://openalex.org/W2171019133,"Six species of lizards in the genus Cnemidophorus, Teiidae, have been found to be all-female or virtually all-female. The species are C. costatus exsanguis Lowe, C. deppei cozumelus Gadow, C. inornatus Baird (western population), C. perplexus Baird and Girard, C. tessellatus (Say), and C. velox Springer. It is hypothesized that the explanation of these virtually all-female populations is genetic."
https://openalex.org/W1987988809,"It is now possible to resolve completely the initial and final quantum states in chemical processes. Spectra of reactive intermediates, of highly vibrationally excited molecules, and even of molecules in the process of falling apart have been recorded. This information has led to greater understanding of the molecular structure and dynamics of small gas-phase molecules. Many of the concepts and spectroscopic techniques that have been developed will be valuable throughout chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1988387115,"Lasers are used in increasingly sophisticated ways to carry out reactions between molecules in selected vibrational, rotational, and electronic states and to probe the product states of chemical reactions. Such investigations are providing unprecedented insights into chemical reaction dynamics, the study of the detailed motions that molecules undergo in simple chemical reactions. In many cases it is possible to describe the influence that specific types of molecular excitation have on reactive events. Experiments are also being carried out to leam about chemical reactivity as a function of the alignment of reagents. There is increasing excitement concerning the potential of laser methods to interrogate the transition states of molecular reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2146538856,"Certain characteristics of supernovae, inferred from observations and theories, are interpreted as suggesting that the young remnants of a supernovae eruption constitute a powerful source of cosmic rays. These features include an enormous energy release, a copious supply of relativistic electrons, large-scale magnetic fields, extended masses of plasma moving at high velocities, indications of the propagation of hydromagnetic waves, and relatively high concentrations of heavier elements. Recent evidence is reviewed which was obtained by the analysis of the continuous spectrum of electromagnetic radiations from the Crab Nebula, optical and nonthermal radio emissions, and photoelectric and photographic techniques employing polaroid filters. Notation, constants, and conversion factors used in the calculations are included. (Seventy-three references.) (C.H.)"
https://openalex.org/W1999671199,"Progress has been made in the understanding of potential energy surfaces for unimolecular ion dissociations and ion-molecule reactions. With recent advances in instrumentation, many new techniques have been developed to generate and study ions, ion-molecule complexes, and large ionic clusters. Developments in ion spectroscopy have enabled considerable advances to be made in the determination of ion structures."

https://openalex.org/W2094399697,A study of some of the factors affecting the extractability of methyl stearate from aqueous methanol has provided evidence for the existence of a disperse phase from which the ester is released at a very slow rate. It is suggested that this phenomenon may be relevant to some problems of binding and activation of substrates in biological systems.
